"Social Inequalities in Depression Across the Lifecourse   DESCRIPTION: This application addresses two major current themes in the              epidemiology and prevention of adult mental disorders: a) social and economic        disparities in health status: and b) early origins of adult health status.           Where most of the current work in these areas has focused on physical health         conditions (e.g., cardiovascular illness. diabetes) there is mounting evidence       of the relevance of these lines of inquiry to psychiatric disorders.                 Furthermore, while socioeconomic disparities in depression in adulthood have         been documented consistently, the mechanisms generating these disparities have       yet to be fully elucidated. Accordingly, we seek to conduct new data analyses        examining socioeconomic disparities in major depressive disorder in relation to      adult and childhood socioeconomic status, and to examine the role of other           childhood environmental factors in the development of depression. These              investigations will be based on the Providence follow-up National Collaborative      Perinatal Project, a thirty-year, longitudinal study of 1,263 individuals who        were enrolled at birth and systematically followed for an average of 27.8            years. Comprehensive prospective assessment of childhood environmental               conditions have been obtained at multiple points in time and adult psychiatric       diagnoses obtained using structured diagnostic interviews. We will employ a          range of analytic strategies including discrete-time survival analyses.                                                                                                   The specific aims of this study are to examine the effects of childhood              socioeconomic status on the occurrence and severity of major depressive              disorder in adulthood. Furthermore, we will assess the direct role of childhood      environmental factors in the occurrence of depression as well as their               potential to mediate the association between early-life socioeconomic                conditions and subsequent depression. Finally, we will study the risk that           substance abuse disorders pose on the incidence of depression and examine            whether this risk is modified by childhood conditions. The prospective nature        of this study, the comprehensive assessment of parental and childhood                variables, and the rigorous measurement of psychiatric disorders in adulthood        make this sample uniquely suited to addressing these aims.

"Disparities in Depression Incidence and Treatment  DESCRIPTION:  An inverse relationship between income and depression incidence        has long been observed in specific contexts.  This research proposes to              explore racial, gender, and income-related disparities in both the incidence         and in the treatment of depression in the U.S. population.                                                                                                                The first goal of this research is to establish an inverse income/depression         relationship in a nationally representative sample.  At the same time, the           research will address the question of how this link is mediated by race,             gender and income.  The question will be answered using highly flexible,             non-parametric methods.                                                                                                                                                   Second, the research will answer the question of how the diagnosis and               treatment of depression vary with underlying symptoms and with socio-economic        status.  The research will test the hypothesis that among U.S. adults with           similar access to care, the diagnosis and treatment of depression varies with        race, gender and income, even controlling for underlying symptom level.  The         analysis will use two rich, national, longitudinal data sets, and will employ        two-stage, instrumental-variable statistical methods to control for reverse          causality between symptom levels and treatment.  The results of this research        will be of major interest to health services researchers, to mental health           providers and to policy-makers.

"Biobehavioral Mechanisms of Depression in Women    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This Mentored Research Scientist                Development Award (MRSDA) is designed to promote the Candidate's long-term goal      of becoming a women's health researcher with expertise in the etiology and           treatment of depression in women. The training and research activities               described in this MRSDA will facilitate the Candidate's training in the methods      of acute stress research and neurohormonal assessment techniques, and the            integration of these techniques within her own background in depression              intervention research. This interdisciplinary training will provide the              Candidate with the skills and experience needed to pursue an independent             program of research testing biobehavioral mechanisms of stress sensitivity,          depression vulnerability, and ultimately, depression treatment outcomes in           women. Post-pubertal females are twice as likely as males to experience a            lifetime episode of major depression, and are particularly likely to become          depressed when faced with stressful life events. This gender-linked health           disparity persists throughout women's reproductive lives, carrying deleterious       consequences for both the woman herself and the children under her care. We          (Cyranowski et al., 2000) have theorized that women's sensitivity to                 interpersonal life stress is mediated, in part, by the hypothalamic                  neurohormone, oxytocin. Oxytocin is known to play a key role in female               reproductive processes. A growing body of animal research indicates that             oxytocin is critically regulated by female reproductive hormones, and that           oxytocin serves to facilitate female affiliative behaviors and down-regulate         the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) stress axis. The proposed pilot study       was designed to provide a preliminary examination of the role of oxytocin in         women's stress sensitivity and depression vulnerability. Twenty-two normal           cycling, depressed females aged 21-40 and 22 age-matched never-depressed             controls will be recruited to participate in a 3-hour laboratory experiment          designed to stimulate, measure and compare peripheral oxytocin release and           basal oxytocin concentrations within and between groups, and to examine whether      peripheral oxytocin release is associated with a down-regulation of the HPA          stress axis following an acute stress task. Subjects will also complete              self-report measures of depression, anxiety, interpersonal function, trauma          history, and recent life stress. Subjects will then be retested with the             laboratory paradigm at 18 weeks follow-up, or for depressed subjects, following      a course of interpersonal psychotherapy (IPT). The skills, training, and pilot       data obtained from this MRSDA will subsequently be used to support the               Candidate's development of an R0l application in Years 03-05 of the award            period.

"Community Socioeconomic Context, Depression and Anxiety   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Socioeconomic position is a key                 determinant of individual mental health, including depression and anxiety            disorders. Depression and anxiety disorders inflict major social and economic        burden on families and communities. Recent studies suggest that the community        socioeconomic context, in particular its degree of income inequality,                contribute to a person's morbidity and mortality, even after individual              socioeconomic position has been taken into account; a disturbing finding as          income inequality has grown in the US during the last three decades.                                                                                                      The proposed analyses will expand this research program on socioeconomic             context to include psychiatric disorders. We will examine the relationship           between socioeconomic residential context and the prevalence of major                depression and anxiety disorders in Baltimore neighborhoods using the                Epidemiologic Catchment Area- Follow Up survey sample, and in US counties,           using the National Comorbidity Survey sample. In addition to income inequality,      we will examine the relationship between alternative contextual socioeconomic        indicators at the county and neighborhood levels (i.e., absolute income,             poverty and social capital) and major depression and anxiety disorders. This         will be the first population-based analysis to examine the association between       residential socioeconomic context in relation to the prevalence of depression        and anxiety disorders in the US. Our analysis will also make important               methodological contributions to the field of psychiatric epidemiology.               Socioeconomic context will be measured at the individual, neighborhood (FCA-F)       and county (NCS) levels, and we will apply innovative statistical methods that       are appropriate for the simultaneous analysis of two levels of data and              interactions between contextual and individual-level variables. Testing              hypothetical mechanisms that may relate contextual and individual socioeconomic      attributes (e.g., age, gender, race/ethnicity, socioeconomic position) will be       an area of concentration of this analysis, as it has been overlooked in most         multilevel studies to date. The results of these analyses will have                  implications for local health policy in urban neighborhoods and counties across      the US that have the potential to reduce the social costs associated with            depression and anxiety disorders.

"GENDER AND DEPRESSION; TREATMENT, QI, AND OUTCOMES Little is known about the clinical aspects of depression care received by females, relative to males, in primary care settings.  In particular, few studies have addressed whether depressed men and women respond similarly to treatment for depression within usual care primary care settings.  Recently, a number of studies have examined the efficacy and cost- effectiveness of models designed to improve depression treatment for primary care patients by increasing the number of patients who receive guideline-concordant care.  Yet, we do not know whether these quality improvement (QI) efforts have been equally effective for men and women.  It is important for policy makers to know whether existing QI programs successfully reduce gender disparities or inadvertently create new disparities.  The proposed study will contribute to research knowledge of these issues using a unique, common data base from four quality improvement studies for depression, called QID.  This data base includes 1498 primary care patients with major depression plus an additional 500 depressed patients who did not meet QID exclusion criteria from Partners in Care (PIC), an AHRQ-funded PORT II for depression.  The proposed study will 1) determine if there are differences in quality of care received, compliance and health outcomes for depressed men and women in usual care; 2) determine whether QI programs for depression reduce existing disparities in quality of care and outcomes for men and women; 3) determine (for PIC only) whether costs and cost-effectiveness of QI programs differ for men and women; and 4) determine whether the effect of appropriate treatment on outcomes differ for men and women. Multiple factors that explain possible gender differences will be explored.  Estimates of treatment effectiveness under QID's more naturalistic conditions are the type of data needed to inform policy debates over mental health care coverage.

"Patient Centered Depression Care for African-Americans DESCRIPTION:  (Provided by the Applicant) Several studies document underutilization of outpatient specialty mental health services by African Americans. However, African Americans with depression are just as likely as whites to receive care in primary care settings. Despite their use of primary care services, African American patients are less likely than whites to be recognized as depressed, offered pharmacotherapy, and to initiate or complete pharmacotherapy or psychotherapy for depression. Compared to whites, African American patients express stronger preferences for counseling and more negative attitudes toward antidepressant medication, the most common form of treatment of depression used by primary care physicians. African Americans are also more likely to see depression and its treatment through a spiritual framework. Studies show that African Americans receive less optimal technical and interpersonal health care than whites for many conditions, including depression. Depression is a common chronic condition that results in substantial morbidity, functional disability, and resource use. Despite the proven efficacy of pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy for treatment of depression, many depressed primary care patients of all races and ethnicities still do not receive adequate treatment. Recent quality improvement trials for depression in primary care have shown improvements in outcomes; however, there is room for improvement, particularly for ethnic minority patients. Interventions focusing on patient-centeredness have documented benefits on patient adherence, patient satisfaction, and health outcomes. Yet, only a few recent quality improvement strategies for depression include patient-centered accommodations. We have created a patient-centered adaptation that includes many of the components of recent successful quality improvement interventions for depression in primary care. The proposed study compares a standard depression intervention for patients (delivered by a depression case manager) and physicians (review of guidelines and structured mental health consultation) to a patient-centered intervention for patients (incorporates patient activation, individual preferences, and cultural sensitivity) and physicians (incorporates participatory communication skills training with individualized feedback on interactive CD-ROM). Thirty physicians and 250 patients will be randomized to either the standard interventions or the culturally tailored interventions. The main hypothesis is that patients in the patient-centered, culturally tailored intervention group will have higher remission rates from depression and lower levels of depressive symptoms at 12 months than patients in the standard intervention care group. Secondary outcomes will include patient receipt of guideline concordant care, patient and physician satisfaction with care, patient-physician communication behaviors, patient and physician attitudes toward depression, and self-efficacy in managing depression. This study will add to knowledge about how to effectively engage African American patients in care of depression and serve as a prototype of how to incorporate patient-centeredness in programs to reduce racial and ethnic disparities in health care for common conditions.

"Community Socioeconomic Context, Depression and Anxiety   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Socioeconomic position is a key                 determinant of individual mental health, including depression and anxiety            disorders. Depression and anxiety disorders inflict major social and economic        burden on families and communities. Recent studies suggest that the community        socioeconomic context, in particular its degree of income inequality,                contribute to a person's morbidity and mortality, even after individual              socioeconomic position has been taken into account; a disturbing finding as          income inequality has grown in the US during the last three decades.                                                                                                      The proposed analyses will expand this research program on socioeconomic             context to include psychiatric disorders. We will examine the relationship           between socioeconomic residential context and the prevalence of major                depression and anxiety disorders in Baltimore neighborhoods using the                Epidemiologic Catchment Area- Follow Up survey sample, and in US counties,           using the National Comorbidity Survey sample. In addition to income inequality,      we will examine the relationship between alternative contextual socioeconomic        indicators at the county and neighborhood levels (i.e., absolute income,             poverty and social capital) and major depression and anxiety disorders. This         will be the first population-based analysis to examine the association between       residential socioeconomic context in relation to the prevalence of depression        and anxiety disorders in the US. Our analysis will also make important               methodological contributions to the field of psychiatric epidemiology.               Socioeconomic context will be measured at the individual, neighborhood (FCA-F)       and county (NCS) levels, and we will apply innovative statistical methods that       are appropriate for the simultaneous analysis of two levels of data and              interactions between contextual and individual-level variables. Testing              hypothetical mechanisms that may relate contextual and individual socioeconomic      attributes (e.g., age, gender, race/ethnicity, socioeconomic position) will be       an area of concentration of this analysis, as it has been overlooked in most         multilevel studies to date. The results of these analyses will have                  implications for local health policy in urban neighborhoods and counties across      the US that have the potential to reduce the social costs associated with            depression and anxiety disorders.

"Depression-Diabetes Mechanisms: Urban African Americans DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  African-Americans have increased prevalence of both diabetes and diabetes complications, reflecting combined psychobehavioral and metabolic dysfunction. Depression may contribute to both the genesis of Type 2 diabetes, and difficulties in management; we find that many African-Americans with diabetes also have depression, that depression is a factor in nonadherence, and that nonadherence leads to poor glycemic control- a major cause of complications. (1) To establish the prevalence, socioecoloqic associates, and. qlycemic impact of depression, we will study patients presenting to the Grady Diabetes Clinic; evaluate socioeconomic status, literacy, and access to care; and relate depression to these factors and to metabolic control both at presentation and after one year of care. (2) To define the pathways through which depression contributes to metabolic imbalance, we will study patients exposed to progressive psychobehavioral challenge (depression and/or early life stress), and assess (a) hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal activation; (b) counter-regulatory hormones; and (c) immunoinflammatory cytokines; in relation to (d) insulin resistance. (3) To determine the psychobehavioral and neurohormonal mechanisms of treatment, we will conduct a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial: patients with depression will receive stress management videotapes and either placebo or the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) citalopram, and we will assess (a) overall glycemic control (HbAlc levels), and (b) patient adherence -to a prescribed diet/exercise program, to use of medications, and to scheduled return appointments; in relation to (c) depressive symptoms and (d) neurometabolic function as defined in Aim #2. These questions will be addressed by a multidisciplinary team with experience in both neuroendocrine analysis, clinical psychiatry, and diabetes management. The goal of this proposal is to use state-of-the-art psychobiological techniques to define the neurobehavioral and neurometabolic abnormalities and their response to treatment in urban African-Americans with type 2 diabetes and depression, as needed to improve basic understanding of disordered metabolism in this patient population and to help relieve their disparity in health.

"Biobehavioral Mechanisms of Depression in Women    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This Mentored Research Scientist                Development Award (MRSDA) is designed to promote the Candidate's long-term goal      of becoming a women's health researcher with expertise in the etiology and           treatment of depression in women. The training and research activities               described in this MRSDA will facilitate the Candidate's training in the methods      of acute stress research and neurohormonal assessment techniques, and the            integration of these techniques within her own background in depression              intervention research. This interdisciplinary training will provide the              Candidate with the skills and experience needed to pursue an independent             program of research testing biobehavioral mechanisms of stress sensitivity,          depression vulnerability, and ultimately, depression treatment outcomes in           women. Post-pubertal females are twice as likely as males to experience a            lifetime episode of major depression, and are particularly likely to become          depressed when faced with stressful life events. This gender-linked health           disparity persists throughout women's reproductive lives, carrying deleterious       consequences for both the woman herself and the children under her care. We          (Cyranowski et al., 2000) have theorized that women's sensitivity to                 interpersonal life stress is mediated, in part, by the hypothalamic                  neurohormone, oxytocin. Oxytocin is known to play a key role in female               reproductive processes. A growing body of animal research indicates that             oxytocin is critically regulated by female reproductive hormones, and that           oxytocin serves to facilitate female affiliative behaviors and down-regulate         the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) stress axis. The proposed pilot study       was designed to provide a preliminary examination of the role of oxytocin in         women's stress sensitivity and depression vulnerability. Twenty-two normal           cycling, depressed females aged 21-40 and 22 age-matched never-depressed             controls will be recruited to participate in a 3-hour laboratory experiment          designed to stimulate, measure and compare peripheral oxytocin release and           basal oxytocin concentrations within and between groups, and to examine whether      peripheral oxytocin release is associated with a down-regulation of the HPA          stress axis following an acute stress task. Subjects will also complete              self-report measures of depression, anxiety, interpersonal function, trauma          history, and recent life stress. Subjects will then be retested with the             laboratory paradigm at 18 weeks follow-up, or for depressed subjects, following      a course of interpersonal psychotherapy (IPT).

"Patient-Centered Depression Care in the Public Sector DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  For depression care to be sustainable in public sector primary care settings, it must accommodate patient preferences and the priorities and capacities of providers and administrators. This application aims to directly address the need for information on how to assess and incorporate the preferences of patients, providers, and administrators into the design of a depression intervention. In 3 large public sector primary care centers serving mostly low-income Latinos, we assess the depression care preferences and resources of patients, providers, and administrators. To do so, we use mixed qualitative and quantitative methods and a novel application of conjoint analysis, a marketing research method. Next, we randomize 100 patients at each clinic (300 patients total) to a standardized depression intervention vs. wait list control, not for the traditional purpose of studying intervention effects on patient outcomes, but rather for providing patients, clinicians, and administrators with a treatment exposure. We then examine whether stated preferences before the intervention correspond to the actual behaviors of patients, providers, and administrators when provided with an opportunity for care, and whether exposure to depression treatment or improved outcomes change stated preferences for care. Finally, we conduct a multi-stakeholder negotiation process to prioritize consumer oriented- preferences for care given resource constraints. At study end, we will have gained information regarding the preferences of multiple stakeholders in public sector care and on how public primary care systems can weigh not only the often harsh realities of public sector practice constraints, but also the needs and priorities of informed consumers, in efforts to improve care.

"Neighborhood Risk Factors for Maternal Depression    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This training proposal is designed to enable me to undertake independent applied research focusing on maternal depression, specifically environmental risk factors and their mediators. It will provide a specific set of skills and knowledge of mental health issues and enable me to build on research that has demonstrated that poor and minority women have almost twice the rates of maternal depression compared to their middleclass counterparts. The effect of the social context on maternal depression, and postpartum depression in particular, has not been thoroughly studied in disadvantaged women. This is significant because many risk factors for depression are not wholly endogenous but arise out of the dynamic interaction between the individual and the social and physical environment. Furthermore, approaches to prevention of maternal depression, and postpartum depression specifically, differ based on whether the focus is the individual or the environment. The career development plan proposed herein consists of didactic training and mentored research projects. In the research projects, the main question concerns the role of the social environment, represented by neighborhood characteristics. Researching social environmental factors brings the complex interplay between race/ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and area of residence into focus. In recognition of these complexities, we will recruit non-Hispanic African American mothers in order to identify variation in neighborhood factors in a group of women generally considered at high risk. Study I is a qualitative study of mothers sampled based on a neighborhood (census block group) sampling frame. The objective of this study is to assess mothers' perceptions about the influence of neighborhood stressors on their mood states using qualitative analytic methods (specifically, focus groups and structured interviews). Study 2 is a cross-sectional study of mothers also from low- and mid-level SES neighborhoods. The objective of this study is to determine if neighborhood characteristics are associated with the presence of depressive symptoms, while adjusting for important individual characteristics with the use of structural equation modeling.

"Psychosocial & Nutritional Associations with Depression Relative to Non-Hispanic whites, Puerto Rican elders living in the US mainland are at particularly higher risk for several conditions, among them depression. Differences between these two groups in the prevalence of depression persist despite controlling for socio-demographic variables, which suggests the contribution of socio-cultural and/or biological factors in the existing health disparity among Puerto Rican elders. Research with B vitamins suggests that folate, cobalamin and pyridoxine status correlate with depressive symptomatology. Puerto Rican elders have been identified as having lower plasma and dietary status of these vitamins compared to Non-Hispanic white elders. This population faces more stressors than other groups, which is thought to contribute to health disparities. Social support has also been shown to mediate stressors that lead to disease outcomes. The specific aims of this research are to 1) examine the associations of folate, cobalamin, and pyridoxine on depressive symptomatology using dietary intake and plasma vitamin measures 2) Assess cross-sectional and two year relationships of stress on nutritional status and depressive symptomatology and 3) Assess how social support mediates the above associations.

"Patient Centered Depression Care for African-Americans DESCRIPTION:  (Provided by the Applicant) Several studies document underutilization of outpatient specialty mental health services by African Americans. However, African Americans with depression are just as likely as whites to receive care in primary care settings. Despite their use of primary care services, African American patients are less likely than whites to be recognized as depressed, offered pharmacotherapy, and to initiate or complete pharmacotherapy or psychotherapy for depression. Compared to whites, African American patients express stronger preferences for counseling and more negative attitudes toward antidepressant medication, the most common form of treatment of depression used by primary care physicians. African Americans are also more likely to see depression and its treatment through a spiritual framework. Studies show that African Americans receive less optimal technical and interpersonal health care than whites for many conditions, including depression. Depression is a common chronic condition that results in substantial morbidity, functional disability, and resource use. Despite the proven efficacy of pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy for treatment of depression, many depressed primary care patients of all races and ethnicities still do not receive adequate treatment. Recent quality improvement trials for depression in primary care have shown improvements in outcomes; however, there is room for improvement, particularly for ethnic minority patients. Interventions focusing on patient-centeredness have documented benefits on patient adherence, patient satisfaction, and health outcomes. Yet, only a few recent quality improvement strategies for depression include patient-centered accommodations. We have created a patient-centered adaptation that includes many of the components of recent successful quality improvement interventions for depression in primary care. The proposed study compares a standard depression intervention for patients (delivered by a depression case manager) and physicians (review of guidelines and structured mental health consultation) to a patient-centered intervention for patients (incorporates patient activation, individual preferences, and cultural sensitivity) and physicians (incorporates participatory communication skills training with individualized feedback on interactive CD-ROM).

"Functional Limitation, Arthritis, Depression, & Race    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This study addresses the programmatic area from PA02-043 Social and Cultural Dimensions of Health related to consequences of poor health. This study evaluates the influence of major depression in conjunction with sociodemographic, health, and economic factors on arthritis-related functional limitations to identify risk factors amenable to public health/public policy prevention or intervention strategies. Over 35 million Americans have one or more conditions resulting in a limitation of life activities with an associated economic cost exceeding $170 billion. Depression and arthritis are the two leading causes of functional limitations in the United States. Arthritis-related functional limitations are a particular concern due to disproportionately high burdens among ethnic minority groups. This study addresses major public health and public policy questions related to functional limitation and major depression in adults with arthritis as they near retirement age. It uses nationally representative longitudinal 1996-2000 data from the Health and Retirement Survey (HRS) to estimate rates of functional limitation and 12-month major depression among persons with arthritis. It also estimates the impact of major depression on subsequent functional impairment and use of medical services. It further estimates racial/ethnic differences in functional impairment and major depression and examines whether differences in depression rates, other health needs, and/or health care access partly explain racial/ethnic disparities in functional limitation onset and subsequent use of health care services. The investigators provide a spectrum of health services research, statistical, medical rehabilitation, clinical, mental health, public health, and economic expertise needed to complete this methodologically sophisticated study using national data. The project extends their preliminary work based on the 1996 HRS data, which shows racial/ethnic differences in depressive disorders and functional limitations among persons with arthritis. This study addresses goals from Healthy People 2010, National Center for Medical Rehabilitation Research, and the National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin diseases strategic plan. Hypotheses tested by this study will provide information that would motivate clinical and public health strategies to improve health care and reduce functional impairment among people with arthritis.         ","Functional Limitation, Arthritis, Depression, & Race",6704654,R01HD045412,"['health care service utilization ', ' statistics /biometry ', ' human population study ', ' epidemiology ', ' longitudinal human study ', ' major depression ', ' arthritis ', ' African American ', ' Hispanic American ', ' racial /ethnic difference ', ' functional ability ', ' human data ', ' clinical research ', ' health disparity ', ' ']",NICHD,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,R01,2004,133585,0.1294282136217189
"PATHWAYS TO OVERCOMING DISPARITIES IN DEPRESSION    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This is a competing continuation for an NIMH R01 (Pathways to Outcomes of Care in Depression), which funded five-year follow-up of participants in Partners in Care, a group-level randomized trial of quality improvement interventions versus usual care for depression.  Our continuation proposes a new follow-up study in response to key findings from the existing grant:  1) Quality improvement interventions for depression had stronger effects on improving outcomes among minorities than whites during the active intervention period, despite similar effects on quality of care across ethnic groups; 2) by five-year follow-up, ethnic-related health outcome disparities apparent among controls were eliminated among intervention subjects.  We propose a 3-stage study of quality improvement (QI) effects on health outcome disparities:  1) Stage 1:  7-year follow-up of the full PIC sample (N=1182) to examine how initial QI affected intermediate outcomes such as concerns about stigma of depression; occurrence of life events; use of social supports; having a regular provider; use of appropriate treatments.  2) Stage 2: a qualitative study of the minority subjects, using a series of telephone interviews, to examine how subjects respond to depressive symptoms, stressful life events, and healthcare visits, in real time.  3) Stage 3: an ethnographically-based further follow-up of Latinos in Los Angeles, stratified by gender, intervention status and 7-year outcome, to learn more about how depressed patients are managing their lives within the context of their own environment.  Data from Stage 1 will be used to test hypotheses about QI effects on intermediate outcomes and differences in such effects for minorities and whites; data from Stages 2 and 3 will be used to confirm or refute findings from Stage 1, provide richer detail on pathways to outcome improvement, and generate hypotheses about mechanisms for outcome improvement among minorities.

"Depression-Diabetes Mechanisms: Urban African Americans DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  African-Americans have increased prevalence of both diabetes and diabetes complications, reflecting combined psychobehavioral and metabolic dysfunction. Depression may contribute to both the genesis of Type 2 diabetes, and difficulties in management; we find that many African-Americans with diabetes also have depression, that depression is a factor in nonadherence, and that nonadherence leads to poor glycemic control- a major cause of complications. (1) To establish the prevalence, socioecoloqic associates, and. qlycemic impact of depression, we will study patients presenting to the Grady Diabetes Clinic; evaluate socioeconomic status, literacy, and access to care; and relate depression to these factors and to metabolic control both at presentation and after one year of care. (2) To define the pathways through which depression contributes to metabolic imbalance, we will study patients exposed to progressive psychobehavioral challenge (depression and/or early life stress), and assess (a) hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal activation; (b) counter-regulatory hormones; and (c) immunoinflammatory cytokines; in relation to (d) insulin resistance. (3) To determine the psychobehavioral and neurohormonal mechanisms of treatment, we will conduct a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial: patients with depression will receive stress management videotapes and either placebo or the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) citalopram, and we will assess (a) overall glycemic control (HbAlc levels), and (b) patient adherence -to a prescribed diet/exercise program, to use of medications, and to scheduled return appointments; in relation to (c) depressive symptoms and (d) neurometabolic function as defined in Aim #2. These questions will be addressed by a multidisciplinary team with experience in both neuroendocrine analysis, clinical psychiatry, and diabetes management. The goal of this proposal is to use state-of-the-art psychobiological techniques to define the neurobehavioral and neurometabolic abnormalities and their response to treatment in urban African-Americans with type 2 diabetes and depression, as needed to improve basic understanding of disordered metabolism in this patient population and to help relieve their disparity in health.

"Racial Differences in Social Relations and Depression DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This application requests five years funding for a K01 Mentored Scientist Development Award for New Minority Faculty (PAR-99-169). This application intends to examine the longitudinal relationships that link SES to depression through stress, emotional support, negative social interactions, and mastery among African American and white adults. The proposed research aims to increase our understanding of the social support process and how it influences mental health outcomes among African Americans and whites. While negative social interactions can exacerbate the effects of stress and increase one's risk for depression, the long term mechanisms whereby social relationships affect mental health remains unclear. Moreover, the part that SES plays in these relationships is unknown. The research component of this application outlines a plan for exploring new and innovative questions around the role of SES, social relationships and mastery in the stress process, and the mechanisms whereby these factors impact depression among African Americans and whites. The Americans' Changing Lives Panel Study (Principal Investigator: James S. House) will be used to investigate these relationships over time. The goal of this application is to identify modifiable social and personal resources that can be used to develop, rigorously test and widely disseminate preventive interventions to reduce the effects of stress on mental health outcomes.

"Biobehavioral Mechanisms of Depression in Women    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This Mentored Research Scientist                Development Award (MRSDA) is designed to promote the Candidate's long-term goal      of becoming a women's health researcher with expertise in the etiology and           treatment of depression in women. The training and research activities               described in this MRSDA will facilitate the Candidate's training in the methods      of acute stress research and neurohormonal assessment techniques, and the            integration of these techniques within her own background in depression              intervention research. This interdisciplinary training will provide the              Candidate with the skills and experience needed to pursue an independent             program of research testing biobehavioral mechanisms of stress sensitivity,          depression vulnerability, and ultimately, depression treatment outcomes in           women. Post-pubertal females are twice as likely as males to experience a            lifetime episode of major depression, and are particularly likely to become          depressed when faced with stressful life events. This gender-linked health           disparity persists throughout women's reproductive lives, carrying deleterious       consequences for both the woman herself and the children under her care. We          (Cyranowski et al., 2000) have theorized that women's sensitivity to                 interpersonal life stress is mediated, in part, by the hypothalamic                  neurohormone, oxytocin. Oxytocin is known to play a key role in female               reproductive processes. A growing body of animal research indicates that             oxytocin is critically regulated by female reproductive hormones, and that           oxytocin serves to facilitate female affiliative behaviors and down-regulate         the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) stress axis. The proposed pilot study       was designed to provide a preliminary examination of the role of oxytocin in         women's stress sensitivity and depression vulnerability. Twenty-two normal           cycling, depressed females aged 21-40 and 22 age-matched never-depressed             controls will be recruited to participate in a 3-hour laboratory experiment          designed to stimulate, measure and compare peripheral oxytocin release and           basal oxytocin concentrations within and between groups, and to examine whether      peripheral oxytocin release is associated with a down-regulation of the HPA          stress axis following an acute stress task. Subjects will also complete              self-report measures of depression, anxiety, interpersonal function, trauma          history, and recent life stress. Subjects will then be retested with the             laboratory paradigm at 18 weeks follow-up, or for depressed subjects, following      a course of interpersonal psychotherapy (IPT). The skills, training, and pilot       data obtained from this MRSDA will subsequently be used to support the               Candidate's development of an R0l application in Years 03-05 of the award            period.

"Functional Limitation, Arthritis, Depression, & Race    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This study addresses the programmatic area from PA02-043 Social and Cultural Dimensions of Health related to consequences of poor health. This study evaluates the influence of major depression in conjunction with sociodemographic, health, and economic factors on arthritis-related functional limitations to identify risk factors amenable to public health/public policy prevention or intervention strategies. Over 35 million Americans have one or more conditions resulting in a limitation of life activities with an associated economic cost exceeding $170 billion. Depression and arthritis are the two leading causes of functional limitations in the United States. Arthritis-related functional limitations are a particular concern due to disproportionately high burdens among ethnic minority groups. This study addresses major public health and public policy questions related to functional limitation and major depression in adults with arthritis as they near retirement age. It uses nationally representative longitudinal 1996-2000 data from the Health and Retirement Survey (HRS) to estimate rates of functional limitation and 12-month major depression among persons with arthritis. It also estimates the impact of major depression on subsequent functional impairment and use of medical services. It further estimates racial/ethnic differences in functional impairment and major depression and examines whether differences in depression rates, other health needs, and/or health care access partly explain racial/ethnic disparities in functional limitation onset and subsequent use of health care services. The investigators provide a spectrum of health services research, statistical, medical rehabilitation, clinical, mental health, public health, and economic expertise needed to complete this methodologically sophisticated study using national data. The project extends their preliminary work based on the 1996 HRS data, which shows racial/ethnic differences in depressive disorders and functional limitations among persons with arthritis. This study addresses goals from Healthy People 2010, National Center for Medical Rehabilitation Research, and the National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin diseases strategic plan. Hypotheses tested by this study will provide information that would motivate clinical and public health strategies to improve health care and reduce functional impairment among people with arthritis.         ","Functional Limitation, Arthritis, Depression, & Race",6831214,R01HD045412,"['health care service utilization ', ' statistics /biometry ', ' human population study ', ' epidemiology ', ' longitudinal human study ', ' major depression ', ' arthritis ', ' African American ', ' Hispanic American ', ' racial /ethnic difference ', ' functional ability ', ' human data ', ' clinical research ', ' health disparity ', ' ']",NICHD,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,R01,2005,133585,0.1294282136217189

"Neighborhood Risk Factors for Maternal Depression    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This training proposal is designed to enable me to undertake independent applied research focusing on maternal depression, specifically environmental risk factors and their mediators. It will provide a specific set of skills and knowledge of mental health issues and enable me to build on research that has demonstrated that poor and minority women have almost twice the rates of maternal depression compared to their middleclass counterparts. The effect of the social context on maternal depression, and postpartum depression in particular, has not been thoroughly studied in disadvantaged women. This is significant because many risk factors for depression are not wholly endogenous but arise out of the dynamic interaction between the individual and the social and physical environment. Furthermore, approaches to prevention of maternal depression, and postpartum depression specifically, differ based on whether the focus is the individual or the environment. The career development plan proposed herein consists of didactic training and mentored research projects. In the research projects, the main question concerns the role of the social environment, represented by neighborhood characteristics. Researching social environmental factors brings the complex interplay between race/ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and area of residence into focus. In recognition of these complexities, we will recruit non-Hispanic African American mothers in order to identify variation in neighborhood factors in a group of women generally considered at high risk. Study I is a qualitative study of mothers sampled based on a neighborhood (census block group) sampling frame. The objective of this study is to assess mothers' perceptions about the influence of neighborhood stressors on their mood states using qualitative analytic methods (specifically, focus groups and structured interviews). Study 2 is a cross-sectional study of mothers also from low- and mid-level SES neighborhoods. The objective of this study is to determine if neighborhood characteristics are associated with the presence of depressive symptoms, while adjusting for important individual characteristics with the use of structural equation modeling.

"MUPS in Primary Care Research Center    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This is a request for funding a Developing Center for Intervention and Services Research (DCISR) in response to PAR 01-090. This new center will focus on patients who present in primary care with medically unexplained physical symptoms (MUPS). MUPS (e.g., unexplained pain, numbness, gastrointestinal symptoms) comprise a very common clinical presentation for disabling psychiatric disorders in primary care settings, such as depression and anxiety. The name of this new Developing Center will be the ""MUPS in Primary Care Research Center"" (MUPS-PCRC.) The center will build the necessary cores (e.g., operations, methods, training) and infrastructure for developing an innovative services research program in primary care concerning this population. Furthermore, the initial studies planned for the MUPS-PCRS will relate to lower socioeconomic status Latino and African-American patients, due to the well-documented disparities in mental health care for these populations. The faculty of MUPS-PCRS will also explore the effectiveness of a culturally- competent, collaborative stepped-care model for treating primary care patients with MUPS, while examining how patients, family members, physicians and behavioral health care specialists accept this model.  At least four pilot studies are planned, in consultation with an external advisory board of leading researchers, and apace with research infrastructure implementation. These studies will gather preliminary data on different stages of the collaborative stepped-care model. One study will focus on development and testing of specialized videos and other educational materials to be used in the first stage of the model, whereas another study will focus on the effectiveness of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) as a second stage treatment strategy and as a way to facilitate behavioral health care referrals. Two other studies concern alternative third-stage treatments for patients who do not respond well to CBT: a) heart rate variability biofeedback for the treatment of residual depression and somatic complaints; b) interpersonal therapy. The expectation is that preliminary data collected in the various studies conducted in the first few years of Center operations will inform the design and planning of several larger-scale investigator -initiated grant applications from MUPS-PCRC faculty and trainees.            ",MUPS in Primary Care Research Center,6959542,P20MH074634,"['biomedical facility ', ' sign /symptom ', ' health science research support ', ' psychosomatic disorder ', ' clinical research ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIV OF MED/DENT NJ-R W JOHNSON MED SCH,P20,2005,480467,0.0446672038191997

"Depression Care Among Elderly Nursing Home Residents    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Depression has pervasive effects on quality of life and health outcomes for elderly nursing home (NH) residents, but existing care processes are poorly understood and the knowledge base for improvement is inadequate. This study will provide a comprehensive assessment of patterns of depression identification and treatment for elderly residents, using merged data from the Minimum Data Set (MDS), Medicare and Medicaid claims, the OSCAR database on facility characteristics, and information on community characteristics in 6 states. The research dataset will integrate extensive clinical information from MDS with details on health and mental health services use, diagnoses, and pharmaceutical use histories from claims, along with contextual information on facilities that will relate care of individuals to other aspects of nursing facility care and life. The study aims to provide a clearer understanding of variations across facilities and communities in depression-related care processes, and to articulate the effects of facility structure, resources, case-mix, and practice patterns on resident care and outcomes. It will examine patterns of identified depression symptoms and diagnoses; antidepressant treatment; use of mental health services; and their interrelationships. An important focus will be on the analysis of racial/ethnic and other socioeconomic and geographical disparities, and identification of policy-modifiable and other factors that give rise to them. Trends in depression identification and treatment from 1999 through 2007 will be evaluated, including changes following public release via the Internet of a facility-level depression quality measure by CMS in 2004. Longitudinal analyses will evaluate trajectories of depression-related resident outcomes over time. Guided by a conceptual framework that articulates hypothesized processes leading to depression identification, treatment, and outcomes in a process of interaction among resident, facility, and community factors, the study will use multilevel modeling techniques that account for clustering of repeated observations within residents, residents within facilities, and facilities within communities.

"Patient Centered Depression Care for African-Americans DESCRIPTION:  (Provided by the Applicant) Several studies document underutilization of outpatient specialty mental health services by African Americans. However, African Americans with depression are just as likely as whites to receive care in primary care settings. Despite their use of primary care services, African American patients are less likely than whites to be recognized as depressed, offered pharmacotherapy, and to initiate or complete pharmacotherapy or psychotherapy for depression. Compared to whites, African American patients express stronger preferences for counseling and more negative attitudes toward antidepressant medication, the most common form of treatment of depression used by primary care physicians. African Americans are also more likely to see depression and its treatment through a spiritual framework. Studies show that African Americans receive less optimal technical and interpersonal health care than whites for many conditions, including depression. Depression is a common chronic condition that results in substantial morbidity, functional disability, and resource use. Despite the proven efficacy of pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy for treatment of depression, many depressed primary care patients of all races and ethnicities still do not receive adequate treatment. Recent quality improvement trials for depression in primary care have shown improvements in outcomes; however, there is room for improvement, particularly for ethnic minority patients. Interventions focusing on patient-centeredness have documented benefits on patient adherence, patient satisfaction, and health outcomes. Yet, only a few recent quality improvement strategies for depression include patient-centered accommodations. We have created a patient-centered adaptation that includes many of the components of recent successful quality improvement interventions for depression in primary care. The proposed study compares a standard depression intervention for patients (delivered by a depression case manager) and physicians (review of guidelines and structured mental health consultation) to a patient-centered intervention for patients (incorporates patient activation, individual preferences, and cultural sensitivity) and physicians (incorporates participatory communication skills training with individualized feedback on interactive CD-ROM). Thirty physicians and 250 patients will be randomized to either the standard interventions or the culturally tailored interventions. The main hypothesis is that patients in the patient-centered, culturally tailored intervention group will have higher remission rates from depression and lower levels of depressive symptoms at 12 months than patients in the standard intervention care group. Secondary outcomes will include patient receipt of guideline concordant care, patient and physician satisfaction with care, patient-physician communication behaviors, patient and physician attitudes toward depression, and self-efficacy in managing depression. This study will add to knowledge about how to effectively engage African American patients in care of depression and serve as a prototype of how to incorporate patient-centeredness in programs to reduce racial and ethnic disparities in health care for common conditions.

(2) To define the pathways through which depression contributes to metabolic imbalance, we will study patients exposed to progressive psychobehavioral challenge (depression and/or early life stress), and assess (a) hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal activation; (b) counter-regulatory hormones; and (c) immunoinflammatory cytokines; in relation to (d) insulin resistance. (3) To determine the psychobehavioral and neurohormonal mechanisms of treatment, we will conduct a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial: patients with depression will receive stress management videotapes and either placebo or the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) citalopram, and we will assess (a) overall glycemic control (HbAlc levels), and (b) patient adherence -to a prescribed diet/exercise program, to use of medications, and to scheduled return appointments; in relation to (c) depressive symptoms and (d) neurometabolic function as defined in Aim #2.

"Literacy and Utilization of Maternal Depression Care    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Nonpsychotic major depression (MOD) occurs in 10-20 percent of women within 6 months of delivery with higher rates seen following preterm birth. Patient factors which reduce participation in care for MOD are major barriers to the delivery of effective depression treatments. Adults with low literacy have higher risk of depressive symptomatology and less utilization of a variety of health care services 20-37 percent of women in populations most at risk for maternal health disparities have low literacy (< 6th grade). The health literacy construct, the capacity to access information needed for health decisions, has been proposed as a mediator of the association between low literacy and low health care service use. Assessing the role of low literacy in the utilization of care for MOD identified postpartum may allow interventions that would reduce barriers to treatment for this vulnerable population. This application outlines a mixed methods study (R03) in which qualitative methods will be added to an ongoing randomized controlled trial to treat risk factors for repeat preterm birth (n=1420). Participants who are diagnosed with DSM-IV MOD following an early preterm birth (<34 weeks EGA) will be offered a choice of free treatments (psychotherapy, antidepressant medication, or a combination of the two). The primary aims of this investigation of women with depression and low literacy (< 6th grade, n=117) are to: 1) Identify factors associated with accepting versus declining referral for depression care among women with high depressive symptomatology (CES-D 22); 2) Identify factors associated with accepting versus declining any of the active treatments for depression offered among women with DSM-IV MOD; and 3) ldentify factors associated with depression treatment continuation versus discontinuation among women with DSM-IV MOD. The proposed study will take advantage of extensive quantitative data collected in the parent study which will be linked to qualitative analyses of transcripts from semi-structured interviews (n=60) and clinical interviews (n=40) The qualitative methods will greatly enhance the quantitative assessments, provide an opportunity to clarify inconsistencies in results, and an opportunity to uncover novel factors linking health literacy and depression treatment utilization. This study represents a unique and cost effective opportunity to study patient factors which are obstacles to depression treatment in women with low literacy and inform future interventions.

"Multifaceted Depression Diabetes Program for Hispanics DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Patients with diabetes are two times more likely to experience depression than the general population, with depression being associated with poor diabetes outcomes and likely to be persistent. Prevalence of diabetes and its complications among Hispanics is twice that among non-Hispanic Whites, and they are less likely to receive care for depression. A randomized clinical trial will test the effectiveness of a health services quality improvement intervention, Multi-faceted Depression and Diabetes Program (MDDP), on improvement in depressive symptoms over time, patient adherence to diabetes self-care regimens, glycemic control, functional status, and quality of life among low-income Hispanic adults with diabetes. MDDP is aimed at positively affecting depression and diabetes outcomes by reducing socio-cultural patient/family, health care provider, and system barriers to patient access and adherence to guideline depression treatment. MDDP is designed for public sector primary care systems. Intervention enhancements include: depression care management based on a stepped care depression treatment algorithm; extension of the primary care management team with a master's degreed social worker, who acts as Diabetes Depression Clinical Specialist (DDCS) in collaboration with primary care physicians (PMDs) and a Case Manager; a psychiatric consultant to provide supervision of the DDCS and consultation to the PMD; DDCS treatment adherence and outcome monitoring and feedback to primary care providers; and PMD education on depression management.

"Psychosocial & Nutritional Associations with Depression Relative to Non-Hispanic whites, Puerto Rican elders living in the US mainland are at particularly higher risk for several conditions, among them depression. Differences between these two groups in the prevalence of depression persist despite controlling for socio-demographic variables, which suggests the contribution of socio-cultural and/or biological factors in the existing health disparity among Puerto Rican elders. Research with B vitamins suggests that folate, cobalamin and pyridoxine status correlate with depressive symptomatology. Puerto Rican elders have been identified as having lower plasma and dietary status of these vitamins compared to Non-Hispanic white elders. This population faces more stressors than other groups, which is thought to contribute to health disparities. Social support has also been shown to mediate stressors that lead to disease outcomes. The specific aims of this research are to 1) examine the associations of folate, cobalamin, and pyridoxine on depressive symptomatology using dietary intake and plasma vitamin measures 2) Assess cross-sectional and two year relationships of stress on nutritional status and depressive symptomatology and 3) Assess how social support mediates the above associations. These data will be gathered from Puerto Rican adults between the ages of 50-70 in the greater Boston area. Understanding these relationship in this at-risk population is necessary to reduce health disparities.

"Patient Centered Depression Care for African-Americans DESCRIPTION:  (Provided by the Applicant) Several studies document underutilization of outpatient specialty mental health services by African Americans. However, African Americans with depression are just as likely as whites to receive care in primary care settings. Despite their use of primary care services, African American patients are less likely than whites to be recognized as depressed, offered pharmacotherapy, and to initiate or complete pharmacotherapy or psychotherapy for depression. Compared to whites, African American patients express stronger preferences for counseling and more negative attitudes toward antidepressant medication, the most common form of treatment of depression used by primary care physicians. African Americans are also more likely to see depression and its treatment through a spiritual framework. Studies show that African Americans receive less optimal technical and interpersonal health care than whites for many conditions, including depression. Depression is a common chronic condition that results in substantial morbidity, functional disability, and resource use. Despite the proven efficacy of pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy for treatment of depression, many depressed primary care patients of all races and ethnicities still do not receive adequate treatment. Recent quality improvement trials for depression in primary care have shown improvements in outcomes; however, there is room for improvement, particularly for ethnic minority patients. Interventions focusing on patient-centeredness have documented benefits on patient adherence, patient satisfaction, and health outcomes. Yet, only a few recent quality improvement strategies for depression include patient-centered accommodations. We have created a patient-centered adaptation that includes many of the components of recent successful quality improvement interventions for depression in primary care. The proposed study compares a standard depression intervention for patients (delivered by a depression case manager) and physicians (review of guidelines and structured mental health consultation) to a patient-centered intervention for patients (incorporates patient activation, individual preferences, and cultural sensitivity) and physicians (incorporates participatory communication skills training with individualized feedback on interactive CD-ROM). Thirty physicians and 250 patients will be randomized to either the standard interventions or the culturally tailored interventions. The main hypothesis is that patients in the patient-centered, culturally tailored intervention group will have higher remission rates from depression and lower levels of depressive symptoms at 12 months than patients in the standard intervention care group. Secondary outcomes will include patient receipt of guideline concordant care, patient and physician satisfaction with care, patient-physician communication behaviors, patient and physician attitudes toward depression, and self-efficacy in managing depression. This study will add to knowledge about how to effectively engage African American patients in care of depression and serve as a prototype of how to incorporate patient-centeredness in programs to reduce racial and ethnic disparities in health care for common conditions.

The research dataset will integrate extensive clinical information from MDS with details on health and mental health services use, diagnoses, and pharmaceutical use histories from claims, along with contextual information on facilities that will relate care of individuals to other aspects of nursing facility care and life. The study aims to provide a clearer understanding of variations across facilities and communities in depression-related care processes, and to articulate the effects of facility structure, resources, case-mix, and practice patterns on resident care and outcomes. It will examine patterns of identified depression symptoms and diagnoses; antidepressant treatment; use of mental health services; and their interrelationships. An important focus will be on the analysis of racial/ethnic and other socioeconomic and geographical disparities, and identification of policy-modifiable and other factors that give rise to them. Trends in depression identification and treatment from 1999 through 2007 will be evaluated, including changes following public release via the Internet of a facility-level depression quality measure by CMS in 2004. Longitudinal analyses will evaluate trajectories of depression-related resident outcomes over time. Guided by a conceptual framework that articulates hypothesized processes leading to depression identification, treatment, and outcomes in a process of interaction among resident, facility, and community factors, the study will use multilevel modeling techniques that account for clustering of repeated observations within residents, residents within facilities, and facilities within communities.

"Troubled Minds, Broken Hearts: Women, Depression and Myocardial Infarction    DESCRIPTION (provided by Applicant):  US Public Health Service's Healthy People 2010 initiative has highlighted the need for a greater research focus on remedying the race and gender disparity in mental health and outcome of coronary heart disease (CHD). While CHD mortality has declined among men, it has continued to increase among women, claiming the lives of more than half a million women every year. Depression predicts adverse outcomes after myocardial infarction (Ml) and is far more prevalent among women than men post-MI. Therefore, it is possible that depression is an important determinant of women's poorer prognosis post-MI. However, there is limited information on this issue.      There is also paucity of clinical trials examining pharmacological treatment of depression in post-MI patients. Since African-Americans have a major burden of unmet mental health needs, it is relevant to conduct such a trial in an African-American population. Accordingly, the specific aims for the research plan are: 1) to examine to what extent depression accounts for women's higher rates of adverse outcomes post-MI; 2) to determine whether the association between depression and outcome is the same or differs in men and women; and 3) to examine, in a preliminary fashion, the efficacy of drug treatment of depression in improving outcome in post-MI men and women in a predominantly African-American patient population. This study will be conducted in collaboration with the General Clinical Research Center (GCRC) at Emory.      If successful, our study will advance understanding of the factors associated with the poorer outcome after Ml and provide novel effective ways to improve outcomes in women, as well as in men. Our study has the potential to demonstrate that treatment of depression improves outcomes after Ml and contribute to remedying race and gender differences in outcomes of Ml patients.   The environment is ideal for the proposed career development. Emory University has an established infrastructure through NIH K30 and K12 programs and GCRC for career development of clinical investigators and is home to several original research projects on CHD. The Lead Mentor and Advisory Committee members are expert clinical investigators with commitment to fostering the candidate's career development.      The candidate's long term goal is to become an independent patient-oriented investigator focusing on the role of psychological, behavioral and biological factors that influence cardiovascular disease (CVD) outcomes and the impact of novel interventions on eliminating disparity in outcomes. To meet these goals, the proposed individualized multidisciplinary career development plan integrates training in mentored patient-oriented research, advanced statistical, epidemiological and behavioral research methods, and collaboration with GCRC and CVD outcomes researchers both at Emory and other national institutions.

"Racial Differences in Social Relations and Depression DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This application requests five years funding for a K01 Mentored Scientist Development Award for New Minority Faculty (PAR-99-169). This application intends to examine the longitudinal relationships that link SES to depression through stress, emotional support, negative social interactions, and mastery among African American and white adults. The proposed research aims to increase our understanding of the social support process and how it influences mental health outcomes among African Americans and whites. While negative social interactions can exacerbate the effects of stress and increase one's risk for depression, the long term mechanisms whereby social relationships affect mental health remains unclear. Moreover, the part that SES plays in these relationships is unknown. The research component of this application outlines a plan for exploring new and innovative questions around the role of SES, social relationships and mastery in the stress process, and the mechanisms whereby these factors impact depression among African Americans and whites. The Americans' Changing Lives Panel Study (Principal Investigator: James S. House) will be used to investigate these relationships over time. The goal of this application is to identify modifiable social and personal resources that can be used to develop, rigorously test and widely disseminate preventive interventions to reduce the effects of stress on mental health outcomes. A five-year program of mentored research, education and training will provide the candidate with the substantive knowledge and methodological skills needed to conduct state-of-the-art research in stress, social relations and mental health. Dr. David T. Takeuchi of the University of Washington will serve as a mentor and will collaborate with an extraordinary group of investigators and scholars who will provide training and consultation in longitudinal design, advanced statistical analysis, questionnaire design and measurement development.

"MUPS in Primary Care Research Center    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This is a request for funding a Developing Center for Intervention and Services Research (DCISR) in response to PAR 01-090. This new center will focus on patients who present in primary care with medically unexplained physical symptoms (MUPS). MUPS (e.g., unexplained pain, numbness, gastrointestinal symptoms) comprise a very common clinical presentation for disabling psychiatric disorders in primary care settings, such as depression and anxiety. The name of this new Developing Center will be the ""MUPS in Primary Care Research Center"" (MUPS-PCRC.) The center will build the necessary cores (e.g., operations, methods, training) and infrastructure for developing an innovative services research program in primary care concerning this population. Furthermore, the initial studies planned for the MUPS-PCRS will relate to lower socioeconomic status Latino and African-American patients, due to the well-documented disparities in mental health care for these populations. The faculty of MUPS-PCRS will also explore the effectiveness of a culturally- competent, collaborative stepped-care model for treating primary care patients with MUPS, while examining how patients, family members, physicians and behavioral health care specialists accept this model.  At least four pilot studies are planned, in consultation with an external advisory board of leading researchers, and apace with research infrastructure implementation. These studies will gather preliminary data on different stages of the collaborative stepped-care model. One study will focus on development and testing of specialized videos and other educational materials to be used in the first stage of the model, whereas another study will focus on the effectiveness of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) as a second stage treatment strategy and as a way to facilitate behavioral health care referrals. Two other studies concern alternative third-stage treatments for patients who do not respond well to CBT: a) heart rate variability biofeedback for the treatment of residual depression and somatic complaints; b) interpersonal therapy. The expectation is that preliminary data collected in the various studies conducted in the first few years of Center operations will inform the design and planning of several larger-scale investigator -initiated grant applications from MUPS-PCRC faculty and trainees.            ",MUPS in Primary Care Research Center,7121493,P20MH074634,"['biomedical facility ', ' sign /symptom ', ' health science research support ', ' psychosomatic disorder ', ' clinical research ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIV OF MED/DENT NJ-R W JOHNSON MED SCH,P20,2006,628856,0.0446672038191997
"Psychosocial & Nutritional Associations with Depression Relative to Non-Hispanic whites, Puerto Rican elders living in the US mainland are at particularly higher risk for several conditions, among them depression. Differences between these two groups in the prevalence of depression persist despite controlling for socio-demographic variables, which suggests the contribution of socio-cultural and/or biological factors in the existing health disparity among Puerto Rican elders. Research with B vitamins suggests that folate, cobalamin and pyridoxine status correlate with depressive symptomatology. Puerto Rican elders have been identified as having lower plasma and dietary status of these vitamins compared to Non-Hispanic white elders. This population faces more stressors than other groups, which is thought to contribute to health disparities. Social support has also been shown to mediate stressors that lead to disease outcomes. The specific aims of this research are to 1) examine the associations of folate, cobalamin, and pyridoxine on depressive symptomatology using dietary intake and plasma vitamin measures 2) Assess cross-sectional and two year relationships of stress on nutritional status and depressive symptomatology and 3) Assess how social support mediates the above associations. These data will be gathered from Puerto Rican adults between the ages of 50-70 in the greater Boston area. Understanding these relationship in this at-risk population is necessary to reduce health disparities.

"Patient-Centered Depression Care in the Public Sector DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  For depression care to be sustainable in public sector primary care settings, it must accommodate patient preferences and the priorities and capacities of providers and administrators. This application aims to directly address the need for information on how to assess and incorporate the preferences of patients, providers, and administrators into the design of a depression intervention. In 3 large public sector primary care centers serving mostly low-income Latinos, we assess the depression care preferences and resources of patients, providers, and administrators. To do so, we use mixed qualitative and quantitative methods and a novel application of conjoint analysis, a marketing research method. Next, we randomize 100 patients at each clinic (300 patients total) to a standardized depression intervention vs. wait list control, not for the traditional purpose of studying intervention effects on patient outcomes, but rather for providing patients, clinicians, and administrators with a treatment exposure. We then examine whether stated preferences before the intervention correspond to the actual behaviors of patients, providers, and administrators when provided with an opportunity for care, and whether exposure to depression treatment or improved outcomes change stated preferences for care. Finally, we conduct a multi-stakeholder negotiation process to prioritize consumer oriented- preferences for care given resource constraints. At study end, we will have gained information regarding the preferences of multiple stakeholders in public sector care and on how public primary care systems can weigh not only the often harsh realities of public sector practice constraints, but also the needs and priorities of informed consumers, in efforts to improve care.

"Literacy and Utilization of Maternal Depression Care    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Nonpsychotic major depression (MOD) occurs in 10-20 percent of women within 6 months of delivery with higher rates seen following preterm birth. Patient factors which reduce participation in care for MOD are major barriers to the delivery of effective depression treatments. Adults with low literacy have higher risk of depressive symptomatology and less utilization of a variety of health care services 20-37 percent of women in populations most at risk for maternal health disparities have low literacy (< 6th grade). The health literacy construct, the capacity to access information needed for health decisions, has been proposed as a mediator of the association between low literacy and low health care service use. Assessing the role of low literacy in the utilization of care for MOD identified postpartum may allow interventions that would reduce barriers to treatment for this vulnerable population. This application outlines a mixed methods study (R03) in which qualitative methods will be added to an ongoing randomized controlled trial to treat risk factors for repeat preterm birth (n=1420). Participants who are diagnosed with DSM-IV MOD following an early preterm birth (<34 weeks EGA) will be offered a choice of free treatments (psychotherapy, antidepressant medication, or a combination of the two). The primary aims of this investigation of women with depression and low literacy (< 6th grade, n=117) are to: 1) Identify factors associated with accepting versus declining referral for depression care among women with high depressive symptomatology (CES-D 22); 2) Identify factors associated with accepting versus declining any of the active treatments for depression offered among women with DSM-IV MOD; and 3) ldentify factors associated with depression treatment continuation versus discontinuation among women with DSM-IV MOD. The proposed study will take advantage of extensive quantitative data collected in the parent study which will be linked to qualitative analyses of transcripts from semi-structured interviews (n=60) and clinical interviews (n=40) The qualitative methods will greatly enhance the quantitative assessments, provide an opportunity to clarify inconsistencies in results, and an opportunity to uncover novel factors linking health literacy and depression treatment utilization. This study represents a unique and cost effective opportunity to study patient factors which are obstacles to depression treatment in women with low literacy and inform future interventions.

"Depression Treatment for Type 2 Diabetes Appalachians    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    The prevalence of type 2 diabetes (T2DM) continues to expand in epidemic proportions nationally and within the underserved rural Appalachian region. Low-income, at-risk populations, such as Appalachians, show increased risk for the development of type 2 diabetes (T2DM) and worsened outcomes. Depression is two times more likely in patients with T2DM than the general population. Depression rates among Appalachians with T2DM appear to be comparable to national means. Depression and diabetes is associated with worsened glycemic control and complications. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) treatment has been shown to reduce depression and average blood sugars in T2DM patients. Aerobic exercise has been shown to be an efficacious treatment for major depression in patients without diabetes. To date, no studies have combined these treatments for patients with T2DM and depression. Advantages of this combined approach may include: extending depression remission through exercise maintenance; use of exercise as behavioral activation within the CBT framework; improvements in glycemic control; and potential for the reduction of cardiovascular risk factors such as HDL-C. The current study is a pilot and feasibility investigation of a community-based interdisciplinary approach to the treatment of depression in underserved rural Appalachian patients with T2DM, entitled Program ACTIVE (Appalachians Coming Together to Increase Vital Exercise). The study is a single-group repeated measures design. The primary aims of the study are: 1) to assess the feasibility of recruitment, retention and adherence to this combined intervention program; 2) to assess the impact of the intervention on depression outcomes; 3) to assess the impact of the intervention on glycemic control; and 4) to assess the impact of the intervention on cardiovascular risk factors, specifically HDL-C. In Phase I, CBT and community-based exercise intervention protocols used in previous efficacy studies will be culturally-tailored for the Appalachian region. In Phase II, N=51 T2DM and depression participants will be recruited to receive 10 weekly sessions of CBT and 12 weeks of community-based aerobic exercise. Assessments will be conducted at baseline, post-intervention (POST) and 3-month follow-up (3MFU). Intention-to-treat analyses will be conducted to assess the feasibility of study recruitment, retention and the impact of intervention exposure on depressive symptoms, glycemic control, and changes in HDL-C as primary outcomes. Secondary outcomes of diabetes-specific quality of life and social support will also be examined. In addition, the feasibility of collecting cost - effectiveness data for use in the R18 trial will be assessed. Approximately 60% of participants are expected to be non-depressed at POST. Outcomes at POST and 3MFU are anticipated to show improvement over baseline.    This study will inform the submission of an NIDDK R18 grant proposal for a multi-arm randomized clinical effectiveness trial of the culturally-tailored interdisciplinary depression intervention (usual care, CBT alone, exercise alone, combination therapy). The rationale for the R18 study mirrors the rationale for this R34 proposal. The study is anticipated to evaluate depression, glycemic control, and cardiovascular risk factor outcomes across 4 time points: baseline, POST, 6- and 12-month follow-up periods. Comparative effectiveness of the treatment arms as well as cost-effectiveness of treatment will be assessed.       ",Depression Treatment for Type 2 Diabetes Appalachians,7083396,R34DK071545,"['noninsulin dependent diabetes mellitus ', ' human subject ', ' high density lipoprotein ', ' clinical depression ', ' human therapy evaluation ', ' aerobic exercise ', ' cognitive behavior therapy ', ' combination therapy ', ' comorbidity ', ' clinical research ', ' behavioral /social science research tag ', ' health services research tag ', ' medically underserved population ', ' patient oriented research ', ' cardiovascular disorder risk ', ' health disparity ', ' rural health ', ' ']",NIDDK,OHIO UNIVERSITY ATHENS,R34,2006,219458,0.19779857041058888
"PATHWAYS TO OVERCOMING DISPARITIES IN DEPRESSION    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This is a competing continuation for an NIMH R01 (Pathways to Outcomes of Care in Depression), which funded five-year follow-up of participants in Partners in Care, a group-level randomized trial of quality improvement interventions versus usual care for depression.  Our continuation proposes a new follow-up study in response to key findings from the existing grant:  1) Quality improvement interventions for depression had stronger effects on improving outcomes among minorities than whites during the active intervention period, despite similar effects on quality of care across ethnic groups; 2) by five-year follow-up, ethnic-related health outcome disparities apparent among controls were eliminated among intervention subjects.  We propose a 3-stage study of quality improvement (QI) effects on health outcome disparities:  1) Stage 1:  7-year follow-up of the full PIC sample (N=1182) to examine how initial QI affected intermediate outcomes such as concerns about stigma of depression; occurrence of life events; use of social supports; having a regular provider; use of appropriate treatments.  2) Stage 2: a qualitative study of the minority subjects, using a series of telephone interviews, to examine how subjects respond to depressive symptoms, stressful life events, and healthcare visits, in real time.  3) Stage 3: an ethnographically-based further follow-up of Latinos in Los Angeles, stratified by gender, intervention status and 7-year outcome, to learn more about how depressed patients are managing their lives within the context of their own environment.  Data from Stage 1 will be used to test hypotheses about QI effects on intermediate outcomes and differences in such effects for minorities and whites; data from Stages 2 and 3 will be used to confirm or refute findings from Stage 1, provide richer detail on pathways to outcome improvement, and generate hypotheses about mechanisms for outcome improvement among minorities.

"Functional Limitation, Arthritis, Depression, & Race    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This study addresses the programmatic area from PA02-043 Social and Cultural Dimensions of Health related to consequences of poor health. This study evaluates the influence of major depression in conjunction with sociodemographic, health, and economic factors on arthritis-related functional limitations to identify risk factors amenable to public health/public policy prevention or intervention strategies. Over 35 million Americans have one or more conditions resulting in a limitation of life activities with an associated economic cost exceeding $170 billion. Depression and arthritis are the two leading causes of functional limitations in the United States. Arthritis-related functional limitations are a particular concern due to disproportionately high burdens among ethnic minority groups. This study addresses major public health and public policy questions related to functional limitation and major depression in adults with arthritis as they near retirement age. It uses nationally representative longitudinal 1996-2000 data from the Health and Retirement Survey (HRS) to estimate rates of functional limitation and 12-month major depression among persons with arthritis. It also estimates the impact of major depression on subsequent functional impairment and use of medical services. It further estimates racial/ethnic differences in functional impairment and major depression and examines whether differences in depression rates, other health needs, and/or health care access partly explain racial/ethnic disparities in functional limitation onset and subsequent use of health care services. The investigators provide a spectrum of health services research, statistical, medical rehabilitation, clinical, mental health, public health, and economic expertise needed to complete this methodologically sophisticated study using national data. The project extends their preliminary work based on the 1996 HRS data, which shows racial/ethnic differences in depressive disorders and functional limitations among persons with arthritis. This study addresses goals from Healthy People 2010, National Center for Medical Rehabilitation Research, and the National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin diseases strategic plan. Hypotheses tested by this study will provide information that would motivate clinical and public health strategies to improve health care and reduce functional impairment among people with arthritis.         ","Functional Limitation, Arthritis, Depression, & Race",6998879,R01HD045412,"['health care service utilization ', ' statistics /biometry ', ' human population study ', ' epidemiology ', ' longitudinal human study ', ' major depression ', ' arthritis ', ' African American ', ' Hispanic American ', ' racial /ethnic difference ', ' functional ability ', ' human data ', ' clinical research ', ' health disparity ', ' ']",NICHD,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,R01,2006,163072,0.1294282136217189
"Maternal depression and child weight: Early pathways    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Childhood overweight is one of the most important health issues of our times, given their burden to individual lives and society as a whole. It is possible that maternal depression has a significant impact at overweight in childhood. This application aims to examine the relationship between maternal depression and weight change during childhood and systematically investigate possible mechanisms explaining this relationship. We propose to conduct secondary data analysis of the Fragile Families (FF) Study and the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study - Kindergarten (ECLS-K), which collected longitudinal information about maternal depression and overweight in childhood in national samples of children. In the FF study, information is available from birth to three years (three waves) (estimated N=2,355) and in the ECLS-K, from pre-K to 5th grade (5 waves) (estimated N=8,818). Maternal depression was measured, in the FF study, using a screening for DSM-IV major depressive disorder (the CIDI short form), and in the ECLS-K, by a brief version of a widely used depression scale (ECD-S). The specific aims of the proposed analysis are to examine: (I) the relationship between maternal depression and weight during different phases of childhood; (II) the role of social or racial/ethnic disparities in childhood weight in explaining the relationship of interest; and (III) specific prevention/treatment relevant mechanisms, including poor dietary practices and lack of physical activity that may account for the relationship of interest. Data will be analyzed using longitudinal multivariate statistical regression analysis techniques and structured equation modeling, controlling for important correlates. Understanding mechanisms explaining the relationship between maternal depression and overweight in childhood offers great potential to inform prevention and treatment of childhood obesity. Given the limited effectiveness of treatment for weight problems, elucidating this significant pathways will provide important information for developing new preventive interventions.             ",Maternal depression and child weight: Early pathways,7295837,R21HD056170,"['Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Decision Making ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Diet ', ' Major Depressive Disorder ', ' major depression ', ' Low income ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Address ', ' Epidemic ', ' Preventive ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Dietary Practices ', ' dietary pattern ', ' Predictive Value ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Family ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' Family Study ', ' Phase ', ' Adolescent ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Low Birth Weight Infant ', ' low birthweight ', ' low birth weight infant human ', ' low birth weight ', ' Screening procedure ', ' screenings ', ' screening ', ' DSM-IV ', ' Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-IV ', ' Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th edition ', ' DSM4 ', ' Physical activity ', ' Childhood ', ' pediatric ', ' Individual ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' Policies ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' Obesity ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Condition ', ' Regression Analysis ', ' Statistical Regression ', ' Regression Diagnostics ', ' Regression Analyses ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Societies ', ' Consensus ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' statistics ', ' Time ', ' Attention ', ' Weight ', ' Techniques ', ' Behavior ', ' Overweight ', ' Over weight ', ' behavior change ', ' interest ', ' Equation ', ' Birth ', ' Parturition ', ' Body Weight Changes ', ' Weight Change ', ' early childhood ', ' Structure ', ' Prevention ', ' social ', ' Measures ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Treatment Effectiveness ', ' response ', ' Accounting ', ' Minority ', ' Population ', ' maternal depression ', ' depressed mother ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' racial/ethnic ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' ']",NICHD,NEW YORK STATE PSYCHIATRIC INSTITUTE,R21,2007,200972,0.08491343616014771
"Depression Care Among Elderly Nursing Home Residents    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Depression has pervasive effects on quality of life and health outcomes for elderly nursing home (NH) residents, but existing care processes are poorly understood and the knowledge base for improvement is inadequate. This study will provide a comprehensive assessment of patterns of depression identification and treatment for elderly residents, using merged data from the Minimum Data Set (MDS), Medicare and Medicaid claims, the OSCAR database on facility characteristics, and information on community characteristics in 6 states. The research dataset will integrate extensive clinical information from MDS with details on health and mental health services use, diagnoses, and pharmaceutical use histories from claims, along with contextual information on facilities that will relate care of individuals to other aspects of nursing facility care and life. The study aims to provide a clearer understanding of variations across facilities and communities in depression-related care processes, and to articulate the effects of facility structure, resources, case-mix, and practice patterns on resident care and outcomes. It will examine patterns of identified depression symptoms and diagnoses; antidepressant treatment; use of mental health services; and their interrelationships. An important focus will be on the analysis of racial/ethnic and other socioeconomic and geographical disparities, and identification of policy-modifiable and other factors that give rise to them. Trends in depression identification and treatment from 1999 through 2007 will be evaluated, including changes following public release via the Internet of a facility-level depression quality measure by CMS in 2004.

"Racial Differences in Geriatric Antidepressant Adherence    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Geriatric depression is often chronic or recurrent, and is associated with substantial suffering, disability, suicide risk and decreased health-related quality of life. Although antidepressants and psychotherapy are clearly effective, older patients often fail to take them as prescribed or recommended and as many as 40% discontinues medication use prematurely. Even with successful health system changes such as collaborative care models in primary care, treatment gaps remain, and thus, poor treatment adherence may limit the extent to which many geriatric patients realize the benefits of these efficacious treatments. While there are racial differences in clinical diagnostic rates of depression, substantially less is known about racial differences in depression treatment adherence rates or the key determinants of adherence among older patients. Limited data from mixed-age samples suggests that African-American patients may be even less willing to engage in psychotherapy or accept antidepressant treatment than white patients. This study will use a mixed methods approach in order to identify the key modifiable determinants of depression treatment adherence among older African-American and white patients. A baseline survey including both quantitative and qualitative components will assess key constructs potentially determining adherence, with particular attention to possible factors (spirituality and stigma) that may differ across racial groups. In addition, four focus groups held with a subset of patients (n=6-8 for each group) will allow us to obtain more in-depth qualitative information and inform the addition of new domains to the follow-up survey. African-American (n=103) and white (n=103) patients 60 years old or over with the recent diagnosis of clinically significant depression in five participating primary care clinic sites will be eligible. Using the baseline and a four-month follow-up survey, we will compare rates of adherence between African-American and white patients and identify the determinants most significantly associated with non-adherence in the acute phase following a new diagnosis of depression. By identifying the key modifiable determinants of depression treatment adherence among both African-American and white elders, clinicians and researchers will be much more effective in identifying at-risk individuals and developing tailored interventions that may improve their treatment adherence and depression outcomes.           ",Racial Differences in Geriatric Antidepressant Adherence,7270113,R21MH073002,"['Gap Junctions ', ' Nexus Junction ', ' Nexus ', ' Low-resistance Junction ', ' Communicating Junction ', ' Screening procedure ', ' screenings ', ' screening ', ' disability ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Spirituality ', ' Spiritualities ', ' Individual ', ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Methods ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Mortality ', ' Baseline Surveys ', ' Developed Countries ', ' Industrialized Nations ', ' Industrialized Countries ', ' Developed Nations ', ' Developed Nation ', ' Developed Country ', ' Patients ', ' Antidepressive Agents ', ' Antidepressants ', ' Antidepressant Drugs ', ' Antidepressant Agent ', ' Kale - dietary ', ' Kale ', ' prescription procedure ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Primary Care ', ' Psychotherapy ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Depressed mood ', ' sadness ', ' depressed ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Recurrence ', ' Recurrent ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Risk ', ' Stigmata ', ' Knowledge ', ' Suicide ', ' suicidality ', ' intent to die ', ' fatal suicide ', ' fatal attempt ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Veterans ', ' Attention ', ' Work ', ' World Health Organization ', ' Severities ', ' Event ', ' Clinic ', ' Mental disorders ', ' psychological disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Belief ', ' psychosocial ', ' Services ', ' suicidal risk ', ' suicide risk ', ' prospective memory ', ' age group ', ' experience ', ' racial difference ', ' race differences ', ' Count ', ' Gender ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' social stigma ', ' stigma ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' executive function ', ' executive control ', ' Communities ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' vulnerable group ', ' geriatric depression ', ' late life depression ', ' Elderly depression ', ' age related ', ' age dependent ', ' health related quality of life ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Minority ', ' Antidepressant adherence ', ' older patient ', ' elderly patient ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' clinically significant ', ' clinical significance ', ' collaborative care ', ' Nexus (resin cement) ', ' Counseling ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Provider ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Developing Countries ', ' Under-Developed Nations ', ' Under-Developed Countries ', ' Third-World Nations ', ' Third-World Countries ', ' Less-Developed Nations ', ' Less-Developed Countries ', ' Developing Nations ', ' Developing Nation ', ' Developing Country ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Major Depressive Disorder ', ' major depression ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Address ', ' Health system ', ' Caring ', ' Qualitative Methods ', ' Adherence (attribute) ', ' Adherence ', ' Data ', ' Improve Access ', ' Rate ', ' prescription document ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' follow-up ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Guidelines ', ' medication compliance ', ' medication adherence ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Freedom ', ' Liberty ', ' Future ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Aging ', ' improved ', ' Health ', ' Health Personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Heart Diseases ', ' heart disorder ', ' Cardiac Disorders ', ' Cardiac Diseases ', ' Depth ', ' Site ', ' Acute ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Medical ', ' psychologic ', ' psychological ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R21,2007,199249,0.13204089694468146
"Antepartum Interpersonal Psychotherapy at 3 NYC Sites    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The 10-13% prevalence of Antepartum Depression (APD) increases 2 fold in women with poor social supports, low socioeconomic status (SES) and negative life events. APD causes low birth weight, prematurity and eclampsia. APD is one of the best predictors of postpartum depression (PPD), which in turn causes impaired infant and childhood emotional and cognitive development. Therefore, treating APD is a method of primary and secondary prevention by treating parents of children at risk. Yet, there are no treatment guidelines for antepartum depression. This application is based on findings from a previous bilingual controlled clinical trial of Interpersonal Psychotherapy adapted for APD (IPT-P). The mood of the IPT-P treatment group significantly improved on all mood scores compared to a matched Parenting Education Program (PEP) control with the same duration, frequency and intensity of contact as the treatment group. This study sample was comprised of a majority of indigent Spanish speaking immigrant women with multiple psychosocial and financial stressors. Because of the small sample size, there was no information on the relationship of  demographic variables such as race and SES to treatment feasibility, prognosis and attachment. Data from the National Comorbidity Study illustrated that effects of ethnicity and race must be examined in the context of SES and psychosocial variables in order to determine disparities in care and treatment outcome. In the proposed trial, a larger more diverse sample (N=150) of women from 3 different sites in New York City will provide enough power to generalize findings and determine the relationship of subgroup variables such as race/ethnicity and SES to treatment feasibility, motherhood and  attachment. 3 sites (New York State Psychiatric Institute/New York Presbyterian Hospital at Columbia, New York Presbyterian Hospital at Cornell and St. Luke's Roosevelt hospital) will provide equal proportions of Latina, African American and White depressed pregnant women. Each subject will be randomized to 12 weeks of IPT-P or PEP, then followed for 6 months postpartum to determine if the IPT-P is more effective in reducing depression, preventing PPD and improving maternal infant attachment. Co-investigators are maternal fetal medicine faculty from respective sites who will be primary liaison to the respective departments of obstetrics and provide clinical obstetrical needs of the study.

"Patient Centered Depression Care for African-Americans DESCRIPTION:  (Provided by the Applicant) Several studies document underutilization of outpatient specialty mental health services by African Americans. However, African Americans with depression are just as likely as whites to receive care in primary care settings. Despite their use of primary care services, African American patients are less likely than whites to be recognized as depressed, offered pharmacotherapy, and to initiate or complete pharmacotherapy or psychotherapy for depression. Compared to whites, African American patients express stronger preferences for counseling and more negative attitudes toward antidepressant medication, the most common form of treatment of depression used by primary care physicians. African Americans are also more likely to see depression and its treatment through a spiritual framework. Studies show that African Americans receive less optimal technical and interpersonal health care than whites for many conditions, including depression. Depression is a common chronic condition that results in substantial morbidity, functional disability, and resource use. Despite the proven efficacy of pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy for treatment of depression, many depressed primary care patients of all races and ethnicities still do not receive adequate treatment. Recent quality improvement trials for depression in primary care have shown improvements in outcomes; however, there is room for improvement, particularly for ethnic minority patients. Interventions focusing on patient-centeredness have documented benefits on patient adherence, patient satisfaction, and health outcomes. Yet, only a few recent quality improvement strategies for depression include patient-centered accommodations. We have created a patient-centered adaptation that includes many of the components of recent successful quality improvement interventions for depression in primary care. The proposed study compares a standard depression intervention for patients (delivered by a depression case manager) and physicians (review of guidelines and structured mental health consultation) to a patient-centered intervention for patients (incorporates patient activation, individual preferences, and cultural sensitivity) and physicians (incorporates participatory communication skills training with individualized feedback on interactive CD-ROM). Thirty physicians and 250 patients will be randomized to either the standard interventions or the culturally tailored interventions. The main hypothesis is that patients in the patient-centered, culturally tailored intervention group will have higher remission rates from depression and lower levels of depressive symptoms at 12 months than patients in the standard intervention care group. Secondary outcomes will include patient receipt of guideline concordant care, patient and physician satisfaction with care, patient-physician communication behaviors, patient and physician attitudes toward depression, and self-efficacy in managing depression. This study will add to knowledge about how to effectively engage African American patients in care of depression and serve as a prototype of how to incorporate patient-centeredness in programs to reduce racial and ethnic disparities in health care for common conditions.

"Web-based lab to study the decision to use antidepressants for the elderly    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposed project develops a web-based software application and survey containing both patient-case descriptions and questionnaire to facilitate research of patient race and the decision to use antidepressant treatment among the elderly. Results will direct further study and inform the development of interventions. The web-based application will be an online healthcare decision lab, supporting research for many years. The survey is essential to the ensuing research on patient race and antidepressant treatment. The project spans two years and has four specific aims. AIM 1 is software development: we design software that accurately measures response times, implements subliminal priming, and implements factorial surveys. The software also performs the standard tasks of governing the website and data collection. AIM 2 is develop a factorial representation of patient cases: we design patient cases as a factorial survey intended to vary in patient cues such that the probability of the treatment for depression spans the unit interval. The factorial survey is essential to the ensuing research. AIM 3 is develop physician questionnaire: we develop a questionnaire comprising questions regarding physician demographics, experience, and attitudes: the goal of this aim is to facilitate collection of physician information related to the decision to use AT, but keep the overall online survey to less than 40 minutes. AIM 4 is test overall feasibility: we test the online application of the survey to assure overall feasibility using a sample of family practice physicians. This is a test of all components including the sampling strategy and the web-based application. The goals of this test are a greater than 50% response rate and identification of physician characteristics that predict recruitment and dropout: essential information to the design of the subsequent study. Relevance: It is known that depression impacts the elderly, treatment differs by patient race, and physician decisions partially explain the disparity. It is not known why-a knowledge gap that must be filled to provide remedy. To know why, we must understand how patient race influences the decision-making of physicians at a cognitive level. The proposed project initiates a program that translates basic knowledge from psychology into clinically relevant research by developing the requisite methods and facility to answer the question of how patient race influences the decision to treat the elderly for depression.

"Moderated Mediational Model of Emergent Sex Differences in Adolescent Depression    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): One in four girls, compared to one in eight boys, is likely to warrant a diagnosis of Major Depressive Disorder by the time she finishes adolescence. What exactly causes these disturbing sex differences is at the center of decades of intense research and debate, yielding few definitive answers thus far. Recent support has emerged for Response Style Theory, positing that gender differences in rumination, or the tendency to perseverate about symptoms and causes of one's depression, may explain a large part of the these sex differences (Nolen-Hoeksema, 1994). The mechanisms by which rumination causes this gender disparity, however, are still unknown. This study proposes to test a new moderated mediational model of rumination in middle childhood and early adolescence to help explain the sex differences in prevalence rates of depression during adolescence. Our application examines how female gender identification may mediate the relation between sex and rumination, and how rumination may in turn mediate the link to depressive symptoms. Furthermore, we will look at how this model is moderated by the effects of age and pubertal development. We hypothesize that this mediational model will explain why the sex-depression link only becomes evident during adolescence, but not in childhood. Adding such a moderational component to the model will help explain why pre-pubertal girls and boys have similar rates of depression, but girls become more likely to develop depressive symptoms later on. We will administer questionnaires to 450 students, their parents, and their teachers in grades 4, 6 and 8 at three time points during the school year (approximately 3 months apart). We will use latent variable structural equation modeling (SEM) to test our mediational hypotheses and multi-group SEM to test our moderational hypotheses. By advancing our understanding of the emergent gender difference in depressive symptoms, we will contribute to knowledge about the etiology of depression for both males and females. This knowledge will enable clinicians to target high-risk youth for prevention and intervention programs and will facilitate the distribution of resources to those who need them most. This project dovetails nicely with the priority given to research on gender differences in adolescent depression by the Division of Pediatric Translational Research and Treatment Development.           ",Moderated Mediational Model of Emergent Sex Differences in Adolescent Depression,7329702,F31MH079670,"['Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Major Depressive Disorder ', ' major depression ', ' Etiology ', ' disease causation ', ' causation ', ' Causality ', ' Elements ', ' Emotions ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Cognitive ', ' Translational Research ', ' translation research enterprise ', ' translation research ', ' Translational Science ', ' Translational Research Enterprise ', ' Rate ', ' sex ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Adolescence ', ' teenage ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' Female ', ' Male Adolescents ', ' adolescent boy ', ' Adoption ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Gender Role ', ' Sex Roles ', ' Age ', ' Goals ', ' Adolescent ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Link ', ' teacher ', ' Childhood ', ' pediatric ', ' Early Intervention (Education) ', ' male ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Structural Models ', ' Parents ', ' Humulus ', ' Hops ', ' Questionnaires ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Schools ', ' Sex Characteristics ', ' sexual dimorphism (noncellular) ', ' gender difference ', ' Sex Differences ', ' Knowledge ', ' Students ', ' Testing ', ' Thinking, function ', ' thoughts ', ' Thinking ', ' Time ', ' Woman ', ' interest ', ' Equation ', ' age group ', ' success ', ' early childhood ', ' cohort ', ' intervention program ', ' skills ', ' Mediation ', ' Negotiation ', ' Negotiating ', ' Prevention ', ' Gender ', "" Women's Role "", ' Female Roles ', ' depressive symptoms ', ' depressive ', ' depression symptom ', ' Emotional Depression ', ' Mediating ', ' Modeling ', ' boys ', ' girls ', ' response ', ' Youth ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' theories ', ' age effect ', ' aging effect ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' coping ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' therapy development ', ' treatment development ', ' intervention development ', ' develop therapy ', ' ']",NIMH,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY,F31,2007,40662,0.07649429169102505
"PATHWAYS TO OVERCOMING DISPARITIES IN DEPRESSION    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This is a competing continuation for an NIMH R01 (Pathways to Outcomes of Care in Depression), which funded five-year follow-up of participants in Partners in Care, a group-level randomized trial of quality improvement interventions versus usual care for depression.  Our continuation proposes a new follow-up study in response to key findings from the existing grant:  1) Quality improvement interventions for depression had stronger effects on improving outcomes among minorities than whites during the active intervention period, despite similar effects on quality of care across ethnic groups; 2) by five-year follow-up, ethnic-related health outcome disparities apparent among controls were eliminated among intervention subjects.  We propose a 3-stage study of quality improvement (QI) effects on health outcome disparities:  1) Stage 1:  7-year follow-up of the full PIC sample (N=1182) to examine how initial QI affected intermediate outcomes such as concerns about stigma of depression; occurrence of life events; use of social supports; having a regular provider; use of appropriate treatments.  2) Stage 2: a qualitative study of the minority subjects, using a series of telephone interviews, to examine how subjects respond to depressive symptoms, stressful life events, and healthcare visits, in real time.  3) Stage 3: an ethnographically-based further follow-up of Latinos in Los Angeles, stratified by gender, intervention status and 7-year outcome, to learn more about how depressed patients are managing their lives within the context of their own environment.  Data from Stage 1 will be used to test hypotheses about QI effects on intermediate outcomes and differences in such effects for minorities and whites; data from Stages 2 and 3 will be used to confirm or refute findings from Stage 1, provide richer detail on pathways to outcome improvement, and generate hypotheses about mechanisms for outcome improvement among minorities.

"Depression-Diabetes Mechanisms: Urban African Americans DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  African-Americans have increased prevalence of both diabetes and diabetes complications, reflecting combined psychobehavioral and metabolic dysfunction. Depression may contribute to both the genesis of Type 2 diabetes, and difficulties in management; we find that many African-Americans with diabetes also have depression, that depression is a factor in nonadherence, and that nonadherence leads to poor glycemic control- a major cause of complications. (1) To establish the prevalence, socioecoloqic associates, and. qlycemic impact of depression, we will study patients presenting to the Grady Diabetes Clinic; evaluate socioeconomic status, literacy, and access to care; and relate depression to these factors and to metabolic control both at presentation and after one year of care. (2) To define the pathways through which depression contributes to metabolic imbalance, we will study patients exposed to progressive psychobehavioral challenge (depression and/or early life stress), and assess (a) hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal activation; (b) counter-regulatory hormones; and (c) immunoinflammatory cytokines; in relation to (d) insulin resistance. (3) To determine the psychobehavioral and neurohormonal mechanisms of treatment, we will conduct a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial: patients with depression will receive stress management videotapes and either placebo or the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) citalopram, and we will assess (a) overall glycemic control (HbAlc levels), and (b) patient adherence -to a prescribed diet/exercise program, to use of medications, and to scheduled return appointments; in relation to (c) depressive symptoms and (d) neurometabolic function as defined in Aim #2. These questions will be addressed by a multidisciplinary team with experience in both neuroendocrine analysis, clinical psychiatry, and diabetes management. The goal of this proposal is to use state-of-the-art psychobiological techniques to define the neurobehavioral and neurometabolic abnormalities and their response to treatment in urban African-Americans with type 2 diabetes and depression, as needed to improve basic understanding of disordered metabolism in this patient population and to help relieve their disparity in health.

"Treating Depression in African American Elders: A Community-Academic Partnership    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This application is in response to the NIH-NIMH program announcement (PAR-05-026) ""Community Participation in Research."" Based on a strong collaborative partnership between an academic research center at Thomas Jefferson University, and a senior center, Center in the Park (CIP), we plan to test the effectiveness of an in-home intervention to treat depression in 192 urban African American elders. Using a two group randomized trial, we will test a brief intervention that combines evidentiary components (depression education, stress reduction, referral, care management and behavioral activation) and mode of delivery (in-home) that resonate with the socio-cultural attributes of the target community. Participants will be enrolled from over 6,000 CIP members who screen positive for depressive symptoms. Study participants will be interviewed at baseline at home and then randomized to treatment or a wait-list control group. Participants in treatment will receive up to 10 in-home sessions from a CIP social worker while wait-list controls will receive usual care. All participants will be reassessed at 4 months by telephone (main trial endpoint) at which point wait-list controls will be offered the intervention and then all study participants will be reassessed at 8 months by telephone. Specific study aims are to: 1 )Test the immediate effect of the intervention at 4-months on depression (between group comparison); 2) Test the maintenance effect of the intervention at 8-months on depression (within group comparison); 3) Evaluate acceptability (social validity) of the intervention and engagement in targeted activities (experimental and wait-list control participants). A secondary aim will assess the feasibility of conducting a clinical trial embedded in a community setting and its dissemination using a community-academic partnership. Three exploratory aims will evaluate the mediational role of behavioral activation, differential treatment effects based on participant characteristics, and the effect of the intervention on quality of life domains. Health disparities coupled with unequal access to culturally relevant mental health treatments are consistently documented for older African Americans. Depression is a debilitating but treatable condition contributing to poor life quality. Our research will identify culturally-relevant depression treatment for African American elders, enhance service capacity of senior centers to treat depression in the community, and disseminate a replicable partnership model.             ",Treating Depression in African American Elders: A Community-Academic Partnership,7234998,R01MH079814,"['Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Symptoms ', ' End Point ', ' Caring ', ' stress management ', ' stress buffering ', ' Effectiveness of Interventions ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Rate ', ' Characteristics ', ' Behavioral ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' Age ', ' base ', ' Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Aged, 80 and over ', ' Oldest Old ', ' Aging ', ' Health ', ' Randomized Controlled Clinical Trials ', ' Interview ', ' Training ', ' Distress ', ' insight ', ' Long-Term Effects ', ' Longterm Effects ', ' Licensing ', ' Living Arrangement ', ' Maintenance ', ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Collaborations ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Philadelphia ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Condition ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' recruit ', ' Research ', ' Research Design ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Social Workers ', ' programs ', ' Stress ', ' Target Populations ', ' Telephone ', ' Phone ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Universities ', ' Waiting Lists ', ' day ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' Services ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' Participant ', ' member ', ' NIH Program Announcements ', ' Program Announcement ', ' Applied Research ', ' Applied Science ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' Gender ', ' Treatment outcome ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' depressive symptoms ', ' depressive ', ' depression symptom ', ' Emotional Depression ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' chronic disorder ', ' chronic disease/disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' clinical investigation ', ' Communities ', ' Community Participation ', ' Community Services ', ' early /brief intervention /therapy ', ' comparison group ', ' geriatric depression ', ' late life depression ', ' Elderly depression ', ' functional decline ', ' decline in function ', ' depression education ', ' depression outreach ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' Coupled ', ' community based service ', ' treatment effect ', ' community based participatory research ', ' aging population ', ' population aging ', ' Control Groups ', ' ']",NIMH,THOMAS JEFFERSON UNIVERSITY,R01,2007,538134,0.21064398028873774
"MUPS in Primary Care Research Center    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This is a request for funding a Developing Center for Intervention and Services Research (DCISR) in response to PAR 01-090. This new center will focus on patients who present in primary care with medically unexplained physical symptoms (MUPS). MUPS (e.g., unexplained pain, numbness, gastrointestinal symptoms) comprise a very common clinical presentation for disabling psychiatric disorders in primary care settings, such as depression and anxiety. The name of this new Developing Center will be the ""MUPS in Primary Care Research Center"" (MUPS-PCRC.) The center will build the necessary cores (e.g., operations, methods, training) and infrastructure for developing an innovative services research program in primary care concerning this population. Furthermore, the initial studies planned for the MUPS-PCRS will relate to lower socioeconomic status Latino and African-American patients, due to the well-documented disparities in mental health care for these populations. The faculty of MUPS-PCRS will also explore the effectiveness of a culturally- competent, collaborative stepped-care model for treating primary care patients with MUPS, while examining how patients, family members, physicians and behavioral health care specialists accept this model.  At least four pilot studies are planned, in consultation with an external advisory board of leading researchers, and apace with research infrastructure implementation. These studies will gather preliminary data on different stages of the collaborative stepped-care model. One study will focus on development and testing of specialized videos and other educational materials to be used in the first stage of the model, whereas another study will focus on the effectiveness of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) as a second stage treatment strategy and as a way to facilitate behavioral health care referrals. Two other studies concern alternative third-stage treatments for patients who do not respond well to CBT: a) heart rate variability biofeedback for the treatment of residual depression and somatic complaints; b) interpersonal therapy. The expectation is that preliminary data collected in the various studies conducted in the first few years of Center operations will inform the design and planning of several larger-scale investigator -initiated grant applications from MUPS-PCRC faculty and trainees.            ",MUPS in Primary Care Research Center,7271960,P20MH074634,"['Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Effectiveness ', ' low socioeconomic status ', ' low socioeconomic position ', ' low socio-economic status ', ' low socio-economic position ', ' Low income ', ' Environment ', ' Symptoms ', ' Caring ', ' Data ', ' Educational Materials ', ' Applications Grants ', ' Grant Proposals ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Pharmacological Treatment ', ' Training and Infrastructure ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Faculty ', ' Family ', ' base ', ' Grant ', ' improved ', ' Health Services Research ', ' services research ', ' Medical Care Research ', ' Healthcare Research ', ' Health Services Evaluation ', ' Health Care Research ', ' Heart Rate ', ' Cardiac Chronotropism ', ' Site ', ' Clinical ', ' Residual state ', ' Residual ', ' Medical ', ' Learning ', ' Individual ', ' Numbers ', ' Funding ', ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' health care referral ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' Names ', ' Numbness ', ' Loss of Sensation ', ' Pain ', ' Painful ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Primary Care Physician ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Primary Care ', ' Staging ', ' Psychiatrist ', ' Anxiety ', ' Condition ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Testing ', ' gastrointestinal symptom ', ' Work ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' Mental disorders ', ' psychological disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' surgery ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Biofeedback ', ' Services ', ' expectation ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Family member ', ' Latino ', ' Modeling ', ' Specialist ', ' behavioral health ', ' response ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Cognitive Therapy ', ' cognitive behavioral treatment ', ' cognitive behavioral therapy ', ' cognitive behavioral modification ', ' cognitive behavioral intervention ', ' cognitive behavior therapy ', ' cognitive behavior modification ', ' cognitive behavior intervention ', ' Cognitive Psychotherapy ', ' Cognition Therapy ', ' Communities ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' interpersonal therapy ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' Consultations ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIV OF MED/DENT NJ-R W JOHNSON MED SCH,P20,2007,554703,0.0446672038191997
"Improving CLTC System Response to Late Life Depression   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In response to NIMH PAR-03-078, ""From intervention development to services: Exploratory Research Grants"" (R34), we seek support to develop a system-level intervention for improving care for depressed older adults who receive publicly funded community long-term care (CLTC) services. Our goal is to develop a system improvement that is acceptable to and can be sustained in public CLTC. We will employ a staged model for intervention development drawing on both published research (global knowledge) and local knowledge of the system of care accrued through our 8 years of clinical epidemiological and service systems research. Specific Aims are to (1) Consolidate global knowledge (from published studies) and local knowledge (gained from prior work in the CLTC system) about (a) depression prevalence, course, and comorbidities; (b) stakeholder preferences for depression treatment, and (c) CLTC resources for responding to depression for purposes of deriving implications for intervention; (2) Engage an expert panel to use this knowledge to specify an intervention, ""Assess, Link, and Support,"" to improve depression care in CLTC; (3) Develop treatment and training manuals; (4) Develop tracking methods for client and system outcomes; and (5) Assess the feasibility, acceptability, and appropriateness of the intervention and collect preliminary data for a subsequent effectiveness study. Quality improvement and organizational complexity theories inform the model of intervention development. Employing behavior aggregation methods, we will convene a multidisciplinary panel of local and national experts to vet a proposed intervention, specific ingredients which are based on theories of competing demands, the gateway filter linkage model, and motivational enhancement-readiness to change. This intervention development effort is responsive to recommendations of the President's New Freedom Commission Report on Mental Health (2003) to institute mental health screening and early intervention programs in public health and human services. Improving depression care through CLTC can extend mental health treatment to socially and economically disadvantaged elders, who historically have underutilized specialty mental health care. We will follow this work by an R01 study to test the intervention's effectiveness rigorously.                    ",Improving CLTC System Response to Late Life Depression,7285274,R34MH071632,"['Low income ', ' Environment ', ' Address ', ' Caring ', ' Data ', ' Effectiveness of Interventions ', ' Social Health Services ', ' Translational Research ', ' translation research enterprise ', ' translation research ', ' Translational Science ', ' Translational Research Enterprise ', ' Principal Investigator ', ' To specify ', ' Process ', ' Freedom ', ' Liberty ', ' base ', ' Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Goals ', ' Aging ', ' improved ', ' Health ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Man (Taxonomy) ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Medical ', ' Link ', ' Institute of Medicine (U.S.) ', ' NAS/IOM ', ' Institute of Medicine ', ' Institutes ', ' Ensure ', ' Screening procedure ', ' screenings ', ' screening ', ' Training ', ' disability ', ' Individual ', ' Numbers ', ' Recovery ', ' Long-Term Care ', ' extended care ', ' Policies ', ' Early Intervention (Education) ', ' Funding ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' uptake ', ' Manuals ', ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health Services ', ' Mental Hygiene Services ', ' Methods ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' Missouri ', ' Persons ', ' National Institute of Mental Health (U.S.) ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' NIMH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' Patients ', ' Plague ', ' Yersinia pestis disease ', ' Primary Care Physician ', ' Staging ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' Public Sector ', ' Publishing ', ' Depressed mood ', ' sadness ', ' depressed ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Condition ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Stigmata ', ' Research Priority ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' medical specialties ', ' Specialty ', ' Tail ', ' Testing ', ' Treatment Protocols ', ' Treatment Schedule ', ' Treatment Regimen ', ' Work ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' System ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' Behavior ', ' Mental disorders ', ' psychological disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Mood Disorders ', ' Affective Disorders ', ' Services ', ' preference ', ' Surgeon ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' intervention program ', ' NIH Program Announcements ', ' Program Announcement ', ' Reporting ', ' Measures ', ' Regulation ', ' Administrator ', ' Managed Care ', ' Modeling ', ' Specialist ', ' Quality of Care ', ' QOC ', ' response ', ' social stigma ', ' stigma ', ' theories ', ' functional disability ', ' Functional impairment ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Client ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' Comorbidity ', ' co-morbidity ', ' geriatric depression ', ' late life depression ', ' Elderly depression ', ' caregiving ', ' care giving ', ' care systems ', ' systems research ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' safety net ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' Early treatment ', ' early therapy ', ' early intervention ', ' collaborative care ', ' therapy development ', ' treatment development ', ' intervention development ', ' develop therapy ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' Provider ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Binding (Molecular Function) ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' Binding ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Purpose ', ' Geographic state ', ' US State ', ' Readiness ', ' Preparedness ', ' ']",NIMH,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R34,2007,267413,0.10522693400854813
"Troubled Minds, Broken Hearts: Women, Depression and Myocardial Infarction    DESCRIPTION (provided by Applicant):  US Public Health Service's Healthy People 2010 initiative has highlighted the need for a greater research focus on remedying the race and gender disparity in mental health and outcome of coronary heart disease (CHD). While CHD mortality has declined among men, it has continued to increase among women, claiming the lives of more than half a million women every year. Depression predicts adverse outcomes after myocardial infarction (Ml) and is far more prevalent among women than men post-MI. Therefore, it is possible that depression is an important determinant of women's poorer prognosis post-MI. However, there is limited information on this issue.      There is also paucity of clinical trials examining pharmacological treatment of depression in post-MI patients. Since African-Americans have a major burden of unmet mental health needs, it is relevant to conduct such a trial in an African-American population. Accordingly, the specific aims for the research plan are: 1) to examine to what extent depression accounts for women's higher rates of adverse outcomes post-MI; 2) to determine whether the association between depression and outcome is the same or differs in men and women; and 3) to examine, in a preliminary fashion, the efficacy of drug treatment of depression in improving outcome in post-MI men and women in a predominantly African-American patient population. This study will be conducted in collaboration with the General Clinical Research Center (GCRC) at Emory.      If successful, our study will advance understanding of the factors associated with the poorer outcome after Ml and provide novel effective ways to improve outcomes in women, as well as in men. Our study has the potential to demonstrate that treatment of depression improves outcomes after Ml and contribute to remedying race and gender differences in outcomes of Ml patients.   The environment is ideal for the proposed career development. Emory University has an established infrastructure through NIH K30 and K12 programs and GCRC for career development of clinical investigators and is home to several original research projects on CHD. The Lead Mentor and Advisory Committee members are expert clinical investigators with commitment to fostering the candidate's career development.      The candidate's long term goal is to become an independent patient-oriented investigator focusing on the role of psychological, behavioral and biological factors that influence cardiovascular disease (CVD) outcomes and the impact of novel interventions on eliminating disparity in outcomes. To meet these goals, the proposed individualized multidisciplinary career development plan integrates training in mentored patient-oriented research, advanced statistical, epidemiological and behavioral research methods, and collaboration with GCRC and CVD outcomes researchers both at Emory and other national institutions.

"Women Physical Disability and Depression: Communities Responding Now! Rates of depression and suicide in women with physical disabilities (WPD) are up to five times higher than in the general population.  Despite this disparity, few intervention studies that address the specific needs of this population are available.  To begin to address objective 6-3 of Healthy People 2010 and reduce the proportion of WPD who experience depressive symptoms, interventions relevant to the lives of WPD are urgently needed.  In keeping with national priorities and the need for consumer participation in the development of mental health therapies, the proposed project will use an existing cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) intervention that has demonstrated effectiveness in reducing depressive symptoms in women as a starting point from which to co-create an intervention that addresses the specific needs of WPD. The co-creation process will occur in the context of a partnership between the investigators, WPD in the community, and three Oregon Centers for Independent Living (CILs).  This partnership will be expanded to include four additional Oregon CILs during the last year of the proposed project for the purpose of developing a peer mentored train-the-trainer program that will facilitate consumer control and promote the sustainability of the intervention. The specific aims of the proposed project are to:  1.  Modify an existing cognitive behavioral group therapy intervention to address the specific needs of WPD who experience depressive symptoms; 2. Conduct an efficacy trial using a mixed-methods approach.  The proposed study outcomes were derived from our previous work with WPD as well as from members of the disability community.  An efficacy trial of the modified intervention with a total of 135 participants will be conducted using a wait list control design; and 3.  Develop a peer mentored train-the-trainer program to facilitate consumer control and promote the sustainability of the intervention.  A long-term goal of the proposed project is to increase the capacity of CILs across the country to offer a relevant, effective, accessible, and affordable intervention to help WPD with depression overcome this debilitating secondary condition.

"Web-based lab to study the decision to use antidepressants for the elderly    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposed project develops a web-based software application and survey containing both patient-case descriptions and questionnaire to facilitate research of patient race and the decision to use antidepressant treatment among the elderly. Results will direct further study and inform the development of interventions. The web-based application will be an online healthcare decision lab, supporting research for many years. The survey is essential to the ensuing research on patient race and antidepressant treatment. The project spans two years and has four specific aims. AIM 1 is software development: we design software that accurately measures response times, implements subliminal priming, and implements factorial surveys. The software also performs the standard tasks of governing the website and data collection. AIM 2 is develop a factorial representation of patient cases: we design patient cases as a factorial survey intended to vary in patient cues such that the probability of the treatment for depression spans the unit interval. The factorial survey is essential to the ensuing research. AIM 3 is develop physician questionnaire: we develop a questionnaire comprising questions regarding physician demographics, experience, and attitudes: the goal of this aim is to facilitate collection of physician information related to the decision to use AT, but keep the overall online survey to less than 40 minutes. AIM 4 is test overall feasibility: we test the online application of the survey to assure overall feasibility using a sample of family practice physicians. This is a test of all components including the sampling strategy and the web-based application. The goals of this test are a greater than 50% response rate and identification of physician characteristics that predict recruitment and dropout: essential information to the design of the subsequent study. Relevance: It is known that depression impacts the elderly, treatment differs by patient race, and physician decisions partially explain the disparity. It is not known why-a knowledge gap that must be filled to provide remedy. To know why, we must understand how patient race influences the decision-making of physicians at a cognitive level. The proposed project initiates a program that translates basic knowledge from psychology into clinically relevant research by developing the requisite methods and facility to answer the question of how patient race influences the decision to treat the elderly for depression.

The proposed project initiates a program that translates basic knowledge from psychology into clinically relevant research by developing the requisite methods and facility to answer the question of how patient race influences the decision to treat the elderly for depression.          ",Web-based lab to study the decision to use antidepressants for the elderly,7497098,R21MH075907,"['Decision Making ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Dropout ', ' Address ', ' Family Physicians ', ' Range ', ' Cognitive ', ' Collection ', ' Rate ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Family Practice ', ' family medicine ', ' Support of Research ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Future ', ' Standards of Weights and Measures ', ' base ', ' Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Clinical ', ' Specific qualifier value ', ' Specified ', ' Phase ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Judgment ', ' Measurement ', ' Methods ', ' Internet ', ' world wide web ', ' web ', ' WWW ', ' Respondent ', ' Online Systems ', ' web based ', ' online computer ', ' On-Line Systems ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Antidepressive Agents ', ' Antidepressants ', ' Antidepressant Drugs ', ' Antidepressant Agent ', ' Probability ', ' Staging ', ' Psychology ', ' Questionnaires ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Reaction Time ', ' psychomotor reaction time ', ' Response Time ', ' Response RT ', ' Research ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Computer software ', ' computer program/software ', ' Software ', ' Software Design ', ' Designing computer software ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Testing ', ' Translating ', ' Attitude ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' novel ', ' Mediation ', ' Negotiation ', ' Negotiating ', ' research study ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' Laboratory Study ', ' Human Resources ', ' personnel ', ' Manpower ', ' Measures ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' Uncertainty ', ' doubt ', ' software development ', ' developing computer software ', ' develop software ', ' time interval ', ' Academy ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Client ', ' geriatric depression ', ' late life depression ', ' Elderly depression ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' clinically relevant ', ' clinical relevance ', ' demographics ', ' therapy development ', ' treatment development ', ' intervention development ', ' develop therapy ', ' Computers ', ' Cues ', ' Data Collection ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF ROCHESTER,R21,2008,167861,0.07018637110966988
"Troubled Minds, Broken Hearts: Women, Depression and Myocardial Infarction    DESCRIPTION (provided by Applicant):  US Public Health Service's Healthy People 2010 initiative has highlighted the need for a greater research focus on remedying the race and gender disparity in mental health and outcome of coronary heart disease (CHD). While CHD mortality has declined among men, it has continued to increase among women, claiming the lives of more than half a million women every year. Depression predicts adverse outcomes after myocardial infarction (Ml) and is far more prevalent among women than men post-MI. Therefore, it is possible that depression is an important determinant of women's poorer prognosis post-MI. However, there is limited information on this issue.      There is also paucity of clinical trials examining pharmacological treatment of depression in post-MI patients. Since African-Americans have a major burden of unmet mental health needs, it is relevant to conduct such a trial in an African-American population. Accordingly, the specific aims for the research plan are: 1) to examine to what extent depression accounts for women's higher rates of adverse outcomes post-MI; 2) to determine whether the association between depression and outcome is the same or differs in men and women; and 3) to examine, in a preliminary fashion, the efficacy of drug treatment of depression in improving outcome in post-MI men and women in a predominantly African-American patient population. This study will be conducted in collaboration with the General Clinical Research Center (GCRC) at Emory.      If successful, our study will advance understanding of the factors associated with the poorer outcome after Ml and provide novel effective ways to improve outcomes in women, as well as in men. Our study has the potential to demonstrate that treatment of depression improves outcomes after Ml and contribute to remedying race and gender differences in outcomes of Ml patients.   The environment is ideal for the proposed career development. Emory University has an established infrastructure through NIH K30 and K12 programs and GCRC for career development of clinical investigators and is home to several original research projects on CHD. The Lead Mentor and Advisory Committee members are expert clinical investigators with commitment to fostering the candidate's career development.      The candidate's long term goal is to become an independent patient-oriented investigator focusing on the role of psychological, behavioral and biological factors that influence cardiovascular disease (CVD) outcomes and the impact of novel interventions on eliminating disparity in outcomes. To meet these goals, the proposed individualized multidisciplinary career development plan integrates training in mentored patient-oriented research, advanced statistical, epidemiological and behavioral research methods, and collaboration with GCRC and CVD outcomes researchers both at Emory and other national institutions.

"Maternal depression and child weight: Early pathways    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Childhood overweight is one of the most important health issues of our times, given their burden to individual lives and society as a whole. It is possible that maternal depression has a significant impact at overweight in childhood. This application aims to examine the relationship between maternal depression and weight change during childhood and systematically investigate possible mechanisms explaining this relationship. We propose to conduct secondary data analysis of the Fragile Families (FF) Study and the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study - Kindergarten (ECLS-K), which collected longitudinal information about maternal depression and overweight in childhood in national samples of children. In the FF study, information is available from birth to three years (three waves) (estimated N=2,355) and in the ECLS-K, from pre-K to 5th grade (5 waves) (estimated N=8,818). Maternal depression was measured, in the FF study, using a screening for DSM-IV major depressive disorder (the CIDI short form), and in the ECLS-K, by a brief version of a widely used depression scale (ECD-S). The specific aims of the proposed analysis are to examine: (I) the relationship between maternal depression and weight during different phases of childhood; (II) the role of social or racial/ethnic disparities in childhood weight in explaining the relationship of interest; and (III) specific prevention/treatment relevant mechanisms, including poor dietary practices and lack of physical activity that may account for the relationship of interest. Data will be analyzed using longitudinal multivariate statistical regression analysis techniques and structured equation modeling, controlling for important correlates. Understanding mechanisms explaining the relationship between maternal depression and overweight in childhood offers great potential to inform prevention and treatment of childhood obesity. Given the limited effectiveness of treatment for weight problems, elucidating this significant pathways will provide important information for developing new preventive interventions.             ",Maternal depression and child weight: Early pathways,7482206,R21HD056170,"['Phase ', ' Adolescent ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Low Birth Weight Infant ', ' low birthweight ', ' low birth weight infant human ', ' low birth weight ', ' Screening procedure ', ' screenings ', ' screening ', ' DSM-IV ', ' Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-IV ', ' Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th edition ', ' DSM4 ', ' Physical activity ', ' Childhood ', ' pediatric ', ' Individual ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' Policies ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' Obesity ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Condition ', ' Regression Analysis ', ' Statistical Regression ', ' Regression Diagnostics ', ' Regression Analyses ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Societies ', ' Consensus ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' statistics ', ' Time ', ' Attention ', ' Weight ', ' Techniques ', ' Behavior ', ' Overweight ', ' Over weight ', ' behavior change ', ' interest ', ' Equation ', ' Birth ', ' Parturition ', ' Body Weight Changes ', ' Weight Change ', ' early childhood ', ' Structure ', ' Prevention ', ' social ', ' Measures ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Treatment Effectiveness ', ' response ', ' Accounting ', ' Minority ', ' Population ', ' maternal depression ', ' depressed mother ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' racial/ethnic ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Decision Making ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Diet ', ' Major Depressive Disorder ', ' major depression ', ' Low income ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Address ', ' Epidemic ', ' Preventive ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Dietary Practices ', ' dietary pattern ', ' Predictive Value ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Family ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' Family Study ', ' ']",NICHD,NEW YORK STATE PSYCHIATRIC INSTITUTE,R21,2008,199354,0.08491343616014771
"Treating Depression in African American Elders: A Community-Academic Partnership    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This application is in response to the NIH-NIMH program announcement (PAR-05-026) ""Community Participation in Research."" Based on a strong collaborative partnership between an academic research center at Thomas Jefferson University, and a senior center, Center in the Park (CIP), we plan to test the effectiveness of an in-home intervention to treat depression in 192 urban African American elders. Using a two group randomized trial, we will test a brief intervention that combines evidentiary components (depression education, stress reduction, referral, care management and behavioral activation) and mode of delivery (in-home) that resonate with the socio-cultural attributes of the target community. Participants will be enrolled from over 6,000 CIP members who screen positive for depressive symptoms. Study participants will be interviewed at baseline at home and then randomized to treatment or a wait-list control group. Participants in treatment will receive up to 10 in-home sessions from a CIP social worker while wait-list controls will receive usual care. All participants will be reassessed at 4 months by telephone (main trial endpoint) at which point wait-list controls will be offered the intervention and then all study participants will be reassessed at 8 months by telephone. Specific study aims are to: 1 )Test the immediate effect of the intervention at 4-months on depression (between group comparison); 2) Test the maintenance effect of the intervention at 8-months on depression (within group comparison); 3) Evaluate acceptability (social validity) of the intervention and engagement in targeted activities (experimental and wait-list control participants). A secondary aim will assess the feasibility of conducting a clinical trial embedded in a community setting and its dissemination using a community-academic partnership. Three exploratory aims will evaluate the mediational role of behavioral activation, differential treatment effects based on participant characteristics, and the effect of the intervention on quality of life domains. Health disparities coupled with unequal access to culturally relevant mental health treatments are consistently documented for older African Americans. Depression is a debilitating but treatable condition contributing to poor life quality. Our research will identify culturally-relevant depression treatment for African American elders, enhance service capacity of senior centers to treat depression in the community, and disseminate a replicable partnership model.             ",Treating Depression in African American Elders: A Community-Academic Partnership,7434464,R01MH079814,"['comparison group ', ' geriatric depression ', ' late life depression ', ' Elderly depression ', ' functional decline ', ' decline in function ', ' depression education ', ' depression outreach ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' Coupled ', ' community based service ', ' treatment effect ', ' community based participatory research ', ' aging population ', ' population aging ', ' Control Groups ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Symptoms ', ' End Point ', ' Caring ', ' stress management ', ' stress buffering ', ' Effectiveness of Interventions ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Rate ', ' Characteristics ', ' Behavioral ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' Age ', ' base ', ' Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Aged, 80 and over ', ' Oldest Old ', ' Aging ', ' Health ', ' Randomized Controlled Clinical Trials ', ' Interview ', ' Training ', ' Distress ', ' insight ', ' Long-Term Effects ', ' Longterm Effects ', ' Licensing ', ' Living Arrangement ', ' Maintenance ', ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Collaborations ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Philadelphia ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Condition ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' recruit ', ' Research ', ' Research Design ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Social Workers ', ' programs ', ' Stress ', ' Target Populations ', ' Telephone ', ' Phone ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Universities ', ' Waiting Lists ', ' day ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' Services ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' Participant ', ' member ', ' NIH Program Announcements ', ' Program Announcement ', ' Applied Research ', ' Applied Science ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' Gender ', ' Treatment outcome ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' depressive symptoms ', ' depressive ', ' depression symptom ', ' Emotional Depression ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' chronic disorder ', ' chronic disease/disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' clinical investigation ', ' Communities ', ' Community Participation ', ' Community Services ', ' early /brief intervention /therapy ', ' ']",NIMH,THOMAS JEFFERSON UNIVERSITY,R01,2008,584113,0.21064398028873774
"CBPR to Improve Depression Care for African-American Domestic Violence Survivors    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Few mental health treatment programs specifically address the complex needs of African American (AA) abuse survivors. We plan to use CBPR to develop and test a community-based multi-faceted intervention to reduce depression disparities in African American women who experienced IPV. The purpose of the proposal is to strengthen our community-academic partnership and to acquire the skills, tools and preliminary data necessary to conduct a large scale controlled trial. Our partnership consists of African American IPV survivors, community leaders, domestic violence advocates, mental health providers and researchers who have been working together to understand the beliefs and needs of depressed African American IPV survivors. We are now developing a depression care model based within the Healing Roots center, a community-based African American domestic violence program. Our intervention incorporates many of the same principles included in the heath system based Chronic Care Model but it places the community and its resources at the core of the program. African American domestic violence advocates will serve in a similar role to that of care managers, providing care coordination and patient education. They will link IPV survivors into the health care system and empower them to have more effective interactions with both onsite and clinic based providers. Advocates will use motivational interviewing techniques to help women make changes they wish to make in a culturally appropriate manner. Finally, we will incorporate creative arts-based programs as a way to recruit and retain women who might otherwise be hesitant to access mental heath services or recognize their IPV. We will strengthen the partnership between our academic and community groups, build capacity from CBPR among all members, and monitor the success of the process. We will adapt, prioritize and pilot test our intervention to assess its feasibility and acceptability and collect preliminary effectiveness data. Moreover, we will engage the community in designing and preparing an acceptable large-scale intervention study. Our project is strongly grounded in principles of Empowerment theory on both micro and macro levels. On an individual level our project will empower women to address violence in their relationships, to use self-management support tools and self-care practices to control their depression, and to become involved informed consumers of mental health services. At the community level, the project will enable community members to partner with researchers to design and conduct research that is relevant to their needs and respectful of their expertise, which leaves long lasting resources in place and leads directly to social change.           ",CBPR to Improve Depression Care for African-American Domestic Violence Survivors,7532384,R21MH082139,"['Provider ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Purpose ', ' Address ', ' Caring ', ' Advocate ', ' Data ', ' Monitor ', ' Process ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Health Personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Left ', ' Healed ', ' Domestic Violence ', ' Survivors ', ' Link ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' interventions research ', ' intervention research ', ' Psyche structure ', ' mental ', ' Individual ', ' Plant Roots ', ' root ', ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health Services ', ' Mental Hygiene Services ', ' Patient Education ', ' Patient Training ', ' Patient Instruction ', ' tool ', ' Depressed mood ', ' sadness ', ' depressed ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' recruit ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Self Care ', ' personal care ', ' Social Change ', ' Social transformation ', ' Social modification ', ' programs ', ' Arts ', ' Testing ', ' Violence ', ' violent behavior ', ' violent ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Complex ', ' Clinic ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' Belief ', ' Services ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' skills ', ' treatment program ', ' member ', ' motivational enhancement therapy ', ' motivational interview ', ' Case Manager ', ' Case Management Nurse ', ' Care Manager ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Self Management ', ' Modeling ', ' theories ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Communities ', ' healing ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' chronic care model ', ' ']",NIMH,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,R21,2008,169852,0.0482678324740185
"Antepartum Interpersonal Psychotherapy at 3 NYC Sites    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The 10-13% prevalence of Antepartum Depression (APD) increases 2 fold in women with poor social supports, low socioeconomic status (SES) and negative life events. APD causes low birth weight, prematurity and eclampsia. APD is one of the best predictors of postpartum depression (PPD), which in turn causes impaired infant and childhood emotional and cognitive development. Therefore, treating APD is a method of primary and secondary prevention by treating parents of children at risk. Yet, there are no treatment guidelines for antepartum depression. This application is based on findings from a previous bilingual controlled clinical trial of Interpersonal Psychotherapy adapted for APD (IPT-P). The mood of the IPT-P treatment group significantly improved on all mood scores compared to a matched Parenting Education Program (PEP) control with the same duration, frequency and intensity of contact as the treatment group. This study sample was comprised of a majority of indigent Spanish speaking immigrant women with multiple psychosocial and financial stressors. Because of the small sample size, there was no information on the relationship of  demographic variables such as race and SES to treatment feasibility, prognosis and attachment. Data from the National Comorbidity Study illustrated that effects of ethnicity and race must be examined in the context of SES and psychosocial variables in order to determine disparities in care and treatment outcome. In the proposed trial, a larger more diverse sample (N=150) of women from 3 different sites in New York City will provide enough power to generalize findings and determine the relationship of subgroup variables such as race/ethnicity and SES to treatment feasibility, motherhood and  attachment. 3 sites (New York State Psychiatric Institute/New York Presbyterian Hospital at Columbia, New York Presbyterian Hospital at Cornell and St. Luke's Roosevelt hospital) will provide equal proportions of Latina, African American and White depressed pregnant women. Each subject will be randomized to 12 weeks of IPT-P or PEP, then followed for 6 months postpartum to determine if the IPT-P is more effective in reducing depression, preventing PPD and improving maternal infant attachment. Co-investigators are maternal fetal medicine faculty from respective sites who will be primary liaison to the respective departments of obstetrics and provide clinical obstetrical needs of the study.

"Telepsychiatry & Culturally Sensitive Treatment of Depressed Asian Americans    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Asian Americans tend to underutilize mental health services compared to other ethnic groups, with delayed treatment and higher attrition rates (Kung, 2003). When suffering from symptoms of mental illnesses, many underserved Chinese Americans seek help from their primary care physicians (PCPs) (Yeung et al., 2004a). In 2003, the applicant received a Career Development Award to study the effectiveness of Culturally Sensitive Collaborative Treatment (CSCT) for the treatment of underserved Chinese Americans with major depressive disorder (MDD) in primary care. The key elements of CSCT are active screening to increase recognition of depressed patients, culturally sensitive consultation by a psychiatrist and care management. Preliminary findings show that CSCT improves case recognition, facilitates engagement, and decreases the disparities of treatment among underserved Chinese Americans with MDD (Yeung et al., 2006; Yeung, 2007). This proposed study will investigate the feasibility and effectiveness of using Telepsychiatry-based CSCT (T-CSCT) to extend the CSCT model to underserved Chinese Americans in remote clinics. The specific aims of this study are: 1) To investigate whether telepsychiatry consultation is acceptable to underserved Chinese Americans with MDD and to their PCPs, and 2) To investigate the effectiveness of T-CSCT on improving treatment outcomes of underserved Chinese Americans with MDD in remote clinics. Subjects will be recruited by depression screening in primary care clinics and by advertisements to promote depression self-screening. Two hundred underserved Chinese American patients who screen positive for MDD will be randomized to receive either T-CSCT or Usual Care (UC). Treatment outcomes of patients in these two groups will be compared. This study will examine the acceptability and effectiveness of telepsychiatry- based culturally sensitive psychiatric treatment for underserved Chinese Americans with major depressive disorder. The goal is to increase access to mental health services and to decrease disparities in the treatment of depression among ethnic minority patients.          ",Telepsychiatry & Culturally Sensitive Treatment of Depressed Asian Americans,7525071,R01MH079831,"['Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Major Depressive Disorder ', ' major depression ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Elements ', ' Videoconferencing ', ' Videoconferences ', ' Symptoms ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Caring ', ' Adherence (attribute) ', ' Adherence ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' K-Series Research Career Programs ', ' Research Career Program ', ' K-Awards ', ' Career Development Programs K-Series ', ' Career Development Awards and Programs ', ' Career Development Awards ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Chinese People ', ' Chinese ', ' Rate ', ' Telemedicine ', ' Health Professional ', ' Healthcare professional ', ' Health Care Professional ', ' base ', ' Goals ', ' improved ', ' Health ', ' Psychiatric therapeutic procedure ', ' psychiatric treatment ', ' psychiatric therapy ', ' psychiatric care ', ' Interview ', ' Screening procedure ', ' screenings ', ' screening ', ' insanity ', ' satisfaction ', ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health Services ', ' Mental Hygiene Services ', ' Patients ', ' Primary Care Physician ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Primary Care ', ' Psychiatrist ', ' Questionnaires ', ' Depressed mood ', ' sadness ', ' depressed ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' recruit ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Appendix ', ' Psychiatric Diagnosis ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Stigmatization ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Asian Americans ', ' Translating ', ' Use Effectiveness ', ' Work ', ' Clinic ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' Distant ', ' Pattern ', ' Mental disorders ', ' psychological disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Familiarity ', ' Manuscripts ', ' help-seeking behavior ', ' help seeking ', ' outreach ', ' Case Manager ', ' Case Management Nurse ', ' Care Manager ', ' sensitivity training ', ' Depression screen ', ' depression screening ', ' Chinese American ', ' Treatment outcome ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' chronic disorder ', ' chronic disease/disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Modeling ', ' Specialist ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Acculturation ', ' Cultural Assimilation ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' Advertisements ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' Consultations ', ' ']",NIMH,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R01,2008,356231,0.043059893616054584
"Chronic Illness & Minor Depression: Community and CDSMP    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Minor depression alone and its co-occurrence with chronic diseases are under- recognized, under-treated and understudied. This proposed study uses theoretically driven mixed methodologies to understand key barriers and facilitators for the successful translation of an evidence-based intervention (EBI) - chronic disease self management programs (CDSMP) - into community settings for underserved Latinos who suffer from minor depression and co- occurring chronic disease. We have chosen CDSMP because of its strong evidence base and its ability to be delivered by lay health workers in various settings and reduce health disparities. New data show that minor depression exerts large costs, increases mortality when present in cardiac disease, and is not responsive to most interventions that are effective for major depression. This proposed study is aligned with CDC's performance goal to support prevention research to develop sustainable and transferable community-based behavioral interventions. We propose to partner with two community partners - Hispanic Service Council and Familia Sana and use ongoing funded community-based participatory research (CBPR) efforts for a three-phase study. This partnership will drive the understanding of important barriers and facilitators that need to be addressed for the successful adaptation of this EBI - that is, to make it contextually relevant, keep it effective and meet primary stakeholders' needs. In Hillsborough County area where we wish to do this work, the Latino population is over 20% and huge gaps in general and mental health services exist. The specific aims of this project are to: identify key stakeholder perspectives on multi- dimensional barriers and facilitators to the adoption of CDSMP into community settings; employ mixed methods to adapt CDSMP to best address those priority needs; and test the feasibility of implementing the adapted CDSMP using a lagged intervention design with outcome measurements over months, to estimate intervention parameters in preparation for a future large scale cross-county implementation study. This research is exceptionally relevant to public health because it seeks to improve health and functioning outcomes in a poor minority population that suffers from an important, highly prevalent and disabling condition - minor depression that co-occurs with chronic diseases - using community engagement for the adaptation, implementation and sustainability of an EBI.     Project Narrative  This research is exceptionally relevant to public health because it seeks to improve health and functioning outcomes in a poor minority population that suffers from an important, highly prevalent and disabling condition - minor depression that co-occurs with chronic diseases - using community engagement for the adaptation, implementation and sustainability of an EBI.",Chronic Illness & Minor Depression: Community and CDSMP,7620688,R18MN000004,[''],ODCDC,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH FLORIDA,R18,2008,435505,0.13383863377822755
"Reducing Disparities in Depression Care for Ethnically Diverse Older Men    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The epidemic of suicide among older (i.e. age 60 and above) men in the US is a public health crisis. Older men have eight to ten-times higher rates of completed suicide than older women. Because depression is one of the strongest risk factors for suicide, improving care for depression in primary settings is a vital public health strategy to prevent suicide and other adverse outcomes of depression. Depression is more common in women than in men, but depressed older men and minorities are less likely to receive effective treatment. To address this knowledge gap and reduce disparities in older men and minorities, we propose a study that applies both qualitative and quantitative methods to better understand the perspectives, experiences, and preferences for care of ethnically diverse depressed older men and the primary care providers who treat them. Our focus gender-specific focus and attention to age-related factors will enable us to examine potentially important but under-studied variability among older men in how they experience and deal with their depression and will allow us to further develop our conceptual model and to develop strategies to engage more difficult to reach subgroups of diverse older men. Primary care is a logical site for this research because it is the setting where most depressed older men can potentially be recognized and treated. We will conduct systematic screening to identify a representative sample of 100 older men (50 Mexican-American and 50 white non- Hispanic) older men with treated and untreated clinical depression from primary care clinics in two cities and then conduct interviews with them and their primary care physicians (n = 48). This proposal's aims are 1) to examine how forms of masculinity and age-related changes and attitudes (i.e. health status, major role transitions, conceptions of normal aging) influence men's depression illness meanings, experience, and patterns of help-seeking, 2) to systematically examine older men's preferences for depression treatment, and 3) to identify factors that impede or facilitate depression care from the perspectives of primary care physicians. This proposal brings together an interdisciplinary group of investigators with extensive experience in working with older and minority populations and builds directly on published preliminary data (Hinton et al, 2006). It is the intention of this proposal to generate empirical data to help close the gender and ethnic gap in depression care, reduce associated health disparities, and mitigate high suicide rates in older men. Because depression is one of the strongest risk factors for suicide and because men who kill themselves frequently have had recent prior contact with their primary care physicians, improving care for depression in primary care settings is a vital public health strategy to prevent suicide and other adverse outcomes of depression. Depressed older men, however, are significantly less likely than women to receive effective depression treatment. Despite its public health importance, the barriers to depression care for older men are not well understood. Through a focused and in-depth examination of the perspectives and preferences of depressed older men and their primary care providers, this research will generate empirical data to reduce barriers to depression care for older men in primary care settings.          ",Reducing Disparities in Depression Care for Ethnically Diverse Older Men,7372390,R01MH080067,"['Publishing ', ' Depressed mood ', ' sadness ', ' depressed ', ' Condition ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Sex Characteristics ', ' sexual dimorphism (noncellular) ', ' gender difference ', ' Sex Differences ', ' Sick Role ', ' Illness Behavior ', ' Social Sciences ', ' Knowledge ', ' Suicide ', ' suicidality ', ' intent to die ', ' fatal suicide ', ' fatal attempt ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Time ', ' Attention ', ' Attitude ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Clinic ', ' Pattern ', ' preference ', ' Surgeon ', ' age group ', ' experience ', ' Participant ', ' Agreement ', ' help-seeking behavior ', ' help seeking ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' CDC ', ' Gender ', ' accomplished suicide ', ' completed suicide ', ' commit suicide ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Hispanics ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Latino ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Quality of Care ', ' QOC ', ' theories ', ' Cities ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Complement ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' age related ', ' age dependent ', ' Minority ', ' care preference ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' older women ', ' older men ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' normal aging ', ' Conceptions ', ' Provider ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Endogenous depression ', ' clinical depression ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Diagnosis ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Address ', ' Epidemic ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Caring ', ' Qualitative Methods ', ' Data ', ' Improve Access ', ' Strategic Planning ', ' Subgroup ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' trend ', ' Rate ', ' socioeconomics ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomic ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio economic ', ' Face ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Killings ', ' Intention ', ' Freedom ', ' Liberty ', ' Age ', ' base ', ' concept ', ' Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Goals ', ' Aging ', ' Label ', ' suicide rate ', ' improved ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' healthcare service availability ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare access availability ', ' health services availability ', ' health care service availability ', ' health care service access ', ' health care availability ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Availability of Health Services ', ' Accessibility of health care ', ' Access to Healthcare ', ' Access to Health Care ', ' Access to Care ', ' Health Status ', ' Level of Health ', ' Depth ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Medical ', ' Interview ', ' Screening procedure ', ' screenings ', ' screening ', ' disability ', ' Distress ', ' Ageism ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Methods ', ' Mexican Americans ', ' Chicanos ', ' Chicanas ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' National Institute of Mental Health (U.S.) ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' NIMH ', ' Physicians ', ' Primary Care Physician ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Primary Care ', ' Shapes ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT DAVIS,R01,2008,392681,0.07210390872443814
"Depression Care Among Elderly Nursing Home Residents    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Depression has pervasive effects on quality of life and health outcomes for elderly nursing home (NH) residents, but existing care processes are poorly understood and the knowledge base for improvement is inadequate. This study will provide a comprehensive assessment of patterns of depression identification and treatment for elderly residents, using merged data from the Minimum Data Set (MDS), Medicare and Medicaid claims, the OSCAR database on facility characteristics, and information on community characteristics in 6 states. The research dataset will integrate extensive clinical information from MDS with details on health and mental health services use, diagnoses, and pharmaceutical use histories from claims, along with contextual information on facilities that will relate care of individuals to other aspects of nursing facility care and life. The study aims to provide a clearer understanding of variations across facilities and communities in depression-related care processes, and to articulate the effects of facility structure, resources, case-mix, and practice patterns on resident care and outcomes. It will examine patterns of identified depression symptoms and diagnoses; antidepressant treatment; use of mental health services; and their interrelationships. An important focus will be on the analysis of racial/ethnic and other socioeconomic and geographical disparities, and identification of policy-modifiable and other factors that give rise to them. Trends in depression identification and treatment from 1999 through 2007 will be evaluated, including changes following public release via the Internet of a facility-level depression quality measure by CMS in 2004. Longitudinal analyses will evaluate trajectories of depression-related resident outcomes over time. Guided by a conceptual framework that articulates hypothesized processes leading to depression identification, treatment, and outcomes in a process of interaction among resident, facility, and community factors, the study will use multilevel modeling techniques that account for clustering of repeated observations within residents, residents within facilities, and facilities within communities.

"MUPS in Primary Care Research Center    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This is a request for funding a Developing Center for Intervention and Services Research (DCISR) in response to PAR 01-090. This new center will focus on patients who present in primary care with medically unexplained physical symptoms (MUPS). MUPS (e.g., unexplained pain, numbness, gastrointestinal symptoms) comprise a very common clinical presentation for disabling psychiatric disorders in primary care settings, such as depression and anxiety. The name of this new Developing Center will be the ""MUPS in Primary Care Research Center"" (MUPS-PCRC.) The center will build the necessary cores (e.g., operations, methods, training) and infrastructure for developing an innovative services research program in primary care concerning this population. Furthermore, the initial studies planned for the MUPS-PCRS will relate to lower socioeconomic status Latino and African-American patients, due to the well-documented disparities in mental health care for these populations. The faculty of MUPS-PCRS will also explore the effectiveness of a culturally- competent, collaborative stepped-care model for treating primary care patients with MUPS, while examining how patients, family members, physicians and behavioral health care specialists accept this model.  At least four pilot studies are planned, in consultation with an external advisory board of leading researchers, and apace with research infrastructure implementation. These studies will gather preliminary data on different stages of the collaborative stepped-care model. One study will focus on development and testing of specialized videos and other educational materials to be used in the first stage of the model, whereas another study will focus on the effectiveness of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) as a second stage treatment strategy and as a way to facilitate behavioral health care referrals. Two other studies concern alternative third-stage treatments for patients who do not respond well to CBT: a) heart rate variability biofeedback for the treatment of residual depression and somatic complaints; b) interpersonal therapy.

"Improving CLTC System Response to Late Life Depression   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In response to NIMH PAR-03-078, ""From intervention development to services: Exploratory Research Grants"" (R34), we seek support to develop a system-level intervention for improving care for depressed older adults who receive publicly funded community long-term care (CLTC) services. Our goal is to develop a system improvement that is acceptable to and can be sustained in public CLTC. We will employ a staged model for intervention development drawing on both published research (global knowledge) and local knowledge of the system of care accrued through our 8 years of clinical epidemiological and service systems research. Specific Aims are to (1) Consolidate global knowledge (from published studies) and local knowledge (gained from prior work in the CLTC system) about (a) depression prevalence, course, and comorbidities; (b) stakeholder preferences for depression treatment, and (c) CLTC resources for responding to depression for purposes of deriving implications for intervention; (2) Engage an expert panel to use this knowledge to specify an intervention, ""Assess, Link, and Support,"" to improve depression care in CLTC; (3) Develop treatment and training manuals; (4) Develop tracking methods for client and system outcomes; and (5) Assess the feasibility, acceptability, and appropriateness of the intervention and collect preliminary data for a subsequent effectiveness study. Quality improvement and organizational complexity theories inform the model of intervention development. Employing behavior aggregation methods, we will convene a multidisciplinary panel of local and national experts to vet a proposed intervention, specific ingredients which are based on theories of competing demands, the gateway filter linkage model, and motivational enhancement-readiness to change. This intervention development effort is responsive to recommendations of the President's New Freedom Commission Report on Mental Health (2003) to institute mental health screening and early intervention programs in public health and human services. Improving depression care through CLTC can extend mental health treatment to socially and economically disadvantaged elders, who historically have underutilized specialty mental health care. We will follow this work by an R01 study to test the intervention's effectiveness rigorously.                    ",Improving CLTC System Response to Late Life Depression,7473985,R34MH071632,"['therapy development ', ' treatment development ', ' intervention development ', ' develop therapy ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' Provider ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Binding (Molecular Function) ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' Binding ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Purpose ', ' Geographic state ', ' US State ', ' Readiness ', ' Preparedness ', ' Low income ', ' Environment ', ' Address ', ' Caring ', ' Data ', ' Effectiveness of Interventions ', ' Social Health Services ', ' Translational Research ', ' translation research enterprise ', ' translation research ', ' Translational Science ', ' Translational Research Enterprise ', ' Principal Investigator ', ' To specify ', ' Process ', ' Freedom ', ' Liberty ', ' base ', ' Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Goals ', ' Aging ', ' improved ', ' Health ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Man (Taxonomy) ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Medical ', ' Link ', ' Institute of Medicine (U.S.) ', ' NAS/IOM ', ' Institute of Medicine ', ' Institutes ', ' Ensure ', ' Screening procedure ', ' screenings ', ' screening ', ' Training ', ' disability ', ' Individual ', ' Numbers ', ' Recovery ', ' Long-Term Care ', ' extended care ', ' Policies ', ' Early Intervention (Education) ', ' Funding ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' uptake ', ' Manuals ', ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health Services ', ' Mental Hygiene Services ', ' Methods ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' Missouri ', ' Persons ', ' National Institute of Mental Health (U.S.) ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' NIMH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' Patients ', ' Plague ', ' Yersinia pestis disease ', ' Primary Care Physician ', ' Staging ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' Public Sector ', ' Publishing ', ' Depressed mood ', ' sadness ', ' depressed ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Condition ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Stigmata ', ' Research Priority ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' medical specialties ', ' Specialty ', ' Tail ', ' Testing ', ' Treatment Protocols ', ' Treatment Schedule ', ' Treatment Regimen ', ' Work ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' System ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' Behavior ', ' Mental disorders ', ' psychological disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Mood Disorders ', ' Affective Disorders ', ' Services ', ' preference ', ' Surgeon ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' intervention program ', ' NIH Program Announcements ', ' Program Announcement ', ' Reporting ', ' Measures ', ' Regulation ', ' Administrator ', ' Managed Care ', ' Modeling ', ' Specialist ', ' Quality of Care ', ' QOC ', ' response ', ' social stigma ', ' stigma ', ' theories ', ' functional disability ', ' Functional impairment ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Client ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' Comorbidity ', ' co-morbidity ', ' geriatric depression ', ' late life depression ', ' Elderly depression ', ' caregiving ', ' care giving ', ' care systems ', ' systems research ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' safety net ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' Early treatment ', ' early therapy ', ' early intervention ', ' collaborative care ', ' ']",NIMH,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R34,2008,66853,0.10522693400854813

"Risk and Protective Factors for Depression Among Racial Groups    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Past studies on major depression in different racial groups have yielded critical insights about mental illness in diverse communities. However, these studies have invariably treated racial groups as homogeneous categories rather than fully examining the heterogeneity within these groups. This is a revised R01 application by a New Junior Investigator that aims to investigate the social and psychological risk and protective factors for depression among African American, Caribbean Black, Asian American, Latino and White adults using existing national data. The proposed research will take advantage of comprehensive epidemiological data and sophisticated and innovative statistical methods to examine a wide range of risk and protective factors and their interactions, while also considering the heterogeneity within and between racial and ethnic groups. These relationships will be examined using the National Institute of Mental Health's Collaborative Psychiatric Epidemiology Surveys (CPES). The studies contain large samples of respondents of African American and Afro-Caribbean descent (National Survey of American Life), Latino and Asian descent (National Latino and Asian American Study), as well as a sample of the general population (National Comorbidity Study-Revised). The proposed application builds on previous research examining racial and ethnic health disparities in several important ways. First, it builds upon and advances previous empirical research on social relationships and depression by taking into account race/ethnicity, and immigration-related factors and how these factors influence the social relationships among diverse populations. Second, this research carefully focuses on the sociodemographic and other sources of heterogeneity that exist within and across these populations. Third, the proposed research will identify the pathways linking race and ethnicity to depression. This work is important in an etiologic sense, as it can lead to new knowledge about depression as a disease process across diverse populations. Finally, this research utilizes sophisticated statistical models to identify depression risk profiles by examining the social and contextual determinants of depression among a diverse sample of adults; which is important for identifying factors that define particular risk groups. The goal of this research is to identify those factors that will enhance current interventions, as well as provide information relevant to the development of new and innovative research-based interventions that meet the mental health needs of diverse populations. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Findings from the proposed investigation promise to increase our understanding of differences in risk and protective factors for different profiles of depression among diverse populations and will demonstrate a broader public health value in their utility in informing the design of targeted prevention and intervention programs for depression in adults that make use of existing, natural helping networks. More specifically, findings for the proposed research will inform the development, testing and translation of innovative interventions for adults with major depressive disorder. The goal of this research is to identify those factors that will enhance current interventions as well as develop new and innovative research-based interventions that meet the mental health needs of diverse populations.          Project Narrative Findings from the proposed investigation promise to increase our understanding of differences in risk and protective factors for different profiles of depression among diverse populations and will demonstrate a broader public health value in their utility in informing the design of targeted prevention and intervention programs for depression in adults that make use of existing, natural helping networks.

"Population-Based Psychiatric Intervention in Primary Care    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This is a request for a competing renewal of an NIMH Midcareer Investigator Award in Patient-Oriented Research (NIMH staff has advised Dr. Katon that he could submit a competing renewal of his K-24 award as a full professor). This K-24 will build on Dr. Katon's prior research in: 1) developing innovative ""collaborative care"" interventions to improve the quality of care and outcomes of patients with depressive and anxiety disorders within primary care settings; 2) improving understanding about the adverse impact of anxiety and depressive disorders in patients with common medical disorders; and 3) developing interventions to improve psychiatric outcomes in patients with chronic medical illness and comorbid depressive and anxiety disorders. The specific aims of this proposal include: 1) to continue to enhance Dr. Katon's epidemiologic, biostatistical and health economic skills in order to demonstrate in population-based studies the bidirectional adverse interactions between depression and chronic medical illness. The evidence from these population- based studies will be developed by a) showing in cross-sectional and longitudinal studies the adverse impact of depression on medical symptom burden, functional impairment, adherence to medical regimens, medical complications and mortality; and b) by demonstrating in longitudinal studies that residual depressive symptoms and incident complications of medical illness are associated with a higher risk of developing major depression and new deficits in functioning. Additional aims include: 2) to develop and test adaptations of collaborative care models in patients with depression and chronic medical illness that are targeted at improving medical disease control, behavioral risk factors, as well as improving quality of depression care; 3) to continue to adapt collaborative care interventions and test their effectiveness in new populations experiencing disparities in quality of mental health care such as adolescent populations with depression, youth with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) living in rural settings, and women with depression treated in Ob-Gyn settings; and 4) To continue to expand Dr. Katon's mentorship of junior investigators in mental health services research. These goals will be met through continued and expanded research activities, coursework in epidemiology, biostatistics and health economics and mentorship from external consultants. These courses, interactions with mentors, and mentored readings will improve Dr. Katon's ability as a mentor as well as enhancing the cutting edge research of his Health Services Division. RELEVANCE: The research that will be completed during the course of this award will increase knowledge about the importance of screening for and treating depression in patients with chronic medical illnesses; test new models of care in patients with depression and chronic medical illnesses aimed at improving quality of quality of depression and medical care; and adapt the collaborative care model to new populations (youth with ADHD and depression and women treated in Ob-Gyn settings) that experience disparities in quality of mental health care.           ",Population-Based Psychiatric Intervention in Primary Care,7658381,K24MH069471,"['Coronary heart disease ', ' coronary disorder ', ' Coronary Disease ', ' Depressive disorder ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ', ' attention deficit hyperactive disorder ', ' Predominantly Hyperactive-Impulsive Type Hyperactivity Disorder ', ' Predominantly Hyperactive-Impulsive Type Attention-Deficit Disorder ', ' Hyperkinetic Syndrome ', ' Hyperactivity Disorder NOS ', ' ADHD ', ' AD/HD ', ' Major Depressive Disorder ', ' major depression ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Symptoms ', ' Caring ', ' Adherence (attribute) ', ' Adherence ', ' Midcareer Investigator Award in Patient-Oriented Research ', ' Midcareer Investigator Award in Patient-Oriented Research (K24) ', ' K24 Program ', ' K24 Mechanism ', ' Subgroup ', ' Behavioral ', ' Fasting ', ' fasts ', ' fasted ', ' Telemedicine ', ' Guidelines ', ' Glucose ', ' Dextrose ', ' D-Glucose ', ' base ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Gynecology ', ' improved ', ' Health Services Research ', ' services research ', ' Medical Care Research ', ' Healthcare Research ', ' Health Services Evaluation ', ' Health Care Research ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Residual state ', ' Residual ', ' Medical ', ' Adolescent ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Screening procedure ', ' screenings ', ' screening ', ' medical complication ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' Rural ', ' Research Activity ', ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health Services ', ' Mental Hygiene Services ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Mortality ', ' National Institute of Mental Health (U.S.) ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' NIMH ', ' Epidemiologic Studies ', ' epidemiologic investigation ', ' Epidemiology Research ', ' Epidemiological Studies ', ' Epidemiologic Research ', ' Discipline of obstetrics ', ' Obstetrics ', ' Patients ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Primary Care ', ' Anxiety ', ' Anxiety Disorders ', ' Reading ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Support ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Testing ', ' Treatment Protocols ', ' Treatment Schedule ', ' Treatment Regimen ', ' Woman ', ' Award ', ' Pattern ', ' Biometry ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Biometrics ', ' meetings ', ' chronic depression ', ' Chronic depressive personality disorder ', ' Chronic depressive disorder ', ' Blood Pressure ', ' experience ', ' professor ', ' skills ', ' Treatment outcome ', ' depressive symptoms ', ' depressive ', ' depression symptom ', ' Emotional Depression ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' chronic disorder ', ' chronic disease/disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Modeling ', ' Quality of Care ', ' QOC ', ' Youth ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' functional disability ', ' Functional impairment ', ' Adverse effects ', ' treatment adverse effect ', ' therapy adverse effect ', ' side effect ', ' Treatment Side Effects ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' disorder control ', ' disease control ', ' cost ', ' health economics ', ' care systems ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' collaborative care ', ' high risk ', ' population based ', ' primary care setting ', ' depression ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,K24,2009,152667,0.1598081010008386
"Physical Frailty in Urban African-Americans    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This NIH Revision application for Physical Frailty in Urban African Americans (PFUAA; AG10436) responds to PAR-08-065. It requests 3 years of funding to enable additional data collection on a representative well-characterized cohort of African Americans living in St. Louis, MO, (the African American Health project, or AAH). Data to be collected relate to potential interactions between genetic factors and depression in mediating coronary artery disease (CAD) risk in AAH using single SNP/haplotype association analyses. CAD is the leading cause of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in the U.S. Nationally, African Americans have higher morbidity-mortality rates from CAD than whites, and particularly so in Missouri and in the city of St. Louis. Depression is also common and has multiple adverse associations with CAD. These relationships have been understudied in population-based samples and especially in African Americans. As frailty and disability are associated with both atherosclerotic disease and depressive symptoms, better understanding of the genetic reasons for the adverse CAD-depression associations is crucial to the AAH project. Prior data indicate that these conditions are common in AAH, with 3-year period prevalences of 42% for cardiovascular diseases and 31% for clinically relevant levels of depressive symptoms. Despite the well-known CAD-depression adverse associations, the precise genetic factors and molecular mechanisms mediating them remain largely unknown. The overarching hypothesis of this project is that depression contributes to the development and sequelae of CAD through common gene-gene (GXG) and/or gene-environment (GXE) interactions. To examine this hypothesis, this NIH Revision project will enroll 450 AAH subjects to pursue three specific aims: SA1. Identify the prevalence of CAD and depression phenotypes in a population-based sample of community-dwelling 57-75 year old African Americans. SA2. Examine the relationships between the CAD and depression phenotypes in this population, highlighting the modulating role of selected genes in the serotonin and inflammatory pathways. SA3. Discover potential gene-depression interactions with significant contribution to the development of CAD in African Americans. We have assembled an outstanding multidisciplinary group with all the required expertise to conduct this research, including epidemiology (aging, depression, cardiovascular, and genetic), cardiac imaging, CAD and depression phenotyping, cardiovascular disease mutation analysis, and (crucially) the development and use of novel statistical methods to study genetic polymorphisms for translational studies of cardiovascular disease. We plan to follow this project with a larger grant application to recruit 1050 additional subjects and perform genome wide analyses to address these important issues in even greater depth. This research has the potential to identify excellent targets for pharmacological and non-pharmacological approaches to preventing, ameliorating, or reversing either or both of these important conditions. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Coronary artery disease is a leading cause of death and health problems in the U.S. and has a particularly strong impact on African Americans. The presence of depression increases the frequency of coronary artery disease and all its complications in both blacks and whites. The purpose of this research is to examine the relationship between coronary artery disease and depression in an ongoing study of African Americans living in St. Louis, Missouri with an emphasis on understanding how genetic factors interact with depression symptoms to exert such a strong negative impact on coronary artery disease.              PROJECT NARRATIVE Coronary artery disease is a leading cause of death and health problems in the U.S. and has a particularly strong impact on African Americans.

"Treating Depression in African American Elders: A Community-Academic Partnership    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This application is in response to the NIH-NIMH program announcement (PAR-05-026) ""Community Participation in Research."" Based on a strong collaborative partnership between an academic research center at Thomas Jefferson University, and a senior center, Center in the Park (CIP), we plan to test the effectiveness of an in-home intervention to treat depression in 192 urban African American elders. Using a two group randomized trial, we will test a brief intervention that combines evidentiary components (depression education, stress reduction, referral, care management and behavioral activation) and mode of delivery (in-home) that resonate with the socio-cultural attributes of the target community. Participants will be enrolled from over 6,000 CIP members who screen positive for depressive symptoms. Study participants will be interviewed at baseline at home and then randomized to treatment or a wait-list control group. Participants in treatment will receive up to 10 in-home sessions from a CIP social worker while wait-list controls will receive usual care. All participants will be reassessed at 4 months by telephone (main trial endpoint) at which point wait-list controls will be offered the intervention and then all study participants will be reassessed at 8 months by telephone. Specific study aims are to: 1 )Test the immediate effect of the intervention at 4-months on depression (between group comparison); 2) Test the maintenance effect of the intervention at 8-months on depression (within group comparison); 3) Evaluate acceptability (social validity) of the intervention and engagement in targeted activities (experimental and wait-list control participants). A secondary aim will assess the feasibility of conducting a clinical trial embedded in a community setting and its dissemination using a community-academic partnership. Three exploratory aims will evaluate the mediational role of behavioral activation, differential treatment effects based on participant characteristics, and the effect of the intervention on quality of life domains. Health disparities coupled with unequal access to culturally relevant mental health treatments are consistently documented for older African Americans. Depression is a debilitating but treatable condition contributing to poor life quality. Our research will identify culturally-relevant depression treatment for African American elders, enhance service capacity of senior centers to treat depression in the community, and disseminate a replicable partnership model.             ",Treating Depression in African American Elders: A Community-Academic Partnership,7643238,R01MH079814,"['health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Symptoms ', ' Caring ', ' stress management ', ' stress buffering ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Characteristics ', ' Behavioral ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' Age ', ' base ', ' Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Aged, 80 and over ', ' Oldest Old ', ' Aging ', ' Health ', ' Randomized Controlled Clinical Trials ', ' Interview ', ' Training ', ' Distress ', ' insight ', ' Long-Term Effects ', ' Longterm Effects ', ' Licensing ', ' Living Arrangement ', ' Maintenance ', ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Collaborations ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Philadelphia ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' recruit ', ' Research ', ' Research Design ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Social Workers ', ' programs ', ' Stress ', ' Target Populations ', ' Telephone ', ' Phone ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Universities ', ' Waiting Lists ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' Services ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' Participant ', ' member ', ' NIH Program Announcements ', ' Program Announcement ', ' Applied Research ', ' Applied Science ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' Gender ', ' brief intervention ', ' brief treatment ', ' brief therapy ', ' Treatment outcome ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' depressive symptoms ', ' depressive ', ' depression symptom ', ' Emotional Depression ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' chronic disorder ', ' chronic disease/disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' clinical investigation ', ' Communities ', ' Community Participation ', ' Community Services ', ' comparison group ', ' geriatric depression ', ' late life depression ', ' Elderly depression ', ' functional decline ', ' decline in function ', ' depression education ', ' depression outreach ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' Coupled ', ' community based service ', ' treatment effect ', ' community based participatory research ', ' aging population ', ' population aging ', ' high risk ', ' community setting ', ' group intervention ', ' treatment as usual ', ' usual care ', ' depression ', ' intervention effect ', ' Control Groups ', ' ']",NIMH,THOMAS JEFFERSON UNIVERSITY,R01,2009,595285,0.21064398028873774
"Reducing Disparities in Depression Care for Ethnically Diverse Older Men    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The epidemic of suicide among older (i.e. age 60 and above) men in the US is a public health crisis. Older men have eight to ten-times higher rates of completed suicide than older women. Because depression is one of the strongest risk factors for suicide, improving care for depression in primary settings is a vital public health strategy to prevent suicide and other adverse outcomes of depression. Depression is more common in women than in men, but depressed older men and minorities are less likely to receive effective treatment. To address this knowledge gap and reduce disparities in older men and minorities, we propose a study that applies both qualitative and quantitative methods to better understand the perspectives, experiences, and preferences for care of ethnically diverse depressed older men and the primary care providers who treat them. Our focus gender-specific focus and attention to age-related factors will enable us to examine potentially important but under-studied variability among older men in how they experience and deal with their depression and will allow us to further develop our conceptual model and to develop strategies to engage more difficult to reach subgroups of diverse older men. Primary care is a logical site for this research because it is the setting where most depressed older men can potentially be recognized and treated. We will conduct systematic screening to identify a representative sample of 100 older men (50 Mexican-American and 50 white non- Hispanic) older men with treated and untreated clinical depression from primary care clinics in two cities and then conduct interviews with them and their primary care physicians (n = 48). This proposal's aims are 1) to examine how forms of masculinity and age-related changes and attitudes (i.e. health status, major role transitions, conceptions of normal aging) influence men's depression illness meanings, experience, and patterns of help-seeking, 2) to systematically examine older men's preferences for depression treatment, and 3) to identify factors that impede or facilitate depression care from the perspectives of primary care physicians. This proposal brings together an interdisciplinary group of investigators with extensive experience in working with older and minority populations and builds directly on published preliminary data (Hinton et al, 2006). It is the intention of this proposal to generate empirical data to help close the gender and ethnic gap in depression care, reduce associated health disparities, and mitigate high suicide rates in older men. Because depression is one of the strongest risk factors for suicide and because men who kill themselves frequently have had recent prior contact with their primary care physicians, improving care for depression in primary care settings is a vital public health strategy to prevent suicide and other adverse outcomes of depression. Depressed older men, however, are significantly less likely than women to receive effective depression treatment. Despite its public health importance, the barriers to depression care for older men are not well understood. Through a focused and in-depth examination of the perspectives and preferences of depressed older men and their primary care providers, this research will generate empirical data to reduce barriers to depression care for older men in primary care settings.          ",Reducing Disparities in Depression Care for Ethnically Diverse Older Men,7554149,R01MH080067,"['Health Care Costs ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Hispanics ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Latino ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Quality of Care ', ' QOC ', ' theories ', ' Cities ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Complement ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' age related ', ' age dependent ', ' Minority ', ' care preference ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' older women ', ' older men ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' normal aging ', ' high risk ', ' primary care setting ', ' treatment strategy ', ' effective therapy ', ' effective treatment ', ' depression ', ' depressed ', ' Conceptions ', ' Provider ', ' Endogenous depression ', ' clinical depression ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Address ', ' Epidemic ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Caring ', ' Qualitative Methods ', ' Data ', ' Improve Access ', ' Strategic Planning ', ' Subgroup ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' trend ', ' socioeconomics ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomic ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio economic ', ' Face ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Killings ', ' Intention ', ' Freedom ', ' Liberty ', ' Age ', ' base ', ' Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Goals ', ' Aging ', ' Label ', ' suicide rate ', ' improved ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' healthcare service availability ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare access availability ', ' health services availability ', ' health care service availability ', ' health care service access ', ' health care availability ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Availability of Health Services ', ' Accessibility of health care ', ' Access to Healthcare ', ' Access to Health Care ', ' Access to Care ', ' Health Status ', ' Level of Health ', ' Suicide prevention ', ' suicide intervention ', ' suicidality prevention ', ' prevent suicide ', ' prevent suicidality ', ' Suicide precaution ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Medical ', ' Interview ', ' Screening procedure ', ' screenings ', ' screening ', ' disability ', ' Distress ', ' Ageism ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Methods ', ' Mexican Americans ', ' Chicanos ', ' Chicanas ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' National Institute of Mental Health (U.S.) ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' NIMH ', ' Physicians ', ' Primary Care Physician ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Primary Care ', ' Shapes ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' Publishing ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Sex Characteristics ', ' sexual dimorphism (noncellular) ', ' gender difference ', ' Sex Differences ', ' Sick Role ', ' Illness Behavior ', ' Social Sciences ', ' Knowledge ', ' Suicide ', ' suicidality ', ' intent to die ', ' fatal suicide ', ' fatal attempt ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Time ', ' Attention ', ' Attitude ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Clinic ', ' Pattern ', ' preference ', ' Surgeon ', ' age group ', ' experience ', ' Participant ', ' Agreement ', ' help-seeking behavior ', ' help seeking ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' CDC ', ' Gender ', ' accomplished suicide ', ' completed suicide ', ' commit suicide ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT DAVIS,R01,2009,440496,0.07210390872443814
"Women Physical Disability and Depression: Communities Responding Now! Rates of depression and suicide in women with physical disabilities (WPD) are up to five times higher than in the general population.  Despite this disparity, few intervention studies that address the specific needs of this population are available.  To begin to address objective 6-3 of Healthy People 2010 and reduce the proportion of WPD who experience depressive symptoms, interventions relevant to the lives of WPD are urgently needed.  In keeping with national priorities and the need for consumer participation in the development of mental health therapies, the proposed project will use an existing cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) intervention that has demonstrated effectiveness in reducing depressive symptoms in women as a starting point from which to co-create an intervention that addresses the specific needs of WPD. The co-creation process will occur in the context of a partnership between the investigators, WPD in the community, and three Oregon Centers for Independent Living (CILs).  This partnership will be expanded to include four additional Oregon CILs during the last year of the proposed project for the purpose of developing a peer mentored train-the-trainer program that will facilitate consumer control and promote the sustainability of the intervention. The specific aims of the proposed project are to:  1.  Modify an existing cognitive behavioral group therapy intervention to address the specific needs of WPD who experience depressive symptoms; 2. Conduct an efficacy trial using a mixed-methods approach.  The proposed study outcomes were derived from our previous work with WPD as well as from members of the disability community.  An efficacy trial of the modified intervention with a total of 135 participants will be conducted using a wait list control design; and 3.  Develop a peer mentored train-the-trainer program to facilitate consumer control and promote the sustainability of the intervention.  A long-term goal of the proposed project is to increase the capacity of CILs across the country to offer a relevant, effective, accessible, and affordable intervention to help WPD with depression overcome this debilitating secondary condition. This proposed project addresses three national public health priorities including Healthy People 2010 goal 6 of reducing secoooary conditins in people with disabilities, and the President's New Freedom Commission on Mental Health goals 2 and 3 which emphasize the importance of consumer driven mental health care, and elimination of mental health disparities that adversely affect the health and overall functioning; of a number of disadvantaged populatiom in the U.S. including women with physical disabilities.",Women Physical Disability and Depression: Communities Responding Now!,7617051,R01MH079818,"['Healthy People 2010 ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Population Group ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Effectiveness ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Address ', ' Cognitive ', ' trend ', ' Process ', ' Depression and Suicide ', ' depression and suicidality ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Feeling ', ' feelings ', ' Group Therapy ', ' Behavioral ', ' Freedom ', ' Liberty ', ' Affect ', ' Goals ', ' Disabled Persons ', ' disabled people ', ' disabled ', ' Persons with Disabilities ', ' People with Disabilities ', ' Handicapped ', ' Disabled Population ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' Incidence ', ' Independent Living ', ' Ensure ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' interventions research ', ' intervention research ', ' disability ', ' Loneliness ', ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health Services ', ' Mental Hygiene Services ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Mortality ', ' Oregon ', ' Poverty ', ' Problem Solving ', ' Publishing ', ' Depressed mood ', ' sadness ', ' depressed ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' self esteem ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Violence ', ' violent behavior ', ' violent ', ' Investigation ', ' Waiting Lists ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Country ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' surgery ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Outcome Study ', ' Body Image ', ' body perception ', ' experience ', ' skills ', ' Participant ', ' peer ', ' member ', ' Population Study ', ' General Population ', ' General Public ', ' Reporting ', ' Relative (related person) ', ' Relative ', ' depressive symptoms ', ' depressive ', ' depression symptom ', ' Emotional Depression ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Modeling ', ' Trainers Training ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Communities ', ' burden of illness ', ' years of life lost to disease ', ' years of life lost to disability ', ' disease burden ', ' burden of disease ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' efficacy trial ', ' coping ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' community based participatory research ', ' therapy design ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' cognitive behavior therapy ', ' depression ', ' public health priorities ', ' Consumer Participation ', ' Consumer Involvement ', ' Control Groups ', ' ']",NIMH,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,R01,2009,254490,0.025192893176621926
"FOR MOMS:Culturally Relevant Treatment for Perinatal Depression    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Among socio-economically disadvantaged minority and white women, depression during pregnancy and the postpartum is often under-detected and under-treated. Maternal postpartum depression has adverse, lasting effects on maternal, infant and child well-being. Depression during pregnancy has been demonstrated to be the most potent predictor of postpartum depression and appears to be linked to low birth weight and prematurity. Poor, urban women are at least twice as likely as middle-class women to meet diagnostic criteria for major depression during pregnancy. At the same time, depressed, disadvantaged women have been proven difficult to engage and retain in mental health treatment because they face numerous barriers to care at the patient, provider, and system levels. This proposed randomized, controlled trial will evaluate the effects of a culturally relevant, multicomponent intervention for antenatal depression (FOR MOMS, ""Maintain Our Mothers' Strength"") that has the potential to overcome patient, provider, and system-level barriers to care and engage depressed, low-income women in evidence-based treatments to reduce antenatal depressive symptoms, improve maternal psychosocial functioning, and ameliorate postpartum depression. This research will take advantage of the unique partnership between the Seattle King County Public Health Department (PHSKC) and the University of Washington's School of Social Work and Department of Psychiatry. We propose to enroll a sample of 220 depressed, pregnant women on Medicaid from PHSKC and will test the effectiveness of the FOR MOMS intervention relative to usual care for antenatal depression. FOR MOMS consists of a pre- treatment engagement session and a choice of brief interpersonal psychotherapy (IPT) or evidence-based pharmacotherapy. The engagement session and brief IPT for antenatal depression have been enhanced to reduce racial and economic disparities in treatment engagement and retention and have been shown to be effective in a pilot study. After study entry, assessments will be conducted at baseline and 3, 6, 12, and 18 months post-baseline, a time period designed to include the first postpartum year.

"Telepsychiatry & Culturally Sensitive Treatment of Depressed Asian Americans    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Asian Americans tend to underutilize mental health services compared to other ethnic groups, with delayed treatment and higher attrition rates (Kung, 2003). When suffering from symptoms of mental illnesses, many underserved Chinese Americans seek help from their primary care physicians (PCPs) (Yeung et al., 2004a). In 2003, the applicant received a Career Development Award to study the effectiveness of Culturally Sensitive Collaborative Treatment (CSCT) for the treatment of underserved Chinese Americans with major depressive disorder (MDD) in primary care. The key elements of CSCT are active screening to increase recognition of depressed patients, culturally sensitive consultation by a psychiatrist and care management. Preliminary findings show that CSCT improves case recognition, facilitates engagement, and decreases the disparities of treatment among underserved Chinese Americans with MDD (Yeung et al., 2006; Yeung, 2007). This proposed study will investigate the feasibility and effectiveness of using Telepsychiatry-based CSCT (T-CSCT) to extend the CSCT model to underserved Chinese Americans in remote clinics. The specific aims of this study are: 1) To investigate whether telepsychiatry consultation is acceptable to underserved Chinese Americans with MDD and to their PCPs, and 2) To investigate the effectiveness of T-CSCT on improving treatment outcomes of underserved Chinese Americans with MDD in remote clinics. Subjects will be recruited by depression screening in primary care clinics and by advertisements to promote depression self-screening. Two hundred underserved Chinese American patients who screen positive for MDD will be randomized to receive either T-CSCT or Usual Care (UC). Treatment outcomes of patients in these two groups will be compared. This study will examine the acceptability and effectiveness of telepsychiatry- based culturally sensitive psychiatric treatment for underserved Chinese Americans with major depressive disorder. The goal is to increase access to mental health services and to decrease disparities in the treatment of depression among ethnic minority patients.          ",Telepsychiatry & Culturally Sensitive Treatment of Depressed Asian Americans,7686906,R01MH079831,"['Major Depressive Disorder ', ' major depression ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Elements ', ' Videoconferencing ', ' Videoconferences ', ' Symptoms ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Caring ', ' Adherence (attribute) ', ' Adherence ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' K-Series Research Career Programs ', ' Research Career Program ', ' K-Awards ', ' Career Development Programs K-Series ', ' Career Development Awards and Programs ', ' Career Development Awards ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Chinese People ', ' Chinese ', ' Telemedicine ', ' Health Professional ', ' Healthcare professional ', ' Health Care Professional ', ' active method ', ' active treatment ', ' active technique ', ' base ', ' Goals ', ' improved ', ' Health ', ' Psychiatric therapeutic procedure ', ' psychiatric treatment ', ' psychiatric therapy ', ' psychiatric care ', ' Interview ', ' Screening procedure ', ' screenings ', ' screening ', ' insanity ', ' satisfaction ', ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health Services ', ' Mental Hygiene Services ', ' Patients ', ' Primary Care Physician ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Primary Care ', ' Psychiatrist ', ' Questionnaires ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' recruit ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Psychiatric Diagnosis ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Stigmatization ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Asian Americans ', ' Translating ', ' Use Effectiveness ', ' Work ', ' Clinic ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' Distant ', ' Pattern ', ' Mental disorders ', ' psychological disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Familiarity ', ' Manuscripts ', ' help-seeking behavior ', ' help seeking ', ' outreach ', ' Case Manager ', ' Case Management Nurse ', ' Care Manager ', ' sensitivity training ', ' Depression screen ', ' depression screening ', ' Chinese American ', ' Treatment outcome ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' chronic disorder ', ' chronic disease/disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Modeling ', ' Specialist ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Acculturation ', ' Cultural Assimilation ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' Advertisements ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' primary care setting ', ' treatment as usual ', ' usual care ', ' depression ', ' depressed ', ' Consultations ', ' ']",NIMH,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R01,2009,357919,0.043059893616054584
"Moderated Mediational Model of Emergent Sex Differences in Adolescent Depression    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): One in four girls, compared to one in eight boys, is likely to warrant a diagnosis of Major Depressive Disorder by the time she finishes adolescence. What exactly causes these disturbing sex differences is at the center of decades of intense research and debate, yielding few definitive answers thus far. Recent support has emerged for Response Style Theory, positing that gender differences in rumination, or the tendency to perseverate about symptoms and causes of one's depression, may explain a large part of the these sex differences (Nolen-Hoeksema, 1994). The mechanisms by which rumination causes this gender disparity, however, are still unknown. This study proposes to test a new moderated mediational model of rumination in middle childhood and early adolescence to help explain the sex differences in prevalence rates of depression during adolescence. Our application examines how female gender identification may mediate the relation between sex and rumination, and how rumination may in turn mediate the link to depressive symptoms. Furthermore, we will look at how this model is moderated by the effects of age and pubertal development. We hypothesize that this mediational model will explain why the sex-depression link only becomes evident during adolescence, but not in childhood. Adding such a moderational component to the model will help explain why pre-pubertal girls and boys have similar rates of depression, but girls become more likely to develop depressive symptoms later on. We will administer questionnaires to 450 students, their parents, and their teachers in grades 4, 6 and 8 at three time points during the school year (approximately 3 months apart). We will use latent variable structural equation modeling (SEM) to test our mediational hypotheses and multi-group SEM to test our moderational hypotheses. By advancing our understanding of the emergent gender difference in depressive symptoms, we will contribute to knowledge about the etiology of depression for both males and females. This knowledge will enable clinicians to target high-risk youth for prevention and intervention programs and will facilitate the distribution of resources to those who need them most. This project dovetails nicely with the priority given to research on gender differences in adolescent depression by the Division of Pediatric Translational Research and Treatment Development.           ",Moderated Mediational Model of Emergent Sex Differences in Adolescent Depression,7564824,F31MH079670,"['Diagnosis ', ' Major Depressive Disorder ', ' major depression ', ' Etiology ', ' disease causation ', ' causation ', ' Causality ', ' Elements ', ' Emotions ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Cognitive ', ' Translational Research ', ' translation research enterprise ', ' translation research ', ' Translational Science ', ' Translational Research Enterprise ', ' sex ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Adolescence ', ' teenage ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' Female ', ' Male Adolescents ', ' adolescent boy ', ' Adoption ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Gender Role ', ' Sex Roles ', ' Age ', ' Goals ', ' Adolescent ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Link ', ' teacher ', ' Childhood ', ' pediatric ', ' male ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Structural Models ', ' Parents ', ' Humulus ', ' Hops ', ' Questionnaires ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Schools ', ' Sex Characteristics ', ' sexual dimorphism (noncellular) ', ' gender difference ', ' Sex Differences ', ' Knowledge ', ' Students ', ' Testing ', ' Thinking, function ', ' thoughts ', ' Thinking ', ' Time ', ' Woman ', ' interest ', ' Equation ', ' age group ', ' success ', ' cohort ', ' intervention program ', ' skills ', ' Mediation ', ' Negotiation ', ' Negotiating ', ' Prevention ', ' Gender ', "" Women's Role "", ' Female Roles ', ' depressive symptoms ', ' depressive ', ' depression symptom ', ' Emotional Depression ', ' Mediating ', ' Modeling ', ' boys ', ' girls ', ' response ', ' Youth ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' theories ', ' age effect ', ' aging effect ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' coping ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' Early treatment ', ' early therapy ', ' early intervention ', ' therapy development ', ' treatment development ', ' intervention development ', ' develop therapy ', ' high risk ', ' early adolescence ', ' depression ', ' longitudinal design ', ' ']",NIMH,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY,F31,2009,41176,0.07649429169102505
"Coregulatory Processes and Postpartum Depression in Mexican-Americans    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The consequences of postpartum depression (PPD) extend far beyond the mother's mental health, and can have severe detrimental effects on marital relationships, parenting abilities, mother-infant bonding, and infant health and development. Although Latinos are the fastest growing population group in the US, few studies of PPD have been conducted with Latina women. Existing studies suggest a significantly elevated vulnerability to PPD for low income ethnic minority women. However, the trajectories of onset and recovery have not been well- described, and little is known about the influence of cultural-ecological risk and protective factors. Further, most research has failed to consider the fundamental role of the newborn baby and the ability of mother-infant interactions to influence the onset and course of PPD. This study will evaluate a community sample of 330 low-income Mexican American first- time mothers from the prenatal period through the first postpartum year. The development of PPD and the process of recovery will be examined using well-validated symptom and clinically diagnostic measures. Culturally-ecological factors will be examined that may either confer risk or offer protection from PPD. Repeated home observations of mother-infant interactions will be collected in the critical first 6 months following childbirth. The bio-psychosocial process by which mothers and infants co-regulate each other's emotions, behavior, and physiology will be analyzed and used to predict the longitudinal course of PPD over the first year. Findings will significantly enhance understanding of the impact of culturally-relevant risk and protective factors on the onset and course of PPD in a highly vulnerable population, and will identify innovative targets (e.g., mother-infant interactions) for future interventions. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Postpartum mood disorders, primarily depression, affect a large number of new mothers. Estimates range from 10-15 percent in general population samples. However, striking health disparities are evident in studies evaluating low-income and/or ethnic minority mothers, for whom prevalence rates from 24-49 percent have been reported. A large research literature documents the substantial detrimental public health impact of postpartum depression, not just for women, but for their partners and children as well. According to the World Health Organization (2007), depression is the leading cause of disability worldwide, and the fourth leading contributor to worldwide burden of disease. Infants and children of mothers who are depressed, especially those experiencing social disadvantage, face considerable short and long-term disadvantage, including lower birth weight, poorer cognitive development, higher rates of behavioral and social problems, and more frequent emotional problems. In Arizona, the largest percentages of new births are to Hispanic women, of whom the majority is classified as low-income. Population birth trends in Arizona (and the US as a whole), the magnitude of the public health impact of postpartum mood disorders, and the significant mental health disparities new Hispanic mothers experience argue for the critical need for further understanding of processes affecting the development of postpartum mood disorders in low-income Mexican American women.           Principal Investigator/Program Director (Last, First, Middle): Luecken, Linda J.

"Cost Effectiveness of a Home Support Program for Depression in Black Elders    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   This application addresses the broad Challenge Area (05) Comparative Effectiveness Research and specific Challenge Topic, 05-MH-102*: Cost Effectiveness of Mental Health Interventions. We propose a two year initiative to add a cost and outcome component which will enable us to perform a cost effectiveness analysis of our currently funded randomized controlled trial (NIMH R01MH079814) ""Treating Depression in Older African Americans"") that tests a novel 10- session home-based intervention to treat depression in older community-dwelling African Americans. The intervention, referred to as Beat the Blues (BTB), involves trained social workers who meet with participants to identify care management concerns, make referrals and linkages, provide depression education, develop tailored action plans to accomplish identified behavioral goals and enhance engagement in pleasurable activities, and teach stress reduction techniques for managing daily stressors (e.g., deep breathing). BTB uses a randomized two-group experimental design (treatment vs. wait-list control) in which all participants are screened twice for depressive symptoms (PHQ-9 >5) to determine study eligibility, randomly assigned, and then evaluated at 4 months on main study outcomes (PHQ-9 depression severity, quality of life, functional ability). At 4 months, the wait-list control group receives BTB in its entirety, and then all study participants are reassessed at 8 months to evaluate the maintenance of treatment effects for the treatment group, and whether the wait-list control group demonstrates similar improvements as the treatment group at 4 months. BTB is embedded in a senior center, Center in the Park (CIP) involving their agency staff as depression screeners and interventionists. Essential to translating BTB as a depression program for delivery by senior centers, is an understanding of its cost, outcomes, and cost effectiveness. Economic evaluations of home support programs for depression which target older African Americans and can be delivered by trained staff of a community-based agency are non- existent. The specific aims of our proposed study are to: 1. Calculate the cost of delivering BTB by senior center staff trained in the program; 2. Calculate the cost effectiveness of BTB from a societal perspective that employs two relevant outcome measures: cost per quality adjusted life year (QALY; Euro-QOL 5D vs. HUI2 and HU13 health utility measures), and cost per reduction in depression symptoms. Cost-effectiveness will be measured as the average incremental difference between cost of BTB and the control group divided by the difference in health utility (measured as QALYS) between treatment and control periods at 4 months, and at 8 months for the subsample of participants who receive BTB for the first 4 months and are observed for another 4 months. Univariate and probabilistic sensitivity analyses will be conducted to determine the incremental cost effectiveness of BTB at 8 months, and will aid in determining the robustness of the model when inpatient and outpatient medical and medication costs are varied. We also propose exploratory aims to: a) examine relationship between results of Euro-QOL 5D instrument (EQ-5D) and Health Utilities Index (HUI2 vs. HUI3) to inform preliminary recommendations as to which instrument is best suited for cost effectiveness in the BTB population; b) explore whether the cost effectiveness of BTB falls within established thresholds, and c) explore the application of these thresholds when applied to social-behavioral programs. This two year initiative overlaps with years 03-04 (of 5 years) of the original trial such that our proposal is feasible and can be accomplished within the structure/timeline of the parent study. The cost analyses will involve a subset (n=122/192) of participants for which we will be able to collect QALY measures. This study has potential for making a major impact on the science of economic evaluation by comparing different utility indices for their sensitivity with the target population, translational research by providing cost and cost effectiveness of a depression program for delivery by a senior center, and health policy by linking coverage decisions to adequate scientific evidence of treatment and cost effectiveness for an underserved group for whom mental health disparities persist. As the prevalence of late-life depression among older African Americans is high, an economic evaluation of BTB has great potential for improving the lives of this vulnerable population.

"Antepartum Interpersonal Psychotherapy at 3 NYC Sites    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The 10-13% prevalence of Antepartum Depression (APD) increases 2 fold in women with poor social supports, low socioeconomic status (SES) and negative life events. APD causes low birth weight, prematurity and eclampsia. APD is one of the best predictors of postpartum depression (PPD), which in turn causes impaired infant and childhood emotional and cognitive development. Therefore, treating APD is a method of primary and secondary prevention by treating parents of children at risk. Yet, there are no treatment guidelines for antepartum depression. This application is based on findings from a previous bilingual controlled clinical trial of Interpersonal Psychotherapy adapted for APD (IPT-P). The mood of the IPT-P treatment group significantly improved on all mood scores compared to a matched Parenting Education Program (PEP) control with the same duration, frequency and intensity of contact as the treatment group. This study sample was comprised of a majority of indigent Spanish speaking immigrant women with multiple psychosocial and financial stressors. Because of the small sample size, there was no information on the relationship of  demographic variables such as race and SES to treatment feasibility, prognosis and attachment. Data from the National Comorbidity Study illustrated that effects of ethnicity and race must be examined in the context of SES and psychosocial variables in order to determine disparities in care and treatment outcome. In the proposed trial, a larger more diverse sample (N=150) of women from 3 different sites in New York City will provide enough power to generalize findings and determine the relationship of subgroup variables such as race/ethnicity and SES to treatment feasibility, motherhood and  attachment. 3 sites (New York State Psychiatric Institute/New York Presbyterian Hospital at Columbia, New York Presbyterian Hospital at Cornell and St. Luke's Roosevelt hospital) will provide equal proportions of Latina, African American and White depressed pregnant women. Each subject will be randomized to 12 weeks of IPT-P or PEP, then followed for 6 months postpartum to determine if the IPT-P is more effective in reducing depression, preventing PPD and improving maternal infant attachment. Co-investigators are maternal fetal medicine faculty from respective sites who will be primary liaison to the respective departments of obstetrics and provide clinical obstetrical needs of the study.

"Reducing Disparities and Improving Care for Depression in OB-GYN Clinics    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Background: Major depressive episodes occur throughout a woman's lifespan, with the highest rates during the reproductive and menopausal transition years. During this time, OB-GYNs are the only providers whom many women regularly see. Low income and minority women are particularly likely to seek their routine care in OB-GYN clinics. There are marked gaps in accuracy of diagnosis and quality of depression care in OB-GYN clinics, with disparities in quality of depression care which exceed those seen in primary care clinics. Models incorporating depression care into clinical settings may be adaptable to OB-GYN settings but have not been tested outside of the perinatal period. Most women seen by OB-GYNs are not pregnant; thus, studies focusing solely on perinatal depression excludes a large number of women who could benefit from care. No studies to date have been completed that have adapted depression care models to OB-GYN clinics as a whole. Research Goal: We propose a three-part intervention, integrated with OB-GYN care, consisting of (i) enhanced education; (ii) engagement; and (iii) depression care management (with antidepressant monitoring and/or provision of brief psychotherapy). We hypothesize that a three-part depression intervention, integrated into the OB-GYN clinical setting, will improve treatment outcomes for depression, functional outcomes, and satisfaction with depression care. Study Design: In the proposed randomized controlled trial, 260 OB-GYN clinic patients with major depression and/or dysthymia will be assigned to either: 1) an integrated depression intervention or 2) usual care (UC). We will screen approximately 8,300 patients presenting for scheduled clinic appointments at two urban OB-GYN clinics over 18-months for major depression/dysthymia. A large number of these patients are low-income and minority women. Potentially eligible patients may also be referred by a clinic provider or reply to informational flyers posted in the clinics. The integrated depression intervention will last 12 months. Outcomes will be assessed at baseline and at 6, 12, and 18 months by telephone interviews by blinded research staff. Aims: Our Primary Aims are: 1) To evaluate, compared to UC, the impact of an integrated OB-GYN depression intervention on depression treatment outcomes, including change in depressive symptoms and depression treatment response; and 2) To evaluate, compared to UC, the impact of an integrated OB-GYN depression intervention on functional outcomes. Our Secondary Aims are: 3) To evaluate, compared to UC, the impact of an integrated OB-GYN depression intervention on quality of depression care indicators, including number of therapy visits, and dose, duration, and adherence to antidepressant medications; and on satisfaction with depression care, including patient and provider satisfaction, and provider attitudes toward depression care in OB-GYN clinics; and 4) [To identify potential facilitators and barriers to sustainability of the integrated OB-GYN intervention.]      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The results of our proposed randomized controlled trial will greatly impact public health by satisfying an unmet need for effective depression services for all women seen in the OB-GYN clinical setting. The potential improvements in depression treatment outcomes and quality of life for the large proportion of women who receive their care in this setting will be substantial.           The results of our proposed randomized controlled trial will greatly impact public health by satisfying an unmet need for effective depression services for all women seen in the OB-GYN clinical setting.

"Madres para la Salud (Mothers for Health)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Pregnancy-associated weight gain and failure to lose weight after birth contributes to the development of overweight and obesity in Hispanic women, who have prevalence rates exceeding 70%. Recent evidence shows that obesity is associated with systemic and fat tissue inflammation which can facilitate the development of obesity-related chronic diseases and contributes to the development of postpartum depression. Despite the well-established beneficial effects of exercise on weight, women tend to underparticipate in physical activity during the childbearing years. Further, the mechanisms underpinning the interplay of overweight, obesity, physical activity, and subsequent risk such as inflammatory processes or postpartum depression are not clear. The proposed study seeks to test a social support intervention, ""Madres para la Salud"" [Mothers for Health], to explore the effectiveness of a culturally specific program using ""bouts"" of physical activity to effect changes in body fat, fat tissue inflammation, and postpartum depression symptoms in sedentary Hispanic women. This innovative program has the potential to advance our understanding of the relationship between moderate increases in physical activity and specific health outcomes. The study aims are to:1) Examine the effectiveness of the Madres para la Salud for reducing the distal outcomes in: (a) body fat (b) systemic and fat tissue inflammation and (c) PPD symptoms among postpartum Hispanic women compared with an attention control group, at 6 and 12 months, after controlling for dietary intake; 2) Test whether the theoretical mediators, intermediate outcomes, of social support and walking, and environmental factor moderators, affect changes in body fat; systemic and fat tissue inflammation; and PPD symptoms among postpartum Hispanic women at 6 and 12 months, and 3) Determine the relationship between the immediate outcome of walking (minutes walked per week) and change in the distal outcomes of: (a) body fat (b) systemic and fat tissue inflammation and (c) PPD symptoms. A prospective, randomized controlled trial will guide the study. A sample of 140 sedentary Hispanic women, 18-35 years, and between 6 weeks and 6 months following childbirth will be used. Participants will be randomly assigned to the intervention or attention-control group. The intervention group will have weekly walking sessions and support interventions with Promotoras. The attention-control group will receive health newsletters and follow-up phone calls. Data will be gathered at baseline, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months using questionnaires, fat tissue biopsies, blood samples, and a subset sample for DEXA body scans, as well as objective and self-report measures of walking adherence. The intervention's effectiveness will be evaluated using a mixed models analysis of variance (ANOVA) comparing the two groups, structural equation modeling (SEM), and evaluating the relationship between walking and body-fat loss. The results will have significance for women's health providers who seek to improve the long-term health of Hispanic women. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed project tests an intervention that can be integrated into the daily lives of Hispanic women following childbirth. The intervention will use culturally sensitive strategies and planned supports during walking activities to decrease body fat and postpartum depression symptoms, while improving the cellular processes related to excess body fat.           PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed project tests an intervention that can be integrated into the daily lives of Hispanic women following childbirth.

"CBPR to Improve Depression Care for African-American Domestic Violence Survivors African-Americans receive less guideline-appropriate depression care than Whites. likewise, women with histories of intimate partner violence (IPV) have increased rates of depression and greater mistrust of mental health care. However, few mental health treatment programs specifically address the complex needs of African-American abuse survivors. We plan to use Community-Based Participatory Research (CBPR) to develop and test a community-based multi-faceted intervention to reduce depression disparities in AfricanAmerican women who have experienced IPV. The pUrPOse of this proposal is to strengthen our communityacademic partnership and to acquire the skills, tools, and preliminary data necessary to conduct a large-scale controlled trial. Our partnership consists of African-American IPV survivors, community leaders, domestic violence advocates, mental health providers and researchers who have already been working together to understand the beliefs and needs of depressed African-American IPV survivors. We are now developing a depression care model based within the Healing Roots Center, a community-based African-American domestic violence program. Our intervention incorporates many of the same principles included in the health systembased Chronic Care Model, but it places the community and its resources at the core of the program. AfricanAmerican domestic violence advocates will serve in a role similar to that of care managers, providing care coordination and patient education. They will link IPV survivors into the health care system and empower them to have more effective interactions with both on-site and clinic-based providers. Advocates will use motivational interviewing techniques to help women make behavior changes they wish to make in a culturallyappropriate manner. Finally, we will incorporate creative, arts-based programs as a way to recruit and retain women who might otherwise be hesitant to access mental health services or recognize their IPV. We will strengthen the partnership between our academic and community groups, build capacity for CBPR among all members, and monitor the success of the process. We will adapt, prioritize and pilot test assessment instruments that will be used to measure the effectiveness of our intervention. We will pilot test our intervention to assess its feasibility and acceptability and collect preliminary effectiveness data. Moreover, we will engage the community in designing and preparing an acceptable large-scale intervention study. Our project is strongly grounded in principles of Empowerment Theory on both micro and macro levels. On an individual level, our project will empower women to address the violence in their relationships, to use selfmanagement support tools and self-care practices to control their depression, and to become involved, informed consumers of mental health services. At a community level, the project will enable community members to partner with researchers to design and conduct research that is relevant to their needs and respectful of their expertise, which leaves lasting resources in place, and leads directly to social change.

"Chronic Illness & Minor Depression: Community and CDSMP    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Minor depression alone and its co-occurrence with chronic diseases are under- recognized, under-treated and understudied. This proposed study uses theoretically driven mixed methodologies to understand key barriers and facilitators for the successful translation of an evidence-based intervention (EBI) - chronic disease self management programs (CDSMP) - into community settings for underserved Latinos who suffer from minor depression and co- occurring chronic disease. We have chosen CDSMP because of its strong evidence base and its ability to be delivered by lay health workers in various settings and reduce health disparities. New data show that minor depression exerts large costs, increases mortality when present in cardiac disease, and is not responsive to most interventions that are effective for major depression. This proposed study is aligned with CDC's performance goal to support prevention research to develop sustainable and transferable community-based behavioral interventions. We propose to partner with two community partners - Hispanic Service Council and Familia Sana and use ongoing funded community-based participatory research (CBPR) efforts for a three-phase study. This partnership will drive the understanding of important barriers and facilitators that need to be addressed for the successful adaptation of this EBI - that is, to make it contextually relevant, keep it effective and meet primary stakeholders' needs. In Hillsborough County area where we wish to do this work, the Latino population is over 20% and huge gaps in general and mental health services exist. The specific aims of this project are to: identify key stakeholder perspectives on multi- dimensional barriers and facilitators to the adoption of CDSMP into community settings; employ mixed methods to adapt CDSMP to best address those priority needs; and test the feasibility of implementing the adapted CDSMP using a lagged intervention design with outcome measurements over months, to estimate intervention parameters in preparation for a future large scale cross-county implementation study. This research is exceptionally relevant to public health because it seeks to improve health and functioning outcomes in a poor minority population that suffers from an important, highly prevalent and disabling condition - minor depression that co-occurs with chronic diseases - using community engagement for the adaptation, implementation and sustainability of an EBI.     Project Narrative  This research is exceptionally relevant to public health because it seeks to improve health and functioning outcomes in a poor minority population that suffers from an important, highly prevalent and disabling condition - minor depression that co-occurs with chronic diseases - using community engagement for the adaptation, implementation and sustainability of an EBI.",Chronic Illness & Minor Depression: Community and CDSMP,7688679,R18MN000004,[''],ODCDC,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH FLORIDA,R18,2009,557146,0.13383863377822755
"Understanding Social Contributions to Disparities in Depression Care: US and UK    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Physicians' ability to communicate effectively with patients from ethnically and socially diverse backgrounds is essential to reducing health disparities. However, communication is not solely the task of medical professionals, patients also play a critical role in active participation in their care and in gaining the necessary confidence and competence to implement and continue treatment. The disparities that are evident within medical care reflect the interplay of social factors, including race, gender, age, literacy, and the cultural and normative expectations that guide the perspectives of both patients and physicians. The proposed investigation is designed to contribute to the disentangling of physician-derived and patient-derived contributions to social bias that may exacerbate health disparities associated with the provision and receipt of depression care and suicide risk assessment in the US and UK. In order to do so, we propose a novel approach in which videotape simulations are used to portray a depression -focused visit in primary care in which the ethnicity and gender of the participants have been experimentally manipulated. While sharing the context of a medical visit, the simulations differ in focus; one is designed to examine physicians' cognitive and clinical reasoning processes while the other explores patients' perceptions, responses and judgments related to the receipt of care. In the first study (for which data are already collected), visit simulations were shown to 128 US and UK physicians who were asked to take the role of the treating physician and provide a narrative account of their clinical reasoning. The second study shows simulated depression visits, in which patient and physician gender and ethnicity is experimentally manipulated, to 640 ethnically diverse male and female subjects in the US and UK. Subjects vicariously take the role of the depressed patient in the simulations to provide insights into their cognitive and affective reactions to care. In this way, we will be able to explore how subjects acting as analogue patients and physicians are influenced by gender and ethnicity in making medical care judgments in the context of the US and UK health care system and social structure. Study 3 will test the ecological validity of the analogue findings through the analysis of actual patient data in which physicians from different ethnic backgrounds have assessed patients' depression and suicide risk in an anonymised database. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: ability to communicate effectively with patients from ethnically and socially diverse backgrounds is essential to reducing health disparities. However amelioration of disparities is not solely the task of medical professionals: patients also play a critical role in active participation in care and acquisition of the confidence and competence necessary to implement and continue treatment.

"Treating Depression in African American Elders: A Community-Academic Partnership    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This application is in response to the NIH-NIMH program announcement (PAR-05-026) ""Community Participation in Research."" Based on a strong collaborative partnership between an academic research center at Thomas Jefferson University, and a senior center, Center in the Park (CIP), we plan to test the effectiveness of an in-home intervention to treat depression in 192 urban African American elders. Using a two group randomized trial, we will test a brief intervention that combines evidentiary components (depression education, stress reduction, referral, care management and behavioral activation) and mode of delivery (in-home) that resonate with the socio-cultural attributes of the target community. Participants will be enrolled from over 6,000 CIP members who screen positive for depressive symptoms. Study participants will be interviewed at baseline at home and then randomized to treatment or a wait-list control group. Participants in treatment will receive up to 10 in-home sessions from a CIP social worker while wait-list controls will receive usual care. All participants will be reassessed at 4 months by telephone (main trial endpoint) at which point wait-list controls will be offered the intervention and then all study participants will be reassessed at 8 months by telephone. Specific study aims are to: 1 )Test the immediate effect of the intervention at 4-months on depression (between group comparison); 2) Test the maintenance effect of the intervention at 8-months on depression (within group comparison); 3) Evaluate acceptability (social validity) of the intervention and engagement in targeted activities (experimental and wait-list control participants). A secondary aim will assess the feasibility of conducting a clinical trial embedded in a community setting and its dissemination using a community-academic partnership. Three exploratory aims will evaluate the mediational role of behavioral activation, differential treatment effects based on participant characteristics, and the effect of the intervention on quality of life domains. Health disparities coupled with unequal access to culturally relevant mental health treatments are consistently documented for older African Americans. Depression is a debilitating but treatable condition contributing to poor life quality. Our research will identify culturally-relevant depression treatment for African American elders, enhance service capacity of senior centers to treat depression in the community, and disseminate a replicable partnership model.             ",Treating Depression in African American Elders: A Community-Academic Partnership,8271512,R01MH079814,[''],NIMH,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R01,2010,476919,0.21064398028873774

The intervention's effectiveness will be evaluated using a mixed models analysis of variance (ANOVA) comparing the two groups, structural equation modeling (SEM), and evaluating the relationship between walking and body-fat loss. The results will have significance for women's health providers who seek to improve the long-term health of Hispanic women. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed project tests an intervention that can be integrated into the daily lives of Hispanic women following childbirth. The intervention will use culturally sensitive strategies and planned supports during walking activities to decrease body fat and postpartum depression symptoms, while improving the cellular processes related to excess body fat.           PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed project tests an intervention that can be integrated into the daily lives of Hispanic women following childbirth.

"Stress, depression, and the mother-infant relationship across the first year    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The current application seeks to investigate the role of chronic daily stress in the course of postpartum depression, the negative impact on infant cognitive and emotional development, and the mediating role of the mother-infant relationship on infant development. Chronic stress is linked to the onset and course of depression, and as many as 19% of women (49% of Mexican-American women) suffer from postpartum depression, making it a significant public health concern. Exposure to maternal depression during early infancy has significant long-term effects on several developmental processes. There is a substantial literature that details the negative effects of postpartum depression on infant adaptation, including deficits in both cognitive functioning and the development of emotion regulation skills. It is possible that these developmental competencies may be dependent upon mother-infant relationship quality, and that this relationship mediates the effects of maternal depression. The proposed research plan will test several models to address the role of daily stress, the impact of depression on the mother-infant relationship and infant competencies, and the mediational role of the quality of the mother-infant relationship on infant development. Data will be drawn from a larger longitudinal study that explores coregulatory processes between infants and their depressed, Mexican-American mothers. Measurements include maternal self-reports of stress, depression, and infant emotional regulation; observations of mother-infant interactions; and assessment of infant cognitive and emotional development across the first postpartum year. These data allow the opportunity to longitudinally explore important public health issues related to postpartum depression and infant development in a high risk population.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research has important public health implications due to high prevalence rates of postpartum depression in Mexican-American women and the significant impact it is found to have on infant development. Infants with early developmental risk are more likely to suffer from mental health issues, have poorer academic achievement through adolescence, and have poorer long-term adjustment. A better understanding of the mechanisms through which this negative impact operates is needed to inform prevention and intervention programs to promote healthy child development.           Project Narrative  The proposed research has important public health implications due to high prevalence rates of postpartum depression in Mexican-American women and the significant impact it is found to have on infant development.

"Reducing Disparities and Improving Care for Depression in OB-GYN Clinics    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Background: Major depressive episodes occur throughout a woman's lifespan, with the highest rates during the reproductive and menopausal transition years. During this time, OB-GYNs are the only providers whom many women regularly see. Low income and minority women are particularly likely to seek their routine care in OB-GYN clinics. There are marked gaps in accuracy of diagnosis and quality of depression care in OB-GYN clinics, with disparities in quality of depression care which exceed those seen in primary care clinics. Models incorporating depression care into clinical settings may be adaptable to OB-GYN settings but have not been tested outside of the perinatal period. Most women seen by OB-GYNs are not pregnant; thus, studies focusing solely on perinatal depression excludes a large number of women who could benefit from care. No studies to date have been completed that have adapted depression care models to OB-GYN clinics as a whole. Research Goal: We propose a three-part intervention, integrated with OB-GYN care, consisting of (i) enhanced education; (ii) engagement; and (iii) depression care management (with antidepressant monitoring and/or provision of brief psychotherapy). We hypothesize that a three-part depression intervention, integrated into the OB-GYN clinical setting, will improve treatment outcomes for depression, functional outcomes, and satisfaction with depression care. Study Design: In the proposed randomized controlled trial, 260 OB-GYN clinic patients with major depression and/or dysthymia will be assigned to either: 1) an integrated depression intervention or 2) usual care (UC). We will screen approximately 8,300 patients presenting for scheduled clinic appointments at two urban OB-GYN clinics over 18-months for major depression/dysthymia. A large number of these patients are low-income and minority women. Potentially eligible patients may also be referred by a clinic provider or reply to informational flyers posted in the clinics. The integrated depression intervention will last 12 months. Outcomes will be assessed at baseline and at 6, 12, and 18 months by telephone interviews by blinded research staff. Aims: Our Primary Aims are: 1) To evaluate, compared to UC, the impact of an integrated OB-GYN depression intervention on depression treatment outcomes, including change in depressive symptoms and depression treatment response; and 2) To evaluate, compared to UC, the impact of an integrated OB-GYN depression intervention on functional outcomes. Our Secondary Aims are: 3) To evaluate, compared to UC, the impact of an integrated OB-GYN depression intervention on quality of depression care indicators, including number of therapy visits, and dose, duration, and adherence to antidepressant medications; and on satisfaction with depression care, including patient and provider satisfaction, and provider attitudes toward depression care in OB-GYN clinics; and 4) [To identify potential facilitators and barriers to sustainability of the integrated OB-GYN intervention.]      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The results of our proposed randomized controlled trial will greatly impact public health by satisfying an unmet need for effective depression services for all women seen in the OB-GYN clinical setting. The potential improvements in depression treatment outcomes and quality of life for the large proportion of women who receive their care in this setting will be substantial.           The results of our proposed randomized controlled trial will greatly impact public health by satisfying an unmet need for effective depression services for all women seen in the OB-GYN clinical setting.

"Chronic Illness & Minor Depression: Community and CDSMP    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Minor depression alone and its co-occurrence with chronic diseases are under- recognized, under-treated and understudied. This proposed study uses theoretically driven mixed methodologies to understand key barriers and facilitators for the successful translation of an evidence-based intervention (EBI) - chronic disease self management programs (CDSMP) - into community settings for underserved Latinos who suffer from minor depression and co- occurring chronic disease. We have chosen CDSMP because of its strong evidence base and its ability to be delivered by lay health workers in various settings and reduce health disparities. New data show that minor depression exerts large costs, increases mortality when present in cardiac disease, and is not responsive to most interventions that are effective for major depression. This proposed study is aligned with CDC's performance goal to support prevention research to develop sustainable and transferable community-based behavioral interventions. We propose to partner with two community partners - Hispanic Service Council and Familia Sana and use ongoing funded community-based participatory research (CBPR) efforts for a three-phase study. This partnership will drive the understanding of important barriers and facilitators that need to be addressed for the successful adaptation of this EBI - that is, to make it contextually relevant, keep it effective and meet primary stakeholders' needs. In Hillsborough County area where we wish to do this work, the Latino population is over 20% and huge gaps in general and mental health services exist. The specific aims of this project are to: identify key stakeholder perspectives on multi- dimensional barriers and facilitators to the adoption of CDSMP into community settings; employ mixed methods to adapt CDSMP to best address those priority needs; and test the feasibility of implementing the adapted CDSMP using a lagged intervention design with outcome measurements over months, to estimate intervention parameters in preparation for a future large scale cross-county implementation study. This research is exceptionally relevant to public health because it seeks to improve health and functioning outcomes in a poor minority population that suffers from an important, highly prevalent and disabling condition - minor depression that co-occurs with chronic diseases - using community engagement for the adaptation, implementation and sustainability of an EBI.     Project Narrative  This research is exceptionally relevant to public health because it seeks to improve health and functioning outcomes in a poor minority population that suffers from an important, highly prevalent and disabling condition - minor depression that co-occurs with chronic diseases - using community engagement for the adaptation, implementation and sustainability of an EBI.",Chronic Illness & Minor Depression: Community and CDSMP,7934698,R18MN000004,[''],ODCDC,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH FLORIDA,R18,2010,534502,0.13383863377822755
"Coregulatory Processes and Postpartum Depression in Mexican-Americans    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The consequences of postpartum depression (PPD) extend far beyond the mother's mental health, and can have severe detrimental effects on marital relationships, parenting abilities, mother-infant bonding, and infant health and development. Although Latinos are the fastest growing population group in the US, few studies of PPD have been conducted with Latina women. Existing studies suggest a significantly elevated vulnerability to PPD for low income ethnic minority women. However, the trajectories of onset and recovery have not been well- described, and little is known about the influence of cultural-ecological risk and protective factors. Further, most research has failed to consider the fundamental role of the newborn baby and the ability of mother-infant interactions to influence the onset and course of PPD. This study will evaluate a community sample of 330 low-income Mexican American first- time mothers from the prenatal period through the first postpartum year. The development of PPD and the process of recovery will be examined using well-validated symptom and clinically diagnostic measures. Culturally-ecological factors will be examined that may either confer risk or offer protection from PPD. Repeated home observations of mother-infant interactions will be collected in the critical first 6 months following childbirth. The bio-psychosocial process by which mothers and infants co-regulate each other's emotions, behavior, and physiology will be analyzed and used to predict the longitudinal course of PPD over the first year. Findings will significantly enhance understanding of the impact of culturally-relevant risk and protective factors on the onset and course of PPD in a highly vulnerable population, and will identify innovative targets (e.g., mother-infant interactions) for future interventions. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Postpartum mood disorders, primarily depression, affect a large number of new mothers. Estimates range from 10-15 percent in general population samples. However, striking health disparities are evident in studies evaluating low-income and/or ethnic minority mothers, for whom prevalence rates from 24-49 percent have been reported. A large research literature documents the substantial detrimental public health impact of postpartum depression, not just for women, but for their partners and children as well. According to the World Health Organization (2007), depression is the leading cause of disability worldwide, and the fourth leading contributor to worldwide burden of disease. Infants and children of mothers who are depressed, especially those experiencing social disadvantage, face considerable short and long-term disadvantage, including lower birth weight, poorer cognitive development, higher rates of behavioral and social problems, and more frequent emotional problems. In Arizona, the largest percentages of new births are to Hispanic women, of whom the majority is classified as low-income. Population birth trends in Arizona (and the US as a whole), the magnitude of the public health impact of postpartum mood disorders, and the significant mental health disparities new Hispanic mothers experience argue for the critical need for further understanding of processes affecting the development of postpartum mood disorders in low-income Mexican American women.           Principal Investigator/Program Director (Last, First, Middle): Luecken, Linda J.

"Reducing Disparities in Depression Care for Ethnically Diverse Older Men    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The epidemic of suicide among older (i.e. age 60 and above) men in the US is a public health crisis. Older men have eight to ten-times higher rates of completed suicide than older women. Because depression is one of the strongest risk factors for suicide, improving care for depression in primary settings is a vital public health strategy to prevent suicide and other adverse outcomes of depression. Depression is more common in women than in men, but depressed older men and minorities are less likely to receive effective treatment. To address this knowledge gap and reduce disparities in older men and minorities, we propose a study that applies both qualitative and quantitative methods to better understand the perspectives, experiences, and preferences for care of ethnically diverse depressed older men and the primary care providers who treat them. Our focus gender-specific focus and attention to age-related factors will enable us to examine potentially important but under-studied variability among older men in how they experience and deal with their depression and will allow us to further develop our conceptual model and to develop strategies to engage more difficult to reach subgroups of diverse older men. Primary care is a logical site for this research because it is the setting where most depressed older men can potentially be recognized and treated. We will conduct systematic screening to identify a representative sample of 100 older men (50 Mexican-American and 50 white non- Hispanic) older men with treated and untreated clinical depression from primary care clinics in two cities and then conduct interviews with them and their primary care physicians (n = 48). This proposal's aims are 1) to examine how forms of masculinity and age-related changes and attitudes (i.e. health status, major role transitions, conceptions of normal aging) influence men's depression illness meanings, experience, and patterns of help-seeking, 2) to systematically examine older men's preferences for depression treatment, and 3) to identify factors that impede or facilitate depression care from the perspectives of primary care physicians. This proposal brings together an interdisciplinary group of investigators with extensive experience in working with older and minority populations and builds directly on published preliminary data (Hinton et al, 2006). It is the intention of this proposal to generate empirical data to help close the gender and ethnic gap in depression care, reduce associated health disparities, and mitigate high suicide rates in older men. Because depression is one of the strongest risk factors for suicide and because men who kill themselves frequently have had recent prior contact with their primary care physicians, improving care for depression in primary care settings is a vital public health strategy to prevent suicide and other adverse outcomes of depression. Depressed older men, however, are significantly less likely than women to receive effective depression treatment. Despite its public health importance, the barriers to depression care for older men are not well understood. Through a focused and in-depth examination of the perspectives and preferences of depressed older men and their primary care providers, this research will generate empirical data to reduce barriers to depression care for older men in primary care settings.          ",Reducing Disparities in Depression Care for Ethnically Diverse Older Men,7754441,R01MH080067,"['Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Collection ', ' Provider ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Endogenous depression ', ' clinical depression ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Address ', ' Epidemic ', ' Symptoms ', ' TimeLine ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Caring ', ' Qualitative Methods ', ' Data ', ' Strategic Planning ', ' Subgroup ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' trend ', ' Principal Investigator ', ' Modification ', ' socioeconomics ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomic ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio economic ', ' Face ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Killings ', ' Intention ', ' Freedom ', ' Liberty ', ' Age ', ' base ', ' human subject ', ' rural area ', ' Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Goals ', ' Label ', ' suicide rate ', ' Group Meetings ', ' improved ', ' Health Personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Health Status ', ' Level of Health ', ' General Hospitals ', ' Suicide prevention ', ' suicide intervention ', ' suicidality prevention ', ' prevent suicide ', ' prevent suicidality ', ' Suicide precaution ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Medical ', ' Insurance ', ' Interviewer ', ' Interview ', ' Screening procedure ', ' screenings ', ' screening ', ' Training ', ' Language ', ' disability ', ' Distress ', ' Individual ', ' Rural ', ' Ageism ', ' Sample Size ', ' Funding ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Mails ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Methods ', ' Mexican Americans ', ' Chicanos ', ' Chicanas ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' National Institute of Mental Health (U.S.) ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' NIMH ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Primary Care Physician ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Primary Care ', ' Shapes ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' Publishing ', ' Depressed mood ', ' sadness ', ' depressed ', ' Reading ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Sex Characteristics ', ' sexual dimorphism (noncellular) ', ' gender difference ', ' Sex Differences ', ' Sick Role ', ' Illness Behavior ', ' Social Sciences ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Suicide ', ' suicidality ', ' intent to die ', ' fatal suicide ', ' fatal attempt ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Telephone ', ' Phone ', ' Time ', ' Attention ', ' Attitude ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Clinic ', ' Source ', ' Pattern ', ' Location ', ' Postdoctoral Fellow ', ' post-doctoral ', ' post-doc ', ' Research Associate ', ' Postdoc ', ' preference ', ' Surgeon ', ' age group ', ' experience ', ' metropolitan ', ' Budgets ', ' Participant ', ' Study Subject ', ' help-seeking behavior ', ' help seeking ', ' Human Resources ', ' personnel ', ' Manpower ', ' Depression screen ', ' depression screening ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' CDC ', ' County ', ' Gender ', ' accomplished suicide ', ' completed suicide ', ' commit suicide ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Hispanics ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Latino ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' Uninsured ', ' theories ', ' Cities ', ' Accounting ', ' Communities ', ' Qualitative Research ', ' Complement ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' age related ', ' age dependent ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Minority ', ' care preference ', ' Population ', ' older women ', ' older men ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' normal aging ', ' high risk ', ' primary care setting ', ' treatment strategy ', ' effective therapy ', ' effective treatment ', ' adverse outcome ', ' adverse consequence ', ' Conceptions ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT DAVIS,R01,2010,449929,0.07210390872443814
"Madres para la Salud (Mothers for Health)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Pregnancy-associated weight gain and failure to lose weight after birth contributes to the development of overweight and obesity in Hispanic women, who have prevalence rates exceeding 70%. Recent evidence shows that obesity is associated with systemic and fat tissue inflammation which can facilitate the development of obesity-related chronic diseases and contributes to the development of postpartum depression. Despite the well-established beneficial effects of exercise on weight, women tend to underparticipate in physical activity during the childbearing years. Further, the mechanisms underpinning the interplay of overweight, obesity, physical activity, and subsequent risk such as inflammatory processes or postpartum depression are not clear. The proposed study seeks to test a social support intervention, ""Madres para la Salud"" [Mothers for Health], to explore the effectiveness of a culturally specific program using ""bouts"" of physical activity to effect changes in body fat, fat tissue inflammation, and postpartum depression symptoms in sedentary Hispanic women. This innovative program has the potential to advance our understanding of the relationship between moderate increases in physical activity and specific health outcomes. The study aims are to:1) Examine the effectiveness of the Madres para la Salud for reducing the distal outcomes in: (a) body fat (b) systemic and fat tissue inflammation and (c) PPD symptoms among postpartum Hispanic women compared with an attention control group, at 6 and 12 months, after controlling for dietary intake; 2) Test whether the theoretical mediators, intermediate outcomes, of social support and walking, and environmental factor moderators, affect changes in body fat; systemic and fat tissue inflammation; and PPD symptoms among postpartum Hispanic women at 6 and 12 months, and 3) Determine the relationship between the immediate outcome of walking (minutes walked per week) and change in the distal outcomes of: (a) body fat (b) systemic and fat tissue inflammation and (c) PPD symptoms. A prospective, randomized controlled trial will guide the study. A sample of 140 sedentary Hispanic women, 18-35 years, and between 6 weeks and 6 months following childbirth will be used. Participants will be randomly assigned to the intervention or attention-control group. The intervention group will have weekly walking sessions and support interventions with Promotoras. The attention-control group will receive health newsletters and follow-up phone calls. Data will be gathered at baseline, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months using questionnaires, fat tissue biopsies, blood samples, and a subset sample for DEXA body scans, as well as objective and self-report measures of walking adherence. The intervention's effectiveness will be evaluated using a mixed models analysis of variance (ANOVA) comparing the two groups, structural equation modeling (SEM), and evaluating the relationship between walking and body-fat loss. The results will have significance for women's health providers who seek to improve the long-term health of Hispanic women. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed project tests an intervention that can be integrated into the daily lives of Hispanic women following childbirth. The intervention will use culturally sensitive strategies and planned supports during walking activities to decrease body fat and postpartum depression symptoms, while improving the cellular processes related to excess body fat.

"Women Physical Disability and Depression: Communities Responding Now! Rates of depression and suicide in women with physical disabilities (WPD) are up to five times higher than in the general population.  Despite this disparity, few intervention studies that address the specific needs of this population are available.  To begin to address objective 6-3 of Healthy People 2010 and reduce the proportion of WPD who experience depressive symptoms, interventions relevant to the lives of WPD are urgently needed.  In keeping with national priorities and the need for consumer participation in the development of mental health therapies, the proposed project will use an existing cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) intervention that has demonstrated effectiveness in reducing depressive symptoms in women as a starting point from which to co-create an intervention that addresses the specific needs of WPD. The co-creation process will occur in the context of a partnership between the investigators, WPD in the community, and three Oregon Centers for Independent Living (CILs).  This partnership will be expanded to include four additional Oregon CILs during the last year of the proposed project for the purpose of developing a peer mentored train-the-trainer program that will facilitate consumer control and promote the sustainability of the intervention. The specific aims of the proposed project are to:  1.  Modify an existing cognitive behavioral group therapy intervention to address the specific needs of WPD who experience depressive symptoms; 2. Conduct an efficacy trial using a mixed-methods approach.  The proposed study outcomes were derived from our previous work with WPD as well as from members of the disability community.  An efficacy trial of the modified intervention with a total of 135 participants will be conducted using a wait list control design; and 3.  Develop a peer mentored train-the-trainer program to facilitate consumer control and promote the sustainability of the intervention.  A long-term goal of the proposed project is to increase the capacity of CILs across the country to offer a relevant, effective, accessible, and affordable intervention to help WPD with depression overcome this debilitating secondary condition.

"Risk and Protective Factors for Depression Among Racial Groups    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Past studies on major depression in different racial groups have yielded critical insights about mental illness in diverse communities. However, these studies have invariably treated racial groups as homogeneous categories rather than fully examining the heterogeneity within these groups. This is a revised R01 application by a New Junior Investigator that aims to investigate the social and psychological risk and protective factors for depression among African American, Caribbean Black, Asian American, Latino and White adults using existing national data. The proposed research will take advantage of comprehensive epidemiological data and sophisticated and innovative statistical methods to examine a wide range of risk and protective factors and their interactions, while also considering the heterogeneity within and between racial and ethnic groups. These relationships will be examined using the National Institute of Mental Health's Collaborative Psychiatric Epidemiology Surveys (CPES). The studies contain large samples of respondents of African American and Afro-Caribbean descent (National Survey of American Life), Latino and Asian descent (National Latino and Asian American Study), as well as a sample of the general population (National Comorbidity Study-Revised). The proposed application builds on previous research examining racial and ethnic health disparities in several important ways. First, it builds upon and advances previous empirical research on social relationships and depression by taking into account race/ethnicity, and immigration-related factors and how these factors influence the social relationships among diverse populations. Second, this research carefully focuses on the sociodemographic and other sources of heterogeneity that exist within and across these populations. Third, the proposed research will identify the pathways linking race and ethnicity to depression. This work is important in an etiologic sense, as it can lead to new knowledge about depression as a disease process across diverse populations. Finally, this research utilizes sophisticated statistical models to identify depression risk profiles by examining the social and contextual determinants of depression among a diverse sample of adults; which is important for identifying factors that define particular risk groups. The goal of this research is to identify those factors that will enhance current interventions, as well as provide information relevant to the development of new and innovative research-based interventions that meet the mental health needs of diverse populations. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Findings from the proposed investigation promise to increase our understanding of differences in risk and protective factors for different profiles of depression among diverse populations and will demonstrate a broader public health value in their utility in informing the design of targeted prevention and intervention programs for depression in adults that make use of existing, natural helping networks. More specifically, findings for the proposed research will inform the development, testing and translation of innovative interventions for adults with major depressive disorder. The goal of this research is to identify those factors that will enhance current interventions as well as develop new and innovative research-based interventions that meet the mental health needs of diverse populations.           Project Narrative Findings from the proposed investigation promise to increase our understanding of differences in risk and protective factors for different profiles of depression among diverse populations and will demonstrate a broader public health value in their utility in informing the design of targeted prevention and intervention programs for depression in adults that make use of existing, natural helping networks.

"Cost Effectiveness of a Home Support Program for Depression in Black Elders    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   This application addresses the broad Challenge Area (05) Comparative Effectiveness Research and specific Challenge Topic, 05-MH-102*: Cost Effectiveness of Mental Health Interventions. We propose a two year initiative to add a cost and outcome component which will enable us to perform a cost effectiveness analysis of our currently funded randomized controlled trial (NIMH R01MH079814) ""Treating Depression in Older African Americans"") that tests a novel 10- session home-based intervention to treat depression in older community-dwelling African Americans. The intervention, referred to as Beat the Blues (BTB), involves trained social workers who meet with participants to identify care management concerns, make referrals and linkages, provide depression education, develop tailored action plans to accomplish identified behavioral goals and enhance engagement in pleasurable activities, and teach stress reduction techniques for managing daily stressors (e.g., deep breathing). BTB uses a randomized two-group experimental design (treatment vs. wait-list control) in which all participants are screened twice for depressive symptoms (PHQ-9 >5) to determine study eligibility, randomly assigned, and then evaluated at 4 months on main study outcomes (PHQ-9 depression severity, quality of life, functional ability). At 4 months, the wait-list control group receives BTB in its entirety, and then all study participants are reassessed at 8 months to evaluate the maintenance of treatment effects for the treatment group, and whether the wait-list control group demonstrates similar improvements as the treatment group at 4 months. BTB is embedded in a senior center, Center in the Park (CIP) involving their agency staff as depression screeners and interventionists. Essential to translating BTB as a depression program for delivery by senior centers, is an understanding of its cost, outcomes, and cost effectiveness. Economic evaluations of home support programs for depression which target older African Americans and can be delivered by trained staff of a community-based agency are non- existent. The specific aims of our proposed study are to: 1. Calculate the cost of delivering BTB by senior center staff trained in the program; 2. Calculate the cost effectiveness of BTB from a societal perspective that employs two relevant outcome measures: cost per quality adjusted life year (QALY; Euro-QOL 5D vs. HUI2 and HU13 health utility measures), and cost per reduction in depression symptoms. Cost-effectiveness will be measured as the average incremental difference between cost of BTB and the control group divided by the difference in health utility (measured as QALYS) between treatment and control periods at 4 months, and at 8 months for the subsample of participants who receive BTB for the first 4 months and are observed for another 4 months. Univariate and probabilistic sensitivity analyses will be conducted to determine the incremental cost effectiveness of BTB at 8 months, and will aid in determining the robustness of the model when inpatient and outpatient medical and medication costs are varied. We also propose exploratory aims to: a) examine relationship between results of Euro-QOL 5D instrument (EQ-5D) and Health Utilities Index (HUI2 vs. HUI3) to inform preliminary recommendations as to which instrument is best suited for cost effectiveness in the BTB population; b) explore whether the cost effectiveness of BTB falls within established thresholds, and c) explore the application of these thresholds when applied to social-behavioral programs. This two year initiative overlaps with years 03-04 (of 5 years) of the original trial such that our proposal is feasible and can be accomplished within the structure/timeline of the parent study. The cost analyses will involve a subset (n=122/192) of participants for which we will be able to collect QALY measures. This study has potential for making a major impact on the science of economic evaluation by comparing different utility indices for their sensitivity with the target population, translational research by providing cost and cost effectiveness of a depression program for delivery by a senior center, and health policy by linking coverage decisions to adequate scientific evidence of treatment and cost effectiveness for an underserved group for whom mental health disparities persist. As the prevalence of late-life depression among older African Americans is high, an economic evaluation of BTB has great potential for improving the lives of this vulnerable population. Public Health Statement - BTB We propose an economic evaluation of a home support depression program for older African Americans elders.

"Internet Intervention to Prevent Major Depressive Episodes    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) Latino Mental Health Research Program, based at San Francisco General Hospital (SFGH), proposes to develop evidence-based Internet interventions in Spanish and English to prevent major depressive episodes (MDEs). The current pilot project has three aims designed to set the stage for a subsequent randomized control trial of such an Internet intervention:  Aim 1. Adaptation of a widely tested cognitive-behavioral intervention for Internet administration, and creation of a self-help research Website that will automatically recruit participants online, deliver the intervention online, and conduct follow-up assessments online.  Aim 2. Usability testing of the Website with Spanish- and English-speaking men and women from public sector health clinics to assess and optimize, prior to launching the online pilot study: accessibility to as wide a range of individuals as possible, to reduce disparities; understanding of informed consent for the study; and understanding of the various study measures (i.e., measures of depression, self-efficacy, and so on).  Aim 3. Conducting a nationwide online pilot study of the site in Spanish and English to examine: recruitment rates, response rates to specific ads to identify best recruitment strategies, and characteristics of responders; information on the effectiveness of informed consent procedures to enhance understanding of key aspects of the study; utilization patterns of each element of the site; and efficacy of methods to reduce follow-up attrition.  This application is responsive to NIMH Strategic Objective 3 (to develop new and better interventions that incorporate the diverse needs and circumstances of people with mental illnesses) and Objective 4 (to strengthen the public health impact of NIMH-supported research). The Internet intervention would provide a highly innovative means of delivering preventive mental health services for undertreated and underserved populations. An online intervention of this type has the potential to reach millions of individuals nationally and internationally, thereby maximizing the public health benefit of NIMH funding.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Major depression affects millions of people and is the number one cause of disability worldwide.

"Understanding Social Contributions to Disparities in Depression Care: US and UK    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Physicians' ability to communicate effectively with patients from ethnically and socially diverse backgrounds is essential to reducing health disparities. However, communication is not solely the task of medical professionals, patients also play a critical role in active participation in their care and in gaining the necessary confidence and competence to implement and continue treatment. The disparities that are evident within medical care reflect the interplay of social factors, including race, gender, age, literacy, and the cultural and normative expectations that guide the perspectives of both patients and physicians. The proposed investigation is designed to contribute to the disentangling of physician-derived and patient-derived contributions to social bias that may exacerbate health disparities associated with the provision and receipt of depression care and suicide risk assessment in the US and UK. In order to do so, we propose a novel approach in which videotape simulations are used to portray a depression -focused visit in primary care in which the ethnicity and gender of the participants have been experimentally manipulated. While sharing the context of a medical visit, the simulations differ in focus; one is designed to examine physicians' cognitive and clinical reasoning processes while the other explores patients' perceptions, responses and judgments related to the receipt of care. In the first study (for which data are already collected), visit simulations were shown to 128 US and UK physicians who were asked to take the role of the treating physician and provide a narrative account of their clinical reasoning. The second study shows simulated depression visits, in which patient and physician gender and ethnicity is experimentally manipulated, to 640 ethnically diverse male and female subjects in the US and UK. Subjects vicariously take the role of the depressed patient in the simulations to provide insights into their cognitive and affective reactions to care. In this way, we will be able to explore how subjects acting as analogue patients and physicians are influenced by gender and ethnicity in making medical care judgments in the context of the US and UK health care system and social structure. Study 3 will test the ecological validity of the analogue findings through the analysis of actual patient data in which physicians from different ethnic backgrounds have assessed patients' depression and suicide risk in an anonymised database. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: ability to communicate effectively with patients from ethnically and socially diverse backgrounds is essential to reducing health disparities. However amelioration of disparities is not solely the task of medical professionals: patients also play a critical role in active participation in care and acquisition of the confidence and competence necessary to implement and continue treatment. The proposed investigation is designed to contribute to the disentangling of physician-derived and patient-derived contributions to social bias that may exacerbate health disparities associated with the provision and receipt of depression care and suicide risk in the US and UK so that more effective interventions may be designed and implemented.           Public Health Relevance Physicians' ability to communicate effectively with patients from ethnically and socially diverse backgrounds is essential to reducing health disparities.

"FOR MOMS:Culturally Relevant Treatment for Perinatal Depression    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Among socio-economically disadvantaged minority and white women, depression during pregnancy and the postpartum is often under-detected and under-treated. Maternal postpartum depression has adverse, lasting effects on maternal, infant and child well-being. Depression during pregnancy has been demonstrated to be the most potent predictor of postpartum depression and appears to be linked to low birth weight and prematurity. Poor, urban women are at least twice as likely as middle-class women to meet diagnostic criteria for major depression during pregnancy. At the same time, depressed, disadvantaged women have been proven difficult to engage and retain in mental health treatment because they face numerous barriers to care at the patient, provider, and system levels. This proposed randomized, controlled trial will evaluate the effects of a culturally relevant, multicomponent intervention for antenatal depression (FOR MOMS, ""Maintain Our Mothers' Strength"") that has the potential to overcome patient, provider, and system-level barriers to care and engage depressed, low-income women in evidence-based treatments to reduce antenatal depressive symptoms, improve maternal psychosocial functioning, and ameliorate postpartum depression. This research will take advantage of the unique partnership between the Seattle King County Public Health Department (PHSKC) and the University of Washington's School of Social Work and Department of Psychiatry. We propose to enroll a sample of 220 depressed, pregnant women on Medicaid from PHSKC and will test the effectiveness of the FOR MOMS intervention relative to usual care for antenatal depression. FOR MOMS consists of a pre- treatment engagement session and a choice of brief interpersonal psychotherapy (IPT) or evidence-based pharmacotherapy. The engagement session and brief IPT for antenatal depression have been enhanced to reduce racial and economic disparities in treatment engagement and retention and have been shown to be effective in a pilot study. After study entry, assessments will be conducted at baseline and 3, 6, 12, and 18 months post-baseline, a time period designed to include the first postpartum year. We will examine the effects of the FOR MOMS intervention on clinical and functional outcomes and conduct an incremental cost effectiveness analysis of the costs and benefits of the intervention from a health and welfare agency perspective. Our study team is comprised of an interdisciplinary group of researchers with extensive expertise in health services research, health economics, and clinical research with depressed, low-income, minority women.

"Telepsychiatry & Culturally Sensitive Treatment of Depressed Asian Americans    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Asian Americans tend to underutilize mental health services compared to other ethnic groups, with delayed treatment and higher attrition rates (Kung, 2003). When suffering from symptoms of mental illnesses, many underserved Chinese Americans seek help from their primary care physicians (PCPs) (Yeung et al., 2004a). In 2003, the applicant received a Career Development Award to study the effectiveness of Culturally Sensitive Collaborative Treatment (CSCT) for the treatment of underserved Chinese Americans with major depressive disorder (MDD) in primary care. The key elements of CSCT are active screening to increase recognition of depressed patients, culturally sensitive consultation by a psychiatrist and care management. Preliminary findings show that CSCT improves case recognition, facilitates engagement, and decreases the disparities of treatment among underserved Chinese Americans with MDD (Yeung et al., 2006; Yeung, 2007). This proposed study will investigate the feasibility and effectiveness of using Telepsychiatry-based CSCT (T-CSCT) to extend the CSCT model to underserved Chinese Americans in remote clinics. The specific aims of this study are: 1) To investigate whether telepsychiatry consultation is acceptable to underserved Chinese Americans with MDD and to their PCPs, and 2) To investigate the effectiveness of T-CSCT on improving treatment outcomes of underserved Chinese Americans with MDD in remote clinics. Subjects will be recruited by depression screening in primary care clinics and by advertisements to promote depression self-screening. Two hundred underserved Chinese American patients who screen positive for MDD will be randomized to receive either T-CSCT or Usual Care (UC). Treatment outcomes of patients in these two groups will be compared. This study will examine the acceptability and effectiveness of telepsychiatry- based culturally sensitive psychiatric treatment for underserved Chinese Americans with major depressive disorder. The goal is to increase access to mental health services and to decrease disparities in the treatment of depression among ethnic minority patients.          ",Telepsychiatry & Culturally Sensitive Treatment of Depressed Asian Americans,7890385,R01MH079831,"['Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Major Depressive Disorder ', ' major depression ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Elements ', ' Videoconferencing ', ' Videoconferences ', ' Symptoms ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Caring ', ' Adherence (attribute) ', ' Adherence ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' K-Series Research Career Programs ', ' Research Career Program ', ' K-Awards ', ' Career Development Programs K-Series ', ' Career Development Awards and Programs ', ' Career Development Awards ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Chinese People ', ' Chinese ', ' Telemedicine ', ' Health Professional ', ' Healthcare professional ', ' Health Care Professional ', ' active method ', ' active treatment ', ' active technique ', ' base ', ' Goals ', ' improved ', ' Health ', ' Psychiatric therapeutic procedure ', ' psychiatric treatment ', ' psychiatric therapy ', ' psychiatric care ', ' Interview ', ' Screening procedure ', ' screenings ', ' screening ', ' insanity ', ' satisfaction ', ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health Services ', ' Mental Hygiene Services ', ' Patients ', ' Primary Care Physician ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Primary Care ', ' Psychiatrist ', ' Questionnaires ', ' Depressed mood ', ' sadness ', ' depressed ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' recruit ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Psychiatric Diagnosis ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Stigmatization ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Asian Americans ', ' Translating ', ' Use Effectiveness ', ' Work ', ' Clinic ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' Distant ', ' Pattern ', ' Mental disorders ', ' psychological disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Familiarity ', ' Manuscripts ', ' help-seeking behavior ', ' help seeking ', ' outreach ', ' Case Manager ', ' Case Management Nurse ', ' Care Manager ', ' sensitivity training ', ' Depression screen ', ' depression screening ', ' Chinese American ', ' Treatment outcome ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' chronic disorder ', ' chronic disease/disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Modeling ', ' Specialist ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Acculturation ', ' Cultural Assimilation ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' Advertisements ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' primary care setting ', ' treatment as usual ', ' usual care ', ' Consultations ', ' ']",NIMH,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R01,2010,358425,0.043059893616054584
"Moderated Mediational Model of Emergent Sex Differences in Adolescent Depression    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): One in four girls, compared to one in eight boys, is likely to warrant a diagnosis of Major Depressive Disorder by the time she finishes adolescence. What exactly causes these disturbing sex differences is at the center of decades of intense research and debate, yielding few definitive answers thus far. Recent support has emerged for Response Style Theory, positing that gender differences in rumination, or the tendency to perseverate about symptoms and causes of one's depression, may explain a large part of the these sex differences (Nolen-Hoeksema, 1994). The mechanisms by which rumination causes this gender disparity, however, are still unknown. This study proposes to test a new moderated mediational model of rumination in middle childhood and early adolescence to help explain the sex differences in prevalence rates of depression during adolescence. Our application examines how female gender identification may mediate the relation between sex and rumination, and how rumination may in turn mediate the link to depressive symptoms. Furthermore, we will look at how this model is moderated by the effects of age and pubertal development. We hypothesize that this mediational model will explain why the sex-depression link only becomes evident during adolescence, but not in childhood. Adding such a moderational component to the model will help explain why pre-pubertal girls and boys have similar rates of depression, but girls become more likely to develop depressive symptoms later on. We will administer questionnaires to 450 students, their parents, and their teachers in grades 4, 6 and 8 at three time points during the school year (approximately 3 months apart). We will use latent variable structural equation modeling (SEM) to test our mediational hypotheses and multi-group SEM to test our moderational hypotheses. By advancing our understanding of the emergent gender difference in depressive symptoms, we will contribute to knowledge about the etiology of depression for both males and females. This knowledge will enable clinicians to target high-risk youth for prevention and intervention programs and will facilitate the distribution of resources to those who need them most. This project dovetails nicely with the priority given to research on gender differences in adolescent depression by the Division of Pediatric Translational Research and Treatment Development.           ",Moderated Mediational Model of Emergent Sex Differences in Adolescent Depression,7750603,F31MH079670,"['Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Major Depressive Disorder ', ' major depression ', ' Etiology ', ' disease causation ', ' causation ', ' Causality ', ' Elements ', ' Emotions ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Cognitive ', ' Translational Research ', ' translation research enterprise ', ' translation research ', ' Translational Science ', ' Translational Research Enterprise ', ' sex ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Adolescence ', ' teenage ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' Female ', ' Male Adolescents ', ' adolescent boy ', ' Adoption ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Gender Role ', ' Sex Roles ', ' Age ', ' Goals ', ' Adolescent ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Link ', ' teacher ', ' Childhood ', ' pediatric ', ' male ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Structural Models ', ' Parents ', ' Humulus ', ' Hops ', ' Questionnaires ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Schools ', ' Sex Characteristics ', ' sexual dimorphism (noncellular) ', ' gender difference ', ' Sex Differences ', ' Knowledge ', ' Students ', ' Testing ', ' Thinking, function ', ' thoughts ', ' Thinking ', ' Time ', ' Woman ', ' interest ', ' Equation ', ' age group ', ' success ', ' cohort ', ' intervention program ', ' skills ', ' Mediation ', ' Negotiation ', ' Negotiating ', ' Prevention ', ' Gender ', "" Women's Role "", ' Female Roles ', ' depressive symptoms ', ' depressive ', ' depression symptom ', ' Emotional Depression ', ' Mediating ', ' Modeling ', ' boys ', ' girls ', ' response ', ' Youth ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' theories ', ' age effect ', ' aging effect ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' coping ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' Early treatment ', ' early therapy ', ' early intervention ', ' therapy development ', ' treatment development ', ' intervention development ', ' develop therapy ', ' high risk ', ' early adolescence ', ' longitudinal design ', ' ']",NIMH,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY,F31,2010,13811,0.07649429169102505
"Population-Based Psychiatric Intervention in Primary Care    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This is a request for a competing renewal of an NIMH Midcareer Investigator Award in Patient-Oriented Research (NIMH staff has advised Dr. Katon that he could submit a competing renewal of his K-24 award as a full professor). This K-24 will build on Dr. Katon's prior research in: 1) developing innovative ""collaborative care"" interventions to improve the quality of care and outcomes of patients with depressive and anxiety disorders within primary care settings; 2) improving understanding about the adverse impact of anxiety and depressive disorders in patients with common medical disorders; and 3) developing interventions to improve psychiatric outcomes in patients with chronic medical illness and comorbid depressive and anxiety disorders. The specific aims of this proposal include: 1) to continue to enhance Dr. Katon's epidemiologic, biostatistical and health economic skills in order to demonstrate in population-based studies the bidirectional adverse interactions between depression and chronic medical illness. The evidence from these population- based studies will be developed by a) showing in cross-sectional and longitudinal studies the adverse impact of depression on medical symptom burden, functional impairment, adherence to medical regimens, medical complications and mortality; and b) by demonstrating in longitudinal studies that residual depressive symptoms and incident complications of medical illness are associated with a higher risk of developing major depression and new deficits in functioning. Additional aims include: 2) to develop and test adaptations of collaborative care models in patients with depression and chronic medical illness that are targeted at improving medical disease control, behavioral risk factors, as well as improving quality of depression care; 3) to continue to adapt collaborative care interventions and test their effectiveness in new populations experiencing disparities in quality of mental health care such as adolescent populations with depression, youth with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) living in rural settings, and women with depression treated in Ob-Gyn settings; and 4) To continue to expand Dr. Katon's mentorship of junior investigators in mental health services research. These goals will be met through continued and expanded research activities, coursework in epidemiology, biostatistics and health economics and mentorship from external consultants. These courses, interactions with mentors, and mentored readings will improve Dr. Katon's ability as a mentor as well as enhancing the cutting edge research of his Health Services Division. RELEVANCE: The research that will be completed during the course of this award will increase knowledge about the importance of screening for and treating depression in patients with chronic medical illnesses; test new models of care in patients with depression and chronic medical illnesses aimed at improving quality of quality of depression and medical care; and adapt the collaborative care model to new populations (youth with ADHD and depression and women treated in Ob-Gyn settings) that experience disparities in quality of mental health care.           ",Population-Based Psychiatric Intervention in Primary Care,7799157,K24MH069471,"['Coronary heart disease ', ' coronary disorder ', ' Coronary Disease ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Depressive disorder ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ', ' attention deficit hyperactive disorder ', ' Predominantly Hyperactive-Impulsive Type Hyperactivity Disorder ', ' Predominantly Hyperactive-Impulsive Type Attention-Deficit Disorder ', ' Hyperkinetic Syndrome ', ' Hyperactivity Disorder NOS ', ' ADHD ', ' AD/HD ', ' Major Depressive Disorder ', ' major depression ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Symptoms ', ' Caring ', ' Adherence (attribute) ', ' Adherence ', ' Midcareer Investigator Award in Patient-Oriented Research ', ' Midcareer Investigator Award in Patient-Oriented Research (K24) ', ' K24 Program ', ' K24 Mechanism ', ' Subgroup ', ' Behavioral ', ' Fasting ', ' fasts ', ' fasted ', ' Telemedicine ', ' Guidelines ', ' Glucose ', ' Dextrose ', ' D-Glucose ', ' base ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Gynecology ', ' improved ', ' Health Services Research ', ' services research ', ' Medical Care Research ', ' Healthcare Research ', ' Health Services Evaluation ', ' Health Care Research ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Residual state ', ' Residual ', ' Medical ', ' Adolescent ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Screening procedure ', ' screenings ', ' screening ', ' medical complication ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' Rural ', ' Research Activity ', ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health Services ', ' Mental Hygiene Services ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Mortality ', ' National Institute of Mental Health (U.S.) ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' NIMH ', ' Epidemiologic Studies ', ' epidemiologic investigation ', ' Epidemiology Research ', ' Epidemiological Studies ', ' Epidemiologic Research ', ' Discipline of obstetrics ', ' Obstetrics ', ' Patients ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Primary Care ', ' Anxiety ', ' Anxiety Disorders ', ' Reading ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Support ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Testing ', ' Woman ', ' Award ', ' Pattern ', ' Biometry ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Biometrics ', ' meetings ', ' chronic depression ', ' Chronic depressive personality disorder ', ' Chronic depressive disorder ', ' Blood Pressure ', ' experience ', ' professor ', ' skills ', ' Treatment outcome ', ' depressive symptoms ', ' depressive ', ' depression symptom ', ' Emotional Depression ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' chronic disorder ', ' chronic disease/disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Modeling ', ' Quality of Care ', ' QOC ', ' Youth ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' functional disability ', ' Functional impairment ', ' Adverse effects ', ' treatment adverse effect ', ' therapy adverse effect ', ' side effect ', ' Treatment Side Effects ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' disorder control ', ' disease control ', ' cost ', ' health economics ', ' care systems ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' collaborative care ', ' high risk ', ' population based ', ' primary care setting ', ' Regimen ', ' adverse outcome ', ' adverse consequence ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,K24,2010,152444,0.1598081010008386
"Methylphenidate Use to Improve Outcomes in Geriatric Depression    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Fewer than 50% of elderly depressed patients achieve remission and functional recovery in response to first-line antidepressant pharmacotherapy. The majority of patients are left with significant residual symptoms, putting them at risk of chronic, relapsing illness, frailty, and suicide. Improved understanding of neurobiology of geriatric depression and mechanisms of treatment response may lead to the improved clinical management of this pervasive and disabling disorder. While the serotonin system has been the focus of pharmacotherapy in unipolar major depression, there is a compelling rationale for the study of other monoamine systems. Impairment of executive functions persists even after amelioration of depressive symptoms and that these symptoms are poorly responsive to serotonergic treatment alone. We hypothesized that the addition of methylphenidate (MPH) to the serotonergic drug, citalopram, may result in better clinical outcomes of the affective and cognitive symptoms of late life depression. These considerations provided the impetus for our pilot study to evaluate the treatment response of the combination of citalopram and methylphenidate (MPH) compared to citalopram and placebo. We observed enhanced antidepressant response and improvement in executive cognitive function tests to a combination of citalopram and methylphenidate (MPH). The improvement in executive function was greater in patients who were homozygous for the dopamine transporter genotype (DAT VNTR10/10). The current proposal will evaluate the role of adjunctive MPH treatment to determine the effects of pharmacologic increase of dopamine on the clinical and cognitive response to selective serotonin reuptake (SSRI) treatment. We will also explore the role of the candidate genes involved in the regulation of dopaminergic neurotransmission (i.e., COMT, DAT1, DRD4) and sertonergic neurotransmission (i.e., HTR2A) in the clinical and cognitive response to treatment with methylphenidate and citalopram. We will recruit 168 elderly non-demented subjects with major depression to participate in a double-blind randomized placebo- controlled trial. Participants will be randomly assigned to three groups: one group will receive combination of citalopram and MPH, the second group will receive MPH and placebo, and the third group will receive citalopram and placebo. All subjects will undergo comprehensive medical, neuropsychiatric and cognitive assessments, and genetic testing at baseline and over the 16 weeks of treatment. Our study will provide the unique information regarding the use of methylphenidate to improve cognitive and clinical outcomes, and will shed light on the underlying mechanism of treatment response in geriatric depression. Evaluating selected dopamine-related genes in late-life depression with respect to mood and cognitive symptoms, and treatment response may lead to the development of the targeted individualized treatments in geriatric depression.             ",Methylphenidate Use to Improve Outcomes in Geriatric Depression,7756615,R01MH077650,"['Motivation ', ' Functional disorder ', ' pathophysiology ',

"Treating Depression in African American Elders: A Community-Academic Partnership    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This application is in response to the NIH-NIMH program announcement (PAR-05-026) ""Community Participation in Research."" Based on a strong collaborative partnership between an academic research center at Thomas Jefferson University, and a senior center, Center in the Park (CIP), we plan to test the effectiveness of an in-home intervention to treat depression in 192 urban African American elders. Using a two group randomized trial, we will test a brief intervention that combines evidentiary components (depression education, stress reduction, referral, care management and behavioral activation) and mode of delivery (in-home) that resonate with the socio-cultural attributes of the target community. Participants will be enrolled from over 6,000 CIP members who screen positive for depressive symptoms. Study participants will be interviewed at baseline at home and then randomized to treatment or a wait-list control group. Participants in treatment will receive up to 10 in-home sessions from a CIP social worker while wait-list controls will receive usual care. All participants will be reassessed at 4 months by telephone (main trial endpoint) at which point wait-list controls will be offered the intervention and then all study participants will be reassessed at 8 months by telephone. Specific study aims are to: 1 )Test the immediate effect of the intervention at 4-months on depression (between group comparison); 2) Test the maintenance effect of the intervention at 8-months on depression (within group comparison); 3) Evaluate acceptability (social validity) of the intervention and engagement in targeted activities (experimental and wait-list control participants). A secondary aim will assess the feasibility of conducting a clinical trial embedded in a community setting and its dissemination using a community-academic partnership. Three exploratory aims will evaluate the mediational role of behavioral activation, differential treatment effects based on participant characteristics, and the effect of the intervention on quality of life domains. Health disparities coupled with unequal access to culturally relevant mental health treatments are consistently documented for older African Americans. Depression is a debilitating but treatable condition contributing to poor life quality. Our research will identify culturally-relevant depression treatment for African American elders, enhance service capacity of senior centers to treat depression in the community, and disseminate a replicable partnership model.             ",Treating Depression in African American Elders: A Community-Academic Partnership,7897666,R01MH079814,"['Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Symptoms ', ' Caring ', ' stress management ', ' stress buffering ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Characteristics ', ' Behavioral ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' Age ', ' base ', ' Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Aged, 80 and over ', ' Oldest Old ', ' Aging ', ' Health ', ' Interview ', ' Training ', ' Distress ', ' insight ', ' Long-Term Effects ', ' Longterm Effects ', ' Licensing ', ' Living Arrangement ', ' Maintenance ', ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Collaborations ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Philadelphia ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' recruit ', ' Research ', ' Research Design ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Social Workers ', ' programs ', ' Stress ', ' Target Populations ', ' Telephone ', ' Phone ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Universities ', ' Waiting Lists ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' Services ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' Participant ', ' member ', ' NIH Program Announcements ', ' Program Announcement ', ' Applied Research ', ' Applied Science ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' Gender ', ' brief intervention ', ' brief treatment ', ' brief therapy ', ' Treatment outcome ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' depressive symptoms ', ' depressive ', ' depression symptom ', ' Emotional Depression ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' chronic disorder ', ' chronic disease/disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' clinical investigation ', ' Communities ', ' Community Participation ', ' Community Services ', ' comparison group ', ' geriatric depression ', ' late life depression ', ' Elderly depression ', ' functional decline ', ' decline in function ', ' depression education ', ' depression outreach ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' Coupled ', ' community based service ', ' treatment effect ', ' community based participatory research ', ' aging population ', ' population aging ', ' high risk ', ' community setting ', ' group intervention ', ' treatment as usual ', ' usual care ', ' intervention effect ', ' randomized trial ', ' Control Groups ', ' ']",NIMH,THOMAS JEFFERSON UNIVERSITY,R01,2010,123833,0.21064398028873774
"Cost Effectiveness of a Home Support Program for Depression in Black Elders    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   This application addresses the broad Challenge Area (05) Comparative Effectiveness Research and specific Challenge Topic, 05-MH-102*: Cost Effectiveness of Mental Health Interventions. We propose a two year initiative to add a cost and outcome component which will enable us to perform a cost effectiveness analysis of our currently funded randomized controlled trial (NIMH R01MH079814) ""Treating Depression in Older African Americans"") that tests a novel 10- session home-based intervention to treat depression in older community-dwelling African Americans. The intervention, referred to as Beat the Blues (BTB), involves trained social workers who meet with participants to identify care management concerns, make referrals and linkages, provide depression education, develop tailored action plans to accomplish identified behavioral goals and enhance engagement in pleasurable activities, and teach stress reduction techniques for managing daily stressors (e.g., deep breathing). BTB uses a randomized two-group experimental design (treatment vs. wait-list control) in which all participants are screened twice for depressive symptoms (PHQ-9 >5) to determine study eligibility, randomly assigned, and then evaluated at 4 months on main study outcomes (PHQ-9 depression severity, quality of life, functional ability). At 4 months, the wait-list control group receives BTB in its entirety, and then all study participants are reassessed at 8 months to evaluate the maintenance of treatment effects for the treatment group, and whether the wait-list control group demonstrates similar improvements as the treatment group at 4 months. BTB is embedded in a senior center, Center in the Park (CIP) involving their agency staff as depression screeners and interventionists. Essential to translating BTB as a depression program for delivery by senior centers, is an understanding of its cost, outcomes, and cost effectiveness. Economic evaluations of home support programs for depression which target older African Americans and can be delivered by trained staff of a community-based agency are non- existent. The specific aims of our proposed study are to: 1. Calculate the cost of delivering BTB by senior center staff trained in the program; 2. Calculate the cost effectiveness of BTB from a societal perspective that employs two relevant outcome measures: cost per quality adjusted life year (QALY; Euro-QOL 5D vs. HUI2 and HU13 health utility measures), and cost per reduction in depression symptoms. Cost-effectiveness will be measured as the average incremental difference between cost of BTB and the control group divided by the difference in health utility (measured as QALYS) between treatment and control periods at 4 months, and at 8 months for the subsample of participants who receive BTB for the first 4 months and are observed for another 4 months. Univariate and probabilistic sensitivity analyses will be conducted to determine the incremental cost effectiveness of BTB at 8 months, and will aid in determining the robustness of the model when inpatient and outpatient medical and medication costs are varied. We also propose exploratory aims to: a) examine relationship between results of Euro-QOL 5D instrument (EQ-5D) and Health Utilities Index (HUI2 vs. HUI3) to inform preliminary recommendations as to which instrument is best suited for cost effectiveness in the BTB population; b) explore whether the cost effectiveness of BTB falls within established thresholds, and c) explore the application of these thresholds when applied to social-behavioral programs. This two year initiative overlaps with years 03-04 (of 5 years) of the original trial such that our proposal is feasible and can be accomplished within the structure/timeline of the parent study. The cost analyses will involve a subset (n=122/192) of participants for which we will be able to collect QALY measures. This study has potential for making a major impact on the science of economic evaluation by comparing different utility indices for their sensitivity with the target population, translational research by providing cost and cost effectiveness of a depression program for delivery by a senior center, and health policy by linking coverage decisions to adequate scientific evidence of treatment and cost effectiveness for an underserved group for whom mental health disparities persist. As the prevalence of late-life depression among older African Americans is high, an economic evaluation of BTB has great potential for improving the lives of this vulnerable population. Public Health Statement - BTB We propose an economic evaluation of a home support depression program for older African Americans elders. Our study will contribute to the science of economic evaluation by comparing utility indices for sensitivity with an older African American depressed population, translational research to enable delivery by a community organization, and health policy by linking coverage decisions to adequate scientific evidence of cost effectiveness.               Public Health Statement - BTB We propose an economic evaluation of a home support depression program for older African Americans elders.

"Telepsychiatry & Culturally Sensitive Treatment of Depressed Asian Americans    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Asian Americans tend to underutilize mental health services compared to other ethnic groups, with delayed treatment and higher attrition rates (Kung, 2003). When suffering from symptoms of mental illnesses, many underserved Chinese Americans seek help from their primary care physicians (PCPs) (Yeung et al., 2004a). In 2003, the applicant received a Career Development Award to study the effectiveness of Culturally Sensitive Collaborative Treatment (CSCT) for the treatment of underserved Chinese Americans with major depressive disorder (MDD) in primary care. The key elements of CSCT are active screening to increase recognition of depressed patients, culturally sensitive consultation by a psychiatrist and care management. Preliminary findings show that CSCT improves case recognition, facilitates engagement, and decreases the disparities of treatment among underserved Chinese Americans with MDD (Yeung et al., 2006; Yeung, 2007). This proposed study will investigate the feasibility and effectiveness of using Telepsychiatry-based CSCT (T-CSCT) to extend the CSCT model to underserved Chinese Americans in remote clinics. The specific aims of this study are: 1) To investigate whether telepsychiatry consultation is acceptable to underserved Chinese Americans with MDD and to their PCPs, and 2) To investigate the effectiveness of T-CSCT on improving treatment outcomes of underserved Chinese Americans with MDD in remote clinics. Subjects will be recruited by depression screening in primary care clinics and by advertisements to promote depression self-screening. Two hundred underserved Chinese American patients who screen positive for MDD will be randomized to receive either T-CSCT or Usual Care (UC). Treatment outcomes of patients in these two groups will be compared. This study will examine the acceptability and effectiveness of telepsychiatry- based culturally sensitive psychiatric treatment for underserved Chinese Americans with major depressive disorder. The goal is to increase access to mental health services and to decrease disparities in the treatment of depression among ethnic minority patients.          ",Telepsychiatry & Culturally Sensitive Treatment of Depressed Asian Americans,8115120,R01MH079831,"['ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' Chinese American ', ' Chinese People ', ' Chinese ', ' Distant ', ' Major Depressive Disorder ', ' major depression ', ' Mental Health Services ', ' Mental Hygiene Services ', ' Asian Americans ', ' Videoconferences ', ' Primary Care Physician ', ' outreach ', ' Case Manager ', ' Case Management Nurse ', ' Care Manager ', ' treatment as usual ', ' usual care ', ' K-Series Research Career Programs ', ' Research Career Program ', ' K-Awards ', ' Career Development Programs K-Series ', ' Career Development Awards and Programs ', ' Career Development Awards ', ' Health Professional ', ' Healthcare professional ', ' Health Care Professional ', ' active method ', ' active treatment ', ' active technique ', ' satisfaction ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' chronic disorder ', ' chronic disease/disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Adherence (attribute) ', ' Adherence ', ' Depressed mood ', ' sadness ', ' depressed ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' Work ', ' Clinic ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' recruit ', ' Mental disorders ', ' psychological disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' Treatment outcome ', ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Patients ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Familiarity ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Communication ', ' Modeling ', ' Testing ', ' Consultations ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Questionnaires ', ' Technology ', ' Life ', ' Acculturation ', ' Cultural Assimilation ', ' Specialist ', ' Knowledge ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' base ', ' Symptoms ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Interview ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Primary Care ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Outcome ', ' Pattern ', ' Communities ', ' Caring ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Screening procedure ', ' screenings ', ' screening ', ' improved ', ' Translating ', ' Manuscripts ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Elements ', ' Use Effectiveness ', ' Advertisements ', ' sensitivity training ', ' Psychiatrist ', ' Depression screen ', ' depression screening ', ' Psychiatric therapeutic procedure ', ' psychiatric treatment ', ' psychiatric therapy ', ' psychiatric care ', ' help-seeking behavior ', ' help seeking ', ' Videoconferencing ', ' insanity ', ' Stigmatization ', ' Telemedicine ', ' Psychiatric Diagnosis ', ' primary care setting ', ' ']",NIMH,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R01,2011,354841,0.043059893616054584
"Coregulatory Processes and Postpartum Depression in Mexican-Americans    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The consequences of postpartum depression (PPD) extend far beyond the mother's mental health, and can have severe detrimental effects on marital relationships, parenting abilities, mother-infant bonding, and infant health and development. Although Latinos are the fastest growing population group in the US, few studies of PPD have been conducted with Latina women. Existing studies suggest a significantly elevated vulnerability to PPD for low income ethnic minority women. However, the trajectories of onset and recovery have not been well- described, and little is known about the influence of cultural-ecological risk and protective factors. Further, most research has failed to consider the fundamental role of the newborn baby and the ability of mother-infant interactions to influence the onset and course of PPD. This study will evaluate a community sample of 330 low-income Mexican American first- time mothers from the prenatal period through the first postpartum year. The development of PPD and the process of recovery will be examined using well-validated symptom and clinically diagnostic measures. Culturally-ecological factors will be examined that may either confer risk or offer protection from PPD. Repeated home observations of mother-infant interactions will be collected in the critical first 6 months following childbirth. The bio-psychosocial process by which mothers and infants co-regulate each other's emotions, behavior, and physiology will be analyzed and used to predict the longitudinal course of PPD over the first year. Findings will significantly enhance understanding of the impact of culturally-relevant risk and protective factors on the onset and course of PPD in a highly vulnerable population, and will identify innovative targets (e.g., mother-infant interactions) for future interventions. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Postpartum mood disorders, primarily depression, affect a large number of new mothers. Estimates range from 10-15 percent in general population samples. However, striking health disparities are evident in studies evaluating low-income and/or ethnic minority mothers, for whom prevalence rates from 24-49 percent have been reported. A large research literature documents the substantial detrimental public health impact of postpartum depression, not just for women, but for their partners and children as well. According to the World Health Organization (2007), depression is the leading cause of disability worldwide, and the fourth leading contributor to worldwide burden of disease. Infants and children of mothers who are depressed, especially those experiencing social disadvantage, face considerable short and long-term disadvantage, including lower birth weight, poorer cognitive development, higher rates of behavioral and social problems, and more frequent emotional problems. In Arizona, the largest percentages of new births are to Hispanic women, of whom the majority is classified as low-income. Population birth trends in Arizona (and the US as a whole), the magnitude of the public health impact of postpartum mood disorders, and the significant mental health disparities new Hispanic mothers experience argue for the critical need for further understanding of processes affecting the development of postpartum mood disorders in low-income Mexican American women.           Principal Investigator/Program Director (Last, First, Middle): Luecken, Linda J.

"Exploring CBT-DM's Absoulte and Relative Efficacy for Depressed T1DM Latino Youth    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is an R03 (PAR-09-223) application submitted to NIDDK. This study entails the revision of the 12-session Group Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT-DM) manual for depressed Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (T1DM) Latino youth, and explores both the absolute efficacy of CBT-DM against a treatment as usual (TAU) condition, and the added impact of CBT-DM over the original culturally-adapted CBT for depression. After initial manual revision by our expert team, in-depth interviews with diabetes treatment providers, and a small pre-pilot study with 8 depressed T1DM Latino youth and their parents will be conducted to inform the revision of and further refine CBT-DM treatment manual. Focus groups with youth and parents in the small pre-pilot study will serve to complete the refinement process. Finally, 60 depressed T1DM youth will be randomized to one of three conditions: CBT-DM, CBT for depression, and TAU. Treatment efficacy will be assessed by comparing changes on depression, self-esteem and functionality scores, diabetes self-efficacy and quality of life, and treatment adherence and self-care management of T1DM. We propose that both CBT-DM and CBT will be superior to TAU in reducing depression, and improving self-esteem and functionality. We also hypothesize that CBT-DM will be superior to the other conditions in domains related to T1DM (diabetes self-efficacy, quality of life, treatment adherence and self-care behaviors). Intake data will be obtained with structured diagnostic interviews, self-report scales and laboratory tests of glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c). We will assess youth T1DM health and treatment adherence information, mental health (including depression) diagnostic status, youth cognitive and affective variables, parent and family functioning, and family knowledge about youth depression and T1DM. We will also evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of treatment, the adequacy of randomization, attrition rates, therapist competence and treatment integrity. The assessment will be conducted at baseline, at weeks 5, 9 and 12 (post-treatment), and at the three- and six-month follow-ups. This investigation is the second step in a research program aimed to bring the benefits of evidence-based treatment (EBT) development to Latino youth with comorbid T1DM and depression, and set the stage for a larger-scale and definite study of treatment efficacy (R01). This study is innovative because it is the first that could potentially contribute to provide initial evidence in support of the probably-efficacious status of a psychosocial intervention aimed at both improving diabetes health status and reducing depressive symptoms in youth. The revised CBT-DM manual for T1DM Latino youth would also be an innovative clinical tool that could enhance the prevention of mood disorders and the reduction of health disparities in this minority group.   PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This study is likely to shed light on whether a novel intervention combining CBT with diabetes education for youth can reduce the morbidity observed in those with co-morbid T1DM and depression and achieve positive diabetes outcomes, as opposed to Treatment as usual (TAU) and CBT for depression. It will be the first to develop/adapt and pilot-test (in a small Randomized Clinical Trial-type design) a culturally-sensitive intervention specifically tailored to Latino youth with co-morbid T1DM and depression, and if proven to be promising, it will make it attractive for administrators to implement it in primary care and mental health settings serving the Latino pediatric population. This research will potentially help to close knowledge gaps in treatment research with T1DM Latino children and impact other behavioral, cognitive, and affective factors that add on the burden of diabetes in this vulnerable and underserved group.        This study is likely to shed light on whether a novel intervention combining CBT with diabetes education for youth can reduce the morbidity observed in those with co-morbid T1DM and depression and achieve positive diabetes outcomes, as opposed to Treatment as usual (TAU) and CBT for depression.

"Treating Depression in African American Elders: A Community-Academic Partnership    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This application is in response to the NIH-NIMH program announcement (PAR-05-026) ""Community Participation in Research."" Based on a strong collaborative partnership between an academic research center at Thomas Jefferson University, and a senior center, Center in the Park (CIP), we plan to test the effectiveness of an in-home intervention to treat depression in 192 urban African American elders. Using a two group randomized trial, we will test a brief intervention that combines evidentiary components (depression education, stress reduction, referral, care management and behavioral activation) and mode of delivery (in-home) that resonate with the socio-cultural attributes of the target community. Participants will be enrolled from over 6,000 CIP members who screen positive for depressive symptoms. Study participants will be interviewed at baseline at home and then randomized to treatment or a wait-list control group. Participants in treatment will receive up to 10 in-home sessions from a CIP social worker while wait-list controls will receive usual care. All participants will be reassessed at 4 months by telephone (main trial endpoint) at which point wait-list controls will be offered the intervention and then all study participants will be reassessed at 8 months by telephone. Specific study aims are to: 1 )Test the immediate effect of the intervention at 4-months on depression (between group comparison); 2) Test the maintenance effect of the intervention at 8-months on depression (within group comparison); 3) Evaluate acceptability (social validity) of the intervention and engagement in targeted activities (experimental and wait-list control participants). A secondary aim will assess the feasibility of conducting a clinical trial embedded in a community setting and its dissemination using a community-academic partnership. Three exploratory aims will evaluate the mediational role of behavioral activation, differential treatment effects based on participant characteristics, and the effect of the intervention on quality of life domains. Health disparities coupled with unequal access to culturally relevant mental health treatments are consistently documented for older African Americans. Depression is a debilitating but treatable condition contributing to poor life quality. Our research will identify culturally-relevant depression treatment for African American elders, enhance service capacity of senior centers to treat depression in the community, and disseminate a replicable partnership model.             ",Treating Depression in African American Elders: A Community-Academic Partnership,8096646,R01MH079814,"['Target Populations ', ' aging population ', ' population aging ', ' comparison group ', ' depressive symptoms ', ' depressive ', ' depression symptom ', ' Emotional Depression ', ' Long-Term Effects ', ' Longterm Effects ', ' National Institute of Mental Health (U.S.) ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' NIMH ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' treatment effect ', ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Treatment outcome ', ' NIH Program Announcements ', ' Program Announcement ', ' Stress ', ' Gender ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Telephone ', ' Phone ', ' intervention effect ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Interview ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' chronic disorder ', ' chronic disease/disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Training ', ' Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Waiting Lists ', ' Aging ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Distress ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' clinical investigation ', ' Coupled ', ' Licensing ', ' community setting ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' Philadelphia ', ' Population ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Modeling ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' insight ', ' Caring ', ' Collaborations ', ' Reporting ', ' Characteristics ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' Participant ', ' Maintenance ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' Age ', ' Universities ', ' base ', ' Testing ', ' Symptoms ', ' response ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Communities ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' recruit ', ' programs ', ' treatment as usual ', ' usual care ', ' randomized trial ', ' social ', ' Behavioral ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' Research ', ' Services ', ' high risk ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Control Groups ', ' Time ', ' Prevalence ', ' member ', ' Health ', ' group intervention ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Outcome ', ' Research Design ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Aged, 80 and over ', ' Oldest Old ', ' depression education ', ' depression outreach ', ' brief intervention ', ' brief treatment ', ' brief therapy ', ' Living Arrangement ', ' community based service ', ' Community Participation ', ' Social Workers ', ' Community Services ', ' functional decline ', ' decline in function ', ' community based participatory research ', ' geriatric depression ', ' late life depression ', ' Elderly depression ', ' Applied Research ', ' Applied Science ', ' caucasian American ', ' white American ', ' stress management ', ' stress buffering ', ' ']",NIMH,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R01,2011,557428,0.21064398028873774
"Reducing Disparities and Improving Care for Depression in OB-GYN Clinics    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Background: Major depressive episodes occur throughout a woman's lifespan, with the highest rates during the reproductive and menopausal transition years. During this time, OB-GYNs are the only providers whom many women regularly see. Low income and minority women are particularly likely to seek their routine care in OB-GYN clinics. There are marked gaps in accuracy of diagnosis and quality of depression care in OB-GYN clinics, with disparities in quality of depression care which exceed those seen in primary care clinics. Models incorporating depression care into clinical settings may be adaptable to OB-GYN settings but have not been tested outside of the perinatal period. Most women seen by OB-GYNs are not pregnant; thus, studies focusing solely on perinatal depression excludes a large number of women who could benefit from care. No studies to date have been completed that have adapted depression care models to OB-GYN clinics as a whole. Research Goal: We propose a three-part intervention, integrated with OB-GYN care, consisting of (i) enhanced education; (ii) engagement; and (iii) depression care management (with antidepressant monitoring and/or provision of brief psychotherapy). We hypothesize that a three-part depression intervention, integrated into the OB-GYN clinical setting, will improve treatment outcomes for depression, functional outcomes, and satisfaction with depression care. Study Design: In the proposed randomized controlled trial, 260 OB-GYN clinic patients with major depression and/or dysthymia will be assigned to either: 1) an integrated depression intervention or 2) usual care (UC). We will screen approximately 8,300 patients presenting for scheduled clinic appointments at two urban OB-GYN clinics over 18-months for major depression/dysthymia. A large number of these patients are low-income and minority women. Potentially eligible patients may also be referred by a clinic provider or reply to informational flyers posted in the clinics. The integrated depression intervention will last 12 months. Outcomes will be assessed at baseline and at 6, 12, and 18 months by telephone interviews by blinded research staff. Aims: Our Primary Aims are: 1) To evaluate, compared to UC, the impact of an integrated OB-GYN depression intervention on depression treatment outcomes, including change in depressive symptoms and depression treatment response; and 2) To evaluate, compared to UC, the impact of an integrated OB-GYN depression intervention on functional outcomes. Our Secondary Aims are: 3) To evaluate, compared to UC, the impact of an integrated OB-GYN depression intervention on quality of depression care indicators, including number of therapy visits, and dose, duration, and adherence to antidepressant medications; and on satisfaction with depression care, including patient and provider satisfaction, and provider attitudes toward depression care in OB-GYN clinics; and 4) [To identify potential facilitators and barriers to sustainability of the integrated OB-GYN intervention.]      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The results of our proposed randomized controlled trial will greatly impact public health by satisfying an unmet need for effective depression services for all women seen in the OB-GYN clinical setting. The potential improvements in depression treatment outcomes and quality of life for the large proportion of women who receive their care in this setting will be substantial.           The results of our proposed randomized controlled trial will greatly impact public health by satisfying an unmet need for effective depression services for all women seen in the OB-GYN clinical setting.

"Madres para la Salud (Mothers for Health)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Pregnancy-associated weight gain and failure to lose weight after birth contributes to the development of overweight and obesity in Hispanic women, who have prevalence rates exceeding 70%. Recent evidence shows that obesity is associated with systemic and fat tissue inflammation which can facilitate the development of obesity-related chronic diseases and contributes to the development of postpartum depression. Despite the well-established beneficial effects of exercise on weight, women tend to underparticipate in physical activity during the childbearing years. Further, the mechanisms underpinning the interplay of overweight, obesity, physical activity, and subsequent risk such as inflammatory processes or postpartum depression are not clear. The proposed study seeks to test a social support intervention, ""Madres para la Salud"" [Mothers for Health], to explore the effectiveness of a culturally specific program using ""bouts"" of physical activity to effect changes in body fat, fat tissue inflammation, and postpartum depression symptoms in sedentary Hispanic women. This innovative program has the potential to advance our understanding of the relationship between moderate increases in physical activity and specific health outcomes. The study aims are to:1) Examine the effectiveness of the Madres para la Salud for reducing the distal outcomes in: (a) body fat (b) systemic and fat tissue inflammation and (c) PPD symptoms among postpartum Hispanic women compared with an attention control group, at 6 and 12 months, after controlling for dietary intake; 2) Test whether the theoretical mediators, intermediate outcomes, of social support and walking, and environmental factor moderators, affect changes in body fat; systemic and fat tissue inflammation; and PPD symptoms among postpartum Hispanic women at 6 and 12 months, and 3) Determine the relationship between the immediate outcome of walking (minutes walked per week) and change in the distal outcomes of: (a) body fat (b) systemic and fat tissue inflammation and (c) PPD symptoms. A prospective, randomized controlled trial will guide the study. A sample of 140 sedentary Hispanic women, 18-35 years, and between 6 weeks and 6 months following childbirth will be used. Participants will be randomly assigned to the intervention or attention-control group. The intervention group will have weekly walking sessions and support interventions with Promotoras. The attention-control group will receive health newsletters and follow-up phone calls. Data will be gathered at baseline, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months using questionnaires, fat tissue biopsies, blood samples, and a subset sample for DEXA body scans, as well as objective and self-report measures of walking adherence. The intervention's effectiveness will be evaluated using a mixed models analysis of variance (ANOVA) comparing the two groups, structural equation modeling (SEM), and evaluating the relationship between walking and body-fat loss. The results will have significance for women's health providers who seek to improve the long-term health of Hispanic women. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed project tests an intervention that can be integrated into the daily lives of Hispanic women following childbirth. The intervention will use culturally sensitive strategies and planned supports during walking activities to decrease body fat and postpartum depression symptoms, while improving the cellular processes related to excess body fat.           PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed project tests an intervention that can be integrated into the daily lives of Hispanic women following childbirth.

"Internet Intervention to Prevent Major Depressive Episodes    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) Latino Mental Health Research Program, based at San Francisco General Hospital (SFGH), proposes to develop evidence-based Internet interventions in Spanish and English to prevent major depressive episodes (MDEs). The current pilot project has three aims designed to set the stage for a subsequent randomized control trial of such an Internet intervention:  Aim 1. Adaptation of a widely tested cognitive-behavioral intervention for Internet administration, and creation of a self-help research Website that will automatically recruit participants online, deliver the intervention online, and conduct follow-up assessments online.  Aim 2. Usability testing of the Website with Spanish- and English-speaking men and women from public sector health clinics to assess and optimize, prior to launching the online pilot study: accessibility to as wide a range of individuals as possible, to reduce disparities; understanding of informed consent for the study; and understanding of the various study measures (i.e., measures of depression, self-efficacy, and so on).  Aim 3. Conducting a nationwide online pilot study of the site in Spanish and English to examine: recruitment rates, response rates to specific ads to identify best recruitment strategies, and characteristics of responders; information on the effectiveness of informed consent procedures to enhance understanding of key aspects of the study; utilization patterns of each element of the site; and efficacy of methods to reduce follow-up attrition.  This application is responsive to NIMH Strategic Objective 3 (to develop new and better interventions that incorporate the diverse needs and circumstances of people with mental illnesses) and Objective 4 (to strengthen the public health impact of NIMH-supported research). The Internet intervention would provide a highly innovative means of delivering preventive mental health services for undertreated and underserved populations. An online intervention of this type has the potential to reach millions of individuals nationally and internationally, thereby maximizing the public health benefit of NIMH funding.

"Treatment of Insomnia and Depression in Elders (TIDE)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Insomnia and depression are two of the most prevalent mental health disorders and often co-occur. Health disparities in rural America and among African-Americans are well documented. We propose an R34 exploratory project to test the feasibility of delivering high-fidelity insomnia and depression psychological services to an underserved population. Treatment of Insomnia and Depression in Elders (TIDE) is a pilot study that will treat rural, predominantly African-American older adults who present to their primary care physician with co-occurring insomnia/depression. Stage 1 will be an uncontrolled case study series (n = 10) focusing on treatment development/refinement and patient acceptability. In stage 2, feasibility will be experimentally tested with 46 participants randomized to integrated cognitive-behavior therapy (CBT) + usual care or to usual care only in an effectiveness pilot study. The treatment will combine/integrate compact CBT for insomnia (including relaxation, sleep restriction, and stimulus control) and for depression (including cognitive therapy and behavioral activation). The experimental intervention comprises delivering CBT services by videoconferencing to patients in primary care settings who live in rural areas. Treatment will be evaluated by pre, post, and follow-up self report instruments on insomnia, depression, and quality of life. In addition, the stage 1 pilot will use investigator designed quantitative and qualitative measures to evaluate critical process variables including patient acceptability of the video format, patient acceptability of the treatments, and obstacles to adherence. Depending on stage 1 data, these measures may be incorporated into stage 2 as well.  Several innovative features of this exploratory project include: intervening with CBT on both disorders hoping to gain a synergy by their combined presentation; use of telehealth to deliver treatment to distant locations; translation of efficacy findings to an effectiveness trial; treatment will be delivered in the primary care setting, the preferred locale of rural, older adults; the study will extend knowledge of the range of CBT applications by enrolling under-represented groups with respect to ethnicity, literacy, and financial resources.  The primary aims of this project are (1) to determine the feasibility and maximal therapy characteristics of integrated CBT for co-occurring insomnia/depression in both the case study series (stage 1) and the experimental investigation (stage 2), (2) collect pilot data on whether participants receiving integrated CBT + usual care show comparable or greater reductions in insomnia symptoms compared to participants receiving usual care at posttreatment and follow-up, and (3) collect pilot data on whether participants receiving integrated CBT + usual care show comparable or greater reductions in depression symptoms compared to participants receiving usual care at posttreatment and follow-up.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Co-occurring insomnia and depression is a highly prevalent mental health disorder. This combination is well represented in groups characterized by health disparities: rural, African-Americans.

"The Role of Social Networks in Treatment Engagement for Minorities DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application is in response to NOT-MH-10-021 's request for competitive revision applications for targeted research on mental health disparities. We request a revision to the UCLA/RAND NIMH Partnered Research Center for Quality Care. We plan secondary analysis of a unique data base to understand the roles that social networks play in supporting the engagement in treatment and medication use of persons who are at risk of or in need of treatment for depression, in particular those who are underserved minorities. The objective of this analysis is to inform the development of future community-based interventions that include a focus on the social networks of intervention recipients as a mechanism for improving outcomes. The data base includes a large sample of underserved minorities and a matched sample of whites which allows for the analyses of the potential of social network members to support engagement for minorities as well as whites. It will also allow for exploration of the effect of a Quality Improvement intervention on the activation level of networks related to treatment seeking and adherence to treatments as well as comparisons by ethnic group. The project will build on network analysis theory and methods to investigate how personal networks are used in coping with symptoms, life events, help-seeking and use of treatments by those who have experienced depression. Our specific aim is: To analyze secondary data from Partners in Care minority and matched white respondents to determine how their social interactions differ and the types of proactive coping strategies used to deal with depressive symptoms and stressful events. A grounded theory approach will be used to identify themes in the qualitative data, examine network visualizations derived from the social network interviews, and identify the roles social networks play in enhancing treatment engagement and outcome. We propose to use a mixed-methods analytic approach to develop theory, based on empirical analysis of data from Partners in Care, a group-level randomized controlled trial of practice-initiated Quality Improvement programs for depression for which funding ended March 2009. Data include a series of 780 in-depth qualitative interviews with all minorities and a sub-sample of whites in which respondents provided detailed information about specific events involving stress, depression, and treatment and how they coped with those situations. It also includes data from a social network interview in which respondents provided detailed information about their personal networks, the positive and negative influence of network members on the respondent's stress, depression and treatment and the structure of relationships among these network members. These data will be linked to 9 years of longitudinal survey data. The findings from our analyses will add to the evidence base for future effective mental health interventions for diverse groups, including ethnic minorities. We will use a community work group to review the data and help generate hypotheses and explanations as well as provide cultural competence in the analysis. Public Health Relevance: By learning about the potential of network members to play key roles in supporting depressed persons recovery, engagement and adherence to evidence-based care, we hope to add to the evidence base for future effective community-based mental health interventions for diverse groups, including minorities.",The Role of Social Networks in Treatment Engagement for Minorities,8137530,P30MH082760,"['psychological disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Communities ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Future ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Interview ', ' Learning ', ' Medicine ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Methods ', ' Motivation ', ' Persons ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' NIMH ', ' National Institute of Mental Health (U.S.) ', ' Professional Postions ', ' Jobs ', ' Occupations ', ' Patients ', ' Play ', ' Recurrent ', ' Recurrence ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' socioenvironment ', ' social context ', ' social climate ', ' Social Environment ', ' Social Interaction ', ' Stress ', ' Stressful Event ', ' Treatment outcome ', ' depressive ', ' depression symptom ', ' Emotional Depression ', ' depressive symptoms ', ' Longitudinal Surveys ', ' Caring ', ' Social Network ', ' Guidelines ', ' Visualization ', ' Imagery ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Chronic ', ' Series ', ' Link ', ' Individual ', ' Recovery ', ' data repository ', ' clinical data repository ', ' Electronic Database ', ' Electronic Databank ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Databases ', ' Funding ', ' Respondent ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' sadness ', ' depressed ', ' Depressed mood ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Event ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' interest ', ' experience ', ' care seeking ', ' Structure ', ' cultural competence ', ' member ', ' help seeking ', ' help-seeking behavior ', ' Network Analysis ', ' Pathway Analysis ', ' Sampling ', ' QOC ', ' Quality of Care ', ' response ', ' theories ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Adherence ', ' Adherence (attribute) ', ' Data ', ' NIH RFA ', ' Request for Applications ', ' Targeted Research ', ' underserved minority ', ' under-represented minority ', ' Underrepresented Minority ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Clinical Services ', ' Healthcare professional ', ' Health Care Professional ', ' Health Professional ', ' working group ', ' underserved people ', ' under served population ', ' Underserved Population ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' coping ', ' ethnic minority ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' service intervention ', ' public health relevance ', ' evidence base ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,P30,2011,224921,0.059328594392013614
"Placebo Controlled Trial of Sertraline and IPT for Postpartum Depression    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Depression in perinatal women confers substantial medical, psychiatric, social and developmental risk to children (NAS, 2009) and remains a critical and under-addressed public health problem. Population specific differences, or disparities, in the presence (prevalence) and persistence of perinatal depression as well as in access to care are poorly understood. The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality Evidence Report (2005) and the National Academy of Sciences / Institute of Medicine Report on Depression in Parents (2009) both outline a clear gap in understanding of depression around the time of childbearing in minority women, rural and low SES women.  This proposal is a Competitive Revision Application for Targeted Research on Mental Health Disparities NOT-MH-10-021. As required by the RFA for this proposal, it is submitted as a revision of a current parent NIMH grant entitled, ""Placebo Controlled Trial of Sertraline and IPT for Postpartum Depression (1 R01 MH074636-01A2; Stuart PI). The purpose of the proposal, as described by the NIMH RFA, is ""to conduct secondary analyses to target research questions addressing mental health disparities.""  The Revised Application aims overall to combine and analyze important sub-group differences to provide novel information on disparities in perinatal depression and treatment use. The parent grant will contribute data from over 5500 perinatal women who have been screened in the project to date. Additional data will be obtained from the Women's Mood Disorder (WMD) Task group, a part of the National Network of Depression Centers that was established 2009 in order to synergistically advance the field of women's depression by capitalizing upon the strengths and expertise of a collaborative network. The Revised Application will aggregate and analyze 12 individual WMD member databases in order to address key disparities-related questions related to depression in women around the time of childbearing and to provide information on population differences in course and treatment use (engagement and adequacy) from pregnancy through postpartum. The proposed aims cannot be addressed by any of the individual databases due to inadequate statistical power. All groups have collected similar depression and treatment use measurements from multiple sites and treatment settings. The pooled sample will include > 30,000 perinatal women, and will include large numbers of women from diverse racial minority (n=5117), SES, and geographical groups for key comparative analyses. This data will be used to develop a clinical tool to overcome disparities in treatment which will allow clinicians to tailor interventions to specific settings and individual women. In addition, this project will establish collaborative capacity and infrastructure of the WMD to advance multi-site, interdisciplinary collaborative research on women's depression with an emphasis on understanding and addressing health disparities.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The proposed study will provide critical information about population specific differences, or disparities, in the presence (prevalence) and persistence of perinatal depression as well as access to treatment. Data from 12 studies will be aggregated and will include more than 30,000 perinatal women, including 5117 minority women.

"Barriers and Facilitators of Mental Health Services Utilization Among Latinos    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Using a community-based participatory research (CBPR) model, this 5-year longitudinal cohort study will empirically assess the association of individual, partner/family, social context and larger community stressors, on clinical depression, depression severity, and cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk among Caribbean Latinos in Lawrence, MA, and assess the buffering effects of culture-specific types of social support and resources on these associations. Partners in this collaboration are: individual Latino residents of Lawrence; community- based organizations including the Greater Lawrence Family Health Center, the City of Lawrence Mayor's Health Task Force, the Lawrence Council on Aging/Senior Center, the YWCA of Greater Lawrence, Holy Family Hospital, Lawrence General Hospital; and UMass Medical School (UMMS). This collaboration began in 2003 and the proposed study builds from its prior CBPR work. The study will be conducted among 600 Caribbean Latino adults living in Lawrence, MA, a HRSA defined medically underserved community. Available evidence suggests that depressive symptoms and clinical depression are highly prevalent among low-income Latinos in the US. However, there is a scarcity of longitudinal studies of depression in this population, and relatively little is known about the risk and protective factors for these conditions in this population. Evidence indicates that depression is an independent risk factor for disability, excess mortality and adverse health outcomes, including cardiovascular disease, a leading cause of death among Latinos. Understanding the stressors that contribute to depression and CVD risk among Latinos is crucial to developing targeted interventions. The primary aims of the proposed study are to: 1) assess cross-sectional associations between stress (measured at the individual, partner/family, social and larger community levels) and measures of clinical depression and depression severity; 2) assess longitudinal associations between stress (measured at the individual, partner/family, social and larger community levels) and measures of clinical depression and depression severity; and 3) assess the mediating effect of social support and resources (measured at the individual, partner/family, social and larger community levels) on the associations between stress and measures of clinical depression and depression severity. The secondary aims are to: 4) assess the longitudinal association between stress and measures of depression with CVD risk and 5) investigate the mediating effect of health-related behaviors, namely diet, physical activity, smoking, alcohol use and sleep on the association between stress and measures of depression with CVD risk. Study participants will be followed for two years with measures taken annually. CBPR aims are to: 1) enhance the participatory infrastructure of the Partnership through continuous self-assessment; 2) evaluate the outreach process for diffusion and dissemination of study results; and 3) evaluate the success in implementing new programs and developing new research projects that build from the results of the proposed study.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The Lawrence-UMass Latino Health Partnership (Partnership), is a 7-year community-based participatory research (CBPR) collaborative to improve the health of Latinos living in Lawrence, MA, a HRSA defined medically underserved community. Established in 2003, this Partnership includes the Greater Lawrence Family Health Center, the City of Lawrence Mayor's Health Task Force, the Lawrence Council on Aging/Senior Center, the YWCA of Greater Lawrence, Holy Family Hospital, Lawrence General Hospital and the University of Massachusetts Medical School. The Partnership proposes to study the influence of stress on mental health and cardiovascular risk among Lawrence Latinos as well as factors that may influence these associations, in particular social support and resources. The Partnership also will seek to enhance its process, disseminate the study results and evaluate the impact of the project on new community programs and research projects.             The Lawrence-UMass Latino Health Partnership (Partnership), is a 7-year community-based participatory research (CBPR) collaborative to improve the health of Latinos living in Lawrence, MA, a HRSA defined medically underserved community.

"Population-Based Psychiatric Intervention in Primary Care    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This is a request for a competing renewal of an NIMH Midcareer Investigator Award in Patient-Oriented Research (NIMH staff has advised Dr. Katon that he could submit a competing renewal of his K-24 award as a full professor). This K-24 will build on Dr. Katon's prior research in: 1) developing innovative ""collaborative care"" interventions to improve the quality of care and outcomes of patients with depressive and anxiety disorders within primary care settings; 2) improving understanding about the adverse impact of anxiety and depressive disorders in patients with common medical disorders; and 3) developing interventions to improve psychiatric outcomes in patients with chronic medical illness and comorbid depressive and anxiety disorders. The specific aims of this proposal include: 1) to continue to enhance Dr. Katon's epidemiologic, biostatistical and health economic skills in order to demonstrate in population-based studies the bidirectional adverse interactions between depression and chronic medical illness. The evidence from these population- based studies will be developed by a) showing in cross-sectional and longitudinal studies the adverse impact of depression on medical symptom burden, functional impairment, adherence to medical regimens, medical complications and mortality; and b) by demonstrating in longitudinal studies that residual depressive symptoms and incident complications of medical illness are associated with a higher risk of developing major depression and new deficits in functioning. Additional aims include: 2) to develop and test adaptations of collaborative care models in patients with depression and chronic medical illness that are targeted at improving medical disease control, behavioral risk factors, as well as improving quality of depression care; 3) to continue to adapt collaborative care interventions and test their effectiveness in new populations experiencing disparities in quality of mental health care such as adolescent populations with depression, youth with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) living in rural settings, and women with depression treated in Ob-Gyn settings; and 4) To continue to expand Dr. Katon's mentorship of junior investigators in mental health services research. These goals will be met through continued and expanded research activities, coursework in epidemiology, biostatistics and health economics and mentorship from external consultants. These courses, interactions with mentors, and mentored readings will improve Dr. Katon's ability as a mentor as well as enhancing the cutting edge research of his Health Services Division.

"FOR MOMS:Culturally Relevant Treatment for Perinatal Depression    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Among socio-economically disadvantaged minority and white women, depression during pregnancy and the postpartum is often under-detected and under-treated. Maternal postpartum depression has adverse, lasting effects on maternal, infant and child well-being. Depression during pregnancy has been demonstrated to be the most potent predictor of postpartum depression and appears to be linked to low birth weight and prematurity. Poor, urban women are at least twice as likely as middle-class women to meet diagnostic criteria for major depression during pregnancy. At the same time, depressed, disadvantaged women have been proven difficult to engage and retain in mental health treatment because they face numerous barriers to care at the patient, provider, and system levels. This proposed randomized, controlled trial will evaluate the effects of a culturally relevant, multicomponent intervention for antenatal depression (FOR MOMS, ""Maintain Our Mothers' Strength"") that has the potential to overcome patient, provider, and system-level barriers to care and engage depressed, low-income women in evidence-based treatments to reduce antenatal depressive symptoms, improve maternal psychosocial functioning, and ameliorate postpartum depression. This research will take advantage of the unique partnership between the Seattle King County Public Health Department (PHSKC) and the University of Washington's School of Social Work and Department of Psychiatry. We propose to enroll a sample of 220 depressed, pregnant women on Medicaid from PHSKC and will test the effectiveness of the FOR MOMS intervention relative to usual care for antenatal depression. FOR MOMS consists of a pre- treatment engagement session and a choice of brief interpersonal psychotherapy (IPT) or evidence-based pharmacotherapy. The engagement session and brief IPT for antenatal depression have been enhanced to reduce racial and economic disparities in treatment engagement and retention and have been shown to be effective in a pilot study. After study entry, assessments will be conducted at baseline and 3, 6, 12, and 18 months post-baseline, a time period designed to include the first postpartum year. We will examine the effects of the FOR MOMS intervention on clinical and functional outcomes and conduct an incremental cost effectiveness analysis of the costs and benefits of the intervention from a health and welfare agency perspective. Our study team is comprised of an interdisciplinary group of researchers with extensive expertise in health services research, health economics, and clinical research with depressed, low-income, minority women.

"Reducing Disparities in Depression Care for Ethnically Diverse Older Men DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The epidemic of suicide among older (i.e. age 60 and above) men in the US is a public health crisis. Older men have eight to ten-times higher rates of completed suicide than older women. Because depression is one of the strongest risk factors for suicide, improving care for depression in primary settings is a vital public health strategy to prevent suicide and other adverse outcomes of depression. Depression is more common in women than in men, but depressed older men and minorities are less likely to receive effective treatment. To address this knowledge gap and reduce disparities in older men and minorities, we propose a study that applies both qualitative and quantitative methods to better understand the perspectives, experiences, and preferences for care of ethnically diverse depressed older men and the primary care providers who treat them. Our focus gender-specific focus and attention to age-related factors will enable us to examine potentially important but under-studied variability among older men in how they experience and deal with their depression and will allow us to further develop our conceptual model and to develop strategies to engage more difficult to reach subgroups of diverse older men. Primary care is a logical site for this research because it is the setting where most depressed older men can potentially be recognized and treated. We will conduct systematic screening to identify a representative sample of 100 older men (50 Mexican-American and 50 white non- Hispanic) older men with treated and untreated clinical depression from primary care clinics in two cities and then conduct interviews with them and their primary care physicians (n = 48). This proposal's aims are 1) to examine how forms of masculinity and age-related changes and attitudes (i.e. health status, major role transitions, conceptions of normal aging) influence men's depression illness meanings, experience, and patterns of help-seeking, 2) to systematically examine older men's preferences for depression treatment, and 3) to identify factors that impede or facilitate depression care from the perspectives of primary care physicians. This proposal brings together an interdisciplinary group of investigators with extensive experience in working with older and minority populations and builds directly on published preliminary data (Hinton et al, 2006). It is the intention of this proposal to generate empirical data to help close the gender and ethnic gap in depression care, reduce associated health disparities, and mitigate high suicide rates in older men. Because depression is one of the strongest risk factors for suicide and because men who kill themselves frequently have had recent prior contact with their primary care physicians, improving care for depression in primary care settings is a vital public health strategy to prevent suicide and other adverse outcomes of depression. Depressed older men, however, are significantly less likely than women to receive effective depression treatment. Despite its public health importance, the barriers to depression care for older men are not well understood. Through a focused and in-depth examination of the perspectives and preferences of depressed older men and their primary care providers, this research will generate empirical data to reduce barriers to depression care for older men in primary care settings.",Reducing Disparities in Depression Care for Ethnically Diverse Older Men,8009805,R01MH080067,"['socioeconomics ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomic ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio economic ', ' normal aging ', ' Participant ', ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Health Status ', ' Level of Health ', ' disability ', ' Attention ', ' Agreement ', ' Qualitative Methods ', ' Suicide ', ' suicidality ', ' intent to die ', ' fatal suicide ', ' fatal attempt ', ' Ethnic group ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' older women ', ' Freedom ', ' Liberty ', ' Primary Care Physician ', ' Conceptions ', ' Latino ', ' Mexican Americans ', ' Chicanos ', ' Chicanas ', ' care preference ', ' adverse outcome ', ' adverse consequence ', ' Intention ', ' effective therapy ', ' effective treatment ', ' Aging ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Sick Role ', ' Illness Behavior ', ' Surgeon ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Strategic Planning ', ' Gender ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' Endogenous depression ', ' clinical depression ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Caring ', ' National Institute of Mental Health (U.S.) ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' NIMH ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' help-seeking behavior ', ' help seeking ', ' Provider ', ' Physicians ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Woman ', ' accomplished suicide ', ' completed suicide ', ' commit suicide ', ' Ageism ', ' Face ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' suicide rate ', ' older men ', ' Suicide prevention ', ' suicide intervention ', ' suicidality prevention ', ' prevent suicide ', ' prevent suicidality ', ' Suicide precaution ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Primary Care ', ' Attitude ', ' trend ', ' Distress ', ' Subgroup ', ' Minority ', ' Medical ', ' Cities ', ' Complement ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Publishing ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' Sampling ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' treatment strategy ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' Quality of Care ', ' QOC ', ' Epidemic ', ' Improve Access ', ' Shapes ', ' Social Sciences ', ' Pattern ', ' Knowledge ', ' Research ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' healthcare service availability ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare access availability ', ' health services availability ', ' health care service availability ', ' health care service access ', ' health care availability ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Availability of Health Services ', ' Accessibility of health care ', ' Access to Healthcare ', ' Access to Health Care ', ' Access to Care ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Modeling ', ' Age ', ' Screening procedure ', ' screenings ', ' screening ', ' Area ', ' base ', ' Time ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Site ', ' Address ', ' Interview ', ' Label ', ' Killings ', ' improved ', ' experience ', ' Methods ', ' Population ', ' theories ', ' high risk ', ' Goals ', ' Clinic ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Data ', ' primary care setting ', ' Work ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Depressed mood ', ' sadness ', ' depressed ', ' Hispanics ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Risk Factors ', ' age related ', ' age dependent ', ' Sex Characteristics ', ' sexual dimorphism (noncellular) ', ' gender difference ', ' Sex Differences ', ' preference ', ' age group ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' CDC ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT DAVIS,R01,2011,468429,0.07210390872443814
"Understanding Social Contributions to Disparities in Depression Care: US and UK    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Physicians' ability to communicate effectively with patients from ethnically and socially diverse backgrounds is essential to reducing health disparities. However, communication is not solely the task of medical professionals, patients also play a critical role in active participation in their care and in gaining the necessary confidence and competence to implement and continue treatment. The disparities that are evident within medical care reflect the interplay of social factors, including race, gender, age, literacy, and the cultural and normative expectations that guide the perspectives of both patients and physicians. The proposed investigation is designed to contribute to the disentangling of physician-derived and patient-derived contributions to social bias that may exacerbate health disparities associated with the provision and receipt of depression care and suicide risk assessment in the US and UK. In order to do so, we propose a novel approach in which videotape simulations are used to portray a depression -focused visit in primary care in which the ethnicity and gender of the participants have been experimentally manipulated. While sharing the context of a medical visit, the simulations differ in focus; one is designed to examine physicians' cognitive and clinical reasoning processes while the other explores patients' perceptions, responses and judgments related to the receipt of care. In the first study (for which data are already collected), visit simulations were shown to 128 US and UK physicians who were asked to take the role of the treating physician and provide a narrative account of their clinical reasoning. The second study shows simulated depression visits, in which patient and physician gender and ethnicity is experimentally manipulated, to 640 ethnically diverse male and female subjects in the US and UK. Subjects vicariously take the role of the depressed patient in the simulations to provide insights into their cognitive and affective reactions to care. In this way, we will be able to explore how subjects acting as analogue patients and physicians are influenced by gender and ethnicity in making medical care judgments in the context of the US and UK health care system and social structure. Study 3 will test the ecological validity of the analogue findings through the analysis of actual patient data in which physicians from different ethnic backgrounds have assessed patients' depression and suicide risk in an anonymised database. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: ability to communicate effectively with patients from ethnically and socially diverse backgrounds is essential to reducing health disparities.

"Internet Studies to Enhance Long Term Survivorship after Hematologic Malignancy    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This investigator-initiated new R01 application, in response to PA-10-067, proposes to reduce depression and cancer-related emotional distress, while also improving health behaviors in adult hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) survivors using an internet-based intervention in a multi-center randomized controlled clinical trial (RCT). Among adult long-term cancer survivors, those who received HSCT live with some of the highest risks for life-threatening chronic health conditions including cardiovascular disease, diabetes, osteoporosis, and recurrence or second cancers along with other risks. Even more prevalent in HSCT survivors are psychological symptoms that inhibit quality of life, specifically depression and cancer-related distress. Our previous internet intervention has demonstrated efficacy in reducing depression and distress with survivors at a single site, and has pilot tested the efficacy of providing a survivorship preventive care plan. With the proposed improvements and the extension of the intervention to multiple transplant centers we expect to strengthen both the reach and efficacy of the intervention while we advance the science of internet-based providing of health behavior change models to cancer survivors. Specific aims of the project are to: 1) determine whether 2-10 year HSCT survivors with elevated depression or cancer-related distress who are randomized to receive access to a tailored internet-based program report reduced depression and distress when compared with control group survivors who receive a survivorship care plan by mail and delayed access to the internet site (enhanced usual care), and 2) determine whether survivors with low survivorship preventive care adherence (PCA) who are randomized to receive access to the tailored internet-based program, including a survivorship preventive care plan, report increased PCA when compared with control group survivors. The study will examine main effects of the intervention as well as moderating (age <40, chronic graft versus host disease, rural residence, lower income) and mediating effects (health self-efficacy, knowledge of survivorship needs) per Protection Motivation Theory. Further analyses will identify risk factors for disparities in survivorship preventive care adherence in HSCT survivors. The five-site multi-center RCT will enroll N=1200 adult HSCT survivors with internet access. Assessments will occur at baseline, 3 and 12 months. Participants without internet access will be invited to complete the baseline assessment for participation in the risk factor analyses. To our knowledge, this study will be the first to explore the efficacy of a tailored internet-based intervention, enhanced with options for alerts and reminders through individualized SMS messaging, mobile applications and social networking media, to target health behaviors in a cancer survivor population. The program is cost-effective and readily tailored. If effective, the program could be disseminated nationwide for long-term HSCT survivors in all transplant centers and would provide a framework for similar survivorship care models in non-HSCT cancer survivor populations.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Among adult long-term cancer survivors, those who receive hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT: also called blood, marrow or umbilical cord blood transplantation) live with some of the highest risks for life-threatening chronic health conditions including cardiovascular disease, diabetes, osteoporosis, and recurrence or second cancers. Also prevalent in HSCT survivors are symptoms that inhibit quality of life such as depression and cancer-related emotional distress.

"An Innovative Approach to Preventing Depression    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application is submitted is in response to PAR-09-173: Pilot Intervention and Services Research Grants (R34). We propose to use this grant mechanism to address three priority areas of the NIMH including decreasing the morbidity associated with depression, improving the mental health of females, and reducing the racial disparity in mental health. We address these issues by developing a novel approach to preventing depression in preadolescent African American girls growing up in urban, low-income environments. Aims: The specific aims for the proposed application are to: 1) Develop methods and infrastructure for carrying out tests of proof-of-principle, and 2) Establish proof-of principle through evidence of feasibility and acceptability and preliminary studies of efficacy and determination of settings for deployment. Approach: Our approach will be to target individual and interpersonal vulnerabilities that have been shown to confer risk for depression in our existing research on African American girls living in low- income, urban settings. Specifically, we aim to increase assertiveness and active coping in order to reduce early emerging depressive symptoms during the preadolescent period. In addition, we propose that increasing interpersonal connectedness with the mother via maternal engagement in the prevention program is necessary to yield effects that generalize and are maintained. Investigators: The Principal Investigators, Drs. Kathryn Keenan and Kathryn Grant, are among the leading researchers in the field of developmental psychopathology who focus on children living in urban poverty. They are currently testing developmental models of depression in girls growing up in poverty. The present application is a joint venture in which their collective expertise in depression research and recent interest in translating their empirical findings to the prevention of depression will be applied. Innovation: The three novel aspects of our approach to preventing depression in females are targeting the preadolescent period, deriving individual vulnerabilities from existing datasets to target in the prevention program, using the mother as the method of delivery of the preventive intervention, and addressing barriers that have limited participation of low-income urban African American families in treatment. Public Health Relevance: Achievement of the aims described in this application will be the first step toward a major advancement in the prevention of depressive disorders for a population who is at highest risk for disorder and is least likely to receive mental health services, and has been underrepresented in preventive intervention research. Preventing the onset of depressive disorders in adolescent girls is one of the most promising avenues toward reducing the morbidity associated with depression for females.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Depressive disorders are among the leading contributors to disability and mortality in women around the world, rivaling cardiovascular disease. Therefore, preventing depression in females would result in an enormous improvement in women's health. The development of effective preventive interventions has been challenging, especially for African American girls living in poverty. These girls are at high risk for developing depression and are among the least likely to seek or receive mental health services. The aims of the present study are to: 1) Develop methods and infrastructure for carrying out tests of proof-of-principle, and 2) Establish proof-of principle through evidence of feasibility and acceptability and preliminary studies of efficacy and determination of settings for deployment.              Depressive disorders are among the leading contributors to disability and mortality in women around the world, rivaling cardiovascular disease.

"Methylphenidate Use to Improve Outcomes in Geriatric Depression    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Fewer than 50% of elderly depressed patients achieve remission and functional recovery in response to first-line antidepressant pharmacotherapy. The majority of patients are left with significant residual symptoms, putting them at risk of chronic, relapsing illness, frailty, and suicide. Improved understanding of neurobiology of geriatric depression and mechanisms of treatment response may lead to the improved clinical management of this pervasive and disabling disorder. While the serotonin system has been the focus of pharmacotherapy in unipolar major depression, there is a compelling rationale for the study of other monoamine systems. Impairment of executive functions persists even after amelioration of depressive symptoms and that these symptoms are poorly responsive to serotonergic treatment alone. We hypothesized that the addition of methylphenidate (MPH) to the serotonergic drug, citalopram, may result in better clinical outcomes of the affective and cognitive symptoms of late life depression. These considerations provided the impetus for our pilot study to evaluate the treatment response of the combination of citalopram and methylphenidate (MPH) compared to citalopram and placebo. We observed enhanced antidepressant response and improvement in executive cognitive function tests to a combination of citalopram and methylphenidate (MPH). The improvement in executive function was greater in patients who were homozygous for the dopamine transporter genotype (DAT VNTR10/10). The current proposal will evaluate the role of adjunctive MPH treatment to determine the effects of pharmacologic increase of dopamine on the clinical and cognitive response to selective serotonin reuptake (SSRI) treatment. We will also explore the role of the candidate genes involved in the regulation of dopaminergic neurotransmission (i.e., COMT, DAT1, DRD4) and sertonergic neurotransmission (i.e., HTR2A) in the clinical and cognitive response to treatment with methylphenidate and citalopram. We will recruit 168 elderly non-demented subjects with major depression to participate in a double-blind randomized placebo- controlled trial. Participants will be randomly assigned to three groups: one group will receive combination of citalopram and MPH, the second group will receive MPH and placebo, and the third group will receive citalopram and placebo. All subjects will undergo comprehensive medical, neuropsychiatric and cognitive assessments, and genetic testing at baseline and over the 16 weeks of treatment. Our study will provide the unique information regarding the use of methylphenidate to improve cognitive and clinical outcomes, and will shed light on the underlying mechanism of treatment response in geriatric depression.

"FOR MOMS:Culturally Relevant Treatment for Perinatal Depression  Title: ""FOR MOMS: Culturally Relevant Treatment Services for Perinatal Depression"" Abstract:  Among socio-economically disadvantaged minority and white women, depression during pregnancy and the postpartum is often under-detected and under-treated. Maternal postpartum depression has adverse, lasting effects on maternal, infant and child well-being. Depression during pregnancy has been demonstrated to be the most potent predictor of postpartum depression and appears to be linked to low birth weight and prematurity. Poor, urban women are at least twice as likely as middle-class women to meet diagnostic criteria for major depression during pregnancy. At the same time, depressed, disadvantaged women have been proven difficult to engage and retain in mental health treatmentbecause they face numerous barriers to care at the patient, provider, and system levels. This proposed randomized, controlled trial will evaluate the effects of a culturally relevant, multicomponent intervention for antenatal depression (FOR MOMS, ""Maintain Our Mothers' Strength"") that has the potential to overcome patient, provider, and system-level barriers to care and engage depressed, low-income women in evidence-based treatments to reduce antenatal depressive symptoms, improve maternal psychosocial functioning, and ameliorate postpartum depression. This research will take advantage of the unique partnership between the Seattle King County Public Health Department (PHSKC) and the University of Washington's School of Social Work and Department of Psychiatry. We propose to enroll a sample of 220 depressed, pregnant women on Medicaid from PHSKC and will test the effectiveness of the FOR MOMS intervention relative to usual care for antenatal depression. FOR MOMS consists of a pre- treatment engagement session and a choice of brief interpersonal psychotherapy (IPT) or evidence-based pharmacotherapy. The engagement session and brief IPT for antenatal depression have been enhanced to reduce racial and economic disparities in treatment engagement and retention and have been shown to be effective in a pilot study. After study entry, assessments will be conducted at baseline and 3, 6, 12, and 18 months post-baseline, a time period designed to include the first postpartum year. We will examine the effects of the FOR MOMS intervention on clinical and functional outcomes and conduct an incremental cost effectiveness analysis of the costs and benefits of the intervention from a health and welfare agency perspective. Our study team is comprised of an interdisciplinary group of researchers with extensive expertise in health services research, health economics, and clinical research with depressed, low-income, minority women.

"Methylphenidate Use to Improve Outcomes in Geriatric Depression    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Fewer than 50% of elderly depressed patients achieve remission and functional recovery in response to first-line antidepressant pharmacotherapy. The majority of patients are left with significant residual symptoms, putting them at risk of chronic, relapsing illness, frailty, and suicide. Improved understanding of neurobiology of geriatric depression and mechanisms of treatment response may lead to the improved clinical management of this pervasive and disabling disorder. While the serotonin system has been the focus of pharmacotherapy in unipolar major depression, there is a compelling rationale for the study of other monoamine systems. Impairment of executive functions persists even after amelioration of depressive symptoms and that these symptoms are poorly responsive to serotonergic treatment alone. We hypothesized that the addition of methylphenidate (MPH) to the serotonergic drug, citalopram, may result in better clinical outcomes of the affective and cognitive symptoms of late life depression. These considerations provided the impetus for our pilot study to evaluate the treatment response of the combination of citalopram and methylphenidate (MPH) compared to citalopram and placebo. We observed enhanced antidepressant response and improvement in executive cognitive function tests to a combination of citalopram and methylphenidate (MPH). The improvement in executive function was greater in patients who were homozygous for the dopamine transporter genotype (DAT VNTR10/10). The current proposal will evaluate the role of adjunctive MPH treatment to determine the effects of pharmacologic increase of dopamine on the clinical and cognitive response to selective serotonin reuptake (SSRI) treatment. We will also explore the role of the candidate genes involved in the regulation of dopaminergic neurotransmission (i.e., COMT, DAT1, DRD4) and sertonergic neurotransmission (i.e., HTR2A) in the clinical and cognitive response to treatment with methylphenidate and citalopram. We will recruit 168 elderly non-demented subjects with major depression to participate in a double-blind randomized placebo- controlled trial. Participants will be randomly assigned to three groups: one group will receive combination of citalopram and MPH, the second group will receive MPH and placebo, and the third group will receive citalopram and placebo. All subjects will undergo comprehensive medical, neuropsychiatric and cognitive assessments, and genetic testing at baseline and over the 16 weeks of treatment. Our study will provide the unique information regarding the use of methylphenidate to improve cognitive and clinical outcomes, and will shed light on the underlying mechanism of treatment response in geriatric depression. Evaluating selected dopamine-related genes in late-life depression with respect to mood and cognitive symptoms, and treatment response may lead to the development of the targeted individualized treatments in geriatric depression.

"Stress, depression, and the mother-infant relationship across the first year    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The current application seeks to investigate the role of chronic daily stress in the course of postpartum depression, the negative impact on infant cognitive and emotional development, and the mediating role of the mother-infant relationship on infant development. Chronic stress is linked to the onset and course of depression, and as many as 19% of women (49% of Mexican-American women) suffer from postpartum depression, making it a significant public health concern. Exposure to maternal depression during early infancy has significant long-term effects on several developmental processes. There is a substantial literature that details the negative effects of postpartum depression on infant adaptation, including deficits in both cognitive functioning and the development of emotion regulation skills. It is possible that these developmental competencies may be dependent upon mother-infant relationship quality, and that this relationship mediates the effects of maternal depression. The proposed research plan will test several models to address the role of daily stress, the impact of depression on the mother-infant relationship and infant competencies, and the mediational role of the quality of the mother-infant relationship on infant development. Data will be drawn from a larger longitudinal study that explores coregulatory processes between infants and their depressed, Mexican-American mothers. Measurements include maternal self-reports of stress, depression, and infant emotional regulation; observations of mother-infant interactions; and assessment of infant cognitive and emotional development across the first postpartum year. These data allow the opportunity to longitudinally explore important public health issues related to postpartum depression and infant development in a high risk population.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research has important public health implications due to high prevalence rates of postpartum depression in Mexican-American women and the significant impact it is found to have on infant development. Infants with early developmental risk are more likely to suffer from mental health issues, have poorer academic achievement through adolescence, and have poorer long-term adjustment. A better understanding of the mechanisms through which this negative impact operates is needed to inform prevention and intervention programs to promote healthy child development.

"Understanding Social Contributions to Disparities in Depression Care: US and UK  Abstract Physicians' ability to communicate effectively with patients from ethnically and socially diverse backgrounds is essential to reducing health disparities. However, communication is not solely the task of medical professionals, patients also play a critical role in active participation in their care and in gaining the necessary confidence and competence to implement and continue treatment. The disparities that are evident within medical care reflect the interplay of social factors, including race, gender, age, literacy, and the cultural and normative expectations that guide the perspectives of both patients and physicians. The proposed investigation is designed to contribute to the disentangling of physician-derived and patient-derived contributions to social bias that may exacerbate health disparities associated with the provision and receipt of depression care and suicide risk assessment in the US and UK. In order to do so, we propose a novel approach in which videotape simulations are used to portray a depression -focused visit in primary care in which the ethnicity and gender of the participants have been experimentally manipulated. While sharing the context of a medical visit, the simulations differ in focus; one is designed to examine physicians' cognitive and clinical reasoning processes while the other explores patients' perceptions, responses and judgments related to the receipt of care. In the first study (for which data are already collected), visit simulations were shown to 128 US and UK physicians who were asked to take the role of the treating physician and provide a narrative account of their clinical reasoning. The second study shows simulated depression visits, in which patient and physician gender and ethnicity is experimentally manipulated, to 640 ethnically diverse male and female subjects in the US and UK. Subjects vicariously take the role of the depressed patient in the simulations to provide insights into their cognitive and affective reactions to care. In this way, we will be able to explore how subjects acting as analogue patients and physicians are influenced by gender and ethnicity in making medical care judgments in the context of the US and UK health care system and social structure. Study 3 will test the ecological validity of the analogue findings through the analysis of actual patient data in which physicians from different ethnic backgrounds have assessed patients' depression and suicide risk in an anonymised database.  Public Health Relevance Physicians' ability to communicate effectively with patients from ethnically and socially diverse backgrounds is essential to reducing health disparities. However amelioration of disparities is not solely the task of medical professionals: patients also play a critical role in active participation in care and acquisition of the confidence and competence necessary to implement and continue treatment. The proposed investigation is designed to contribute to the disentangling of physician-derived and patient-derived contributions to social bias that may exacerbate health disparities associated with the provision and receipt of depression care and suicide risk in the US and UK so that more effective interventions may be designed and implemented.",Understanding Social Contributions to Disparities in Depression Care: US and UK,8270543,R01MH086449,"['abstracting ', ' Accounting ', ' Achievement Attainment ', ' Achievement ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' etoh use ', ' ethanol use ', ' ethanol product use ', ' ethanol intake ', ' ethanol ingestion ', ' ethanol drinking ', ' ethanol consumption ', ' alcoholic drink intake ', ' alcoholic beverage consumption ', ' alcohol use ', ' alcohol product use ', ' alcohol intake ', ' alcohol ingestion ', ' alcohol consumed ', ' EtOH drinking ', ' Alcohol Drinking ', ' Alcohol consumption ', ' Communication ', ' health services delivery ', ' Healthcare Delivery ', ' Health Sciences, Allied and Health Services Delivery ', ' health care delivery ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Medical Education ', ' Female ', ' Habits ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' services research ', ' Medical Care Research ', ' Healthcare Research ', ' Health Services Evaluation ', ' Health Care Research ', ' Health Services Research ', ' In element ', ' Indium ', ' NAS/IOM ', ' Institute of Medicine ', ' Institute of Medicine (U.S.) ', ' Judgment ', ' Lifestyle ', ' Life Style ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Light ', ' literacy ', ' male ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Patient Training ', ' Patient Instruction ', ' Patient Education ', ' Patients ', ' Perception ', ' Physicians ', ' Play ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Primary Care ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Recommendation ', ' recruit ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Research Design ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Smoking ', ' Testing ', ' thoughts ', ' Thinking ', ' Thinking, function ', ' Videotape ', ' Gender ', ' Competence ', ' depressive ', ' depression symptom ', ' Emotional Depression ', ' depressive symptoms ', ' Illicit Drugs ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Interpersonal Communication ', ' Personal Communication ', ' Risk Assessment ', ' Caring ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' Training ', ' insight ', ' Trust ', ' data repository ', ' clinical data repository ', ' Electronic Database ', ' Electronic Databank ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Databases ', ' satisfaction ', ' analog ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Simulate ', ' Shapes ', ' sadness ', ' depressed ', ' Depressed mood ', ' Nature ', ' programs ', ' thoughts about suicide ', ' suicide ideation ', ' suicidal thinking ', ' suicidal ideation ', ' Suicidal thoughts ', ' Feeling suicidal ', ' Investigation ', ' Dimensions ', ' Reaction ', ' Source ', ' Visit ', ' meetings ', ' suicide risk ', ' suicidal risk ', ' care delivery ', ' Structure ', ' reaction rate ', ' skills ', ' simulation ', ' expectation ', ' Participant ', ' cultural competence ', ' empowerment ', ' drinking ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Address ', ' Health system ', ' Data ', ' Cognitive ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' depression and suicidality ', ' Depression and Suicide ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' willingness ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel approaches ', ' new approaches ', ' novel strategies ', ' Outcome ', ' Affective ', ' public health relevance ', ' effective intervention ', ' ']",NIMH,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R01,2012,121770,0.11675821902236523
"Reducing Disparities and Improving Care for Depression in OB-GYN Clinics    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Background: Major depressive episodes occur throughout a woman's lifespan, with the highest rates during the reproductive and menopausal transition years. During this time, OB-GYNs are the only providers whom many women regularly see. Low income and minority women are particularly likely to seek their routine care in OB-GYN clinics. There are marked gaps in accuracy of diagnosis and quality of depression care in OB-GYN clinics, with disparities in quality of depression care which exceed those seen in primary care clinics. Models incorporating depression care into clinical settings may be adaptable to OB-GYN settings but have not been tested outside of the perinatal period. Most women seen by OB-GYNs are not pregnant; thus, studies focusing solely on perinatal depression excludes a large number of women who could benefit from care. No studies to date have been completed that have adapted depression care models to OB-GYN clinics as a whole. Research Goal: We propose a three-part intervention, integrated with OB-GYN care, consisting of (i) enhanced education; (ii) engagement; and (iii) depression care management (with antidepressant monitoring and/or provision of brief psychotherapy). We hypothesize that a three-part depression intervention, integrated into the OB-GYN clinical setting, will improve treatment outcomes for depression, functional outcomes, and satisfaction with depression care. Study Design: In the proposed randomized controlled trial, 260 OB-GYN clinic patients with major depression and/or dysthymia will be assigned to either: 1) an integrated depression intervention or 2) usual care (UC). We will screen approximately 8,300 patients presenting for scheduled clinic appointments at two urban OB-GYN clinics over 18-months for major depression/dysthymia. A large number of these patients are low-income and minority women. Potentially eligible patients may also be referred by a clinic provider or reply to informational flyers posted in the clinics. The integrated depression intervention will last 12 months. Outcomes will be assessed at baseline and at 6, 12, and 18 months by telephone interviews by blinded research staff. Aims: Our Primary Aims are: 1) To evaluate, compared to UC, the impact of an integrated OB-GYN depression intervention on depression treatment outcomes, including change in depressive symptoms and depression treatment response; and 2) To evaluate, compared to UC, the impact of an integrated OB-GYN depression intervention on functional outcomes. Our Secondary Aims are: 3) To evaluate, compared to UC, the impact of an integrated OB-GYN depression intervention on quality of depression care indicators, including number of therapy visits, and dose, duration, and adherence to antidepressant medications; and on satisfaction with depression care, including patient and provider satisfaction, and provider attitudes toward depression care in OB-GYN clinics; and 4) [To identify potential facilitators and barriers to sustainability of the integrated OB-GYN intervention.]      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The results of our proposed randomized controlled trial will greatly impact public health by satisfying an unmet need for effective depression services for all women seen in the OB-GYN clinical setting. The potential improvements in depression treatment outcomes and quality of life for the large proportion of women who receive their care in this setting will be substantial.

"Treatment of Insomnia and Depression in Elders (TIDE)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Insomnia and depression are two of the most prevalent mental health disorders and often co-occur. Health disparities in rural America and among African-Americans are well documented. We propose an R34 exploratory project to test the feasibility of delivering high-fidelity insomnia and depression psychological services to an underserved population. Treatment of Insomnia and Depression in Elders (TIDE) is a pilot study that will treat rural, predominantly African-American older adults who present to their primary care physician with co-occurring insomnia/depression. Stage 1 will be an uncontrolled case study series (n = 10) focusing on treatment development/refinement and patient acceptability. In stage 2, feasibility will be experimentally tested with 46 participants randomized to integrated cognitive-behavior therapy (CBT) + usual care or to usual care only in an effectiveness pilot study. The treatment will combine/integrate compact CBT for insomnia (including relaxation, sleep restriction, and stimulus control) and for depression (including cognitive therapy and behavioral activation). The experimental intervention comprises delivering CBT services by videoconferencing to patients in primary care settings who live in rural areas. Treatment will be evaluated by pre, post, and follow-up self report instruments on insomnia, depression, and quality of life. In addition, the stage 1 pilot will use investigator designed quantitative and qualitative measures to evaluate critical process variables including patient acceptability of the video format, patient acceptability of the treatments, and obstacles to adherence. Depending on stage 1 data, these measures may be incorporated into stage 2 as well.  Several innovative features of this exploratory project include: intervening with CBT on both disorders hoping to gain a synergy by their combined presentation; use of telehealth to deliver treatment to distant locations; translation of efficacy findings to an effectiveness trial; treatment will be delivered in the primary care setting, the preferred locale of rural, older adults; the study will extend knowledge of the range of CBT applications by enrolling under-represented groups with respect to ethnicity, literacy, and financial resources.  The primary aims of this project are (1) to determine the feasibility and maximal therapy characteristics of integrated CBT for co-occurring insomnia/depression in both the case study series (stage 1) and the experimental investigation (stage 2), (2) collect pilot data on whether participants receiving integrated CBT + usual care show comparable or greater reductions in insomnia symptoms compared to participants receiving usual care at posttreatment and follow-up, and (3) collect pilot data on whether participants receiving integrated CBT + usual care show comparable or greater reductions in depression symptoms compared to participants receiving usual care at posttreatment and follow-up.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Co-occurring insomnia and depression is a highly prevalent mental health disorder.

"Group Self-Management for Persons with Depression and Medical Illness    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Latinos suffer a greater disability burden from depression than whites due to low rates of quality depression care. Depression is common among Latinos in primary care settings and is also often chronic, recurring, and comorbid with chronic medical illness. Improving outcomes for both depression and chronic medical illness requires patients to become educated, active partners in managing their illnesses. Latinos desire education regarding general and mental health; have stigma-related concerns regarding mental health care; and prefer psychotherapy to medication. However, safety net primary care providers and clinics often prioritize improving medical outcomes and lack the resources for depression care, especially psychotherapy. There is an important public health need to develop a culturally relevant, low cost intervention that includes educational and psychotherapeutic elements, targets medical illness and depression, and destigmatizes depression care.  In response to patient, provider, and clinic preferences and resources for depression care, in prior work, we developed but have not yet tested an innovative, theoretically-based group intervention, drawing upon two evidence-based interventions that improve self-efficacy: group cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for depression and group self-management for chronic medical illness. Professionally-led group CBT is effective for depression among ethnic minorities in primary care but is difficult to sustain. Among patients with chronic medical illness, lay-led group self-management programs educate and empower patients to engage in healthful behaviors and participate in their care. The groups improve self-efficacy, health-related behaviors, and outcomes; have been adapted for diverse conditions; and have been widely disseminated and sustained. However, standard self-management groups do not improve depression. We thus enhanced the Spanish- language Tomando Control de su Salud chronic disease self-management program by adding depression- related educational and skill-building content from group CBT.  We propose to pilot test and refine Cuerpo Sano, Mente Sana, our newly enhanced Spanish-language self- management program for depression and chronic medical illness. Following a framework for successful implementation of interventions, we 1) evaluate intervention context and refine our intervention and implementation strategy; 2) conduct a randomized trial with 30 low-income Spanish-speaking patients with depressive disorder and chronic medical illness; 3) review pilot findings of feasibility, implementation, and potential sustainability with a multistakeholder panel and revise materials and procedures; 4) conduct a subsequent trial with 30 additional patients; and 5) review additional findings (now including 3- and 6-month intervention effects on self-efficacy, self-care behaviors, and depression and health outcomes) with clinic stakeholders and finalize the intervention and implementation strategy. This study lays the groundwork for future comparative effectiveness studies of strategies to improve care for Latinos in safety net primary care.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project aims to reduce ethnic disparities in depression care by pilot testing and refining a culturally relevant, low-cost intervention for improving both depression and general medical outcomes among Latinos in safety net primary care settings.

"Coregulatory Processes and Postpartum Depression in Mexican-Americans    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The consequences of postpartum depression (PPD) extend far beyond the mother's mental health, and can have severe detrimental effects on marital relationships, parenting abilities, mother-infant bonding, and infant health and development. Although Latinos are the fastest growing population group in the US, few studies of PPD have been conducted with Latina women. Existing studies suggest a significantly elevated vulnerability to PPD for low income ethnic minority women. However, the trajectories of onset and recovery have not been well- described, and little is known about the influence of cultural-ecological risk and protective factors. Further, most research has failed to consider the fundamental role of the newborn baby and the ability of mother-infant interactions to influence the onset and course of PPD. This study will evaluate a community sample of 330 low-income Mexican American first- time mothers from the prenatal period through the first postpartum year. The development of PPD and the process of recovery will be examined using well-validated symptom and clinically diagnostic measures. Culturally-ecological factors will be examined that may either confer risk or offer protection from PPD. Repeated home observations of mother-infant interactions will be collected in the critical first 6 months following childbirth. The bio-psychosocial process by which mothers and infants co-regulate each other's emotions, behavior, and physiology will be analyzed and used to predict the longitudinal course of PPD over the first year. Findings will significantly enhance understanding of the impact of culturally-relevant risk and protective factors on the onset and course of PPD in a highly vulnerable population, and will identify innovative targets (e.g., mother-infant interactions) for future interventions. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Postpartum mood disorders, primarily depression, affect a large number of new mothers. Estimates range from 10-15 percent in general population samples. However, striking health disparities are evident in studies evaluating low-income and/or ethnic minority mothers, for whom prevalence rates from 24-49 percent have been reported. A large research literature documents the substantial detrimental public health impact of postpartum depression, not just for women, but for their partners and children as well. According to the World Health Organization (2007), depression is the leading cause of disability worldwide, and the fourth leading contributor to worldwide burden of disease. Infants and children of mothers who are depressed, especially those experiencing social disadvantage, face considerable short and long-term disadvantage, including lower birth weight, poorer cognitive development, higher rates of behavioral and social problems, and more frequent emotional problems. In Arizona, the largest percentages of new births are to Hispanic women, of whom the majority is classified as low-income. Population birth trends in Arizona (and the US as a whole), the magnitude of the public health impact of postpartum mood disorders, and the significant mental health disparities new Hispanic mothers experience argue for the critical need for further understanding of processes affecting the development of postpartum mood disorders in low-income Mexican American women.

"Internet Intervention to Prevent Major Depressive Episodes    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) Latino Mental Health Research Program, based at San Francisco General Hospital (SFGH), proposes to develop evidence-based Internet interventions in Spanish and English to prevent major depressive episodes (MDEs). The current pilot project has three aims designed to set the stage for a subsequent randomized control trial of such an Internet intervention:  Aim 1. Adaptation of a widely tested cognitive-behavioral intervention for Internet administration, and creation of a self-help research Website that will automatically recruit participants online, deliver the intervention online, and conduct follow-up assessments online.  Aim 2. Usability testing of the Website with Spanish- and English-speaking men and women from public sector health clinics to assess and optimize, prior to launching the online pilot study: accessibility to as wide a range of individuals as possible, to reduce disparities; understanding of informed consent for the study; and understanding of the various study measures (i.e., measures of depression, self-efficacy, and so on).  Aim 3. Conducting a nationwide online pilot study of the site in Spanish and English to examine: recruitment rates, response rates to specific ads to identify best recruitment strategies, and characteristics of responders; information on the effectiveness of informed consent procedures to enhance understanding of key aspects of the study; utilization patterns of each element of the site; and efficacy of methods to reduce follow-up attrition.  This application is responsive to NIMH Strategic Objective 3 (to develop new and better interventions that incorporate the diverse needs and circumstances of people with mental illnesses) and Objective 4 (to strengthen the public health impact of NIMH-supported research). The Internet intervention would provide a highly innovative means of delivering preventive mental health services for undertreated and underserved populations. An online intervention of this type has the potential to reach millions of individuals nationally and internationally, thereby maximizing the public health benefit of NIMH funding.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Major depression affects millions of people and is the number one cause of disability worldwide. An Internet intervention that prevents depression and that can reach at-risk individuals in their own language, 24 hours a day, anywhere with Web access, would greatly increase mental health outreach in the U.S. and beyond. The scalability of such an intervention could also make it very cost effective as a public health measure.

"Exploring CBT-DM's Absoulte and Relative Efficacy for Depressed T1DM Latino Youth    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is an R03 (PAR-09-223) application submitted to NIDDK. This study entails the revision of the 12-session Group Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT-DM) manual for depressed Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (T1DM) Latino youth, and explores both the absolute efficacy of CBT-DM against a treatment as usual (TAU) condition, and the added impact of CBT-DM over the original culturally-adapted CBT for depression. After initial manual revision by our expert team, in-depth interviews with diabetes treatment providers, and a small pre-pilot study with 8 depressed T1DM Latino youth and their parents will be conducted to inform the revision of and further refine CBT-DM treatment manual. Focus groups with youth and parents in the small pre-pilot study will serve to complete the refinement process. Finally, 60 depressed T1DM youth will be randomized to one of three conditions: CBT-DM, CBT for depression, and TAU. Treatment efficacy will be assessed by comparing changes on depression, self-esteem and functionality scores, diabetes self-efficacy and quality of life, and treatment adherence and self-care management of T1DM. We propose that both CBT-DM and CBT will be superior to TAU in reducing depression, and improving self-esteem and functionality. We also hypothesize that CBT-DM will be superior to the other conditions in domains related to T1DM (diabetes self-efficacy, quality of life, treatment adherence and self-care behaviors). Intake data will be obtained with structured diagnostic interviews, self-report scales and laboratory tests of glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c). We will assess youth T1DM health and treatment adherence information, mental health (including depression) diagnostic status, youth cognitive and affective variables, parent and family functioning, and family knowledge about youth depression and T1DM. We will also evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of treatment, the adequacy of randomization, attrition rates, therapist competence and treatment integrity. The assessment will be conducted at baseline, at weeks 5, 9 and 12 (post-treatment), and at the three- and six-month follow-ups. This investigation is the second step in a research program aimed to bring the benefits of evidence-based treatment (EBT) development to Latino youth with comorbid T1DM and depression, and set the stage for a larger-scale and definite study of treatment efficacy (R01). This study is innovative because it is the first that could potentially contribute to provide initial evidence in support of the probably-efficacious status of a psychosocial intervention aimed at both improving diabetes health status and reducing depressive symptoms in youth. The revised CBT-DM manual for T1DM Latino youth would also be an innovative clinical tool that could enhance the prevention of mood disorders and the reduction of health disparities in this minority group.     This study is likely to shed light on whether a novel intervention combining CBT with diabetes education for youth can reduce the morbidity observed in those with co-morbid T1DM and depression and achieve positive diabetes outcomes, as opposed to Treatment as usual (TAU) and CBT for depression. It will be the first to develop/adapt and pilot-test (in a small Randomized Clinical Trial-type design) a culturally-sensitive intervention specifically tailored to Latino youth with co-morbid T1DM and depression, and if proven to be promising, it will make it attractive for administrators to implement it in primary care and mental health settings serving the Latino pediatric population. This research will potentially help to close knowledge gaps in treatment research with T1DM Latino children and impact other behavioral, cognitive, and affective factors that add on the burden of diabetes in this vulnerable and underserved group.

"Barriers and Facilitators of Mental Health Services Utilization Among Latinos    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Using a community-based participatory research (CBPR) model, this 5-year longitudinal cohort study will empirically assess the association of individual, partner/family, social context and larger community stressors, on clinical depression, depression severity, and cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk among Caribbean Latinos in Lawrence, MA, and assess the buffering effects of culture-specific types of social support and resources on these associations. Partners in this collaboration are: individual Latino residents of Lawrence; community- based organizations including the Greater Lawrence Family Health Center, the City of Lawrence Mayor's Health Task Force, the Lawrence Council on Aging/Senior Center, the YWCA of Greater Lawrence, Holy Family Hospital, Lawrence General Hospital; and UMass Medical School (UMMS). This collaboration began in 2003 and the proposed study builds from its prior CBPR work. The study will be conducted among 600 Caribbean Latino adults living in Lawrence, MA, a HRSA defined medically underserved community. Available evidence suggests that depressive symptoms and clinical depression are highly prevalent among low-income Latinos in the US. However, there is a scarcity of longitudinal studies of depression in this population, and relatively little is known about the risk and protective factors for these conditions in this population. Evidence indicates that depression is an independent risk factor for disability, excess mortality and adverse health outcomes, including cardiovascular disease, a leading cause of death among Latinos. Understanding the stressors that contribute to depression and CVD risk among Latinos is crucial to developing targeted interventions. The primary aims of the proposed study are to: 1) assess cross-sectional associations between stress (measured at the individual, partner/family, social and larger community levels) and measures of clinical depression and depression severity; 2) assess longitudinal associations between stress (measured at the individual, partner/family, social and larger community levels) and measures of clinical depression and depression severity; and 3) assess the mediating effect of social support and resources (measured at the individual, partner/family, social and larger community levels) on the associations between stress and measures of clinical depression and depression severity. The secondary aims are to: 4) assess the longitudinal association between stress and measures of depression with CVD risk and 5) investigate the mediating effect of health-related behaviors, namely diet, physical activity, smoking, alcohol use and sleep on the association between stress and measures of depression with CVD risk. Study participants will be followed for two years with measures taken annually. CBPR aims are to: 1) enhance the participatory infrastructure of the Partnership through continuous self-assessment; 2) evaluate the outreach process for diffusion and dissemination of study results; and 3) evaluate the success in implementing new programs and developing new research projects that build from the results of the proposed study.

"Telepsychiatry & Culturally Sensitive Treatment of Depressed Asian Americans    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Asian Americans tend to underutilize mental health services compared to other ethnic groups, with delayed treatment and higher attrition rates (Kung, 2003). When suffering from symptoms of mental illnesses, many underserved Chinese Americans seek help from their primary care physicians (PCPs) (Yeung et al., 2004a). In 2003, the applicant received a Career Development Award to study the effectiveness of Culturally Sensitive Collaborative Treatment (CSCT) for the treatment of underserved Chinese Americans with major depressive disorder (MDD) in primary care. The key elements of CSCT are active screening to increase recognition of depressed patients, culturally sensitive consultation by a psychiatrist and care management. Preliminary findings show that CSCT improves case recognition, facilitates engagement, and decreases the disparities of treatment among underserved Chinese Americans with MDD (Yeung et al., 2006; Yeung, 2007). This proposed study will investigate the feasibility and effectiveness of using Telepsychiatry-based CSCT (T-CSCT) to extend the CSCT model to underserved Chinese Americans in remote clinics. The specific aims of this study are: 1) To investigate whether telepsychiatry consultation is acceptable to underserved Chinese Americans with MDD and to their PCPs, and 2) To investigate the effectiveness of T-CSCT on improving treatment outcomes of underserved Chinese Americans with MDD in remote clinics. Subjects will be recruited by depression screening in primary care clinics and by advertisements to promote depression self-screening. Two hundred underserved Chinese American patients who screen positive for MDD will be randomized to receive either T-CSCT or Usual Care (UC). Treatment outcomes of patients in these two groups will be compared. This study will examine the acceptability and effectiveness of telepsychiatry- based culturally sensitive psychiatric treatment for underserved Chinese Americans with major depressive disorder. The goal is to increase access to mental health services and to decrease disparities in the treatment of depression among ethnic minority patients.

"Social Imprinting in the Development of Major Depression PROJECT SUMMARY   This application seeks support to investigate the neurodevelopmental origins and etiology of major depressive disorder. Specifically, we propose to test a ""fetal programming"" model of depression in which adverse conditions during the fetal period-as indicated by exposure to maternal hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) hormones, elevated maternal pro-inflammatory cytokines; early social adversity; and genetic susceptibility, combine to contribute to a trajectory of elevated lifetime risk for major depression. This project also addresses the challenge of health disparities, which for depression are marked and persistent, and which remain an NIH priority area. We propose that the social origins of depression are, in part, neurodevelopmental  in nature, and that understanding the developmental pathways to depression will not only yield significant insights into etiology, but will also advance the objective of reducing disparities.   The aims of this proposal are: 1) to investigate the combined influences of atypical fetal stress-response pathways and social adversity in relation to the lifetime risk of major depressive disorder; and 2) to investigate gene-environment interactions during the prenatal period in the development of depression. The following hypotheses will be tested. 1) The long-term impact of prenatal risks-as indicated by maternal pro-  inflammatory cytokines and maternal HPA activity-for major depression will be heightened under adverse social conditions. Hypothesis 1a is that the combination of maternal-fetal stress, as indicated by elevated levels of inflammatory cytokines (IL-1, IL-6, TNF-) during mid-gestation, and social adversity will be associated with an increased lifetime risk and recurrence of major depression. Hypothesis 1b is that levels of HPA hormones (increased CRH and decreased DHEAS and hCG) during mid-gestation will be associated with the lifetime risk and recurrence of major depression most strongly among individuals born in the context of social adversity 2) Social adversity during pregnancy and early infancy, in combination with genetic  susceptibility to depression, with be associated with an elevated lifetime risk of depression. Hypothesis 2 is that polymorphisms in genes associated with HPA circuitry and in genes with prior replicated evidence of environmentally dependent effects on depression, will be associated with an increased risk of depression most  strongly among children born in the context of social adversity.     This proposal involves data from a 50-year investigation of a well-established birth cohort, the New England Family Study, which is uniquely capable of addressing the prenatal determinants of mental illness.  The applicant is a social epidemiologist whose long-term career objectives are to discover the developmental pathways leading to major depression, and to identify modifiable pathways in order to reduce the public health burden of depression. RELEVANCE   The aim of this project is to investigate the combined influences of the fetal exposures, genetic susceptibility, and social adversity to the neurodevelopmental origins of major depression.

"Development of an Integrated Microfinance and Depression Care Program for Women     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): It is estimated that by the year 2030, depression will be the single largest contributor to the world's health care burden. Effective treatments exist, bu they do not reach many depressed individuals, especially in resource-poor communities--ethnic minorities, rural residents in the United States, and individuals in most of the developing world. Among the many barriers for treatment are lack of trained professionals, stigma attached to mental health issues, lack of knowledge about mental health resources, and the low perceived value of treatment, particularly when other survival needs seem more pressing.  Women, in particular, are at risk for depression and poverty. Integrating programs that treat depression and address livelihood concerns may improve engagement in depression treatment and improve mental health and functioning for patients in low-resource settings. The proposed R-34 project would integrate depression care with existing ""microfinance"" programs, which provide poverty-alleviation services including small loans, savings programs, and vocational training to women. This project builds on a $2.5 million project funded by Atlantic Philanthropies in 2009 to develop a collaborative care model for the treatment of depression in the primary care systems of Danang and Khanh Hoa provinces in Vietnam by extending the collaborative care team to include the Women's Union lay health workers and delivering the program in the community. The Vietnam Women's Union has an impressive record of accomplishment for successful delivery of microfinance programs to Vietnamese women. This project will 1) conduct qualitative studies of barriers and facilitators of women's successful use of existing depression care and microfinance programs; 2) adapt and integrate the depression care and microfinance services; 3) train Women's Union facilitators to deliver the integrated depression care and microfinance program; and 4) conduct randomized pilot testing of the integrated program to assess acceptability, feasibility, and preliminary effectiveness. These findings will inform a future R01 proposal to conduct a full-scale randomized control study examining the effectiveness of the integrated model and the mechanism of change in the intervention.  The proposed project has significant public health implications for providing depression treatment in resource-poor communities and it offers an innovative approach to addressing overlapping vulnerabilities of gender, depression, and poverty in a collaborative care model, which may be applicable to other resource- poor settings in the United States and abroad. The project is consistent with the designation of global health as one of NIH's top five research priorities.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This study seeks to develop and integrate microfinance program into behavior-activation based collaborative care program for depression for women in under-served and under-resourced communities in the U.S. and abroad.

"Internet Studies to Enhance Long Term Survivorship after Hematologic Malignancy    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This investigator-initiated new R01 application, in response to PA-10-067, proposes to reduce depression and cancer-related emotional distress, while also improving health behaviors in adult hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) survivors using an internet-based intervention in a multi-center randomized controlled clinical trial (RCT). Among adult long-term cancer survivors, those who received HSCT live with some of the highest risks for life-threatening chronic health conditions including cardiovascular disease, diabetes, osteoporosis, and recurrence or second cancers along with other risks. Even more prevalent in HSCT survivors are psychological symptoms that inhibit quality of life, specifically depression and cancer-related distress. Our previous internet intervention has demonstrated efficacy in reducing depression and distress with survivors at a single site, and has pilot tested the efficacy of providing a survivorship preventive care plan. With the proposed improvements and the extension of the intervention to multiple transplant centers we expect to strengthen both the reach and efficacy of the intervention while we advance the science of internet-based providing of health behavior change models to cancer survivors. Specific aims of the project are to: 1) determine whether 2-10 year HSCT survivors with elevated depression or cancer-related distress who are randomized to receive access to a tailored internet-based program report reduced depression and distress when compared with control group survivors who receive a survivorship care plan by mail and delayed access to the internet site (enhanced usual care), and 2) determine whether survivors with low survivorship preventive care adherence (PCA) who are randomized to receive access to the tailored internet-based program, including a survivorship preventive care plan, report increased PCA when compared with control group survivors. The study will examine main effects of the intervention as well as moderating (age <40, chronic graft versus host disease, rural residence, lower income) and mediating effects (health self-efficacy, knowledge of survivorship needs) per Protection Motivation Theory. Further analyses will identify risk factors for disparities in survivorship preventive care adherence in HSCT survivors. The five-site multi-center RCT will enroll N=1200 adult HSCT survivors with internet access. Assessments will occur at baseline, 3 and 12 months. Participants without internet access will be invited to complete the baseline assessment for participation in the risk factor analyses. To our knowledge, this study will be the first to explore the efficacy of a tailored internet-based intervention, enhanced with options for alerts and reminders through individualized SMS messaging, mobile applications and social networking media, to target health behaviors in a cancer survivor population. The program is cost-effective and readily tailored. If effective, the program could be disseminated nationwide for long-term HSCT survivors in all transplant centers and would provide a framework for similar survivorship care models in non-HSCT cancer survivor populations.        Among adult long-term cancer survivors, those who receive hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT: also called blood, marrow or umbilical cord blood transplantation) live with some of the highest risks for life-threatening chronic health conditions including cardiovascular disease, diabetes, osteoporosis, and recurrence or second cancers. Also prevalent in HSCT survivors are symptoms that inhibit quality of life such as depression and cancer-related emotional distress. In a study with five sites across the nation, this research is designed to test whether a tailored internet-based survivorship program with methods for managing health behaviors improves depression, emotional distress and adherence to health care guidelines in adult HSCT survivors.

"Mediators of the Relationship Between Depression and HIV Medication Adherence     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Poor adherence to highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) is a significant clinical issue in the treatment and prevention of HIV, as extremely high levels of HAART adherence are necessary to maintain viral suppression. Recent evidence suggests only 19% of individuals on HAART nationwide show optimal adherence and achieve full viral suppression. Efforts to better understand and improve HAART adherence are crucial to managing the HIV/AIDS epidemic. A group that evidences a disproportionate burden of new HIV infection is low-income minority substance users living in urban areas. In D.C. specifically, where the highest rate of new HIV/AIDS cases in the U.S. are reported each year, the most notable increase in new infection has been among low-income, minority substance users. In this group, one of the most significant and prevalent patient-level barriers to adherence is depressive symptoms. Depressive symptoms, even at subclinical levels, predict nonadherence above and beyond other relevant psychosocial factors, including current substance use. Despite the focus on depressive symptoms as a reliable and powerful predictor of HAART nonadherence among substance users with HIV, few studies have sought to test potential mechanisms underlying this relationship, which is an important step to advance our understanding of how depression affects adherence to inform intervention efforts in this group. Using reinforcement-based theory, we focus on two key shared behavioral/environmental factors related to both depression and substance use that include: (1) reductions in goal-directed activity level and (2) reductions in positive reinforcement in one's environment. Extensive evidence suggests the relevance of these factors to HAART adherence; however, they have not been tested as potential mediators of the relationship between depressive symptoms and HAART adherence. Thus, the aim of the proposal is to test the mediating roles of goal-directed activity level and positive reinforcement in this relationship in a sample of low-income HIV positive substance users. We will use a repeated measures design assessing self-report and clinician rated measures of depressive symptoms, substance use, goal-directed activity level, positive reinforcement, and HAART adherence, as well as clinical indicators (Viral Load, CD4 count) over a 3-month period. The sample will include 125 HIV positive substance users recruited from a large HIV clinic in Washington, D.C. Results have important implications as they would provide the first test of potential mechanisms that may account for the relationship between depression and HAART adherence among low-income, minority substance users, a group at extremely high-risk for poor HIV outcomes. As Kazdin (2007) noted, it is crucial to identify mediators in order to maximize parsimony and optimize efficacy of interventions. Current findings have clear implications for increasing effectiveness and parsimony of integrated interventions to target depression and HAART adherence, as well as important implications for prevention, as better understanding and improving adherence may reduce the risk of transmission in this high-risk group.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Efforts to better understand and improve adherence to highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) among low- income, minority substance users living with HIV is crucial to managing the HIV/AIDS epidemic. One reliable and powerful predictor of nonadherence in this population is depression, yet to date no studies have tested how depression impacts adherence.

"FOR MOMS:Culturally Relevant Treatment for Perinatal Depression  Title: ""FOR MOMS: Culturally Relevant Treatment Services for Perinatal Depression"" Abstract:  Among socio-economically disadvantaged minority and white women, depression during pregnancy and the postpartum is often under-detected and under-treated. Maternal postpartum depression has adverse, lasting effects on maternal, infant and child well-being. Depression during pregnancy has been demonstrated to be the most potent predictor of postpartum depression and appears to be linked to low birth weight and prematurity. Poor, urban women are at least twice as likely as middle-class women to meet diagnostic criteria for major depression during pregnancy. At the same time, depressed, disadvantaged women have been proven difficult to engage and retain in mental health treatmentbecause they face numerous barriers to care at the patient, provider, and system levels. This proposed randomized, controlled trial will evaluate the effects of a culturally relevant, multicomponent intervention for antenatal depression (FOR MOMS, ""Maintain Our Mothers' Strength"") that has the potential to overcome patient, provider, and system-level barriers to care and engage depressed, low-income women in evidence-based treatments to reduce antenatal depressive symptoms, improve maternal psychosocial functioning, and ameliorate postpartum depression. This research will take advantage of the unique partnership between the Seattle King County Public Health Department (PHSKC) and the University of Washington's School of Social Work and Department of Psychiatry. We propose to enroll a sample of 220 depressed, pregnant women on Medicaid from PHSKC and will test the effectiveness of the FOR MOMS intervention relative to usual care for antenatal depression. FOR MOMS consists of a pre- treatment engagement session and a choice of brief interpersonal psychotherapy (IPT) or evidence-based pharmacotherapy. The engagement session and brief IPT for antenatal depression have been enhanced to reduce racial and economic disparities in treatment engagement and retention and have been shown to be effective in a pilot study. After study entry, assessments will be conducted at baseline and 3, 6, 12, and 18 months post-baseline, a time period designed to include the first postpartum year. We will examine the effects of the FOR MOMS intervention on clinical and functional outcomes and conduct an incremental cost effectiveness analysis of the costs and benefits of the intervention from a health and welfare agency perspective. Our study team is comprised of an interdisciplinary group of researchers with extensive expertise in health services research, health economics, and clinical research with depressed, low-income, minority women.

"Psychiatric Epidemiology: Racial Disparities among Vulnerable Populations with De DESCRIPTION (Abstract Provided by Applicant): Remarkably little is known about protective factors that reduce African Americans' risk for depression and diabetes comorbidity. In particular, the link between service use and risk reduction in African Americans has never been demonstrated with a nationally representative sample, particularly one that also takes into account ethnic groups' differences. The lack of research on depression and diabetes comorbidity research among African Americans is due primarily to rather small samples of Black Americans in available data sets from which to draw meaningful conclusions. The proposed research plan aims to provide a comprehensive examination of whether socioeconomic status (SES) and known risk and protective factors are correlated with reductions in the risk for comorbid depression and diabetes with special attention to low income populations in a nationally representative sample of 5,191 African Americans and Caribbean Blacks. The public health significance lies in specifying which demographic factors related to lower comorbidity risk, which will inform subsequent health social service prevention interventions and strategies. The present study plan is designed to advance knowledge and make five important contributions to the literature on depression and diabetes comorbidity among African Americans, namely by: (1) capitalizing on the strengths of a large, nationally representative data set, the National Survey of American Life [NSAL]; (2) determining whether SES is associated with reductions in the risk for the studied comorbid condition by Blacks; (3) examining the mediation effects of health insurance status on the relationship between SES and comorbid depression and diabetes conditions; (4) investigating the relative effects of comorbid status on employment outcomes for welfare recipients; and (5) describing the cultural meaning of being diagnosed with and managing health care with a comorbid diagnosis. The data analytic approaches to be used include logistic regression, multi-nominal logistic regression, and qualitative theme analyses techniques. Project Narrative Comorbid depression and diabetes is recognized as a condition that is costly to the health care system and is a vital topic of public health concern. Remarkably, few investigations focus on the link between service use and risk reduction in African Americans with this comorbid condition.

"Participatory design of mHealth strategies to support collaborative care in perin  Title: Participatory design of mHealth strategies to support collaborative care in perinatal depression      Ian M. Bennett MD PhD          Project Summary    There is a pressing need to expand the reach of perinatal depression care to low income women from  race/ethnic minority populations. Large disparities in depression care delivery between women receiving  Medicaid and those with private insurance are documented. Strategies to reduce these disparities must  address economic, social, and cultural barriers on the patient side as well as limited resources in the safety net  system serving these patients. Patient Centered Outcomes Research (PCOR) methods have not been applied  to the problem of how to reduce these disparities. This K18 career enhancement award in PCOR proposes,  through a program of mentoring, formal coursework, and a linked research project, to build skills in PCOR  methods targeting the delivery of evidence based care to low income women with perinatal depression. In the  research component a participatory design and rapid prototyping approach will be employed to develop and  pilot an mHealth intervention to support sustained implementation of the evidence based collaborative care  approach to depression services in non specialty mental health settings. This project will address work needed  to prepare for a pragmatic comparative effectiveness trial to be carried out after the development of a beta  version of the mHealth system. While over 40 high quality studies now show collaborative care models improve  the quality of depression treatment and outcomes in general medical settings, this approach has not been  widely implemented or sustained. Central to the collaborative care model is a care manager who monitors  patient adherence, response to treatments, and side effects, while providing effective clinical feedback to other  members of the depression care team regarding the status of the patient. The resources required for care  management are high, however, particularly for relatively under-resourced sites caring for low income women~  this high resource cost reduces the sustained implementation of collaborative care. mHealth approaches,  which capitalize on the widespread patient use of mobile phones, hold promise as effective strategies to assist  and even enhance the work of care managers. These systems can potentially carry out substantial portions of  the monitoring, adherence assessment/support, and clinical feedback functions of care managers. To improve  the end user acceptability of the proposed system it will be developed in a participatory manner with patients  and care team members from three diverse prenatal clinics serving low income women with established care  managers.     PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The burden of untreated perinatal depression on public health is very large with direct effects on maternal child health outcomes and long lasting effects on health and health care utilization for both mothers and their children. Improving the sustained implementation of the evidence based collaborative care approach to perinatal depression is expected to have large returns on the mental health of the public while reducing the costs of delivering this care.             ",Participatory design of mHealth strategies to support collaborative care in perin,8599670,K18HS022441,[''],AHRQ,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,K18,2013,163166,0.1666391294467092
"Treatment of Insomnia and Depression in Elders (TIDE)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Insomnia and depression are two of the most prevalent mental health disorders and often co-occur. Health disparities in rural America and among African-Americans are well documented. We propose an R34 exploratory project to test the feasibility of delivering high-fidelity insomnia and depression psychological services to an underserved population. Treatment of Insomnia and Depression in Elders (TIDE) is a pilot study that will treat rural, predominantly African-American older adults who present to their primary care physician with co-occurring insomnia/depression. Stage 1 will be an uncontrolled case study series (n = 10) focusing on treatment development/refinement and patient acceptability. In stage 2, feasibility will be experimentally tested with 46 participants randomized to integrated cognitive-behavior therapy (CBT) + usual care or to usual care only in an effectiveness pilot study. The treatment will combine/integrate compact CBT for insomnia (including relaxation, sleep restriction, and stimulus control) and for depression (including cognitive therapy and behavioral activation). The experimental intervention comprises delivering CBT services by videoconferencing to patients in primary care settings who live in rural areas. Treatment will be evaluated by pre, post, and follow-up self report instruments on insomnia, depression, and quality of life. In addition, the stage 1 pilot will use investigator designed quantitative and qualitative measures to evaluate critical process variables including patient acceptability of the video format, patient acceptability of the treatments, and obstacles to adherence. Depending on stage 1 data, these measures may be incorporated into stage 2 as well.  Several innovative features of this exploratory project include: intervening with CBT on both disorders hoping to gain a synergy by their combined presentation; use of telehealth to deliver treatment to distant locations; translation of efficacy findings to an effectiveness trial; treatment will be delivered in the primary care setting, the preferred locale of rural, older adults; the study will extend knowledge of the range of CBT applications by enrolling under-represented groups with respect to ethnicity, literacy, and financial resources.  The primary aims of this project are (1) to determine the feasibility and maximal therapy characteristics of integrated CBT for co-occurring insomnia/depression in both the case study series (stage 1) and the experimental investigation (stage 2), (2) collect pilot data on whether participants receiving integrated CBT + usual care show comparable or greater reductions in insomnia symptoms compared to participants receiving usual care at posttreatment and follow-up, and (3) collect pilot data on whether participants receiving integrated CBT + usual care show comparable or greater reductions in depression symptoms compared to participants receiving usual care at posttreatment and follow-up.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Co-occurring insomnia and depression is a highly prevalent mental health disorder. This combination is well represented in groups characterized by health disparities: rural, African-Americans. We propose an R34 exploratory project to test the feasibility of delivering high-fidelity insomnia and depression psychological services to these underserved populations.

"An Innovative Approach to Preventing Depression    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application is submitted is in response to PAR-09-173: Pilot Intervention and Services Research Grants (R34). We propose to use this grant mechanism to address three priority areas of the NIMH including decreasing the morbidity associated with depression, improving the mental health of females, and reducing the racial disparity in mental health. We address these issues by developing a novel approach to preventing depression in preadolescent African American girls growing up in urban, low-income environments. Aims: The specific aims for the proposed application are to: 1) Develop methods and infrastructure for carrying out tests of proof-of-principle, and 2) Establish proof-of principle through evidence of feasibility and acceptability and preliminary studies of efficacy and determination of settings for deployment. Approach: Our approach will be to target individual and interpersonal vulnerabilities that have been shown to confer risk for depression in our existing research on African American girls living in low- income, urban settings. Specifically, we aim to increase assertiveness and active coping in order to reduce early emerging depressive symptoms during the preadolescent period. In addition, we propose that increasing interpersonal connectedness with the mother via maternal engagement in the prevention program is necessary to yield effects that generalize and are maintained. Investigators: The Principal Investigators, Drs. Kathryn Keenan and Kathryn Grant, are among the leading researchers in the field of developmental psychopathology who focus on children living in urban poverty. They are currently testing developmental models of depression in girls growing up in poverty. The present application is a joint venture in which their collective expertise in depression research and recent interest in translating their empirical findings to the prevention of depression will be applied. Innovation: The three novel aspects of our approach to preventing depression in females are targeting the preadolescent period, deriving individual vulnerabilities from existing datasets to target in the prevention program, using the mother as the method of delivery of the preventive intervention, and addressing barriers that have limited participation of low-income urban African American families in treatment.  Public Health Relevance: Achievement of the aims described in this application will be the first step toward a major advancement in the prevention of depressive disorders for a population who is at highest risk for disorder and is least likely to receive mental health services, and has been underrepresented in preventive intervention research. Preventing the onset of depressive disorders in adolescent girls is one of the most promising avenues toward reducing the morbidity associated with depression for females.

"Stress, depression, and the mother-infant relationship across the first year    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The current application seeks to investigate the role of chronic daily stress in the course of postpartum depression, the negative impact on infant cognitive and emotional development, and the mediating role of the mother-infant relationship on infant development. Chronic stress is linked to the onset and course of depression, and as many as 19% of women (49% of Mexican-American women) suffer from postpartum depression, making it a significant public health concern. Exposure to maternal depression during early infancy has significant long-term effects on several developmental processes. There is a substantial literature that details the negative effects of postpartum depression on infant adaptation, including deficits in both cognitive functioning and the development of emotion regulation skills. It is possible that these developmental competencies may be dependent upon mother-infant relationship quality, and that this relationship mediates the effects of maternal depression. The proposed research plan will test several models to address the role of daily stress, the impact of depression on the mother-infant relationship and infant competencies, and the mediational role of the quality of the mother-infant relationship on infant development. Data will be drawn from a larger longitudinal study that explores coregulatory processes between infants and their depressed, Mexican-American mothers. Measurements include maternal self-reports of stress, depression, and infant emotional regulation; observations of mother-infant interactions; and assessment of infant cognitive and emotional development across the first postpartum year. These data allow the opportunity to longitudinally explore important public health issues related to postpartum depression and infant development in a high risk population.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research has important public health implications due to high prevalence rates of postpartum depression in Mexican-American women and the significant impact it is found to have on infant development. Infants with early developmental risk are more likely to suffer from mental health issues, have poorer academic achievement through adolescence, and have poorer long-term adjustment. A better understanding of the mechanisms through which this negative impact operates is needed to inform prevention and intervention programs to promote healthy child development.

"Social Media, Teen Moms, and PPD     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     Approximately 400,000 live births occur to adolescents in the United States annually. Of the 50% of adolescent mothers who experience depressive symptoms, less than 25% comply with referrals for depression evaluation and treatment due to lack of knowledge of depression symptoms (literacy), negative attitude towards mental health treatment, perception that individuals with depression are stigmatized (subjective norms), lack of understanding of health resources that are available to her and under her control (perceived control), and lack of time. Untreated depression creates a public health problem in this vulnerable group impacting the adolescent's relationships, functioning at work and school, health care seeking behaviors, mothering skills, and development as well as the development of her child. An innovative and evidence based approach is needed that overcomes each of these barriers, is feasible, is acceptable to adolescent mothers and leads to greater rates of depression treatment. Social media is a promising vehicle to reach and educate adolescent mothers since most adolescent mothers use social media for communication and to search for health information. Based upon the Theory of Planned Behavior, we will target 10 counties in Kentucky with a social media ad campaign that will result in adolescent mothers (n=140) from those counties enrolling in an internet based intervention related to postpartum depression. The previously tested intervention includes vignettes from other adolescent mothers, questions and answers, resources, and an option to enroll in text message service. Before the intervention, after the intervention, and two weeks later the adolescent mothers will complete established questionnaires to determine if the intervention improved attitude and subjective norms towards depression and depression treatment, perceived control and intention related to seeking depression treatment, and the number of adolescent mothers with symptoms of depression who receive depression treatment. Data will be compared to scores on the same instruments from adolescent mothers (n=140) from the control group (10 other counties in Kentucky) that have not been targeted with the social media ad campaign or participated in the intervention. Data from the adolescent mothers in the control group will be collected in partnership with community agencies. The overall purpose of this trial is to test a cost effective and feasible method for reducing the cognitive an emotional barriers to accessing depression treatment in adolescent mothers. The specific aims are to (1) measure the extent to which a social media ad campaign is effective as a recruitment strategy; (2) test the effectiveness of an internet based social marketing intervention on both intention to seek treatment and rates of depression treatment, and (3) examine the dose effect of the intervention. The innovative use of social media ads and an internet based social marketing intervention to increase rates of depression treatment in adolescent mothers has the potential to improve public health of two generations, adolescent mothers and their infants, and allows us to address a serious national health problem.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:     Fifty percent of teen mothers experience symptoms of depression, but few seek or receive depression treatment. Untreated depression creates a public health problem in this vulnerable group impacting the teen's relationships, her functioning at work and school, healthcare seeking behaviors, her mothering skills, and her and her child's development. We will target teen mothers in 10 Kentucky counties with Google and Facebook ads, invite them to participate in an internet intervention that encourages depression treatment, and compare their rate of depression treatment to a control group of teen mothers in 10 other Kentucky counties.            ","Social Media, Teen Moms, and PPD",8484549,R15NR013563,"['adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Attitude ', ' Behavior ', ' Infant and Child Development ', ' Child Development ', ' Forms of Communication ', ' Communications Media ', ' Communities ', ' Control Groups ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' Health ', ' health seeking behavior ', ' Health Care Seeking Behavior ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' Health Promotion ', ' Health Resources ', ' Community Hospitals ', ' Infant ', ' interventions research ', ' intervention research ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' Kentucky ', ' literacy ', ' Marketing ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Methods ', ' Mothers ', ' Nursing Profession ', ' Nursing Field ', ' Nursing ', ' Discipline of Nursing ', ' Patient Training ', ' Patient Instruction ', ' Patient Education ', ' Perception ', ' Planning Theory ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Questionnaires ', ' recruit ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' Research ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Schools ', ' Science ', ' Social transformation ', ' Social modification ', ' Social Change ', ' Social Marketing ', ' Societies ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Work ', ' County ', ' Generations ', ' Measures ', ' depressive ', ' depression symptom ', ' Emotional Depression ', ' depressive symptoms ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' RQ2 ', ' Intention ', ' base ', ' urban area ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Adolescent ', ' Evaluation ', ' Postnatal Depression ', ' Post-Partum Depression ', ' Post-Natal Depression ', ' Postpartum Depression ', ' Individual ', ' teenage mom ', ' teen mother ', ' teen mom ', ' adolescent mother ', ' teenage mother ', ' Policies ', ' world wide web ', ' web ', ' WWW ', ' Internet ', ' Exposure to ', ' instrument ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Adopted ', ' Pattern ', ' Live Birth ', ' behavior change ', ' interest ', ' Services ', ' experience ', ' skills ', ' novel technologies ', ' new technology ', ' social ', ' depression screening ', ' Depression screen ', ' Emotional ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Address ', ' Dose ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Clinical Nursing ', ' Cognitive ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' teen years ', ' Teen ', ' Teenagers ', ' Text ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' cost ', ' underserved people ', ' under served population ', ' Underserved Population ', ' Outcome ', ' cost-effective ', ' cost effective ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' Health behavior change ', ' public health relevance ', ' evidence base ', ' intervention effect ', ' ']",NINR,UNIVERSITY OF LOUISVILLE,R15,2013,449420,0.08615090041290394
"Reducing Disparities and Improving Care for Depression in OB-GYN Clinics    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Background: Major depressive episodes occur throughout a woman's lifespan, with the highest rates during the reproductive and menopausal transition years. During this time, OB-GYNs are the only providers whom many women regularly see. Low income and minority women are particularly likely to seek their routine care in OB-GYN clinics. There are marked gaps in accuracy of diagnosis and quality of depression care in OB-GYN clinics, with disparities in quality of depression care which exceed those seen in primary care clinics. Models incorporating depression care into clinical settings may be adaptable to OB-GYN settings but have not been tested outside of the perinatal period. Most women seen by OB-GYNs are not pregnant; thus, studies focusing solely on perinatal depression excludes a large number of women who could benefit from care. No studies to date have been completed that have adapted depression care models to OB-GYN clinics as a whole. Research Goal: We propose a three-part intervention, integrated with OB-GYN care, consisting of (i) enhanced education; (ii) engagement; and (iii) depression care management (with antidepressant monitoring and/or provision of brief psychotherapy). We hypothesize that a three-part depression intervention, integrated into the OB-GYN clinical setting, will improve treatment outcomes for depression, functional outcomes, and satisfaction with depression care. Study Design: In the proposed randomized controlled trial, 260 OB-GYN clinic patients with major depression and/or dysthymia will be assigned to either: 1) an integrated depression intervention or 2) usual care (UC). We will screen approximately 8,300 patients presenting for scheduled clinic appointments at two urban OB-GYN clinics over 18-months for major depression/dysthymia. A large number of these patients are low-income and minority women. Potentially eligible patients may also be referred by a clinic provider or reply to informational flyers posted in the clinics. The integrated depression intervention will last 12 months. Outcomes will be assessed at baseline and at 6, 12, and 18 months by telephone interviews by blinded research staff. Aims: Our Primary Aims are: 1) To evaluate, compared to UC, the impact of an integrated OB-GYN depression intervention on depression treatment outcomes, including change in depressive symptoms and depression treatment response; and 2) To evaluate, compared to UC, the impact of an integrated OB-GYN depression intervention on functional outcomes. Our Secondary Aims are: 3) To evaluate, compared to UC, the impact of an integrated OB-GYN depression intervention on quality of depression care indicators, including number of therapy visits, and dose, duration, and adherence to antidepressant medications; and on satisfaction with depression care, including patient and provider satisfaction, and provider attitudes toward depression care in OB-GYN clinics; and 4) [To identify potential facilitators and barriers to sustainability of the integrated OB-GYN intervention.]       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The results of our proposed randomized controlled trial will greatly impact public health by satisfying an unmet need for effective depression services for all women seen in the OB-GYN clinical setting. The potential improvements in depression treatment outcomes and quality of life for the large proportion of women who receive their care in this setting will be substantial.

"Evaluating Behavioral Activation Efficacy in Depressed Spanish-Speaking Latinos     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) is highly prevalent and widely-impairing across racial and ethnic groups. Higher rates of MDD have been observed among Latinos with limited English-language proficiency relative to the general population. Although MDD is a highly treatable condition, barriers to treatment access and delivery have been implicated in precluding this group from utilizing and receiving mental health services. Fortunately, Latinos tend to endorse positive attitudes toward psychosocial treatments for depression by applying the valued belief of ""poner de su parte"" or being able to do their part in one's recovery, a concept that is highly consistent with the framework of behavioral treatments for depression. The Behavioral Activation Treatment for Depression (BATD), based on reinforcement theory, may be well-equipped to address disparities associated with higher depression prevalence rates and receipt of care among Latinos with limited English-language proficiency. BATD's idiographic nature leads to a concentration on individuals' personal values, contributing to cultural-sensitivity. It is an efficient, straightforward, and cost-effective treatent that has shown efficacy in numerous samples. It can be adapted to accommodate the Latino community's ""poner de su parte"" mentality. It also explains depression as a result of environmental factors, not internal processes, which may serve to decrease stigma.  Following a small, open-label pilot study that yielded very promising results of BATD, the current study will consist of a larger, randomized control trial (n=60) that will compare BATD to Supportive Counseling in outcomes of depression, contact with positive reinforcement in the environment, treatment satisfaction, therapeutic alliance, and perceived stigma. In addition, participants' adherence rates to each of the therapies and their maintenance of clinical gains at a 3-month follow-up, will be examined.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The project will compare a Behavioral Activation Treatment for Depression (BATD) to Supportive Counseling in treating depressed Latinos with limited English-language proficiency, a group in which high rates of depression have been observed.

"FOR MOMS:Culturally Relevant Treatment for Perinatal Depression  Title: ""FOR MOMS: Culturally Relevant Treatment Services for Perinatal Depression"" Abstract:  Among socio-economically disadvantaged minority and white women, depression during pregnancy and the postpartum is often under-detected and under-treated. Maternal postpartum depression has adverse, lasting effects on maternal, infant and child well-being. Depression during pregnancy has been demonstrated to be the most potent predictor of postpartum depression and appears to be linked to low birth weight and prematurity. Poor, urban women are at least twice as likely as middle-class women to meet diagnostic criteria for major depression during pregnancy. At the same time, depressed, disadvantaged women have been proven difficult to engage and retain in mental health treatmentbecause they face numerous barriers to care at the patient, provider, and system levels. This proposed randomized, controlled trial will evaluate the effects of a culturally relevant, multicomponent intervention for antenatal depression (FOR MOMS, ""Maintain Our Mothers' Strength"") that has the potential to overcome patient, provider, and system-level barriers to care and engage depressed, low-income women in evidence-based treatments to reduce antenatal depressive symptoms, improve maternal psychosocial functioning, and ameliorate postpartum depression. This research will take advantage of the unique partnership between the Seattle King County Public Health Department (PHSKC) and the University of Washington's School of Social Work and Department of Psychiatry. We propose to enroll a sample of 220 depressed, pregnant women on Medicaid from PHSKC and will test the effectiveness of the FOR MOMS intervention relative to usual care for antenatal depression. FOR MOMS consists of a pre- treatment engagement session and a choice of brief interpersonal psychotherapy (IPT) or evidence-based pharmacotherapy. The engagement session and brief IPT for antenatal depression have been enhanced to reduce racial and economic disparities in treatment engagement and retention and have been shown to be effective in a pilot study. After study entry, assessments will be conducted at baseline and 3, 6, 12, and 18 months post-baseline, a time period designed to include the first postpartum year. We will examine the effects of the FOR MOMS intervention on clinical and functional outcomes and conduct an incremental cost effectiveness analysis of the costs and benefits of the intervention from a health and welfare agency perspective. Our study team is comprised of an interdisciplinary group of researchers with extensive expertise in health services research, health economics, and clinical research with depressed, low-income, minority women.

"A Group Treatment for Diabetes Treatment Adherence and Depression in Hispanics     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this application for a K23 Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Award is to prepare the candidate, Trina Chang, M.D., M.P.H., for a career in patient-oriented research focusing on behavioral interventions for minority patients with diabetes and depression. This is an area of enormous public health importance, as diabetes and depression are both common and costly chronic illnesses that often co-occur. Dr. Chang is a clinical researcher and community psychiatrist with a background in public health, research with minorities, and the development, implementation and evaluation of programs at the interface of psychiatry and primary care. She is based at the Massachusetts General Hospital and has access to the expertise of the Depression Clinical and Research Program, the Behavioral Medicine Program, and the Diabetes Center, as well as access to a community health center for subject recruitment. Her immediate career goal is to develop a research program testing an intervention based on problem-solving treatment (PST) to promote diabetes treatment adherence in an underserved Hispanic population; ultimately, she intends to build a career around developing and evaluating behavioral interventions for diabetes and depression in disadvantaged populations, with an eye toward interventions that address the socioeconomic conditions underlying their health problems. The training goals of this career development award are for the candidate to 1) gain experience conducting behavioral research in diabetes, 2) build expertise in developing community interventions for disadvantaged or high-stress populations, particularly Hispanics, 3) advance her skills in adapting PST for different populations and purposes, and 4) learn to conduct mediator analyses. The candidate will also take coursework in biostatistics, methods of community research and behavioral research, cultural anthropology, and the relationship between stress, disparities and health, as well as the responsible conduct of research. The research component of this project will involve a randomized, waitlist-controlled trial of a novel group intervention featuring Problem-solving, Information, Support and Motivation (PRISM) for Spanish-speaking Hispanics with poorly controlled type 2 diabetes. The primary aims will be to refine the intervention and evaluate its efficacy for improving treatment adherence, diabetes, and depression; a secondary aim will be to investigate mediators of its effect. Results of this project will form the basis of an R01 grant application. Combined, this research and training plan will enable Dr. Chang to become an independent investigator in an area with significant need and broad public health applications: treating diabetes and depression in disadvantaged populations by creating innovative behavioral interventions that address the fundamental causes of disease.     PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Diabetes is a highly prevalent and costly chronic illness, one whose toll is multiplied when it co-occurs with depression.

"Understanding Social Contributions to Disparities in Depression Care: US and UK  Abstract Physicians' ability to communicate effectively with patients from ethnically and socially diverse backgrounds is essential to reducing health disparities. However, communication is not solely the task of medical professionals, patients also play a critical role in active participation in their care and in gaining the necessary confidence and competence to implement and continue treatment. The disparities that are evident within medical care reflect the interplay of social factors, including race, gender, age, literacy, and the cultural and normative expectations that guide the perspectives of both patients and physicians. The proposed investigation is designed to contribute to the disentangling of physician-derived and patient-derived contributions to social bias that may exacerbate health disparities associated with the provision and receipt of depression care and suicide risk assessment in the US and UK. In order to do so, we propose a novel approach in which videotape simulations are used to portray a depression -focused visit in primary care in which the ethnicity and gender of the participants have been experimentally manipulated. While sharing the context of a medical visit, the simulations differ in focus; one is designed to examine physicians' cognitive and clinical reasoning processes while the other explores patients' perceptions, responses and judgments related to the receipt of care. In the first study (for which data are already collected), visit simulations were shown to 128 US and UK physicians who were asked to take the role of the treating physician and provide a narrative account of their clinical reasoning. The second study shows simulated depression visits, in which patient and physician gender and ethnicity is experimentally manipulated, to 640 ethnically diverse male and female subjects in the US and UK. Subjects vicariously take the role of the depressed patient in the simulations to provide insights into their cognitive and affective reactions to care. In this way, we will be able to explore how subjects acting as analogue patients and physicians are influenced by gender and ethnicity in making medical care judgments in the context of the US and UK health care system and social structure. Study 3 will test the ecological validity of the analogue findings through the analysis of actual patient data in which physicians from different ethnic backgrounds have assessed patients' depression and suicide risk in an anonymised database.  Public Health Relevance Physicians' ability to communicate effectively with patients from ethnically and socially diverse backgrounds is essential to reducing health disparities. However amelioration of disparities is not solely the task of medical professionals: patients also play a critical role in active participation in care and acquisition of the confidence and competence necessary to implement and continue treatment.

Among adult long-term cancer survivors, those who received HSCT live with some of the highest risks for life-threatening chronic health conditions including cardiovascular disease, diabetes, osteoporosis, and recurrence or second cancers along with other risks. Even more prevalent in HSCT survivors are psychological symptoms that inhibit quality of life, specifically depression and cancer-related distress. Our previous internet intervention has demonstrated efficacy in reducing depression and distress with survivors at a single site, and has pilot tested the efficacy of providing a survivorship preventive care plan. With the proposed improvements and the extension of the intervention to multiple transplant centers we expect to strengthen both the reach and efficacy of the intervention while we advance the science of internet-based providing of health behavior change models to cancer survivors. Specific aims of the project are to: 1) determine whether 2-10 year HSCT survivors with elevated depression or cancer-related distress who are randomized to receive access to a tailored internet-based program report reduced depression and distress when compared with control group survivors who receive a survivorship care plan by mail and delayed access to the internet site (enhanced usual care), and 2) determine whether survivors with low survivorship preventive care adherence (PCA) who are randomized to receive access to the tailored internet-based program, including a survivorship preventive care plan, report increased PCA when compared with control group survivors. The study will examine main effects of the intervention as well as moderating (age <40, chronic graft versus host disease, rural residence, lower income) and mediating effects (health self-efficacy, knowledge of survivorship needs) per Protection Motivation Theory. Further analyses will identify risk factors for disparities in survivorship preventive care adherence in HSCT survivors. The five-site multi-center RCT will enroll N=1200 adult HSCT survivors with internet access. Assessments will occur at baseline, 3 and 12 months. Participants without internet access will be invited to complete the baseline assessment for participation in the risk factor analyses. To our knowledge, this study will be the first to explore the efficacy of a tailored internet-based intervention, enhanced with options for alerts and reminders through individualized SMS messaging, mobile applications and social networking media, to target health behaviors in a cancer survivor population. The program is cost-effective and readily tailored. If effective, the program could be disseminated nationwide for long-term HSCT survivors in all transplant centers and would provide a framework for similar survivorship care models in non-HSCT cancer survivor populations.        Among adult long-term cancer survivors, those who receive hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT: also called blood, marrow or umbilical cord blood transplantation) live with some of the highest risks for life-threatening chronic health conditions including cardiovascular disease, diabetes, osteoporosis, and recurrence or second cancers. Also prevalent in HSCT survivors are symptoms that inhibit quality of life such as depression and cancer-related emotional distress. In a study with five sites across the nation, this research is designed to test whether a tailored internet-based survivorship program with methods for managing health behaviors improves depression, emotional distress and adherence to health care guidelines in adult HSCT survivors.

"Coregulatory Processes and Postpartum Depression in Mexican-Americans    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The consequences of postpartum depression (PPD) extend far beyond the mother's mental health, and can have severe detrimental effects on marital relationships, parenting abilities, mother-infant bonding, and infant health and development. Although Latinos are the fastest growing population group in the US, few studies of PPD have been conducted with Latina women. Existing studies suggest a significantly elevated vulnerability to PPD for low income ethnic minority women. However, the trajectories of onset and recovery have not been well- described, and little is known about the influence of cultural-ecological risk and protective factors. Further, most research has failed to consider the fundamental role of the newborn baby and the ability of mother-infant interactions to influence the onset and course of PPD. This study will evaluate a community sample of 330 low-income Mexican American first- time mothers from the prenatal period through the first postpartum year. The development of PPD and the process of recovery will be examined using well-validated symptom and clinically diagnostic measures. Culturally-ecological factors will be examined that may either confer risk or offer protection from PPD. Repeated home observations of mother-infant interactions will be collected in the critical first 6 months following childbirth. The bio-psychosocial process by which mothers and infants co-regulate each other's emotions, behavior, and physiology will be analyzed and used to predict the longitudinal course of PPD over the first year. Findings will significantly enhance understanding of the impact of culturally-relevant risk and protective factors on the onset and course of PPD in a highly vulnerable population, and will identify innovative targets (e.g., mother-infant interactions) for future interventions.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Postpartum mood disorders, primarily depression, affect a large number of new mothers. Estimates range from 10-15 percent in general population samples. However, striking health disparities are evident in studies evaluating low-income and/or ethnic minority mothers, for whom prevalence rates from 24-49 percent have been reported. A large research literature documents the substantial detrimental public health impact of postpartum depression, not just for women, but for their partners and children as well. According to the World Health Organization (2007), depression is the leading cause of disability worldwide, and the fourth leading contributor to worldwide burden of disease. Infants and children of mothers who are depressed, especially those experiencing social disadvantage, face considerable short and long-term disadvantage, including lower birth weight, poorer cognitive development, higher rates of behavioral and social problems, and more frequent emotional problems. In Arizona, the largest percentages of new births are to Hispanic women, of whom the majority is classified as low-income. Population birth trends in Arizona (and the US as a whole), the magnitude of the public health impact of postpartum mood disorders, and the significant mental health disparities new Hispanic mothers experience argue for the critical need for further understanding of processes affecting the development of postpartum mood disorders in low-income Mexican American women.

"Psychiatric Epidemiology: Racial Disparities among Vulnerable Populations with De DESCRIPTION (Abstract Provided by Applicant): Remarkably little is known about protective factors that reduce African Americans' risk for depression and diabetes comorbidity. In particular, the link between service use and risk reduction in African Americans has never been demonstrated with a nationally representative sample, particularly one that also takes into account ethnic groups' differences. The lack of research on depression and diabetes comorbidity research among African Americans is due primarily to rather small samples of Black Americans in available data sets from which to draw meaningful conclusions. The proposed research plan aims to provide a comprehensive examination of whether socioeconomic status (SES) and known risk and protective factors are correlated with reductions in the risk for comorbid depression and diabetes with special attention to low income populations in a nationally representative sample of 5,191 African Americans and Caribbean Blacks. The public health significance lies in specifying which demographic factors related to lower comorbidity risk, which will inform subsequent health social service prevention interventions and strategies. The present study plan is designed to advance knowledge and make five important contributions to the literature on depression and diabetes comorbidity among African Americans, namely by: (1) capitalizing on the strengths of a large, nationally representative data set, the National Survey of American Life [NSAL]; (2) determining whether SES is associated with reductions in the risk for the studied comorbid condition by Blacks; (3) examining the mediation effects of health insurance status on the relationship between SES and comorbid depression and diabetes conditions; (4) investigating the relative effects of comorbid status on employment outcomes for welfare recipients; and (5) describing the cultural meaning of being diagnosed with and managing health care with a comorbid diagnosis. The data analytic approaches to be used include logistic regression, multi-nominal logistic regression, and qualitative theme analyses techniques.  Project Narrative Comorbid depression and diabetes is recognized as a condition that is costly to the health care system and is a vital topic of public health concern. Remarkably, few investigations focus on the link between service use and risk reduction in African Americans with this comorbid condition. Moreover, no studies have demonstrated variable linkages with a nationally representative African American sample, particularly one that also takes into account ethnic groups' differences until this one.

"Barriers and Facilitators of Mental Health Services Utilization Among Latinos DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Using a community-based participatory research (CBPR) model, this 5-year longitudinal cohort study will empirically assess the association of individual, partner/family, social context and larger community stressors, on clinical depression, depression severity, and cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk among Caribbean Latinos in Lawrence, MA, and assess the buffering effects of culture-specific types of social support and resources on these associations. Partners in this collaboration are: individual Latino residents of Lawrence; community- based organizations including the Greater Lawrence Family Health Center, the City of Lawrence Mayor's Health Task Force, the Lawrence Council on Aging/Senior Center, the YWCA of Greater Lawrence, Holy Family Hospital, Lawrence General Hospital; and UMass Medical School (UMMS). This collaboration began in 2003 and the proposed study builds from its prior CBPR work. The study will be conducted among 600 Caribbean Latino adults living in Lawrence, MA, a HRSA defined medically underserved community. Available evidence suggests that depressive symptoms and clinical depression are highly prevalent among low-income Latinos in the US. However, there is a scarcity of longitudinal studies of depression in this population, and relatively little is known about the risk and protective factors for these conditions in this population. Evidence indicates that depression is an independent risk factor for disability, excess mortality and adverse health outcomes, including cardiovascular disease, a leading cause of death among Latinos. Understanding the stressors that contribute to depression and CVD risk among Latinos is crucial to developing targeted interventions. The primary aims of the proposed study are to: 1) assess cross-sectional associations between stress (measured at the individual, partner/family, social and larger community levels) and measures of clinical depression and depression severity; 2) assess longitudinal associations between stress (measured at the individual, partner/family, social and larger community levels) and measures of clinical depression and depression severity; and 3) assess the mediating effect of social support and resources (measured at the individual, partner/family, social and larger community levels) on the associations between stress and measures of clinical depression and depression severity. The secondary aims are to: 4) assess the longitudinal association between stress and measures of depression with CVD risk and 5) investigate the mediating effect of health-related behaviors, namely diet, physical activity, smoking, alcohol use and sleep on the association between stress and measures of depression with CVD risk. Study participants will be followed for two years with measures taken annually. CBPR aims are to: 1) enhance the participatory infrastructure of the Partnership through continuous self-assessment; 2) evaluate the outreach process for diffusion and dissemination of study results; and 3) evaluate the success in implementing new programs and developing new research projects that build from the results of the proposed study. The Lawrence-UMass Latino Health Partnership (Partnership), is a 7-year community-based participatory research (CBPR) collaborative to improve the health of Latinos living in Lawrence, MA, a HRSA defined medically underserved community. Established in 2003, this Partnership includes the Greater Lawrence Family Health Center, the City of Lawrence Mayor's Health Task Force, the Lawrence Council on Aging/Senior Center, the YWCA of Greater Lawrence, Holy Family Hospital, Lawrence General Hospital and the University of Massachusetts Medical School.

"Exercise to prevent depression and anxiety in older Hispanics     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal is for a K23 Mentored Patient Oriented Research Career Development Award that will prepare the candidate, Daniel Jimenez, become an independently funded researcher with expertise in health promotion/health behavior change interventions designed to prevent common mental illness (depression and anxiety) in at-risk racial/ethnic minority elderly. The candidate and his mentors at Dartmouth Medical School, Cambridge Health Alliance and the University of Pittsburgh have designed a career development plan, which is comprised of scholarly didactics and seminars, expert mentorship, hands-on experience at Dartmouth College, Harvard University, and the University of Pittsburgh as well as measurable productivity including peer- reviewed manuscripts and grant applications. His three career development aims are: 1) to gain expertise in the development of health promotion/health behavior change interventions to prevent common mental health disorders in high-risk older racial/ethnic minority populations; 2) to develop methodological expertise in depression and anxiety prevention research as a foundation for conducting health promotion/health behavior change research in racial/ethnic minority elderly; and 3) to gain increased knowledge on the effects of health promotion/health behavior change interventions on risk factors for depression/anxiety. Addressing these career development aims will provide the candidate with the skills and expertise to conduct the research plan in this proposal. A mixed methods approach will be used to develop and refine Happy Older Latinos are Active (HOLA), a physical activity intervention led by a community health worker, and to demonstrate feasibility, acceptability, and safety of the intervention in a randomized trial. This pilot study has three specific aims: 1) to develop and refine HOLA to address depression and anxiety prevention in a group of older Latinos with minor and subthreshold depression and anxiety; 2) to evaluate the feasibility and potential effectiveness of the newly refined HOLA compared to an enhanced psychoeducation condition with respect to: (a.) depression and anxiety prevention and (b.) depression and anxiety severity; 3) to evaluate the feasibility and potential effectiveness of HOLA compared to enhanced psychoeducation with respect to physical and psychosocial functioning. The development of a health promotion intervention designed to prevent common mental disorders could be a means of addressing multiple disparities (e.g. mental health outcomes, mental health service use, stigma) among racial/ethnic minority elderly. Should these results prove to be promising, a future R01 proposal for an adequately powered, randomized control trial will be submitted. Additionally, the results of this study could have implications fo other high risk, highly disadvantaged populations who could benefit from the proposed health promotion intervention in the service of preventing common and disabling mental disorders.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Depressive and anxiety disorders are among the most common, disabling, and costliest disorders in old age. The identification of people at greatest risk for common mental disorders (depression and anxiety) and the development of timely and empirically based interventions to prevent these mental disorders are major public health challenges. This mentored K23 career development application requests support for a pilot randomized prevention trial that seeks to compare a preventive intervention called ""Happy Older Latinos are Active (HOLA),"" a CHW led group-based, health promotion intervention, to a fotonovela, an enhanced psychoeducation condition. Participants will be older Latinos with minor and subthreshold depression and anxiety.                ",Exercise to prevent depression and anxiety in older Hispanics,8580845,K23MH098025,"['Age ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Elderly ', ' Anxiety ', ' Anxiety Disorders ', ' Asian Americans ', ' psychological disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Belief ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' Depressive disorder ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Physical Exercise ', ' Exercise ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' Health Promotion ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene Services ', ' Mental Health Services ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methods ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' Minority Groups ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' NIMH ', ' National Institute of Mental Health (U.S.) ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Obesity ', ' Peer Review ', ' pilot study ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' Productivity ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Research ', ' R&D ', ' R & D ', ' Development and Research ', ' research and development ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Safety ', ' school of medicine ', ' medical college ', ' medical schools ', ' Testing ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' depressive ', ' depression symptom ', ' Emotional Depression ', ' depressive symptoms ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Hispanics ', ' Latino ', ' base ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' sedentary ', ' Medical ', ' Physical activity ', ' mental ', ' Psyche structure ', ' Individual ', ' Development Plans ', ' Funding ', ' Health Alliance ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Severities ', ' Physical Function ', ' minor depression ', ' minor depressive disorder ', ' psychosocial ', ' Remission ', ' Disease remission ', ' meetings ', ' collegiate ', ' college ', ' Services ', ' experience ', ' DSM ', ' Diagnostic and Statistical Manual ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' Manuscripts ', ' skills ', ' Participant ', ' Prevention Research ', ' help seeking ', ' help-seeking behavior ', ' Prevention ', ' Reporting ', ' career development ', ' psychoeducation ', ' stigma ', ' social stigma ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' diabetes risk ', ' major depression ', ' Major Depressive Disorder ', ' Effectiveness ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Grant Proposals ', ' Applications Grants ', ' High Prevalence ', ' Measurable ', ' Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award (K23) ', ' K23 Program ', ' K23 Mechanism ', ' K23 Award ', ' Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Randomized ', ' NIH RFA ', ' Request for Applications ', ' Community Health ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Social Functioning ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' subthreshold depression ', ' Outcome ', ' Approaches to prevention ', ' Prevention approach ', ' Population ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' ethnic minority ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' Health behavior change ', ' racial/ethnic ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' geriatric mental health ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' therapy design ', ' high risk ', ' public health relevance ', ' randomized trial ', ' ']",NIMH,DARTMOUTH COLLEGE,K23,2013,66495,0.0889757835393338
"Exploring CBT-DM's Absoulte and Relative Efficacy for Depressed T1DM Latino Youth    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is an R03 (PAR-09-223) application submitted to NIDDK. This study entails the revision of the 12-session Group Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT-DM) manual for depressed Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (T1DM) Latino youth, and explores both the absolute efficacy of CBT-DM against a treatment as usual (TAU) condition, and the added impact of CBT-DM over the original culturally-adapted CBT for depression. After initial manual revision by our expert team, in-depth interviews with diabetes treatment providers, and a small pre-pilot study with 8 depressed T1DM Latino youth and their parents will be conducted to inform the revision of and further refine CBT-DM treatment manual. Focus groups with youth and parents in the small pre-pilot study will serve to complete the refinement process. Finally, 60 depressed T1DM youth will be randomized to one of three conditions: CBT-DM, CBT for depression, and TAU. Treatment efficacy will be assessed by comparing changes on depression, self-esteem and functionality scores, diabetes self-efficacy and quality of life, and treatment adherence and self-care management of T1DM. We propose that both CBT-DM and CBT will be superior to TAU in reducing depression, and improving self-esteem and functionality. We also hypothesize that CBT-DM will be superior to the other conditions in domains related to T1DM (diabetes self-efficacy, quality of life, treatment adherence and self-care behaviors). Intake data will be obtained with structured diagnostic interviews, self-report scales and laboratory tests of glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c). We will assess youth T1DM health and treatment adherence information, mental health (including depression) diagnostic status, youth cognitive and affective variables, parent and family functioning, and family knowledge about youth depression and T1DM. We will also evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of treatment, the adequacy of randomization, attrition rates, therapist competence and treatment integrity. The assessment will be conducted at baseline, at weeks 5, 9 and 12 (post-treatment), and at the three- and six-month follow-ups. This investigation is the second step in a research program aimed to bring the benefits of evidence-based treatment (EBT) development to Latino youth with comorbid T1DM and depression, and set the stage for a larger-scale and definite study of treatment efficacy (R01). This study is innovative because it is the first that could potentially contribute to provide initial evidence in support of the probably-efficacious status of a psychosocial intervention aimed at both improving diabetes health status and reducing depressive symptoms in youth. The revised CBT-DM manual for T1DM Latino youth would also be an innovative clinical tool that could enhance the prevention of mood disorders and the reduction of health disparities in this minority group.     This study is likely to shed light on whether a novel intervention combining CBT with diabetes education for youth can reduce the morbidity observed in those with co-morbid T1DM and depression and achieve positive diabetes outcomes, as opposed to Treatment as usual (TAU) and CBT for depression. It will be the first to develop/adapt and pilot-test (in a small Randomized Clinical Trial-type design) a culturally-sensitive intervention specifically tailored to Latino youth with co-morbid T1DM and depression, and if proven to be promising, it will make it attractive for administrators to implement it in primary care and mental health settings serving the Latino pediatric population. This research will potentially help to close knowledge gaps in treatment research with T1DM Latino children and impact other behavioral, cognitive, and affective factors that add on the burden of diabetes in this vulnerable and underserved group.

"Participatory design of mHealth strategies to support collaborative care in perin     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There is a pressing need to expand the reach of perinatal depression care to low income women from race/ethnic minority populations. Large disparities in depression care delivery between women receiving Medicaid and those with private insurance are documented. Strategies to reduce these disparities must address economic, social, and cultural barriers on the patient side as well as limited resources in the safety net system serving these patients. Patient Centered Outcomes Research (PCOR) methods have not been applied to the problem of how to reduce these disparities. This K18 career enhancement award in PCOR proposes, through a program of mentoring, formal coursework, and a linked research project, to build skills in PCOR methods targeting the delivery of evidence based care to low income women with perinatal depression. In the research component a participatory design and rapid prototyping approach will be employed to develop and pilot a mHealth intervention to support sustained implementation of the evidence based collaborative care approach to depression services in non specialty mental health settings. This project will address work needed to prepare for a pragmatic comparative effectiveness trial to be carried out after the development of a beta version of the mHealth system. While over 40 high quality studies now show collaborative care models improve the quality of depression treatment and outcomes in general medical settings, this approach has not been widely implemented or sustained. Central to the collaborative care model is a care manager who monitors patient adherence, response to treatments, and side effects, while providing effective clinical feedback to other members of the depression care team regarding the status of the patient. The resources required for care management are high; however, particularly for relatively under-resourced sites caring for low income women~ this high resource cost reduces the sustained implementation of collaborative care. mHealth approaches, which capitalize on the widespread patient use of mobile phones, hold promise as effective strategies to assist and even enhance the work of care managers. These systems can potentially carry out substantial portions of the monitoring, adherence assessment/support, and clinical feedback functions of care managers. To improve the end user acceptability of the proposed system it will be developed in a participatory manner with patients and care team members from three diverse prenatal clinics serving low income women with established care managers.          PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The burden of untreated perinatal depression on public health is very large with direct effects on maternal child health outcomes and long lasting effects on health and health care utilization for both mothers and their children. Improving the sustained implementation of the evidence based collaborative care approach to perinatal depression is expected to have large returns on the mental health of the public while reducing the costs of delivering this care.

"Participatory design of patient-centered depression and diabetes care.     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There is a pressing need to improve outcomes for patients with diabetes, especially patients from underserved communities. Patients with diabetes have high levels of depressive symptoms that lead to poor engagement in care and worse overall health function. Integrated care for depression and diabetes has been shown to help improve clinical outcomes. However, many patients with depressive symptoms and diabetes, especially traditionally underserved groups, have other priorities such as financial, social and emotional concerns that affect their care. This K18 career enhancement award in Patient Centered Outcomes Research (PCOR) proposes, through a program of mentoring, formal coursework, and a linked research project, to build skills in PCOR methods and utilize a participatory approach to inspire a new services delivery model for diabetes care. The basis of this model would be to include patient's nonbiomedical needs as part of primary care treatment discussions and decisions. Partnering with patients, physicians, and licensed practical nurses (LPNs) as stakeholders, our first phase will use mixed-methods to determine the range of biomedical (physical symptoms, diet and exercise) and nonbiomedical (financial, social and emotional) needs patients with depressive symptoms and Type 2 DM may wish to address in the context of their health. These needs will be used to populate a prioritization card-sort task that will be used to create a personalized management plan that empowers patients to prioritize their own needs within an integrated care intervention. The second phase will prepare for a pragmatic comparative effectiveness trial by pilot testing an integrated depression and Type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) intervention plus patient prioritized planning in primary care patients with depressive symptoms and Type 2 DM and a hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) > 8% from urban clinics serving primarily older low income minority populations. Function will be our primary patient-centered outcome because of the importance patients place on being able to manage one's life circumstances. The intervention is carried out by health care staff already on site thus facilitatig its implementation in real world practices with limited resources and competing demands. Our goal is to close the health disparities gap in diabetes care among traditionally underserved groups including older adults, those in inner city areas, and members of minority groups.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The burden of diabetes is anticipated to grow yet the proportion of adults whose diabetes is controlled is decreasing over time and is particularly low among older adults and ethnic minorities. This K18 career enhancement award in Patient Centered Outcomes Research (PCOR) proposes, through a program of mentoring, formal coursework, and a linked research project, to build skills in PCOR methods and utilize a participatory approach to inspire a new services delivery model for diabetes care.

"Internet Studies to Enhance Long Term Survivorship after Hematologic Malignancy    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This investigator-initiated new R01 application, in response to PA-10-067, proposes to reduce depression and cancer-related emotional distress, while also improving health behaviors in adult hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) survivors using an internet-based intervention in a multi-center randomized controlled clinical trial (RCT). Among adult long-term cancer survivors, those who received HSCT live with some of the highest risks for life-threatening chronic health conditions including cardiovascular disease, diabetes, osteoporosis, and recurrence or second cancers along with other risks. Even more prevalent in HSCT survivors are psychological symptoms that inhibit quality of life, specifically depression and cancer-related distress. Our previous internet intervention has demonstrated efficacy in reducing depression and distress with survivors at a single site, and has pilot tested the efficacy of providing a survivorship preventive care plan. With the proposed improvements and the extension of the intervention to multiple transplant centers we expect to strengthen both the reach and efficacy of the intervention while we advance the science of internet-based providing of health behavior change models to cancer survivors. Specific aims of the project are to: 1) determine whether 2-10 year HSCT survivors with elevated depression or cancer-related distress who are randomized to receive access to a tailored internet-based program report reduced depression and distress when compared with control group survivors who receive a survivorship care plan by mail and delayed access to the internet site (enhanced usual care), and 2) determine whether survivors with low survivorship preventive care adherence (PCA) who are randomized to receive access to the tailored internet-based program, including a survivorship preventive care plan, report increased PCA when compared with control group survivors. The study will examine main effects of the intervention as well as moderating (age <40, chronic graft versus host disease, rural residence, lower income) and mediating effects (health self-efficacy, knowledge of survivorship needs) per Protection Motivation Theory. Further analyses will identify risk factors for disparities in survivorship preventive care adherence in HSCT survivors. The five-site multi-center RCT will enroll N=1200 adult HSCT survivors with internet access. Assessments will occur at baseline, 3 and 12 months. Participants without internet access will be invited to complete the baseline assessment for participation in the risk factor analyses. To our knowledge, this study will be the first to explore the efficacy of a tailored internet-based intervention, enhanced with options for alerts and reminders through individualized SMS messaging, mobile applications and social networking media, to target health behaviors in a cancer survivor population. The program is cost-effective and readily tailored. If effective, the program could be disseminated nationwide for long-term HSCT survivors in all transplant centers and would provide a framework for similar survivorship care models in non-HSCT cancer survivor populations.        Among adult long-term cancer survivors, those who receive hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT: also called blood, marrow or umbilical cord blood transplantation) live with some of the highest risks for life-threatening chronic health conditions including cardiovascular disease, diabetes, osteoporosis, and recurrence or second cancers. Also prevalent in HSCT survivors are symptoms that inhibit quality of life such as depression and cancer-related emotional distress. In a study with five sites across the nation, this research is designed to test whether a tailored internet-based survivorship program with methods for managing health behaviors improves depression, emotional distress and adherence to health care guidelines in adult HSCT survivors.

"Pathways to Reducing Disparities in Depression Outcomes     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Depression for ethnic minorities is a common, disabling condition with documented disparities in access, quality and outcomes of care, particularly in primary care, which is a main treatment setting for ethnic minority groups. Quality improvement programs in primary care can reduce disparities in depression outcomes but are seldom available in vulnerable communities. The proposed project will use the data, partnership infrastructure, and research approach of ""Community Partners in Care"" (CPIC)-augmented by new collection of qualitative data-to shed light on the pathways by which health and social disparities can be reduced, as well as to illuminate how scientific research can inform policy development for neighborhood-focused health improvement. CPIC is a community-partnered randomized trial comparing the effectiveness of a community engagement and planning (CEP) intervention that activates multi-agency networks versus a technical assistance model for individual agencies, in implementing evidence-based interventions for depression in two under-resourced communities of color in Los Angeles. Analyses of 6-month client outcomes indicate that the CEP intervention, relative to technical assistance, led to improved mental wellness and physical health and reduced prevalence of poor mental health, risk factors for homelessness, and missed work days due to health. CPIC was implemented with community participatory co-leadership, including leaders' self-reflection on racism and social justice. The proposed investigators are original developers of CPIC. The proposed new secondary analyses and new qualitative data collection will clarify pathways for intervention effects on key subgroups (each community, African Americans and Latinos, men and women, homeless); develop explanatory models using mixed-methods; document intervention implementation for these groups; and explore the applicability and generalizability of the CPIC approach for a new Los Angeles County neighborhood-based health improvement initiative. The public health significance of the research is enhanced by the fact that it will be conducted entirely in partnership with leaders and members from the affected communities using a Community Partnered Participatory Research approach, which promotes equality and collaborative responsibility for all phases of work. Through that model's focus on equity and self-reflection among all leaders on the impact of racism, the proposed project will serve as an early example of a fourth-generation approach to addressing health disparities, which combines comprehensive intervention models and research strategy that incorporates the community context for racial and ethnic differences and the interactions in partnered leadership. .         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed work will have public health impact in three ways: (1) it will shed light on pathways to reducing mental health and social disparities among specific subgroups (most notably African Americans, Latinos, gender groups, the homeless, and uninsured) who benefited from a community-partnered intervention to improve depression care in underserved communities; (2) it will explore the generalizability and replicability of the Community Partners in Care model to the implementation of a ""neighborhood health"" initiative in Los Angeles to reduce mental health and social disparities; and, more broadly, (3) it will serve as a model for how scientific research can be incorporated into policy in models for neighborhood-based initiatives aimed at reducing disparities in underserved communities of color.                ",Pathways to Reducing Disparities in Depression Outcomes,8771657,R01MD007721,"['Action Research ', ' Affect ', ' Awareness ', ' Client ', ' Color ', ' Communities ', ' Community Services ', ' Data Collection ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Discrimination (Psychology) ', ' Physical Exercise ', ' Exercise ', ' Family ', ' Hair ', ' Health ', ' healthcare service availability ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare access availability ', ' health services availability ', ' health care service availability ', ' health care service access ', ' health care availability ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Availability of Health Services ', ' Accessibility of health care ', ' Access to Healthcare ', ' Access to Health Care ', ' Access to Care ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' Housing ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Income ', ' Insurance ', ' Interview ', ' Leadership ', ' hospital stay ', ' hospital length of stay ', ' hospital days ', ' Number of Days in Hospital ', ' Length of Stay ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Light ', ' Los Angeles ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Methods ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' Minority Groups ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' NIMH ', ' National Institute of Mental Health (U.S.) ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Out-patients ', ' Outpatients ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Primary Care ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Probability ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' QOL ', ' Quality of life ', ' Recreation ', ' recruit ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Science ', ' Social Justice ', ' Social Work ', ' Social Service ', ' Social work (field) ', ' Specialty ', ' medical specialties ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Time ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' County ', ' Gender ', ' Generations ', ' Relative ', ' Relative (related person) ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' Administrator ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' case report ', ' Case Study ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Latino ', ' Uninsured ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' racial/ethnic difference ', ' improved ', ' Chronic ', ' Phase ', ' Medical ', ' racism ', ' Training ', ' Physical activity ', ' mental ', ' Psyche structure ', ' unhoused ', ' homeless ', ' Homelessness ', ' Individual ', ' Trust ', ' Policy Developments ', ' Policies ', ' Community Networks ', ' sadness ', ' depressed ', ' Depressed mood ', ' programs ', ' Location ', ' physical health ', ' physical conditioning ', ' Visit ', ' Services ', ' metropolitan ', ' member ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' outreach ', ' social ', ' substance abuse ', ' abuse of substances ', ' Substance abuse problem ', ' Modeling ', ' behavioral health ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Provider ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' missing work ', ' Employee Absenteeism ', ' Absenteeism at work ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Randomized ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Subgroup ', ' Collection ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Process ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' effectiveness trial ', ' cost ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' social disparities ', ' Prevalence ', ' ethnic minority ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' Evidence based intervention ', ' trial comparing ', ' comparative effectiveness ', ' compare effectiveness ', ' collaborative care ', ' parent grant ', ' public health relevance ', ' evidence base ', ' intervention effect ', ' health equity ', ' randomized trial ', ' screening ', ' ']",NIMHD,RAND CORPORATION,R01,2014,409417,0.08116516577926178
"A Group Treatment for Diabetes Treatment Adherence and Depression in Hispanics     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this application for a K23 Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Award is to prepare the candidate, Trina Chang, M.D., M.P.H., for a career in patient-oriented research focusing on behavioral interventions for minority patients with diabetes and depression. This is an area of enormous public health importance, as diabetes and depression are both common and costly chronic illnesses that often co-occur. Dr. Chang is a clinical researcher and community psychiatrist with a background in public health, research with minorities, and the development, implementation and evaluation of programs at the interface of psychiatry and primary care. She is based at the Massachusetts General Hospital and has access to the expertise of the Depression Clinical and Research Program, the Behavioral Medicine Program, and the Diabetes Center, as well as access to a community health center for subject recruitment. Her immediate career goal is to develop a research program testing an intervention based on problem-solving treatment (PST) to promote diabetes treatment adherence in an underserved Hispanic population; ultimately, she intends to build a career around developing and evaluating behavioral interventions for diabetes and depression in disadvantaged populations, with an eye toward interventions that address the socioeconomic conditions underlying their health problems. The training goals of this career development award are for the candidate to 1) gain experience conducting behavioral research in diabetes, 2) build expertise in developing community interventions for disadvantaged or high-stress populations, particularly Hispanics, 3) advance her skills in adapting PST for different populations and purposes, and 4) learn to conduct mediator analyses. The candidate will also take coursework in biostatistics, methods of community research and behavioral research, cultural anthropology, and the relationship between stress, disparities and health, as well as the responsible conduct of research. The research component of this project will involve a randomized, waitlist-controlled trial of a novel group intervention featuring Problem-solving, Information, Support and Motivation (PRISM) for Spanish-speaking Hispanics with poorly controlled type 2 diabetes. The primary aims will be to refine the intervention and evaluate its efficacy for improving treatment adherence, diabetes, and depression; a secondary aim will be to investigate mediators of its effect. Results of this project will form the basis of an R01 grant application. Combined, this research and training plan will enable Dr. Chang to become an independent investigator in an area with significant need and broad public health applications: treating diabetes and depression in disadvantaged populations by creating innovative behavioral interventions that address the fundamental causes of disease.     PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Diabetes is a highly prevalent and costly chronic illness, one whose toll is multiplied when it co-occurs with depression. The goal of the proposed project is to reduce the impact of these two illnesses in Spanish- speaking Hispanics with poorly controlled Type 2 by promoting diabetes treatment adherence, using a group intervention based on enhanced problem-solving treatment.

"Exercise to prevent depression and anxiety in older Hispanics     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal is for a K23 Mentored Patient Oriented Research Career Development Award that will prepare the candidate, Daniel Jimenez, become an independently funded researcher with expertise in health promotion/health behavior change interventions designed to prevent common mental illness (depression and anxiety) in at-risk racial/ethnic minority elderly. The candidate and his mentors at Dartmouth Medical School, Cambridge Health Alliance and the University of Pittsburgh have designed a career development plan, which is comprised of scholarly didactics and seminars, expert mentorship, hands-on experience at Dartmouth College, Harvard University, and the University of Pittsburgh as well as measurable productivity including peer- reviewed manuscripts and grant applications. His three career development aims are: 1) to gain expertise in the development of health promotion/health behavior change interventions to prevent common mental health disorders in high-risk older racial/ethnic minority populations; 2) to develop methodological expertise in depression and anxiety prevention research as a foundation for conducting health promotion/health behavior change research in racial/ethnic minority elderly; and 3) to gain increased knowledge on the effects of health promotion/health behavior change interventions on risk factors for depression/anxiety. Addressing these career development aims will provide the candidate with the skills and expertise to conduct the research plan in this proposal. A mixed methods approach will be used to develop and refine Happy Older Latinos are Active (HOLA), a physical activity intervention led by a community health worker, and to demonstrate feasibility, acceptability, and safety of the intervention in a randomized trial. This pilot study has three specific aims: 1) to develop and refine HOLA to address depression and anxiety prevention in a group of older Latinos with minor and subthreshold depression and anxiety; 2) to evaluate the feasibility and potential effectiveness of the newly refined HOLA compared to an enhanced psychoeducation condition with respect to: (a.) depression and anxiety prevention and (b.) depression and anxiety severity; 3) to evaluate the feasibility and potential effectiveness of HOLA compared to enhanced psychoeducation with respect to physical and psychosocial functioning. The development of a health promotion intervention designed to prevent common mental disorders could be a means of addressing multiple disparities (e.g. mental health outcomes, mental health service use, stigma) among racial/ethnic minority elderly. Should these results prove to be promising, a future R01 proposal for an adequately powered, randomized control trial will be submitted. Additionally, the results of this study could have implications fo other high risk, highly disadvantaged populations who could benefit from the proposed health promotion intervention in the service of preventing common and disabling mental disorders.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Depressive and anxiety disorders are among the most common, disabling, and costliest disorders in old age. The identification of people at greatest risk for common mental disorders (depression and anxiety) and the development of timely and empirically based interventions to prevent these mental disorders are major public health challenges. This mentored K23 career development application requests support for a pilot randomized prevention trial that seeks to compare a preventive intervention called ""Happy Older Latinos are Active (HOLA),"" a CHW led group-based, health promotion intervention, to a fotonovela, an enhanced psychoeducation condition. Participants will be older Latinos with minor and subthreshold depression and anxiety.

"Barriers and Facilitators of Mental Health Services Utilization Among Latinos DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Using a community-based participatory research (CBPR) model, this 5-year longitudinal cohort study will empirically assess the association of individual, partner/family, social context and larger community stressors, on clinical depression, depression severity, and cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk among Caribbean Latinos in Lawrence, MA, and assess the buffering effects of culture-specific types of social support and resources on these associations. Partners in this collaboration are: individual Latino residents of Lawrence; community- based organizations including the Greater Lawrence Family Health Center, the City of Lawrence Mayor's Health Task Force, the Lawrence Council on Aging/Senior Center, the YWCA of Greater Lawrence, Holy Family Hospital, Lawrence General Hospital; and UMass Medical School (UMMS). This collaboration began in 2003 and the proposed study builds from its prior CBPR work. The study will be conducted among 600 Caribbean Latino adults living in Lawrence, MA, a HRSA defined medically underserved community. Available evidence suggests that depressive symptoms and clinical depression are highly prevalent among low-income Latinos in the US. However, there is a scarcity of longitudinal studies of depression in this population, and relatively little is known about the risk and protective factors for these conditions in this population. Evidence indicates that depression is an independent risk factor for disability, excess mortality and adverse health outcomes, including cardiovascular disease, a leading cause of death among Latinos. Understanding the stressors that contribute to depression and CVD risk among Latinos is crucial to developing targeted interventions. The primary aims of the proposed study are to: 1) assess cross-sectional associations between stress (measured at the individual, partner/family, social and larger community levels) and measures of clinical depression and depression severity; 2) assess longitudinal associations between stress (measured at the individual, partner/family, social and larger community levels) and measures of clinical depression and depression severity; and 3) assess the mediating effect of social support and resources (measured at the individual, partner/family, social and larger community levels) on the associations between stress and measures of clinical depression and depression severity. The secondary aims are to: 4) assess the longitudinal association between stress and measures of depression with CVD risk and 5) investigate the mediating effect of health-related behaviors, namely diet, physical activity, smoking, alcohol use and sleep on the association between stress and measures of depression with CVD risk. Study participants will be followed for two years with measures taken annually. CBPR aims are to: 1) enhance the participatory infrastructure of the Partnership through continuous self-assessment; 2) evaluate the outreach process for diffusion and dissemination of study results; and 3) evaluate the success in implementing new programs and developing new research projects that build from the results of the proposed study. The Lawrence-UMass Latino Health Partnership (Partnership), is a 7-year community-based participatory research (CBPR) collaborative to improve the health of Latinos living in Lawrence, MA, a HRSA defined medically underserved community. Established in 2003, this Partnership includes the Greater Lawrence Family Health Center, the City of Lawrence Mayor's Health Task Force, the Lawrence Council on Aging/Senior Center, the YWCA of Greater Lawrence, Holy Family Hospital, Lawrence General Hospital and the University of Massachusetts Medical School. The Partnership proposes to study the influence of stress on mental health and cardiovascular risk among Lawrence Latinos as well as factors that may influence these associations, in particular social support and resources. The Partnership also will seek to enhance its process, disseminate the study results and evaluate the impact of the project on new community programs and research projects.",Barriers and Facilitators of Mental Health Services Utilization Among Latinos,8628177,R01MH085653,"['adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Aging ', ' etoh use ', ' ethanol use ', ' ethanol product use ', ' ethanol intake ', ' ethanol ingestion ', ' ethanol drinking ', ' ethanol consumption ', ' alcoholic drink intake ', ' alcoholic beverage consumption ', ' alcohol use ', ' alcohol product use ', ' alcohol intake ', ' alcohol ingestion ', ' alcohol consumed ', ' EtOH drinking ', ' Alcohol Drinking ', ' Alcohol consumption ', ' Behavior ', ' psychological disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Behavioral Sciences ', ' Buffers ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' circulatory system ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' Cardiovascular system (all sites) ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' Cause of Death ', ' chronic disorder ', ' chronic disease/disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Cities ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Communities ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' clinical depression ', ' Endogenous depression ', ' dietary ', ' Diet ', ' Diffusion ', ' Family ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Hospitals ', ' General Hospitals ', ' long-term study ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' Massachusetts ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene Services ', ' Mental Health Services ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' NIMH ', ' National Institute of Mental Health (U.S.) ', ' Research ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' school of medicine ', ' medical college ', ' medical schools ', ' Self Assessment ', ' Self Assessment (Psychology) ', ' Sleep ', ' Smoking ', ' socioenvironment ', ' social context ', ' social climate ', ' Social Environment ', ' social support network ', ' Social support ', ' Stress ', ' Health Resources and Services Administration ', ' HRSA ', ' United States Health Resources and Services Administration ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Excess Mortality ', ' Friends ', ' Measures ', ' depressive ', ' depression symptom ', ' Emotional Depression ', ' depressive symptoms ', ' Latino ', ' Mediating ', ' Task Forces ', ' Advisory Committees ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' West Indies Region ', ' Caribbean Sea Region ', ' Caribbean ', ' Caribbean region ', ' Physical activity ', ' disability ', ' Individual ', ' Recovery ', ' healthcare utilization ', ' healthcare service utilization ', ' health services utilization ', ' Health Care Utilization ', ' health care service utilization ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Collaborations ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Severities ', ' Source ', ' Country ', ' experience ', ' stressor ', ' success ', ' Family Health ', ' Family health status ', ' Participant ', ' disease risk ', ' disorder risk ', ' outreach ', ' social ', ' cardiovascular risk ', ' cardiovascular risk factor ', ' Modeling ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' cardiovascular disease risk ', ' cardiovascular disorder risk ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Low income ', ' Address ', ' Research Program Projects ', ' Program Project Grant ', ' P01 Program ', ' P01 Mechanism ', ' Program Research Project Grants ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Strategic Planning ', ' Process ', ' Community Health ', ' Behavioral ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' prospective ', ' twenty-one year old ', ' age 21 years ', ' age 21 ', ' 21 year old ', ' medically underserved ', ' community based participatory research ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIV OF MASSACHUSETTS MED SCH WORCESTER,R01,2014,212720,0.09825966310489728
"Collaborative Care for Depression and Diabetic Retinopathy in African Americans  Depression occurs in 20-25% of older African Americans with diabetic retinopathy (DR) and accelerates progression of DR by compromising diabetes self-management practices and raising hemoglobin A1C levels (HbA1C). Treating depression improves diabetes self-management and lowers HbA1C and may thereby prevent progression of DR. AAs, however, are less likely to be treated for depression than whites. Depression contributes to why AAs have worse glycemic control and higher rates of DR (39% vs. 26%), vision-threatening DR (9.3% vs. 3.2%), and legal blindness (7.3 vs. 5.4%) than whites. These disparities necessitate new interventions to treat depression, improve glycemic control, and prevent progression of DR in older AAs. We seek support for a planning grant to refine the methods, conduct a Feasibility Study, and develop a Manual of Procedures for a planned randomized controlled clinical trial (RCT) entitled, ""Collaborative Care for Depression and Diabetic Retinopathy"" (CC-DDR). CC-DDR is a novel mental health/ophthalmologic intervention that we are designing to treat depression and lower HbA1C levels in older AAs with mild-to-moderate DR and comorbid depression. Community Health Workers, who match participants in race and cultural background, will work with ophthalmologists in the retina clinic to educate participants on the links between depression, HbA1C, and DR, and will extend care into the home where they will use Behavior Activation to treat depression and improve diabetes self-management skills. Before moving to a full-scale RCT of CC-DDR, we propose a 3- stage planning grant. In Stage I we will: 1) develop the CC-DDR treatment protocol; 2) develop a tool to assess therapists' adherence and competency; and 3) seek input from a panel of experts to refine these materials. In Stage II we will conduct an open trial of CC-DDR to evaluate its feasibility. In Stage III we will develop the Manual of Procedures for the planned RCT of CC-DDR. As the population ages and the prevalence of DR rapidly increases in older AAs, a culturally relevant intervention that treats depression, lowers HbA1C, and prevents progression of DR is significant if we are to preserve vision in this population. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This research is significant and innovative because it is the first attempt to integrate a mental health/ophthalmologic intervention into routine retina practice and extend care into the home; it targets a high- risk underserved minority group; and it targets untreated depression, which accelerates progression of diabetic retinopathy. These innovations hold the promise that Collaborative Care for Depression and Diabetic Retinopathy will be more effective than existing interventions and will prevent blindness in this population.                ",Collaborative Care for Depression and Diabetic Retinopathy in African Americans,8677114,R34EY024299,"['Age ', ' Behavior ', ' Blood Pressure ', ' clinical investigation ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Cultural Backgrounds ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Collection ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' diabetes ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Diabetic Retinopathy ', ' Epidemic ', ' Eyeball ', ' Eye ', ' Feasibility Studies ', ' Feedback ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Hemoglobin ', ' Institutes ', ' insulin resistant ', ' Insulin Resistance ', ' Laser Radiation ', ' Laser Electromagnetic ', ' Lasers ', ' extended care ', ' Long-Term Care ', ' Manuals ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Methods ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Neuroendocrine System ', ' Neuroendocrine ', ' Neurosecretory Systems ', ' Patients ', ' Quality Control ', ' QOL ', ' Quality of life ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' recruit ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Retina ', ' Risk ', ' Supervision ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Treatment Regimen ', ' Treatment Schedule ', ' Treatment Protocols ', ' visual function ', ' Sight ', ' Vision ', ' Work ', ' Outcomes Assessment ', ' Outcome Assessment (Health Care) ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' Competence ', ' Self Management ', ' base ', ' quality assurance ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Clinical ', ' Specified ', ' Specific qualifier value ', ' Randomized Controlled Clinical Trials ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' satisfaction ', ' Sample Size ', ' Ophthalmologist ', ' Legal Blindness ', ' Staging ', ' Inflammatory ', ' tool ', ' Severities ', ' Home ', ' Home environment ', ' Clinic ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' visual loss ', ' vision loss ', ' Blindness ', ' meetings ', ' treatment planning ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Modality ', ' depression screening ', ' Depression screen ', ' human subject protection ', ' stigma ', ' social stigma ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' Adherence ', ' Adherence (attribute) ', ' Grant Proposals ', ' Applications Grants ', ' underserved minority ', ' under-represented minority ', ' Underrepresented Populations ', ' Underrepresented Groups ', ' Underrepresented Minority ', ' Monitor ', ' Community Health ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomic ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio economic ', ' socioeconomics ', ' intravitreal injection ', ' health literacy ', ' cost ', ' glycemic control ', ' efficacy trial ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' Vision research ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' collaborative care ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' therapy design ', ' high risk ', ' public health relevance ', ' treatment adherence ', ' diabetes control ', ' clinical practice ', ' ']",NEI,THOMAS JEFFERSON UNIVERSITY,R34,2014,245903,0.173171309668042
"A Culturally Adapted Depression Intervention for African American Adults    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): African Americans are burdened by depression, yet they receive adequate mental health care only 14% of the time. A recent meta-analysis of culturally adapted interventions (CAI) suggest interventions tailored to a specific cultural group were four times more effective than interventions provided to groups consisting of culturally diverse patients. Unfortunately, CAIs focusing specifically on African American adults are sparse. The Oh Happy Day Class (OHDC) was culturally adapted from the Coping with Depression Course (CWD) and designed to treat depression in African American adults. We propose using a two-group, (OHDC v. CWD) randomized controlled trial and a sample of 182 African American adults (age 30-55) with measures at baseline, middle and immediate end of the intervention and 3-, 6-, 9-, and 12-months post-intervention. Primary Aim 1: Examine effectiveness of the OHDC compared to the CWD in increasing retention, adherence, engagement, satisfaction, and treatment seeking. Primary Aim 2: Examine effectiveness of the OHDC compared to the CWD in reducing symptoms of depression. Secondary Aim 3: Examine the effectiveness of the OHDC compared to the CWD in improving self-report of mental and physical health status and reducing self-report of disability. Public Health Impact: Based on CAI research, the OHDC has the potential to be four times more effective than the CWD. If our hypotheses are proven, the OHDC will be the first evidence-based culturally adapted depression intervention designed specifically for African American adults.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: African Americans are burdened by depression, yet they receive adequate mental health care only 14% of the time.

"Psychiatric Epidemiology: Racial Disparities among Vulnerable Populations with De DESCRIPTION (Abstract Provided by Applicant): Remarkably little is known about protective factors that reduce African Americans' risk for depression and diabetes comorbidity. In particular, the link between service use and risk reduction in African Americans has never been demonstrated with a nationally representative sample, particularly one that also takes into account ethnic groups' differences. The lack of research on depression and diabetes comorbidity research among African Americans is due primarily to rather small samples of Black Americans in available data sets from which to draw meaningful conclusions. The proposed research plan aims to provide a comprehensive examination of whether socioeconomic status (SES) and known risk and protective factors are correlated with reductions in the risk for comorbid depression and diabetes with special attention to low income populations in a nationally representative sample of 5,191 African Americans and Caribbean Blacks. The public health significance lies in specifying which demographic factors related to lower comorbidity risk, which will inform subsequent health social service prevention interventions and strategies. The present study plan is designed to advance knowledge and make five important contributions to the literature on depression and diabetes comorbidity among African Americans, namely by: (1) capitalizing on the strengths of a large, nationally representative data set, the National Survey of American Life [NSAL]; (2) determining whether SES is associated with reductions in the risk for the studied comorbid condition by Blacks; (3) examining the mediation effects of health insurance status on the relationship between SES and comorbid depression and diabetes conditions; (4) investigating the relative effects of comorbid status on employment outcomes for welfare recipients; and (5) describing the cultural meaning of being diagnosed with and managing health care with a comorbid diagnosis. The data analytic approaches to be used include logistic regression, multi-nominal logistic regression, and qualitative theme analyses techniques.   Comorbid depression and diabetes is recognized as a condition that is costly to the health care system and is a vital topic of public health concern. Remarkably, few investigations focus on the link between service use and risk reduction in African Americans with this comorbid condition. Moreover, no studies have demonstrated variable linkages with a nationally representative African American sample, particularly one that also takes into account ethnic groups' differences until this one. The Surgeon General's report (2001), ""Mental Health: Culture, Race, and Ethnicity - A supplement to mental health,"" highlighted understanding the protective and risk factors for comorbid conditions among Blacks, as an emergent public health research priority",Psychiatric Epidemiology: Racial Disparities among Vulnerable Populations with De,8687991,K22MD003934,"['abstracting ', ' Accounting ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Age ', ' epidemiologic investigation ', ' Epidemiology Research ', ' Epidemiological Studies ', ' Epidemiologic Research ', ' Epidemiologic Studies ', ' Attention ', ' Award ', ' Client ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Comorbidity ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Complement ', ' Demographic Factors ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' diabetes ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Employment ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' health care service ', ' Health Services ', ' services research ', ' Medical Care Research ', ' Healthcare Research ', ' Health Services Evaluation ', ' Health Care Research ', ' Health Services Research ', ' Level of Health ', ' Health Status ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Income ', ' Health Insurance ', ' Interview ', ' Learning ', ' Literature ', ' Low Income Population ', ' Medicaid ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Methods ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Persons ', ' Perception ', ' Public Assistance ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' welfare ', ' Social Welfare ', ' Social Work ', ' Social Service ', ' Social work (field) ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Testing ', ' Training Activity ', ' Work ', ' Gender ', ' Relative ', ' Relative (related person) ', ' Treatment outcome ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' diverse populations ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' Uninsured ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' improved ', ' Specified ', ' Specific qualifier value ', ' Phase ', ' Logistic Regressions ', ' Link ', ' insight ', ' Employment Status ', ' Inequality ', ' root ', ' Plant Roots ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Respondent ', ' Multiculturalism ', ' Cultural Diversity ', ' instrument ', ' Research Priority ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Insurance Status ', ' Insurance Coverage ', ' programs ', ' black carib ', ' black Caribbean ', ' African Caribbean ', ' Investigation ', ' Techniques ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' interest ', ' Services ', ' Surgeon ', ' information gathering ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' Structure ', ' expectation ', ' Participant ', ' Preventive strategy ', ' Prevention strategy ', ' Negotiation ', ' Negotiating ', ' Mediation ', ' race differences ', ' racial difference ', ' Reporting ', ' Sampling ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' Risk Reduction ', ' Provider ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Low income ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' Career Transition Award ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Exclusion Criteria ', ' Social Health Services ', ' trend ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' ethnic minority ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' racial/ethnic ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' inclusion criteria ', ' public health research ', ' ']",NIMHD,STATE UNIVERSITY OF NEW YORK AT ALBANY,K22,2014,192912,0.10344936690421756

"Participatory design of patient-centered depression and diabetes care. DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There is a pressing need to improve outcomes for patients with diabetes, especially patients from underserved communities. Patients with diabetes have high levels of depressive symptoms that lead to poor engagement in care and worse overall health function. Integrated care for depression and diabetes has been shown to help improve clinical outcomes. However, many patients with depressive symptoms and diabetes, especially traditionally underserved groups, have other priorities such as financial, social and emotional concerns that affect their care. This K18 career enhancement award in Patient Centered Outcomes Research (PCOR) proposes, through a program of mentoring, formal coursework, and a linked research project, to build skills in PCOR methods and utilize a participatory approach to inspire a new services delivery model for diabetes care. The basis of this model would be to include patient's nonbiomedical needs as part of primary care treatment discussions and decisions. Partnering with patients, physicians, and licensed practical nurses (LPNs) as stakeholders, our first phase will use mixed-methods to determine the range of biomedical (physical symptoms, diet and exercise) and nonbiomedical (financial, social and emotional) needs patients with depressive symptoms and Type 2 DM may wish to address in the context of their health. These needs will be used to populate a prioritization card-sort task that will be used to create a personalized management plan that empowers patients to prioritize their own needs within an integrated care intervention. The second phase will prepare for a pragmatic comparative effectiveness trial by pilot testing an integrated depression and Type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) intervention plus patient prioritized planning in primary care patients with depressive symptoms and Type 2 DM and a hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) > 8% from urban clinics serving primarily older low income minority populations. Function will be our primary patient-centered outcome because of the importance patients place on being able to manage one's life circumstances. The intervention is carried out by health care staff already on site thus facilitatig its implementation in real world practices with limited resources and competing demands. Our goal is to close the health disparities gap in diabetes care among traditionally underserved groups including older adults, those in inner city areas, and members of minority groups. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The burden of diabetes is anticipated to grow yet the proportion of adults whose diabetes is controlled is decreasing over time and is particularly low among older adults and ethnic minorities.

"Internet Studies to Enhance Long Term Survivorship after Hematologic Malignancy DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This investigator-initiated new R01 application, in response to PA-10-067, proposes to reduce depression and cancer-related emotional distress, while also improving health behaviors in adult hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) survivors using an internet-based intervention in a multi-center randomized controlled clinical trial (RCT). Among adult long-term cancer survivors, those who received HSCT live with some of the highest risks for life-threatening chronic health conditions including cardiovascular disease, diabetes, osteoporosis, and recurrence or second cancers along with other risks. Even more prevalent in HSCT survivors are psychological symptoms that inhibit quality of life, specifically depression and cancer-related distress. Our previous internet intervention has demonstrated efficacy in reducing depression and distress with survivors at a single site, and has pilot tested the efficacy of providing a survivorship preventive care plan. With the proposed improvements and the extension of the intervention to multiple transplant centers we expect to strengthen both the reach and efficacy of the intervention while we advance the science of internet-based providing of health behavior change models to cancer survivors. Specific aims of the project are to: 1) determine whether 2-10 year HSCT survivors with elevated depression or cancer-related distress who are randomized to receive access to a tailored internet-based program report reduced depression and distress when compared with control group survivors who receive a survivorship care plan by mail and delayed access to the internet site (enhanced usual care), and 2) determine whether survivors with low survivorship preventive care adherence (PCA) who are randomized to receive access to the tailored internet-based program, including a survivorship preventive care plan, report increased PCA when compared with control group survivors. The study will examine main effects of the intervention as well as moderating (age <40, chronic graft versus host disease, rural residence, lower income) and mediating effects (health self-efficacy, knowledge of survivorship needs) per Protection Motivation Theory. Further analyses will identify risk factors for disparities in survivorship preventive care adherence in HSCT survivors. The five-site multi-center RCT will enroll N=1200 adult HSCT survivors with internet access. Assessments will occur at baseline, 3 and 12 months. Participants without internet access will be invited to complete the baseline assessment for participation in the risk factor analyses. To our knowledge, this study will be the first to explore the efficacy of a tailored internet-based intervention, enhanced with options for alerts and reminders through individualized SMS messaging, mobile applications and social networking media, to target health behaviors in a cancer survivor population. The program is cost-effective and readily tailored. If effective, the program could be disseminated nationwide for long-term HSCT survivors in all transplant centers and would provide a framework for similar survivorship care models in non-HSCT cancer survivor populations. Among adult long-term cancer survivors, those who receive hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT: also called blood, marrow or umbilical cord blood transplantation) live with some of the highest risks for life-threatening chronic health conditions including cardiovascular disease, diabetes, osteoporosis, and recurrence or second cancers. Also prevalent in HSCT survivors are symptoms that inhibit quality of life such as depression and cancer-related emotional distress. In a study with five sites across the nation, this research is designed to test whether a tailored internet-based survivorship program with methods for managing health behaviors improves depression, emotional distress and adherence to health care guidelines in adult HSCT survivors.",Internet Studies to Enhance Long Term Survivorship after Hematologic Malignancy,8893909,R01CA160684,"['adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' post treatment ', ' After-Treatment ', ' After Care ', ' Aftercare ', ' Age ', ' Behavior ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Blood ', ' Budgets ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' Control Groups ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' diabetes ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Elements ', ' Florida ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' Methods ', ' Method LOINC Axis 6 ', ' Methodology ', ' Minnesota ', ' Motivation ', ' Nebraska ', ' Osteoporosis ', ' Pennsylvania ', ' QOL ', ' Quality of life ', ' Recurrent ', ' Recurrence ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Science ', ' survivorship ', ' Testing ', ' transplant ', ' Transplantation ', ' Relative ', ' Relative (related person) ', ' Factor Analyses ', ' Factor Analysis ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Mediating ', ' Process Measure ', ' Caring ', ' Social Network ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Chronic ', ' psychological ', ' psychologic ', ' Randomized Controlled Clinical Trials ', ' LTS ', ' Long-Term Survivors ', ' Survivors ', ' Physical activity ', ' Distress ', ' residence ', ' Rural ', ' HSC transplantation ', ' Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation ', ' world wide web ', ' web ', ' WWW ', ' Internet ', ' tool ', ' Marrow ', ' Malignant Hematologic Neoplasm ', ' Hematopoietic Cancer ', ' Hematological Tumor ', ' Hematological Neoplasms ', ' Hematological Malignancies ', ' Hematologic Malignancies ', ' Hematologic Cancer ', ' Hematologic Neoplasms ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Physical Function ', ' preference ', ' experience ', ' cohort ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' Participant ', ' Reporting ', ' feeling upset ', ' feeling distress ', ' emotional distress ', ' secondary cancer ', ' Secondary Malignant Neoplasm ', ' Secondary Malignancy (After Treatment of Primary Cancer) ', ' Secondary Malignancy ', ' Second Cancer ', ' Second Primary Cancers ', ' Chronic GVHD ', ' Chronic Graft Versus Host Disease ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' theories ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' UCB transplantation ', ' Cord Blood Transplantation ', ' Umbilical Cord Blood Transplantation ', ' Low income ', ' Address ', ' Preventive ', ' Symptoms ', ' Adherence ', ' Adherence (attribute) ', ' Data ', ' Center for Cancer Research ', ' NCI Center for Cancer Research ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Randomized ', ' Cancer Survivor ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center ', ' Long Term Survivorship ', ' cost ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' therapy efficacy ', ' therapeutically effective ', ' therapeutic efficacy ', ' intervention efficacy ', ' Treatment Efficacy ', ' Outcome ', ' cost-effective ', ' cost effective ', ' Population ', ' Health behavior change ', ' high risk ', ' secondary outcome ', ' usual care ', ' treatment as usual ', ' intervention effect ', ' efficacy testing ', ' mobile app ', ' mobile application ', ' ']",NCI,FRED HUTCHINSON CANCER RESEARCH CENTER,R01,2015,628406,0.05699861993869596

"Engaging self-regulation targets to understand the mechanisms of behavior change and improve mood and weight outcomes ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Background: Obesity affects 36% of US women and men and increases lifetime risk for diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Similarly, depression affects 20% of US women and 13% of men and is the leading cause of disability worldwide. Further, the 2 disorders have a bidirectional positive relationship. Proven behavioral interventions to treat obesity and depression exist; however, the underlying biological mechanisms remain unknown. This lack of understanding significantly hampers efforts to optimize the effectiveness of behavioral interventions and limits their dissemination and implementation into widespread practice to curtail the adverse consequences of obesity and depression and promote population health. Rapid advances in human neuroscience and behavioral science and integration of the two could provide unique opportunity to fill this gap. Objective: Leveraging a recently funded 2-year randomized controlled trial (""RAINBOW"" target n=404; PI Dr. Jun Ma) of a first-ever integrated treatment for comorbid obesity and depression in primary care that uniquely combines 2 nationally recognized behavioral interventions, we propose a 2-phased project to identify, validate and refine a set of assays to measure self-regulation targets; and to engage these targets to optimize behavioral treatment of obesity and depression. Specific Aims: In the UH2 phase, we will (1) Conduct secondary data analysis and hold workshops and a symposium to finalize selection of self-regulation targets and assays for testing; (2) Leverage the RAINBOW intervention to engage identified targets; and (3) Verify target engagement across multiple domains (neural, physiological, behavioral, psychological), settings (laboratory, virtual, and naturalistic), and time points (0, 4 weeks, 6, 12 and 24 months) Transitional milestones are to (1) Establish assay(s) that reliably and accurately measure the identified targets; (2) Demonstrate malleability of the self-regulation target(s) in response to th RAINBOW integrated treatment; and (3) Identify self-regulation profile(s) that predict treatment response in health behaviors (medical regimen adherence, physical activity, diet) and outcomes (weight, depression). In the UH3 phase, we will conduct a pilot randomized controlled trial in which an additional 100 obese and depressed adults will be randomized to intervention or wait-list control and assessed at baseline, 4 weeks and 6 months. Intervention subjects will receive the first 4 weeks of the RAINBOW intervention, followed by target-guided tailoring of the intervention components in order to optimize target engagement and enhance behavioral change based on their individual self-regulation profile during the first 4 weeks. We will use the insights from intervention subjects to then further refine the tailoring strategies for the waitlis subjects. Implications: This research will provide a toolkit of well-validated assays of self-regulation targets important for health behavior change, as well as target- guided personalization of intervention strategies, in the treatment of comorbid obesity and depression. Impact: Given the widespread relevance of these disorders and the targeted health behaviors, this research will be a prototype for treating multiple chronic conditions with profound potential impacts on population health.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: In this project we propose to understand self-regulation processes and mechanisms underlying evidence- based behavioral interventions for the treatment of obesity and depression, 2 of the top contributors to the burden of disease and disability in the US and globally. The project synergistically integrates human neuroscience and behavioral science to identify which self-regulation targets are engaged by the intervention among which subgroups of the population and how we can harness these target mechanisms to promote greater health behavior change, better weight management and improved mood. In a series of 3 interrelated studies we will identify, validate and refine a set of assays to measure self-regulation targets; and to engage these targets to optimize behavioral treatment of coexisting obesity and depression among adults. Given the widespread relevance of these disorders and the targeted health behaviors (adherence to self-tracking and medications, physical activity, diet), this research will be a prototype for understanding and optimizing behavioral interventions for multiple chronic conditions, with profound potential impacts on population health.            ",Engaging self-regulation targets to understand the mechanisms of behavior change and improve mood and weight outcomes,9037414,UH2HL132368,"['adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Affect ', ' Behavior ', ' lifestyle modification ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' behavior intervention ', ' Life Style Modification ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' Behavioral Sciences ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Brain ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' circulatory system ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' Cardiovascular system (all sites) ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' diabetes ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' dietary ', ' Diet ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Drug Therapy ', ' Pharmacotherapy ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' balance function ', ' balance ', ' Equilibrium ', ' Health behavior ', ' Modern Man ', ' Man (Taxonomy) ', ' Human ', ' interventions research ', ' interventional study ', ' interventional research ', ' intervention research ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' Laboratories ', ' Lifestyle ', ' Life Style ', ' Maintenance ', ' Medicine ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Moods ', ' Neurosciences ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Obesity ', ' Patients ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Primary Care ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Research ', ' Science ', ' Self Regulation ', ' Informal Social Control ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Waiting Lists ', ' wt-loss ', ' body weight loss ', ' Weight Reduction ', ' Weight Loss ', ' Body Weight decreased ', ' Weight ', ' Woman ', ' Measures ', ' conference ', ' symposium ', ' depressive ', ' depression symptom ', ' Emotional Depression ', ' depressive symptoms ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Phase ', ' Biological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' Medical ', ' psychological ', ' psychologic ', ' Series ', ' Training ', ' Physical activity ', ' disability ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Workshop ', ' Educational workshop ', ' Funding ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' sadness ', ' depressed ', ' Depressed mood ', ' programs ', ' Diet Research ', ' Healthy diet ', ' good diet ', ' Health behavior outcomes ', ' behavior change ', ' Remission ', ' Disease remission ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' Participant ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' research study ', ' Emotional ', ' Regulation ', ' response ', ' theories ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' weight management ', ' weight control ', ' Weight maintenance regimen ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Effectiveness ', ' problem solving therapy ', ' Adherence ', ' Adherence (attribute) ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Randomized ', ' Subgroup ', ' Cognitive ', ' Lifetime Risk ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' Behavioral ', ' pilot trial ', ' obesity treatment ', ' years of life lost to disease ', ' years of life lost to disability ', ' disease burden ', ' burden of disease ', ' burden of illness ', ' virtual ', ' Antidepressant adherence ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Health behavior change ', ' early therapy ', ' Early treatment ', ' prototype ', ' public health relevance ', ' evidence base ', ' treatment response ', ' usual care ', ' treatment as usual ', ' population health ', ' Regimen ', ' adverse consequence ', ' adverse outcome ', ' multiple chronic conditions ', ' ']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT CHICAGO,UH2,2015,916000,0.1621694059801449
"Collaborative Care for Depression and Diabetic Retinopathy in African Americans DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Depression occurs in 20-25% of older African Americans with diabetic retinopathy (DR) and accelerates progression of DR by compromising diabetes self-management practices and raising hemoglobin A1C levels (HbA1C). Treating depression improves diabetes self-management and lowers HbA1C and may thereby prevent progression of DR. AAs, however, are less likely to be treated for depression than whites. Depression contributes to why AAs have worse glycemic control and higher rates of DR (39% vs. 26%), vision-threatening DR (9.3% vs. 3.2%), and legal blindness (7.3 vs. 5.4%) than whites. These disparities necessitate new interventions to treat depression, improve glycemic control, and prevent progression of DR in older AAs. We seek support for a planning grant to refine the methods, conduct a Feasibility Study, and develop a Manual of Procedures for a planned randomized controlled clinical trial (RCT) entitled, ""Collaborative Care for Depression and Diabetic Retinopathy"" (CC-DDR). CC-DDR is a novel mental health/ophthalmologic intervention that we are designing to treat depression and lower HbA1C levels in older AAs with mild-to-moderate DR and comorbid depression. Community Health Workers, who match participants in race and cultural background, will work with ophthalmologists in the retina clinic to educate participants on the links between depression, HbA1C, and DR, and will extend care into the home where they will use Behavior Activation to treat depression and improve diabetes self-management skills. Before moving to a full-scale RCT of CC-DDR, we propose a 3- stage planning grant. In Stage I we will: 1) develop the CC-DDR treatment protocol; 2) develop a tool to assess therapists' adherence and competency; and 3) seek input from a panel of experts to refine these materials. In Stage II we will conduct an open trial of CC-DDR to evaluate its feasibility. In Stage III we will develop the Manual of Procedures for the planned RCT of CC-DDR. As the population ages and the prevalence of DR rapidly increases in older AAs, a culturally relevant intervention that treats depression, lowers HbA1C, and prevents progression of DR is significant if we are to preserve vision in this population. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This research is significant and innovative because it is the first attempt to integrate a mental health/ophthalmologic intervention into routine retina practice and extend care into the home; it targets a high- risk underserved minority group; and it targets untreated depression, which accelerates progression of diabetic retinopathy. These innovations hold the promise that Collaborative Care for Depression and Diabetic Retinopathy will be more effective than existing interventions and will prevent blindness in this population.",Collaborative Care for Depression and Diabetic Retinopathy in African Americans,8838813,R34EY024299,"['Age ', ' Behavior ', ' Blood Pressure ', ' clinical investigation ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Cultural Backgrounds ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Collection ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' diabetes ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Diabetic Retinopathy ', ' Epidemic ', ' Eyeball ', ' Eye ', ' Feasibility Studies ', ' Feedback ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' Hemoglobin ', ' Institutes ', ' insulin resistant ', ' Insulin Resistance ', ' Laser Radiation ', ' Laser Electromagnetic ', ' Lasers ', ' extended care ', ' Long-Term Care ', ' Manuals ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Methods ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Neuroendocrine System ', ' Neuroendocrine ', ' Neurosecretory Systems ', ' Patients ', ' Quality Control ', ' QOL ', ' Quality of life ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' recruit ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Retina ', ' Risk ', ' Supervision ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Treatment Schedule ', ' Treatment Regimen ', ' Treatment Protocols ', ' visual function ', ' Sight ', ' Vision ', ' Work ', ' Outcomes Assessment ', ' Outcome Assessment (Health Care) ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' Competence ', ' Self Management ', ' base ', ' quality assurance ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Clinical ', ' Specified ', ' Specific qualifier value ', ' Randomized Controlled Clinical Trials ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' satisfaction ', ' Sample Size ', ' Ophthalmologist ', ' Legal Blindness ', ' Staging ', ' Inflammatory ', ' tool ', ' Severities ', ' Home ', ' Home environment ', ' Clinic ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' visual loss ', ' vision loss ', ' Blindness ', ' meetings ', ' treatment planning ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Modality ', ' depression screening ', ' Depression screen ', ' human subject protection ', ' stigma ', ' social stigma ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' Adherence ', ' Adherence (attribute) ', ' Grant Proposals ', ' Applications Grants ', ' underserved minority ', ' under-represented minority ', ' Underrepresented Populations ', ' Underrepresented Groups ', ' Underrepresented Minority ', ' Monitor ', ' Community Health ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomic ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio economic ', ' socioeconomics ', ' intravitreal injection ', ' health literacy ', ' cost ', ' glycemic control ', ' efficacy trial ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' Vision research ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' collaborative care ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' therapy design ', ' high risk ', ' treatment adherence ', ' diabetes control ', ' clinical practice ', ' ']",NEI,THOMAS JEFFERSON UNIVERSITY,R34,2015,228189,0.173171309668042
"Pathways to Reducing Disparities in Depression Outcomes DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Depression for ethnic minorities is a common, disabling condition with documented disparities in access, quality and outcomes of care, particularly in primary care, which is a main treatment setting for ethnic minority groups. Quality improvement programs in primary care can reduce disparities in depression outcomes but are seldom available in vulnerable communities. The proposed project will use the data, partnership infrastructure, and research approach of ""Community Partners in Care"" (CPIC)-augmented by new collection of qualitative data-to shed light on the pathways by which health and social disparities can be reduced, as well as to illuminate how scientific research can inform policy development for neighborhood-focused health improvement. CPIC is a community-partnered randomized trial comparing the effectiveness of a community engagement and planning (CEP) intervention that activates multi-agency networks versus a technical assistance model for individual agencies, in implementing evidence-based interventions for depression in two under-resourced communities of color in Los Angeles. Analyses of 6-month client outcomes indicate that the CEP intervention, relative to technical assistance, led to improved mental wellness and physical health and reduced prevalence of poor mental health, risk factors for homelessness, and missed work days due to health. CPIC was implemented with community participatory co-leadership, including leaders' self-reflection on racism and social justice. The proposed investigators are original developers of CPIC. The proposed new secondary analyses and new qualitative data collection will clarify pathways for intervention effects on key subgroups (each community, African Americans and Latinos, men and women, homeless); develop explanatory models using mixed-methods; document intervention implementation for these groups; and explore the applicability and generalizability of the CPIC approach for a new Los Angeles County neighborhood-based health improvement initiative. The public health significance of the research is enhanced by the fact that it will be conducted entirely in partnership with leaders and members from the affected communities using a Community Partnered Participatory Research approach, which promotes equality and collaborative responsibility for all phases of work. Through that model's focus on equity and self-reflection among all leaders on the impact of racism, the proposed project will serve as an early example of a fourth-generation approach to addressing health disparities, which combines comprehensive intervention models and research strategy that incorporates the community context for racial and ethnic differences and the interactions in partnered leadership. . PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed work will have public health impact in three ways: (1) it will shed light on pathways to reducing mental health and social disparities among specific subgroups (most notably African Americans, Latinos, gender groups, the homeless, and uninsured) who benefited from a community-partnered intervention to improve depression care in underserved communities; (2) it will explore the generalizability and replicability of the Community Partners in Care model to the implementation of a ""neighborhood health"" initiative in Los Angeles to reduce mental health and social disparities; and, more broadly, (3) it will serve as a model for how scientific research can be incorporated into policy in models for neighborhood-based initiatives aimed at reducing disparities in underserved communities of color.",Pathways to Reducing Disparities in Depression Outcomes,8890204,R01MD007721,"['Action Research ', ' Affect ', ' Awareness ', ' Client ', ' Color ', ' Communities ', ' Community Services ', ' Data Collection ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Discrimination (Psychology) ', ' Physical Exercise ', ' Exercise ', ' Family ', ' Hair ', ' Health ', ' healthcare service availability ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare access availability ', ' health services availability ', ' health care service availability ', ' health care service access ', ' health care availability ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Availability of Health Services ', ' Accessibility of health care ', ' Access to Healthcare ', ' Access to Health Care ', ' Access to Care ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' Housing ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Income ', ' Insurance ', ' Interview ', ' Leadership ', ' hospital stay ', ' hospital length of stay ', ' hospital days ', ' Number of Days in Hospital ', ' Length of Stay ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Light ', ' Los Angeles ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Methods ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' Minority Groups ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' NIMH ', ' National Institute of Mental Health (U.S.) ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Out-patients ', ' Outpatients ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Primary Care ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Probability ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' QOL ', ' Quality of life ', ' Recreation ', ' recruit ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Science ', ' Social Justice ', ' Social Work ', ' Social Service ', ' Social work (field) ', ' Specialty ', ' medical specialties ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Time ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' County ', ' Gender ', ' Generations ', ' Relative ', ' Relative (related person) ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' Administrator ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' case report ', ' Case Study ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Latino ', ' Uninsured ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' racial/ethnic difference ', ' improved ', ' Chronic ', ' Phase ', ' Medical ', ' racism ', ' Training ', ' Physical activity ', ' mental ', ' Psyche structure ', ' unhoused ', ' homeless ', ' Homelessness ', ' Individual ', ' Trust ', ' Policy Developments ', ' Policies ', ' Community Networks ', ' sadness ', ' depressed ', ' Depressed mood ', ' programs ', ' Location ', ' physical health ', ' physical conditioning ', ' Visit ', ' Services ', ' metropolitan ', ' member ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' outreach ', ' social ', ' substance abuse ', ' abuse of substances ', ' Substance abuse problem ', ' Modeling ', ' behavioral health ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Provider ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' missing work ', ' Employee Absenteeism ', ' Absenteeism at work ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Randomized ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Subgroup ', ' Collection ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Process ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' effectiveness trial ', ' cost ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' social disparities ', ' Prevalence ', ' ethnic minority ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' Evidence based intervention ', ' trial comparing ', ' comparative effectiveness ', ' compare effectiveness ', ' collaborative care ', ' parent grant ', ' evidence base ', ' intervention effect ', ' health equity ', ' randomized trial ', ' screening ', ' ']",NIMHD,RAND CORPORATION,R01,2015,511619,0.08116516577926178
"Optimizing a Pediatric Intervention to Increase Maternal Depression Care-Seeking  PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Depression in mothers parenting young children is common and undertreated. Depression is debilitating for mothers, negatively affects their parenting, and is associated with mental, behavioral, and physical health problems in their children. Identifying and treating mothers with depression improves both the mothers' well-being and their children's mental and overall health. Pediatric visits offer a potential significant opportunity to intervene. Mothers may see their child's pediatric provider more often than their own, and these providers could motivate mothers to seek effective, underutilized, formal depression care, by communicating how recovery from depression is linked to child well-being. Therefore, in recent pilot work, we developed a pediatric setting-based intervention that includes a validated maternal depression screen, and subsequent depression education and care-seeking motivational messages that emphasize the benefits of maternal depression care for children.  Initial testing demonstrated that depression screen-positive mothers receiving the intervention had greater intention and attempts to seek depression care compared to mothers receiving usual care. [We then professionally translated the intervention into Spanish as a first step in increasing the generalizability of the intervention through refinement in future studies.] As is often the case with interventions tested as a package, we lack empirical evidence on which components of the pilot intervention deliver the greatest effects. Therefore, we propose to adopt a rapid-cycle intervention improvement approach. We will: (1) refine the components of the pilot-tested intervention [and a Spanish-language translation] using qualitative data and (2) assess the effects of those proposed refinements on depression screen-positive mothers' depression care- seeking, using factorial experiments. The resulting intervention will be provisionally optimized by including only those refined components found to be most experimentally efficacious. This provisionally optimized intervention will have a higher probability of demonstrating reproducible effectiveness, potentially speeding the way to implementation. [The ultimate optimized intervention will improve maternal depression care by being an essential link in future integrated systems between pediatric-based maternal depression screening and effective community-based programs for maternal mental health care.]  My long-term career goal is to become a national leader in improving intergenerational mental health, particularly for patients in disadvantaged settings, by developing interventions for pediatric providers to guide parents to effective, [integrated] mental and behavioral health care for themselves and their children. My medium-term career goal is to develop pediatric-based interventions for improving access to and uptake of effective but underused maternal depression therapies. My short-term career goals are to acquire expertise in maternal depression [affecting diverse populations] and in care-seeking intervention optimization strategies, and to advance the field by (1) better understanding mothers' preferences for pediatric-based maternal depression interventions and (2) producing a provisionally optimized pediatric-based intervention to increase maternal depression care-seeking. These goals will be achieved through further training and mentoring in (1) qualitative research design, implementation, and analysis; (2) design and analysis of data from adaptive and factorial randomized-controlled trials used in the optimization of interventions with multiple components; (3) [community-based, culturally appropriate] maternal mental health services [and research]; and (4) institutional and national career progression as a pediatrician-researcher.  The proposed research will be conducted at the University of California, Davis (UCD). The research and training environment at UCD supporting the proposed work includes: the Department of Pediatrics and its associated multiple pediatric clinic sites; the NIH Clinical and Translational Science Center; [the Center for Reducing Health Disparities;] the Center for Healthcare Policy and Research; graduate level courses in qualitative research, grant writing, health informatics, and career development as a clinician-researcher; infrastructure for database management and statistical planning and analysis; a training program in the responsible conduct of research; and an emphasis on experienced researchers mentoring junior faculty, both interdepartmentally and within the Department of Pediatrics. UCD has a long history of collaborative research and training directly relevant to the aims of this Career Development Award. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Mothers with symptoms suggesting clinical depression can be identified and potentially motivated to seek further care during pediatric visits for their young children. The best ways for pediatric providers to encourage mothers to seek further evaluation and treatment for their depressive symptoms are not known. We plan to provisionally optimize a pediatric office-based intervention that we developed to motivate mothers who may be depressed to seek further care and, thereby to improve the well-being of women [from diverse backgrounds] and their children.            ",Optimizing a Pediatric Intervention to Increase Maternal Depression Care-Seeking,8853955,K23MH101157,"['Affect ', ' California ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Puericulture ', ' Child Care ', ' Child Health ', ' Child health care ', ' childrearing ', ' Child Rearing ', ' Communities ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Environment ', ' Faculty ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Group Interviews ', ' Health ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Health Personnel ', ' healthcare policy ', ' health care policy ', ' Health Policy ', ' services research ', ' Medical Care Research ', ' Healthcare Research ', ' Health Services Evaluation ', ' Health Care Research ', ' Health Services Research ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' Interview ', ' Language ', ' Leadership ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene Services ', ' Mental Health Services ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' Mothers ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' Terminology ', ' Parents ', ' Patients ', ' well-being ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' Probability ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Reinforcement (Psychology) ', ' Reinforcement ', ' Psychological reinforcement ', ' Research ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Research Design ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Solutions ', ' Phone ', ' Telephone ', ' Testing ', ' Training Programs ', ' Translating ', ' Translations ', ' Universities ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Writing ', ' depressive ', ' depression symptom ', ' Emotional Depression ', ' depressive symptoms ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' diverse populations ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' Caring ', ' Intention ', ' Visualization ', ' Imagery ', ' base ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Clinical ', ' Link ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' mental ', ' Psyche structure ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' Individual ', ' pediatrician ', ' Recovery ', ' uptake ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' sadness ', ' depressed ', ' Depressed mood ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Adopted ', ' Clinic ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' physical health ', ' physical conditioning ', ' Visit ', ' preference ', ' pediatric department ', ' experience ', ' intergenerational ', ' care seeking ', ' Speed ', ' Speed (motion) ', ' Participant ', ' database management ', ' Data Base Management ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' research study ', ' motivational interview ', ' motivational enhancement therapy ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' depression screening ', ' Depression screen ', ' behavioral health ', ' career development ', ' theories ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Qualitative Research ', ' consumer informatics ', ' Health Informatics ', ' Public Health Informatics ', ' Provider ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' major depression ', ' Major Depressive Disorder ', ' Effectiveness ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' Dose ', ' Child Mental Health ', ' Symptoms ', ' Qualitative Methods ', ' Data ', ' Improve Access ', ' Research Career Program ', ' K-Awards ', ' Career Development Programs K-Series ', ' Career Development Awards and Programs ', ' Career Development Awards ', ' K-Series Research Career Programs ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Research Training ', ' Clinical Sciences ', ' Cognitive ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' depression outreach ', ' depression education ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' depressed mother ', ' maternal depression ', ' translational sciences center ', ' translational research center ', ' Center for Translational Science Activities ', ' public health relevance ', ' effective intervention ', ' usual care ', ' treatment as usual ', ' responsible research conduct ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT DAVIS,K23,2015,179698,0.16179698151132044
"Development of an Integrated Microfinance and Depression Care Program for Women     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): It is estimated that by the year 2030, depression will be the single largest contributor to the world's health care burden. Effective treatments exist, bu they do not reach many depressed individuals, especially in resource-poor communities--ethnic minorities, rural residents in the United States, and individuals in most of the developing world. Among the many barriers for treatment are lack of trained professionals, stigma attached to mental health issues, lack of knowledge about mental health resources, and the low perceived value of treatment, particularly when other survival needs seem more pressing.  Women, in particular, are at risk for depression and poverty. Integrating programs that treat depression and address livelihood concerns may improve engagement in depression treatment and improve mental health and functioning for patients in low-resource settings. The proposed R-34 project would integrate depression care with existing ""microfinance"" programs, which provide poverty-alleviation services including small loans, savings programs, and vocational training to women. This project builds on a $2.5 million project funded by Atlantic Philanthropies in 2009 to develop a collaborative care model for the treatment of depression in the primary care systems of Danang and Khanh Hoa provinces in Vietnam by extending the collaborative care team to include the Women's Union lay health workers and delivering the program in the community. The Vietnam Women's Union has an impressive record of accomplishment for successful delivery of microfinance programs to Vietnamese women. This project will 1) conduct qualitative studies of barriers and facilitators of women's successful use of existing depression care and microfinance programs; 2) adapt and integrate the depression care and microfinance services; 3) train Women's Union facilitators to deliver the integrated depression care and microfinance program; and 4) conduct randomized pilot testing of the integrated program to assess acceptability, feasibility, and preliminary effectiveness. These findings will inform a future R01 proposal to conduct a full-scale randomized control study examining the effectiveness of the integrated model and the mechanism of change in the intervention.  The proposed project has significant public health implications for providing depression treatment in resource-poor communities and it offers an innovative approach to addressing overlapping vulnerabilities of gender, depression, and poverty in a collaborative care model, which may be applicable to other resource- poor settings in the United States and abroad.

"A Group Treatment for Diabetes Treatment Adherence and Depression in Hispanics DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this application for a K23 Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Award is to prepare the candidate, Trina Chang, M.D., M.P.H., for a career in patient-oriented research focusing on behavioral interventions for minority patients with diabetes and depression. This is an area of enormous public health importance, as diabetes and depression are both common and costly chronic illnesses that often co-occur. Dr. Chang is a clinical researcher and community psychiatrist with a background in public health, research with minorities, and the development, implementation and evaluation of programs at the interface of psychiatry and primary care. She is based at the Massachusetts General Hospital and has access to the expertise of the Depression Clinical and Research Program, the Behavioral Medicine Program, and the Diabetes Center, as well as access to a community health center for subject recruitment. Her immediate career goal is to develop a research program testing an intervention based on problem-solving treatment (PST) to promote diabetes treatment adherence in an underserved Hispanic population; ultimately, she intends to build a career around developing and evaluating behavioral interventions for diabetes and depression in disadvantaged populations, with an eye toward interventions that address the socioeconomic conditions underlying their health problems. The training goals of this career development award are for the candidate to 1) gain experience conducting behavioral research in diabetes, 2) build expertise in developing community interventions for disadvantaged or high-stress populations, particularly Hispanics, 3) advance her skills in adapting PST for different populations and purposes, and 4) learn to conduct mediator analyses. The candidate will also take coursework in biostatistics, methods of community research and behavioral research, cultural anthropology, and the relationship between stress, disparities and health, as well as the responsible conduct of research. The research component of this project will involve a randomized, waitlist-controlled trial of a novel group intervention featuring Problem-solving, Information, Support and Motivation (PRISM) for Spanish-speaking Hispanics with poorly controlled type 2 diabetes. The primary aims will be to refine the intervention and evaluate its efficacy for improving treatment adherence, diabetes, and depression; a secondary aim will be to investigate mediators of its effect. Results of this project will form the basis of an R01 grant application. Combined, this research and training plan will enable Dr. Chang to become an independent investigator in an area with significant need and broad public health applications: treating diabetes and depression in disadvantaged populations by creating innovative behavioral interventions that address the fundamental causes of disease. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Diabetes is a highly prevalent and costly chronic illness, one whose toll is multiplied when it co-occurs with depression. The goal of the proposed project is to reduce the impact of these two illnesses in Spanish- speaking Hispanics with poorly controlled Type 2 by promoting diabetes treatment adherence, using a group intervention based on enhanced problem-solving treatment. If successful, this intervention could provide a cost-effective way to reach a high-need population and empower them to deal with causes of health disparities.",A Group Treatment for Diabetes Treatment Adherence and Depression in Hispanics,8852608,K23DK097356,"['Cultural Anthropology ', ' Attention ', ' Award ', ' Behavior ', ' lifestyle modification ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' behavior intervention ', ' Life Style Modification ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' Behavioral Medicine ', ' Behavioral Research ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Biometrics ', ' Biometry ', ' Blood Sugar ', ' Blood Glucose ', ' Home Blood Glucose Monitoring ', ' Blood Sugar Self-Monitoring ', ' Blood Glucose Self-Monitoring ', ' chronic disorder ', ' chronic disease/disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Communities ', ' Satellite Centers ', ' Community Health Centers ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Complement ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' diabetes ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' type II DM ', ' type 2 DM ', ' maturity onset diabetes ', ' ketosis resistant diabetes ', ' adult onset diabetes ', ' Type II diabetes ', ' Type II Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Type 2 diabetes ', ' Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus ', ' T2DM ', ' T2D ', ' T2 DM ', ' Stable Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Slow-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Noninsulin Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Non-Insulin Dependent Diabetes ', ' NIDDM ', ' Maturity-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' MODY ', ' Ketosis-Resistant Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Adult-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Exhibits ', ' Eyeball ', ' Eye ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' hemoglobin A1c ', ' Hemoglobin A(1) ', ' HbA1c ', ' HbA1 ', ' Hb A1c ', ' Hb A1a+b ', ' Hb A1 ', ' Glycohemoglobin A ', ' Glycosylated hemoglobin A ', ' General Hospitals ', ' hypoglycemic episodes ', ' hypoglycemic ', ' Hypoglycemia ', ' Inventory ', ' Equipment and supply inventories ', ' Learning ', ' Lifestyle ', ' Life Style ', ' Massachusetts ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' Motivation ', ' Patients ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Primary Care ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Problem Solving ', ' Program Evaluation ', ' Psychiatrist ', ' Psychiatry ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Recommendation ', ' Renal Insufficiency ', ' Renal Failure ', ' Kidney Insufficiency ', ' Kidney Failure ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Risk ', ' Running ', ' personal care ', ' Self Care ', ' Stress ', ' Teaching ', ' Educational process of instructing ', ' Testing ', ' Measures ', ' depressive ', ' depression symptom ', ' Emotional Depression ', ' depressive symptoms ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Hispanics ', ' Mediating ', ' Self Management ', ' base ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Left ', ' Area ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' Training ', ' Distress ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' Disorder Management ', ' Disease Management ', ' programs ', ' visual loss ', ' vision loss ', ' Blindness ', ' skills training ', ' empowered ', ' experience ', ' stressor ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' peer ', ' Reporting ', ' psychological distress ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' patient oriented study ', ' patient oriented research ', ' cardiovascular disease risk ', ' cardiovascular disorder risk ', ' diabetes risk ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Preparedness ', ' Readiness ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Address ', ' Dose ', ' Symptoms ', ' M.D. ', ' Doctor of Medicine ', ' Grant Proposals ', ' Applications Grants ', ' M.P.H.

"Exercise to prevent depression and anxiety in older Hispanics DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal is for a K23 Mentored Patient Oriented Research Career Development Award that will prepare the candidate, Daniel Jimenez, become an independently funded researcher with expertise in health promotion/health behavior change interventions designed to prevent common mental illness (depression and anxiety) in at-risk racial/ethnic minority elderly. The candidate and his mentors at Dartmouth Medical School, Cambridge Health Alliance and the University of Pittsburgh have designed a career development plan, which is comprised of scholarly didactics and seminars, expert mentorship, hands-on experience at Dartmouth College, Harvard University, and the University of Pittsburgh as well as measurable productivity including peer- reviewed manuscripts and grant applications. His three career development aims are: 1) to gain expertise in the development of health promotion/health behavior change interventions to prevent common mental health disorders in high-risk older racial/ethnic minority populations; 2) to develop methodological expertise in depression and anxiety prevention research as a foundation for conducting health promotion/health behavior change research in racial/ethnic minority elderly; and 3) to gain increased knowledge on the effects of health promotion/health behavior change interventions on risk factors for depression/anxiety. Addressing these career development aims will provide the candidate with the skills and expertise to conduct the research plan in this proposal. A mixed methods approach will be used to develop and refine Happy Older Latinos are Active (HOLA), a physical activity intervention led by a community health worker, and to demonstrate feasibility, acceptability, and safety of the intervention in a randomized trial. This pilot study has three specific aims: 1) to develop and refine HOLA to address depression and anxiety prevention in a group of older Latinos with minor and subthreshold depression and anxiety; 2) to evaluate the feasibility and potential effectiveness of the newly refined HOLA compared to an enhanced psychoeducation condition with respect to: (a.) depression and anxiety prevention and (b.) depression and anxiety severity; 3) to evaluate the feasibility and potential effectiveness of HOLA compared to enhanced psychoeducation with respect to physical and psychosocial functioning. The development of a health promotion intervention designed to prevent common mental disorders could be a means of addressing multiple disparities (e.g. mental health outcomes, mental health service use, stigma) among racial/ethnic minority elderly. Should these results prove to be promising, a future R01 proposal for an adequately powered, randomized control trial will be submitted. Additionally, the results of this study could have implications fo other high risk, highly disadvantaged populations who could benefit from the proposed health promotion intervention in the service of preventing common and disabling mental disorders. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Depressive and anxiety disorders are among the most common, disabling, and costliest disorders in old age. The identification of people at greatest risk for common mental disorders (depression and anxiety) and the development of timely and empirically based interventions to prevent these mental disorders are major public health challenges. This mentored K23 career development application requests support for a pilot randomized prevention trial that seeks to compare a preventive intervention called ""Happy Older Latinos are Active (HOLA),"" a CHW led group-based, health promotion intervention, to a fotonovela, an enhanced psychoeducation condition.

"METRIC: Measurement, Education and Tracking in Integrated Care: Strategies to Increase Patient Engagement and Reduce Mental Health Disparities among Hispanics ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Barriers to depression treatment among Hispanic populations include persistent stigma, inadequate doctor patient communication (DPC) and resultant sub-optimal use of anti-depressant medications. Stigma is primarily perpetuated due to inadequate disease literacy and cultural factors. Common concerns about depression treatment among Hispanics include fears about the addictive and harmful properties of antidepressants, worries about taking too many pills, and the stigma attached to taking psychotropic medications. Primary care settings often are the gateway to identifying undiagnosed or untreated mental health disorders, particularly for people with comorbid physical health conditions. Hispanics, in particular, are more likely to receive mental health care in primary care settings. Recent recommendations from the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force are that primary care providers screen adult patients for depression only if systems are in place to ensure adequate treatment and follow-up. The proposed study seeks to establish the feasibility of universal screening for depression in an adult primary care safety net setting, measure the effectiveness of a culturally appropriate depression education intervention to reduce stigma and increase uptake in depression treatment among Hispanics, and implement a Measurement-Based Integrated Care (MBIC) model with collaborative, multi-disciplinary treatment and culturally tailored care management strategies. Specific Aim 1: Examine the specific effects of a Depression Education Fotonovela (DEF) to increase knowledge of depression, reduce stigma and increase engagement in depression treatment among Hispanic patients. Specific Aim 2: Evaluate the impact of Measurement-Based Integrated Care (MBIC) for the treatment of depression in one community-based Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHC) in North Texas whose patient population is majority Hispanic. Specific Aim 3: Examine the feasibility of universal screening and accurate detection of depression among adult primary care patients utilizing innovative iPad Depression Screening technology.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Increased disease literacy about depression and discussion of myths related to medication will help allay fears of engaging in treatment, provide patients an avenue to understanding treatment options, and increase participation in shared decision making with their provider. METRIC will advance the scientific knowledge around eliminating health disparities by testing a culturally and linguistically centered integrated care approach, an promoting sustainability of the model through peer services to expand the capacity of primary care. Implementation of the iPad Depression Screening application will increase provider awareness of the incidence and prevalence of depression in their practice, improve the performance and care the clinic provides, and reduce the morbidity of comorbid chronic disease.             ","METRIC: Measurement, Education and Tracking in Integrated Care: Strategies to Increase Patient Engagement and Reduce Mental Health Disparities among Hispanics",8994640,R15MD010220,"['adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Antidepressants ', ' Antidepressant Drugs ', ' Antidepressant Agent ', ' Antidepressive Agents ', ' Awareness ', ' lifestyle modification ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' behavior intervention ', ' Life Style Modification ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' psychological disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Belief ', ' chronic disorder ', ' chronic disease/disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' Counseling ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' Diagnosis ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Drug Therapy ', ' Pharmacotherapy ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Fear ', ' Fright ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Incidence ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' literacy ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Patients ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Primary Care ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Risk Factors ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Diagnostic Findings ', ' Signs and Symptoms ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Texas ', ' Measures ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Hispanics ', ' Caring ', ' Task Forces ', ' Advisory Committees ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Chronic ', ' Medical ', ' Ensure ', ' Measurement ', ' uptake ', ' instructional intervention ', ' Training Intervention ', ' Instruction Intervention ', ' Education for Intervention ', ' Educational Intervention ', ' Knowledge ', ' Clinic ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' physical health ', ' physical conditioning ', ' Services ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' peer ', ' depression screening ', ' Depression screen ', ' Early identification ', ' Modeling ', ' LOINC Axis 2 Property ', ' Property ', ' response ', ' stigma ', ' social stigma ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Drops ', ' Pill ', ' pill (pharmacologic) ', ' Provider ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Preventive ', ' Symptoms ', ' Detection ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' scientific advances ', ' scientific accomplishments ', ' Scientific Advances and Accomplishments ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' Federally Qualified Health Center ', ' depression outreach ', ' depression education ', ' Outcome ', ' Prevalence ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' safety net ', ' clinical significance ', ' clinically significant ', ' early therapy ', ' Early treatment ', ' patient centered ', ' patient oriented ', ' public health relevance ', ' effectiveness measure ', ' patient population ', ' primary care setting ', ' shared decision making ', ' screening ', ' ']",NIMHD,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS ARLINGTON,R15,2015,395467,0.2084684427144073
"Neurobiological Reactivity, Allostatic Load and Depression in Mexican Youth DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal requests funds to examine allostatic load as a potential mechanism in the development of depression in Mexican-origin adolescents. Allostatic load is the loss of flexibility in how physiological systems respond to stressful experiences. High levels of allostatic load have been identified in Mexican origin adults who experience economic, familial, workload, and acculturative stress, yet allostatic load has not been examined from a dynamic, multi-systemic or longitudinal perspective in this ethnic group. Because adolescence increases the risk for the development of depression, longitudinal data are needed to understand how allostatic load and depression change over time in Mexican-origin youth, who 1) are among the largest ethnic minority group in the US, 2) face high risk for depression, and 3) experience high levels of stress. A comprehensive assessment of dynamic, multi-systemic neurobiological reactivity to incentives and social stressors, two symptom-specific contexts, is proposed to assess allostatic load. Our proposed study will add these assessments to an existing, ongoing longitudinal study of the development of psychopathology and adjustment in 673 adolescents of Mexican origin (California Families Project [CFP]; 2R01DA017902-06; Contact PI: R. Conger). From this larger sample, we will identify 250 youths (50% female) with elevated risk for depression based on symptom counts and neuroticism at age 15 years. At ages 16 and 18 years, these selected youth will complete functional magnetic resonance imaging scans while adrenocortical, immunological and autonomic psychophysiological data are collected simultaneously. We expect that high neurobiological reactivity to social stressors and low reactivity to incentives will relate to high levels of depression symptoms in Mexican-origin adolescents. We also hypothesize that neurobiological reactivity will be a more effective index of allostatic load in adolescence than a more traditional additive measure of allostatic load using elevated static measures of physiology. Importantly, by integrating the proposed study and the existing CFP study, we will capitalize on the extensive available data on risk and protective factors (e.g., cognitive, personality, behavioral, contextual and cultural) offered by the CFP. These data on risk and protective factors will support proposed analyses based on biopsychosocial models of the development of depression in Mexican-origin adolescents. We will examine allostatic load as a mediator and a moderator of associations among risk and protective social-contextual factors and changes in depression. Results of the study are expected to inform the development of more effective and culturally sensitive prevention programs for an important, growing and understudied population. The existence of the ongoing CFP study (through 2015) by Dr. Conger and colleagues, with a committed and representative community sample of Mexican origin families, makes this proposal feasible. The timing of the proposal is critical, as youths will be 16 years old when the start of neurobiologica data collection is planned. Consequently, this will be one of the only prospective longitudinal studies of allostatic load as a mechanism of the development of depression in Mexican-origin adolescents. We propose to examine allostatic load as a mechanism in the development of depression in Mexican-origin adolescents. We will examine (a) the synergistic activity of the brain, hormones, and body that contribute to changes in allostatic load and changes in depression and (b) the relationships among allostatic load, stressful experiences, and depression in Mexican-origin adolescents. The knowledge generated by this project will be important for informing the development of more effective prevention and intervention programs that promote resilience against depression in this population.","Neurobiological Reactivity, Allostatic Load and Depression in Mexican Youth",9101841,R01MH098370,"['teenage ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' Adolescence ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Age ', ' Anxiety ', ' Anxiety Disorders ', ' Attention ', ' Behavior ', ' psychological disorder ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Brain ', ' California ', ' Communities ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Comorbidity ', ' Cues ', ' Data Collection ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' Depressive disorder ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Economics ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Ethnic group ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' Family ', ' Female ', ' Therapeutic Hormone ', ' Endocrine Gland Secretion ', ' Hormones ', ' Incentives ', ' indexing ', ' long-term study ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Minority Groups ', ' neurobiological ', ' Neurobiology ', ' neuroticism ', ' neurotic ', ' Psychoneuroses ', ' Neuroses ', ' Neurotic Disorders ', ' Personality ', ' Physiology ', ' abnormal psychology ', ' Psychopathology ', ' psycho-physiological ', ' physiopsychology ', ' Psychophysiological ', ' Physiological Psychology ', ' Physiologic Psychology ', ' Psychophysiology ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' recruit ', ' active recruitment ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' Request for Proposals ', ' Rewards ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' socioenvironment ', ' social context ', ' social climate ', ' Social Environment ', ' Stress ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', ' Workload ', ' Work Load ', ' depressive symptoms ', ' depressive ', ' depression symptom ', ' Emotional Depression ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Latino ', ' Youth ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' base ', ' Acute ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Adolescent ', ' Link ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Predisposition ', ' disability ', ' using substances ', ' substance using ', ' substance use ', ' AOD use ', ' Alcohol or Other Drugs use ', ' young adulthood ', ' adult youth ', ' young adult ', ' Mexican ', ' Funding ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Physiopathology ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Functional disorder ', ' sadness ', ' depressed ', ' Depressed mood ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional MRI ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Knowledge ', ' Motor Hyperactivity ', ' Hyperkinetic Movements ', ' Hyperkinesis ', ' Hyperkinesia ', ' Hyperactivity ', ' Hyperactive behavior ', ' Source ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' Affective Disorders ', ' Mood Disorders ', ' psychosocial ', ' Application Context ', ' contextual factors ', ' experience ', ' stressor ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' intervention program ', ' Prevention program ', ' Negotiation ', ' Negotiating ', ' Mediation ', ' social ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' social stress ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging Scan ', ' MRI Scans ', ' model development ', ' major depression disorder ', ' major depression ', ' clinical depression ', ' Major Depressive Disorder ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' National Institute on Drug Abuse ', ' NIDA ', ' National Institute of Drug Abuse ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Preventative intervention ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' Cognitive ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' allostatic load ', ' Minority ', ' youth depression ', ' pediatric depression ', ' depression in adolescence ', ' depressed adolescents ', ' childhood onset depression ', ' childhood depression ', ' adolescents with depression ', ' adolescent depression ', ' child depression ', ' resilience ', ' biopsychosocial ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' prospective ', ' 15 year old ', ' fifteen year old ', ' age 15 years ', ' 16 year old ', ' sixteen year old ', ' age 16 years ', ' 19 year old ', ' nineteen year old ', ' age 19 years ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' neurobiological mechanism ', ' high risk ', ' flexibility ', ' flexible ', ' gender difference ', ' gender-associated difference ', ' disparity reduction ', ' reduce disparity ', ' psychiatric symptom ', ' comorbid depression ', ' depression comorbidity ', ' comorbidity with depression ', ' comorbid with depression ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT DAVIS,R01,2016,485614,0.1234838862944882
"Telehealth Treatments for Depression with Low-Income Homebound Seniors ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long-term objective of the proposed study is to improve access to depression treatments for low-income, racially diverse homebound seniors, a population experiencing significant disparities in mental health care due to their homebound and low-income status. Specific aims are to compare the acceptability, clinical effectiveness, treatment cost, and budget impact of the two teledelivered treatment delivery models: problem- solving therapy (PST) by licensed clinicians and self-care management (SCM) support by trained lay mental health workers/advisors. The interventionists will be integrated into an aging-service agency; hence, integrated tele-PST (IT-PST) ad integrated tele-SCM (IT-SCM). Although tele-psychotherapy is likely to be an effective mental health service delivery model for the target population, the current and projected shortage of such clinicians and the costs of deploying highly trained professionals pose barriers to this model's widespread real- world adoption and sustainability. A more plausible option may indeed have to utilize trained lay mental health workers. The study participants will be 276 low-income, racially diverse homebound seniors who are served by a home-delivered meal (HDM) program and other aging-service agencies in Austin, Tex. In a 3-arm, pragmatic clinical trial with randomization prior to consent (a preferred public health approach), the participants will receive five sessions of IT-PST, five sessions of IT-SCM, or five telephone check-in calls (for the usual care- UC-group). Our first hypothesis is that IT-PST and IT-SCM will be equally acceptable to the participants. Our second hypothesis is that both IT-PST and IT-SCM will be more effective than UC in reducing depressive symptoms, although IT-PST may be more effective than IT-SCM. Symptoms will be assessed with the 24-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD) at 12, 24, and 36 weeks after baseline. Additional outcomes will be depression-free days (DFDs) and disability (WHODAS 2.0). Our third hypothesis is that IT-SCM will have a lower delivery cost than IT-PST, but both IT-PST and IT-SCM will be more cost-effective than usual care. The analyses include (a) comparisons of delivery costs between IT-PST and IT-SCM; (b) assessment of cost- effectiveness (CEA) based on DFDs and health-related quality adjusted life-year measured by EuroQol-5 (EQ- 5D); and (3) budget impact (BIA) of IT-PST relative to IT-SCM. Both CEA and BIA will employ a hybrid public program perspective of the AoA and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid. Public health significance of this study is that the data will help aging-service providers and funders assess respective strengths and weaknesses of each model as a sustainable approach to providing depression care for an underserved and growing population group and improving their access to evidence-based mental health services. (We use the terms older adults and seniors interchangeably because the latter term is frequently used in aging services.) PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Significance This study aims to find an effective and sustainable approach to reducing disparities in accessing mental health services for an underserved and growing population group of low-income, racially diverse, homebound older adults. It will compare two aging-service integrated, tele delivered depression treatments for these seniors. One model is short-term problem-solving therapy by licensed clinicians; the second model is self-care management support by trained lay advisors. The findings are expected to create a foundation of information for guiding the implementation of acceptable, effective, and sustainable depression care within widely available aging-service infrastructures.",Telehealth Treatments for Depression with Low-Income Homebound Seniors,9099955,R01MD009675,"['Adoption ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Elderly ', ' Aging ', ' Anxiety ', ' Budgets ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' cost effectiveness ', ' health services delivery ', ' Healthcare Delivery ', ' health care delivery ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' drug treatment ', ' Drug Therapy ', ' Pharmacotherapy ', ' Foundations ', ' individuals with disabilities ', ' disabled people ', ' disabled individual ', ' disabled ', ' Persons with Disabilities ', ' People with Disabilities ', ' Handicapped ', ' Disabled Population ', ' Disabled Persons ', ' Health ', ' Hybrids ', ' NAS/IOM ', ' Institute of Medicine ', ' Institute of Medicine (U.S.) ', ' Laws ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene Services ', ' Mental Health Services ', ' Persons ', ' Primary Care Physician ', ' Problem Solving ', ' Psychotherapy ', ' Public Health ', ' personal care ', ' Self Care ', ' Social transformation ', ' Social modification ', ' Social Change ', ' Target Populations ', ' Technology ', ' Phone ', ' Telephone ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Training Support ', ' United States Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration ', ' Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration ', ' SAMHSA ', ' United States Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services ', ' United States Health Care Financing Administration ', ' Health Care Financing Administration ', ' Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services ', ' Measures ', ' Quality-Adjusted Life Years ', ' QALY ', ' Case Management ', ' depressive symptoms ', ' depressive ', ' depression symptom ', ' Emotional Depression ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Mediating ', ' Treatment Cost ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' Training ', ' disability ', ' Licensing ', ' uptake ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Severities ', ' Home ', ' Home environment ', ' Clinic ', ' System ', ' psychosocial ', ' Services ', ' skills training ', ' experience ', ' Medicare/Medicaid ', ' care delivery ', ' austin ', ' Participant ', ' peer ', ' Modeling ', ' psychoeducation ', ' response ', ' Provider ', ' Population Group ', ' Effectiveness ', ' problem solving therapy ', ' telehealth ', ' Low income ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Consent ', ' Data ', ' Improve Access ', ' Intake ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Randomized ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Community Health ', ' Behavioral ', ' Evidence based treatment ', ' late life depression ', ' Elderly depression ', ' geriatric depression ', ' cost ', ' underserved people ', ' under served population ', ' Underserved Population ', ' Clinical effectiveness ', ' Outcome ', ' cost effective ', ' cost-effective ', ' Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression ', ' Hamilton Depression Scale ', ' HAM-D ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' clinically significant ', ' clinical significance ', ' Evidence based intervention ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' evidence base ', ' treatment as usual ', ' usual care ', ' brief screening ', ' arm ', ' World Health Organization Disability Assessment Schedule ', ' WHODAS ', ' late-life anxiety ', ' retention rate ', ' student retention ', ' retention strategy ', ' delivered meals ', ' antidepressant effect ', ' anti-depressant effect ', ' Pragmatic clinical trial ', ' racial diversity ', ' racially diverse ', ' disparity reduction ', ' reduce disparity ', ' ']",NIMHD,"UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS, AUSTIN",R01,2016,460408,0.052871978059883126
"Reducing depressive symptoms among rural African Americans: REJOICE. ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Rural African Americans are disproportionately exposed to numerous stressors such as poverty, racism, and discrimination that place them at risk for experiencing elevated levels of depressive symptoms. Elevated levels of depressive symptoms can lead to a host of negative outcomes including both the development of and poor management of chronic illnesses (i.e., hypertension, diabetes, etc.), poor social functioning, poor occupational functioning, and development of clinical depression. Though effective treatments for decreasing depressive symptoms exist, rural African Americans often fail to receive adequate and timely care. African American churches have been identified as potential venues for providing depression education and treatment for rural African Americans. Within the African American rural community, churches represent a key portal through which a large proportion (as much as 85%) of the African American community can be reached. Churches have been used to address physical health outcomes in those communities but few have focused primarily on addressing mental health outcomes. Through the NIMHD-funded project entitled, ""Faith Academic Initiatives to Transform Health (FAITH) in the Delta"", our partnership, consisting of faith community leaders and UAMS researchers, culturally adapted an evidence-based behavioral activation intervention for use with rural African American churches. This 8- session behavioral activation therapy was adapted to include faith-based themes, Scripture, and other aspects of the rural African American faith culture (e.g., Bible studies, use of lay leaders o deliver the intervention). In addition to assessing the effectiveness of our intervention, ascertaining ways to implement this intervention with proper fidelity to maintain clinical outcomes is also critically important to increase the efficiency of translating research into practice. Work towards disseminating evidence-based depression interventions to ""real world"" settings is particularly salient in addressing depression disparities, whereby rural African Americans bear a disproportionate burden. Thus, this application proposes a Hybrid-2 pragmatic-effectiveness implementation trial that seeks to test the effectiveness of the culturally adapted evidence-based intervention and gather preliminary data on the strategies necessary to support successful implementation of this intervention in rural African American churches. Specifically, this study aims to: 1) Refine a culturally appropriate, evidence-based depression intervention (REJOICE) based on results from our NIMHD-funded pilot study, 2) Determine whether REJOICE is superior to a usual-care control group at post treatment and a 3-month follow-up, 3) Collect pilot data regarding ""real world"" implementation strategies (i.e. face to fac training and coaching calls) on the uptake and maintenance of REJOICE in rural African American churches.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Rural African Americans are disproportionately impacted by social stressors that place them at risk for experiencing elevated depressive symptoms.

"Optimizing a Pediatric Intervention to Increase Maternal Depression Care-Seeking  PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Depression in mothers parenting young children is common and undertreated. Depression is debilitating for mothers, negatively affects their parenting, and is associated with mental, behavioral, and physical health problems in their children. Identifying and treating mothers with depression improves both the mothers' well-being and their children's mental and overall health. Pediatric visits offer a potential significant opportunity to intervene. Mothers may see their child's pediatric provider more often than their own, and these providers could motivate mothers to seek effective, underutilized, formal depression care, by communicating how recovery from depression is linked to child well-being. Therefore, in recent pilot work, we developed a pediatric setting-based intervention that includes a validated maternal depression screen, and subsequent depression education and care-seeking motivational messages that emphasize the benefits of maternal depression care for children.  Initial testing demonstrated that depression screen-positive mothers receiving the intervention had greater intention and attempts to seek depression care compared to mothers receiving usual care. [We then professionally translated the intervention into Spanish as a first step in increasing the generalizability of the intervention through refinement in future studies.] As is often the case with interventions tested as a package, we lack empirical evidence on which components of the pilot intervention deliver the greatest effects. Therefore, we propose to adopt a rapid-cycle intervention improvement approach. We will: (1) refine the components of the pilot-tested intervention [and a Spanish-language translation] using qualitative data and (2) assess the effects of those proposed refinements on depression screen-positive mothers' depression care- seeking, using factorial experiments. The resulting intervention will be provisionally optimized by including only those refined components found to be most experimentally efficacious. This provisionally optimized intervention will have a higher probability of demonstrating reproducible effectiveness, potentially speeding the way to implementation. [The ultimate optimized intervention will improve maternal depression care by being an essential link in future integrated systems between pediatric-based maternal depression screening and effective community-based programs for maternal mental health care.]  My long-term career goal is to become a national leader in improving intergenerational mental health, particularly for patients in disadvantaged settings, by developing interventions for pediatric providers to guide parents to effective, [integrated] mental and behavioral health care for themselves and their children. My medium-term career goal is to develop pediatric-based interventions for improving access to and uptake of effective but underused maternal depression therapies. My short-term career goals are to acquire expertise in maternal depression [affecting diverse populations] and in care-seeking intervention optimization strategies, and to advance the field by (1) better understanding mothers' preferences for pediatric-based maternal depression interventions and (2) producing a provisionally optimized pediatric-based intervention to increase maternal depression care-seeking. These goals will be achieved through further training and mentoring in (1) qualitative research design, implementation, and analysis; (2) design and analysis of data from adaptive and factorial randomized-controlled trials used in the optimization of interventions with multiple components; (3) [community-based, culturally appropriate] maternal mental health services [and research]; and (4) institutional and national career progression as a pediatrician-researcher.  The proposed research will be conducted at the University of California, Davis (UCD). The research and training environment at UCD supporting the proposed work includes: the Department of Pediatrics and its associated multiple pediatric clinic sites; the NIH Clinical and Translational Science Center; [the Center for Reducing Health Disparities;] the Center for Healthcare Policy and Research; graduate level courses in qualitative research, grant writing, health informatics, and career development as a clinician-researcher; infrastructure for database management and statistical planning and analysis; a training program in the responsible conduct of research; and an emphasis on experienced researchers mentoring junior faculty, both interdepartmentally and within the Department of Pediatrics. UCD has a long history of collaborative research and training directly relevant to the aims of this Career Development Award. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Mothers with symptoms suggesting clinical depression can be identified and potentially motivated to seek further care during pediatric visits for their young children. The best ways for pediatric providers to encourage mothers to seek further evaluation and treatment for their depressive symptoms are not known. We plan to provisionally optimize a pediatric office-based intervention that we developed to motivate mothers who may be depressed to seek further care and, thereby to improve the well-being of women [from diverse backgrounds] and their children.            ",Optimizing a Pediatric Intervention to Increase Maternal Depression Care-Seeking,9061439,K23MH101157,"['Affect ', ' California ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Puericulture ', ' Child Care ', ' Child Health ', ' Child health care ', ' childrearing ', ' Parenting behavior ', ' Parenting ', ' Child Rearing ', ' Communities ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Environment ', ' Faculty ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Group Interviews ', ' Health ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Health Personnel ', ' healthcare policy ', ' health care policy ', ' Health Policy ', ' services research ', ' Medical Care Research ', ' Health Services Evaluation ', ' Health Services Research ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' Interview ', ' Language ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene Services ', ' Mental Health Services ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' Mothers ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' Terminology ', ' Parents ', ' Patients ', ' well-being ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' Probability ', ' Public Health ', ' Reinforcement ', ' Psychological reinforcement ', ' Research ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Research Design ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Phone ', ' Telephone ', ' Testing ', ' Training Programs ', ' Translating ', ' Translations ', ' Universities ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Writing ', ' depressive symptoms ', ' depressive ', ' depression symptom ', ' Emotional Depression ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' population diversity ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' diverse populations ', ' Caring ', ' Intention ', ' Visualization ', ' Imagery ', ' base ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Clinical ', ' Link ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' mental ', ' Psyche structure ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' Individual ', ' pediatrician ', ' Recovery ', ' uptake ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' sadness ', ' depressed ', ' Depressed mood ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Adopted ', ' Clinic ', ' System ', ' physical health ', ' physical conditioning ', ' Visit ', ' preference ', ' pediatric department ', ' experience ', ' intergenerational ', ' care seeking ', ' Speed ', ' Participant ', ' database management ', ' Data Base Management ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' research study ', ' motivational interview ', ' motivational enhancement therapy ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' depression screening ', ' Depression screen ', ' behavioral health ', ' career development ', ' theories ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Qualitative Research ', ' consumer informatics ', ' Health Informatics ', ' Public Health Informatics ', ' Provider ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' major depression disorder ', ' major depression ', ' clinical depression ', ' Major Depressive Disorder ', ' Effectiveness ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' Dose ', ' Child Mental Health ', ' Symptoms ', ' qualitative reasoning ', ' Qualitative Methods ', ' Data ', ' Improve Access ', ' Research Career Program ', ' K-Awards ', ' Career Development Programs K-Series ', ' Career Development Awards and Programs ', ' Career Development Awards ', ' K-Series Research Career Programs ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Research Training ', ' Clinical Sciences ', ' Cognitive ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' depression outreach ', ' depression education ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' maternal depression ', ' depressed mother ', ' Center for Translational Science Activities ', ' translational sciences center ', ' translational research center ', ' public health relevance ', ' effective intervention ', ' treatment as usual ', ' usual care ', ' responsible research conduct ', ' leadership development ', ' Health Care Research ', ' healthcare research ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT DAVIS,K23,2016,178974,0.16179698151132044
"A Group Treatment for Diabetes Treatment Adherence and Depression in Hispanics DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this application for a K23 Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Award is to prepare the candidate, Trina Chang, M.D., M.P.H., for a career in patient-oriented research focusing on behavioral interventions for minority patients with diabetes and depression. This is an area of enormous public health importance, as diabetes and depression are both common and costly chronic illnesses that often co-occur. Dr. Chang is a clinical researcher and community psychiatrist with a background in public health, research with minorities, and the development, implementation and evaluation of programs at the interface of psychiatry and primary care. She is based at the Massachusetts General Hospital and has access to the expertise of the Depression Clinical and Research Program, the Behavioral Medicine Program, and the Diabetes Center, as well as access to a community health center for subject recruitment. Her immediate career goal is to develop a research program testing an intervention based on problem-solving treatment (PST) to promote diabetes treatment adherence in an underserved Hispanic population; ultimately, she intends to build a career around developing and evaluating behavioral interventions for diabetes and depression in disadvantaged populations, with an eye toward interventions that address the socioeconomic conditions underlying their health problems. The training goals of this career development award are for the candidate to 1) gain experience conducting behavioral research in diabetes, 2) build expertise in developing community interventions for disadvantaged or high-stress populations, particularly Hispanics, 3) advance her skills in adapting PST for different populations and purposes, and 4) learn to conduct mediator analyses. The candidate will also take coursework in biostatistics, methods of community research and behavioral research, cultural anthropology, and the relationship between stress, disparities and health, as well as the responsible conduct of research. The research component of this project will involve a randomized, waitlist-controlled trial of a novel group intervention featuring Problem-solving, Information, Support and Motivation (PRISM) for Spanish-speaking Hispanics with poorly controlled type 2 diabetes. The primary aims will be to refine the intervention and evaluate its efficacy for improving treatment adherence, diabetes, and depression; a secondary aim will be to investigate mediators of its effect. Results of this project will form the basis of an R01 grant application. Combined, this research and training plan will enable Dr. Chang to become an independent investigator in an area with significant need and broad public health applications: treating diabetes and depression in disadvantaged populations by creating innovative behavioral interventions that address the fundamental causes of disease. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Diabetes is a highly prevalent and costly chronic illness, one whose toll is multiplied when it co-occurs with depression. The goal of the proposed project is to reduce the impact of these two illnesses in Spanish- speaking Hispanics with poorly controlled Type 2 by promoting diabetes treatment adherence, using a group intervention based on enhanced problem-solving treatment.

"Engaging self-regulation targets to understand the mechanisms of behavior change and improve mood and weight outcomes ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Background: Obesity affects 36% of US women and men and increases lifetime risk for diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Similarly, depression affects 20% of US women and 13% of men and is the leading cause of disability worldwide. Further, the 2 disorders have a bidirectional positive relationship. Proven behavioral interventions to treat obesity and depression exist; however, the underlying biological mechanisms remain unknown. This lack of understanding significantly hampers efforts to optimize the effectiveness of behavioral interventions and limits their dissemination and implementation into widespread practice to curtail the adverse consequences of obesity and depression and promote population health. Rapid advances in human neuroscience and behavioral science and integration of the two could provide unique opportunity to fill this gap. Objective: Leveraging a recently funded 2-year randomized controlled trial (""RAINBOW"" target n=404; PI Dr. Jun Ma) of a first-ever integrated treatment for comorbid obesity and depression in primary care that uniquely combines 2 nationally recognized behavioral interventions, we propose a 2-phased project to identify, validate and refine a set of assays to measure self-regulation targets; and to engage these targets to optimize behavioral treatment of obesity and depression. Specific Aims: In the UH2 phase, we will (1) Conduct secondary data analysis and hold workshops and a symposium to finalize selection of self-regulation targets and assays for testing; (2) Leverage the RAINBOW intervention to engage identified targets; and (3) Verify target engagement across multiple domains (neural, physiological, behavioral, psychological), settings (laboratory, virtual, and naturalistic), and time points (0, 4 weeks, 6, 12 and 24 months) Transitional milestones are to (1) Establish assay(s) that reliably and accurately measure the identified targets; (2) Demonstrate malleability of the self-regulation target(s) in response to th RAINBOW integrated treatment; and (3) Identify self-regulation profile(s) that predict treatment response in health behaviors (medical regimen adherence, physical activity, diet) and outcomes (weight, depression). In the UH3 phase, we will conduct a pilot randomized controlled trial in which an additional 100 obese and depressed adults will be randomized to intervention or wait-list control and assessed at baseline, 4 weeks and 6 months. Intervention subjects will receive the first 4 weeks of the RAINBOW intervention, followed by target-guided tailoring of the intervention components in order to optimize target engagement and enhance behavioral change based on their individual self-regulation profile during the first 4 weeks. We will use the insights from intervention subjects to then further refine the tailoring strategies for the waitlis subjects. Implications: This research will provide a toolkit of well-validated assays of self-regulation targets important for health behavior change, as well as target- guided personalization of intervention strategies, in the treatment of comorbid obesity and depression. Impact: Given the widespread relevance of these disorders and the targeted health behaviors, this research will be a prototype for treating multiple chronic conditions with profound potential impacts on population health. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: In this project we propose to understand self-regulation processes and mechanisms underlying evidence- based behavioral interventions for the treatment of obesity and depression, 2 of the top contributors to the burden of disease and disability in the US and globally. The project synergistically integrates human neuroscience and behavioral science to identify which self-regulation targets are engaged by the intervention among which subgroups of the population and how we can harness these target mechanisms to promote greater health behavior change, better weight management and improved mood. In a series of 3 interrelated studies we will identify, validate and refine a set of assays to measure self-regulation targets; and to engage these targets to optimize behavioral treatment of coexisting obesity and depression among adults. Given the widespread relevance of these disorders and the targeted health behaviors (adherence to self-tracking and medications, physical activity, diet), this research will be a prototype for understanding and optimizing behavioral interventions for multiple chronic conditions, with profound potential impacts on population health.",Engaging self-regulation targets to understand the mechanisms of behavior change and improve mood and weight outcomes,9144432,UH2HL132368,"['adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Affect ', ' Behavior ', ' lifestyle modification ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' behavior intervention ', ' Life Style Modification ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' Behavioral Sciences ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Brain ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' circulatory system ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Cardio-vascular ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' diabetes ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' dietary ', ' Diet ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' drug treatment ', ' Drug Therapy ', ' Pharmacotherapy ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' balance function ', ' balance ', ' Equilibrium ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' interventions research ', ' interventional study ', ' interventional research ', ' intervention research ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' Lifestyle ', ' Life Style ', ' Maintenance ', ' Medicine ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Moods ', ' Neurosciences ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Obesity ', ' Patients ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Primary Care ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Research ', ' Science ', ' Self Regulation ', ' Informal Social Control ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Waiting Lists ', ' Body Weight decreased ', ' wt-loss ', ' body weight loss ', ' Weight Reduction ', ' Weight Loss ', ' Weight ', ' Woman ', ' Measures ', ' symposium ', ' symposia ', ' summit ', ' convention ', ' conference ', ' depressive symptoms ', ' depressive ', ' depression symptom ', ' Emotional Depression ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Phase ', ' Biological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' Medical ', ' psychological ', ' psychologic ', ' Series ', ' Training ', ' Physical activity ', ' disability ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Workshop ', ' Educational workshop ', ' Funding ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' sadness ', ' depressed ', ' Depressed mood ', ' programs ', ' Diet Research ', ' Healthy diet ', ' good diet ', ' Health behavior outcomes ', ' behavior change ', ' Remission ', ' Disease remission ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' Participant ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' research study ', ' Emotional ', ' Regulation ', ' response ', ' theories ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' weight management ', ' weight control ', ' Weight maintenance regimen ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Effectiveness ', ' problem solving therapy ', ' Adherence ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Randomized ', ' Subgroup ', ' Cognitive ', ' Lifetime Risk ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' Behavioral ', ' pilot trial ', ' obesity treatment ', ' years of life lost to disease ', ' years of life lost to disability ', ' disease burden ', ' burden of disease ', ' burden of illness ', ' Antidepressant adherence ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Health behavior change ', ' Early treatment ', ' early therapy ', ' prototype ', ' evidence base ', ' treatment response ', ' therapeutic response ', ' response to treatment ', ' treatment as usual ', ' usual care ', ' population health ', ' Regimen ', ' adverse outcome ', ' adverse consequence ', ' multiple chronic conditions ', ' virtual laboratory ', ' virtual lab ', ' remote laboratory ', ' ']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT CHICAGO,UH2,2016,1020984,0.1621694059801449
"Pathways to Reducing Disparities in Depression Outcomes DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Depression for ethnic minorities is a common, disabling condition with documented disparities in access, quality and outcomes of care, particularly in primary care, which is a main treatment setting for ethnic minority groups. Quality improvement programs in primary care can reduce disparities in depression outcomes but are seldom available in vulnerable communities. The proposed project will use the data, partnership infrastructure, and research approach of ""Community Partners in Care"" (CPIC)-augmented by new collection of qualitative data-to shed light on the pathways by which health and social disparities can be reduced, as well as to illuminate how scientific research can inform policy development for neighborhood-focused health improvement. CPIC is a community-partnered randomized trial comparing the effectiveness of a community engagement and planning (CEP) intervention that activates multi-agency networks versus a technical assistance model for individual agencies, in implementing evidence-based interventions for depression in two under-resourced communities of color in Los Angeles. Analyses of 6-month client outcomes indicate that the CEP intervention, relative to technical assistance, led to improved mental wellness and physical health and reduced prevalence of poor mental health, risk factors for homelessness, and missed work days due to health. CPIC was implemented with community participatory co-leadership, including leaders' self-reflection on racism and social justice. The proposed investigators are original developers of CPIC. The proposed new secondary analyses and new qualitative data collection will clarify pathways for intervention effects on key subgroups (each community, African Americans and Latinos, men and women, homeless); develop explanatory models using mixed-methods; document intervention implementation for these groups; and explore the applicability and generalizability of the CPIC approach for a new Los Angeles County neighborhood-based health improvement initiative. The public health significance of the research is enhanced by the fact that it will be conducted entirely in partnership with leaders and members from the affected communities using a Community Partnered Participatory Research approach, which promotes equality and collaborative responsibility for all phases of work. Through that model's focus on equity and self-reflection among all leaders on the impact of racism, the proposed project will serve as an early example of a fourth-generation approach to addressing health disparities, which combines comprehensive intervention models and research strategy that incorporates the community context for racial and ethnic differences and the interactions in partnered leadership. . PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed work will have public health impact in three ways: (1) it will shed light on pathways to reducing mental health and social disparities among specific subgroups (most notably African Americans, Latinos, gender groups, the homeless, and uninsured) who benefited from a community-partnered intervention to improve depression care in underserved communities; (2) it will explore the generalizability and replicability of the Community Partners in Care model to the implementation of a ""neighborhood health"" initiative in Los Angeles to reduce mental health and social disparities; and, more broadly, (3) it will serve as a model for how scientific research can be incorporated into policy in models for neighborhood-based initiatives aimed at reducing disparities in underserved communities of color.",Pathways to Reducing Disparities in Depression Outcomes,9035155,R01MD007721,"['Action Research ', ' Affect ', ' Awareness ', ' Client ', ' Color ', ' Communities ', ' Community Services ', ' Data Collection ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Discrimination ', ' Exercise ', ' Family ', ' Hair ', ' Health ', ' treatment access ', ' health services availability ', ' health service access ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' accessibility to health services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Access to Care ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' Housing ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Income ', ' Insurance ', ' Interview ', ' Leadership ', ' hospital stay ', ' hospital length of stay ', ' hospital days ', ' Number of Days in Hospital ', ' Length of Stay ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Light ', ' Los Angeles ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Methods ', ' Minority Groups ', ' NIMH ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Out-patients ', ' Outpatients ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Primary Care ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Probability ', ' Public Health ', ' QOL ', ' Quality of life ', ' Recreation ', ' recruit ', ' active recruitment ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Science ', ' Social Justice ', ' Social Service ', ' Social Work ', ' Specialty ', ' medical specialties ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Time ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' County ', ' Gender ', ' Generations ', ' Self-Examination ', ' Self-reflection ', ' Self-Surveillance ', ' Self evaluation ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Administrator ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Case Study ', ' case report ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Latino ', ' Uninsured ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Chronic ', ' Phase ', ' Medical ', ' racism ', ' Training ', ' Physical activity ', ' mental ', ' Psyche structure ', ' unhoused ', ' homeless ', ' Homelessness ', ' Individual ', ' Trust ', ' Policy Developments ', ' Policies ', ' Community Networks ', ' sadness ', ' depressed ', ' Depressed mood ', ' programs ', ' Location ', ' physical health ', ' physical conditioning ', ' Visit ', ' Services ', ' metropolitan ', ' member ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' race differences ', ' racial difference ', ' ethnicity difference ', ' ethnic difference ', ' outreach ', ' social ', ' substance abuse ', ' abuse of substances ', ' Substance abuse problem ', ' Modeling ', ' behavioral health ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Provider ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' missing work ', ' Employee Absenteeism ', ' Absenteeism at work ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Randomized ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Subgroup ', ' Collection ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Process ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' effectiveness trial ', ' cost ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' social disparities ', ' Prevalence ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' Evidence based intervention ', ' trial comparing ', ' comparative effectiveness ', ' compare effectiveness ', ' collaborative care ', ' parent grant ', ' evidence base ', ' intervention effect ', ' health equity ', ' randomized trial ', ' Randomization trial ', ' screening ', ' disparity reduction ', ' reduce disparity ', ' ']",NIMHD,RAND CORPORATION,R01,2016,409590,0.08116516577926178
"Remote Supervision for Implementing Collaborative Care for Perinatal Depression ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Depression is a common and serious disorder among pregnant women but few from low income groups receive effective treatment. The highly evidence based collaborative care (CC) model for depression has been shown to work for women in pregnancy but has not been widely implemented. In cases where large scale pragmatic implementation of this innovation has been attempted there has been great variation in the success at individual health centers. A major obstacle to achieving the same success in large scale efforts to implement this care innovation as is seen in more controlled effectiveness trials is the limit of resources available to support the staff members carrying out this care. Although ongoing support in the form of training, technical assistance, quality improvement, and tools has been found to improve implementation and patient outcomes through longitudinal consultation by content experts in the health innovation being implemented most implementation efforts rely primarily on brief intensive training for staff. These content experts are complementary but distinct from general practice facilitators that address general processes that are applicable to implementation of any innovation. In order to achieve the potential public health benefits of CC an efficient and scalable model of longitudinal consultation may be needed to facilitate its effective implementation. We propose a pragmatic cluster randomized trial of longitudinal remote consultation (LRC) utilizing video conferencing to efficiently link providers to consultants who provide timely feedback and training. We plan to use a Hybrid Type III implementation design with a focus on implementation outcomes but also clinical outcomes. The proposed study will involve twenty federally qualified health centers (FQHCs) providing prenatal care and which are part of the national OCHIN Network with a shared electronic health record. All sites will receive a standard multifaceted approach to implementation used in many current broad implementation efforts. After pre-implementation training ten of the sites will be randomly selected to receive the LRC. Implementation and clinical outcomes as well as costs will be compared between the study conditions after a 12 month implementation period and a 13-21 month sustainment period. The results of the proposed study will provide critical generalizable knowledge regarding the benefits of ongoing consultation for implementation of complex interventions like collaborative care.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We plan to carry out a rigorous pragmatic evaluation of the Longitudinal Remote Consultation (LRC) implementation strategy to improve implementation and patient outcomes from team based collaborative care for perinatal depression in federally qualified health centers (FQHCs). LRC improves implementation of evidence based practices for mental health care provided by individual providers but has not been assessed for complex interventions such as collaborative care. Because of the negative impact of perinatal depression, particularly on low income women and their families seen in FQHCs, this promising strategy has great potential for public health impact nationally.            ",Remote Supervision for Implementing Collaborative Care for Perinatal Depression,9008381,R01MH108548,"['Affect ', ' psychological disorder ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Parturition ', ' Birth ', ' Consultations ', ' Cost Analyses ', ' Cost Analysis ', ' cost effectiveness ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Elements ', ' Family ', ' Feedback ', ' Health ', ' Hybrids ', ' Infant ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene Services ', ' Mental Health Services ', ' Patients ', ' Gestation ', ' Pregnancy ', ' Pregnant Women ', ' pregnancy care ', ' Prenatal care ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Primary Care ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Public Health ', ' Research Support ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Supervision ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Woman ', ' Working Women ', ' working females ', ' General Practices ', ' Health Benefit ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Clinical ', ' Penetration ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Link ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' disability ', ' Individual ', ' Perinatal Disorder ', ' Remote Consultation ', ' tool ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Complex ', ' Services ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' skills ', ' member ', ' Modeling ', ' theories ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' Provider ', ' Low income ', ' Address ', ' Evidence based practice ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Randomized ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Process ', ' Federally Qualified Health Center ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' effectiveness trial ', ' cost ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' efficacy trial ', ' Outcome ', ' scale up ', ' Population ', ' prospective ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' safety net ', ' collaborative care ', ' research to practice ', ' research into practice ', ' public health relevance ', ' evidence base ', ' effective therapy ', ' effective treatment ', ' pragmatic trial ', ' peripartum depression ', ' perinatal depression ', ' Cluster randomized trial ', ' Cluster randomization trial ', ' racial minority ', ' disparity reduction ', ' reduce disparity ', ' health care disparity ', ' healthcare disparity ', ' disparity in healthcare ', ' disparity in care ', ' depression model ', ' depressive model ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2016,859329,0.11516465251601139
"eHealth Intervention for Postpartum Depression in Healthcare Settings ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Approximately 15-20% of women experience postpartum depression (PPD), which results in significant suffering for new mothers and their families, and has an adverse impact on infant development. Fortunately, effective treatments for PPD have been developed and validated. However, there are many barriers that make it difficult for women with PPD to access clinic-based mental health treatments and participation is low. Less than 50% of women with PPD seek help because of psychological barriers (stigma, feelings of failure and embarrassment); knowledge barriers (poor understanding about impact of PPD on infant health, unsure about where to get treatment); infrastructure barriers (fear of negative judgment from pediatrician, avoidance of prescription medications while breastfeeding); physical barriers in rural settings (too few providers of care, unacceptable logistical demands on time, transportation, and childcare); and provider-level barriers (inadequate skills for treating PPD, fear of liability, dearth of treatment options, and inadequate reimbursement). Thus, it is of critical importance to develop innovative service delivery systems that overcome barriers to quality healthcare and reduce health disparities. To address this need, we developed and tested the MomMoodBooster program (MMB), an innovative Web-based program for treating PPD adapted from an evidence-based cognitive-behavioral therapy for depression. The MMB program guides participants through six weekly sessions. Webpages in each session use text, interactions, animations, and video to present program content. The MMB program includes daily tracking and charting of mood and pleasant activities as well as online access to a library, covering a range of issues of concern to new mothers. To enhance supportive accountability, mothers also receive a series of up to six personal coach calls lasting approximately 20 minutes each. In Phase I, we will improve the flexibility of MMB's underlying infrastructure and its administrative website as well as its personal coach features in order to translate the research-focused MMB program into a commercial-ready product that fits the workflow and staffing of healthcare organizations. We will use an iterative formative development process informed by stakeholder input and usability testing by care providers in OB/GYN and family-physician practices. In Phase II, we will add mobile technology to enhance the ""push"" aspects of the program and develop an improved administrative interface to enable users in medical care organizations to customize features of the program to meet the needs of their different real-world scenarios. We will also explore the possibility that MMB can be linked to prominent electronic medical record systems that could encourage its greater routine use. Finally, we will use a 2-arm pragmatic randomized controlled trial to evaluate the extent to which healthcare barriers for women with PPD can be overcome by the reach, effectiveness, adoption, implementation, and maintenance of the integrated Web/Mobile MMB program in medical care settings.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Postpartum depression is very common in women, seriously impacts role functioning, and fewer than 50% of those afflicted receive treatment. We have developed a Web-based cognitive-behavioral intervention to overcome barriers to service utilization and provide treatment to mothers with postpartum depression. The goal of this project is to develop and evaluate a commercial-ready version of the intervention in order to promote the implementation and dissemination of this empirically-supported treatment within healthcare organizations.            ",eHealth Intervention for Postpartum Depression in Healthcare Settings,9046911,R43MH109191,"['Adoption ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Architecture ', ' Dorsum ', ' Back ', ' psychological disorder ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Breastfeeding ', ' Breast Feeding ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' cognitive behavioral treatment ', ' cognitive behavioral therapy ', ' cognitive behavioral modification ', ' cognitive behavioral intervention ', ' cognitive behavior therapy ', ' cognitive behavior modification ', ' cognitive behavior intervention ', ' Cognitive Psychotherapy ', ' Cognition Therapy ', ' Cognitive Therapy ', ' Communication ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Exercise ', ' Family ', ' Fear ', ' Fright ', ' Feedback ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Infant ', ' Judgment ', ' Libraries ', ' Logic ', ' Maintenance ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Methods ', ' Moods ', ' Mothers ', ' NIMH ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' web based ', ' online computer ', ' On-Line Systems ', ' Online Systems ', ' Patients ', ' Program Evaluation ', ' Public Health ', ' healthcare quality ', ' health care quality ', ' Recurrent ', ' Recurrence ', ' Research ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Safety ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' Transportation ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Accountability ', ' Computerized Medical Record ', ' Electronic Medical Record ', ' Administrator ', ' Businesses ', ' depressive symptoms ', ' depressive ', ' depression symptom ', ' Emotional Depression ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Medical ', ' psychological ', ' psychologic ', ' Series ', ' Infant Development ', ' Infant Health ', ' Link ', ' Postnatal Depression ', ' Post-Partum Depression ', ' Post-Natal Depression ', ' Postpartum Depression ', ' Failure ', ' pediatrician ', ' Rural ', ' data repository ', ' clinical data repository ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Databases ', ' Funding ', ' world wide web ', ' web ', ' WWW ', ' Internet ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' Shapes ', ' Knowledge ', ' animation ', ' programs ', ' Adopted ', ' Investigation ', ' Clinic ', ' System ', ' meetings ', ' Services ', ' experience ', ' health care organization ', ' health care service organization ', ' Performance ', ' Structure ', ' skills ', ' Participant ', ' member ', ' help seeking ', ' help-seeking behavior ', ' Case Management Nurse ', ' Care Manager ', ' Case Manager ', ' Reporting ', ' gatekeeper ', ' Gatekeeping ', ' stigma ', ' social stigma ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Provider ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Address ', ' Family Physicians ', ' High Prevalence ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Monitor ', ' Process ', ' Text ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' feelings ', ' Feeling ', ' women of childbearing age ', ' women of child bearing age ', ' Female of childbearing age ', ' Female of child bearing age ', ' website ', ' web site ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Treatment Efficacy ', ' therapy efficacy ', ' therapeutically effective ', ' therapeutic efficacy ', ' intervention efficacy ', ' prospective ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' Impairment ', ' usability ', ' service utilization ', ' high risk ', ' public health relevance ', ' evidence base ', ' effective therapy ', ' effective treatment ', ' web page ', ' webpage ', ' database structure ', ' data base structure ', ' flexibility ', ' flexible ', ' arm ', ' Healthy People 2020 ', ' eHealth ', ' e-Health ', ' web portal ', ' internet portal ', ' mobile computing ', ' mobile technology ', ' mobile platform ', ' ']",NIMH,OREGON RES BEHAVIORAL INTERVENTION STRAT,R43,2016,209656,0.10131390530078142
"Exercise to prevent depression and anxiety in older Hispanics DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal is for a K23 Mentored Patient Oriented Research Career Development Award that will prepare the candidate, Daniel Jimenez, become an independently funded researcher with expertise in health promotion/health behavior change interventions designed to prevent common mental illness (depression and anxiety) in at-risk racial/ethnic minority elderly. The candidate and his mentors at Dartmouth Medical School, Cambridge Health Alliance and the University of Pittsburgh have designed a career development plan, which is comprised of scholarly didactics and seminars, expert mentorship, hands-on experience at Dartmouth College, Harvard University, and the University of Pittsburgh as well as measurable productivity including peer- reviewed manuscripts and grant applications. His three career development aims are: 1) to gain expertise in the development of health promotion/health behavior change interventions to prevent common mental health disorders in high-risk older racial/ethnic minority populations; 2) to develop methodological expertise in depression and anxiety prevention research as a foundation for conducting health promotion/health behavior change research in racial/ethnic minority elderly; and 3) to gain increased knowledge on the effects of health promotion/health behavior change interventions on risk factors for depression/anxiety. Addressing these career development aims will provide the candidate with the skills and expertise to conduct the research plan in this proposal. A mixed methods approach will be used to develop and refine Happy Older Latinos are Active (HOLA), a physical activity intervention led by a community health worker, and to demonstrate feasibility, acceptability, and safety of the intervention in a randomized trial. This pilot study has three specific aims: 1) to develop and refine HOLA to address depression and anxiety prevention in a group of older Latinos with minor and subthreshold depression and anxiety; 2) to evaluate the feasibility and potential effectiveness of the newly refined HOLA compared to an enhanced psychoeducation condition with respect to: (a.) depression and anxiety prevention and (b.) depression and anxiety severity; 3) to evaluate the feasibility and potential effectiveness of HOLA compared to enhanced psychoeducation with respect to physical and psychosocial functioning. The development of a health promotion intervention designed to prevent common mental disorders could be a means of addressing multiple disparities (e.g. mental health outcomes, mental health service use, stigma) among racial/ethnic minority elderly. Should these results prove to be promising, a future R01 proposal for an adequately powered, randomized control trial will be submitted. Additionally, the results of this study could have implications fo other high risk, highly disadvantaged populations who could benefit from the proposed health promotion intervention in the service of preventing common and disabling mental disorders. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Depressive and anxiety disorders are among the most common, disabling, and costliest disorders in old age. The identification of people at greatest risk for common mental disorders (depression and anxiety) and the development of timely and empirically based interventions to prevent these mental disorders are major public health challenges. This mentored K23 career development application requests support for a pilot randomized prevention trial that seeks to compare a preventive intervention called ""Happy Older Latinos are Active (HOLA),"" a CHW led group-based, health promotion intervention, to a fotonovela, an enhanced psychoeducation condition.

"Engaging self-regulation targets to understand the mechanisms of behavior change and improve mood and weight outcomes ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Background: Obesity affects 36% of US women and men and increases lifetime risk for diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Similarly, depression affects 20% of US women and 13% of men and is the leading cause of disability worldwide. Further, the 2 disorders have a bidirectional positive relationship. Proven behavioral interventions to treat obesity and depression exist; however, the underlying biological mechanisms remain unknown. This lack of understanding significantly hampers efforts to optimize the effectiveness of behavioral interventions and limits their dissemination and implementation into widespread practice to curtail the adverse consequences of obesity and depression and promote population health. Rapid advances in human neuroscience and behavioral science and integration of the two could provide unique opportunity to fill this gap. Objective: Leveraging a recently funded 2-year randomized controlled trial (""RAINBOW"" target n=404; PI Dr. Jun Ma) of a first-ever integrated treatment for comorbid obesity and depression in primary care that uniquely combines 2 nationally recognized behavioral interventions, we propose a 2-phased project to identify, validate and refine a set of assays to measure self-regulation targets; and to engage these targets to optimize behavioral treatment of obesity and depression. Specific Aims: In the UH2 phase, we will (1) Conduct secondary data analysis and hold workshops and a symposium to finalize selection of self-regulation targets and assays for testing; (2) Leverage the RAINBOW intervention to engage identified targets; and (3) Verify target engagement across multiple domains (neural, physiological, behavioral, psychological), settings (laboratory, virtual, and naturalistic), and time points (0, 4 weeks, 6, 12 and 24 months) Transitional milestones are to (1) Establish assay(s) that reliably and accurately measure the identified targets; (2) Demonstrate malleability of the self-regulation target(s) in response to th RAINBOW integrated treatment; and (3) Identify self-regulation profile(s) that predict treatment response in health behaviors (medical regimen adherence, physical activity, diet) and outcomes (weight, depression). In the UH3 phase, we will conduct a pilot randomized controlled trial in which an additional 100 obese and depressed adults will be randomized to intervention or wait-list control and assessed at baseline, 4 weeks and 6 months. Intervention subjects will receive the first 4 weeks of the RAINBOW intervention, followed by target-guided tailoring of the intervention components in order to optimize target engagement and enhance behavioral change based on their individual self-regulation profile during the first 4 weeks. We will use the insights from intervention subjects to then further refine the tailoring strategies for the waitlis subjects. Implications: This research will provide a toolkit of well-validated assays of self-regulation targets important for health behavior change, as well as target- guided personalization of intervention strategies, in the treatment of comorbid obesity and depression. Impact: Given the widespread relevance of these disorders and the targeted health behaviors, this research will be a prototype for treating multiple chronic conditions with profound potential impacts on population health. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: In this project we propose to understand self-regulation processes and mechanisms underlying evidence- based behavioral interventions for the treatment of obesity and depression, 2 of the top contributors to the burden of disease and disability in the US and globally. The project synergistically integrates human neuroscience and behavioral science to identify which self-regulation targets are engaged by the intervention among which subgroups of the population and how we can harness these target mechanisms to promote greater health behavior change, better weight management and improved mood. In a series of 3 interrelated studies we will identify, validate and refine a set of assays to measure self-regulation targets; and to engage these targets to optimize behavioral treatment of coexisting obesity and depression among adults. Given the widespread relevance of these disorders and the targeted health behaviors (adherence to self-tracking and medications, physical activity, diet), this research will be a prototype for understanding and optimizing behavioral interventions for multiple chronic conditions, with profound potential impacts on population health.",Engaging self-regulation targets to understand the mechanisms of behavior change and improve mood and weight outcomes,9339342,UH2HL132368,"['adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Affect ', ' Behavior ', ' lifestyle modification ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' behavior intervention ', ' Life Style Modification ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' Behavioral Sciences ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Brain ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' circulatory system ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Cardio-vascular ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' diabetes ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' dietary ', ' Diet ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' drug treatment ', ' Drug Therapy ', ' Pharmacotherapy ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' balance function ', ' balance ', ' Equilibrium ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' interventions research ', ' interventional study ', ' interventional research ', ' intervention research ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' Lifestyle ', ' Life Style ', ' Maintenance ', ' Medicine ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Moods ', ' Neurosciences ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Obesity ', ' Patients ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Primary Care ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Research ', ' Science ', ' Self Regulation ', ' Informal Social Control ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Waiting Lists ', ' Body Weight decreased ', ' wt-loss ', ' body weight loss ', ' Weight Reduction ', ' Weight Loss ', ' Weight ', ' Woman ', ' Measures ', ' symposium ', ' symposia ', ' summit ', ' convention ', ' conference ', ' depressive symptoms ', ' depressive ', ' depression symptom ', ' Emotional Depression ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Phase ', ' Biological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' Medical ', ' psychological ', ' psychologic ', ' Series ', ' Training ', ' Physical activity ', ' disability ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Workshop ', ' Educational workshop ', ' Funding ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' sadness ', ' depressed ', ' Depressed mood ', ' programs ', ' Diet Research ', ' Healthy diet ', ' good diet ', ' Health behavior outcomes ', ' behavior change ', ' Remission ', ' Disease remission ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' Participant ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' research study ', ' Emotional ', ' Regulation ', ' response ', ' theories ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' weight management ', ' weight control ', ' Weight maintenance regimen ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Effectiveness ', ' problem solving therapy ', ' Adherence ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Randomized ', ' Subgroup ', ' Cognitive ', ' Lifetime Risk ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' Behavioral ', ' pilot trial ', ' obesity treatment ', ' years of life lost to disease ', ' years of life lost to disability ', ' disease burden ', ' burden of disease ', ' burden of illness ', ' Antidepressant adherence ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Health behavior change ', ' Early treatment ', ' early therapy ', ' prototype ', ' evidence base ', ' treatment response ', ' therapeutic response ', ' response to treatment ', ' treatment as usual ', ' usual care ', ' population health ', ' Regimen ', ' adverse outcome ', ' adverse consequence ', ' multiple chronic conditions ', ' virtual laboratory ', ' virtual lab ', ' remote laboratory ', ' ']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT CHICAGO,UH2,2016,95184,0.1621694059801449
"Recurrent Hemorrhagic Stroke in Minority Populations ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cerebral small vessel disease (CSVD) is a common, progressive condition of aging, and a leading contributor to age-related disability due to stroke, cognitive decline, late-life onset depression and gait deterioration. In most cases the underlying vessel pathology can be classified as one of the two most common subtypes, arteriolosclerosis (AS) and cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA). Although classically recognized as white matter changes on MRI, CSVD frequently comes to clinical attention for the first time when a patient presents with intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). Discovering the biological underpinnings of CSVD is a vital next step toward development of effective preventative strategies. Because their CSVD is uniformly severe, ICH survivors are ideal subjects in which to study CSVD and also form the group most likely to benefit from novel therapies. The proposed studies are motivated by the striking observation that ICH disproportionately affects African- American (AA) and Hispanic-American (HA) populations. Our preliminary analyses demonstrate that these differences extend to post-ICH risk for recurrent ICH, cognitive decline and late-life depression and that blood pressure (BP) may play a fundamental role in these differences. Our revised proposal, best titled ""Longitudinal Follow-up of ICH Survivors in ERICH,"" will systematically determine whether 1) AA and HA are predisposed to CSVD of all types, 2) are predisposed solely to increased risk of AS, or 3) have no inherent predisposition but, through the effects of BP suffer more severe CSVD. To test the central hypothesis that discovering the mechanisms for this health disparity ICH will yield biological insights for CSVD, advance the search for treatments and have impact at the bedside, we propose to leverage the soon- to-conclude Ethnic/Racial Variations of ICH (ERICH) study to perform longitudinal follow-up of a cohort of 900 ICH survivors (300 each of AA, HA, and NHW), recruited in the last two years of ERICH, who have had neuroimaging, genetic, epidemiologic, and socio-ethnic variables ascertained at time of enrollment. Subjects will be followed by telephone every 6 months according to established and validated protocols.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Cerebral small vessel disease (CSVD) is a common, progressive condition of aging, and a leading contributor to age-related disability due to stroke, cognitive decline, gait deterioration, and late-life depression. The most severe and acute manifestation of CSVD is intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), which is frequently the sentinel event that brings a patient's CSVD to clinical attention for the first time. ICH and CSVD affect African-American and Hispanic individuals differently compared to non-Hispanic Whites. The proposed study seeks to better characterize the mechanisms for this health disparity by determining why African-American and Hispanic survivors of ICH are at higher risk of recurrent ICH, cognitive decline and incident depression, all of which are manifestations of progressive CSVD.        ",Recurrent Hemorrhagic Stroke in Minority Populations,9127417,R01NS093870,"['Accounting ', ' Affect ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Elderly ', ' Aging ', ' Attention ', ' Biology ', ' Blood Pressure ', ' Intracerebral Hemorrhage ', ' Cerebrum Hemorrhage ', ' Cerebral Parenchymal Hemorrhage ', ' Cerebral Hemorrhage ', ' Cerebral Brain Hemorrhage ', ' Cerebral hemisphere hemorrhage ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' Gait ', ' Spanish Americans ', ' Hispanic Americans ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' high blood pressure ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Hypertension ', ' Investments ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' MRI ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MR Imaging ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' Pathology ', ' Patients ', ' Play ', ' recruit ', ' active recruitment ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' Recurrent ', ' Recurrence ', ' Risk ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Strikes ', ' Employee Strikes ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' brain attack ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Apoplexy ', ' stroke ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Phone ', ' Telephone ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Measures ', ' Cerebral Amyloid Angiopathy ', ' cerebrovascular amyloidosis ', ' Congophilic Angiopathy ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Hispanics ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Acute ', ' Clinical ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Biological ', ' Survivors ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Predisposition ', ' disability ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Genetic ', ' cognitively impaired ', ' cognitive loss ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' Life ', ' Severities ', ' Event ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' hemorrhagic stroke ', ' Brain hemorrhage ', ' cohort ', ' regulate blood pressure ', ' regulate BP ', ' blood pressure management ', ' blood pressure homeostasis ', ' blood pressure control ', ' BP regulation ', ' BP management ', ' BP homeostasis ', ' BP control ', ' blood pressure regulation ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' neuroimaging ', ' Preventive strategy ', ' Preventative strategy ', ' Prevention strategy ', ' Deterioration ', ' Arterioloscleroses ', ' Sentinel ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' late life depression ', ' Elderly depression ', ' geriatric depression ', ' age dependent ', ' age related ', ' Minority ', ' Population ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' novel therapeutics ', ' novel therapy ', ' novel drugs ', ' novel drug treatments ', ' next generation therapeutics ', ' new therapy ', ' new therapeutics ', ' new drugs ', ' new drug treatments ', ' white matter change ', ' high risk ', ' public health relevance ', ' personalized approach ', ' tailored approach ', ' precision approach ', ' individualized approach ', ' Personalized medical approach ', ' histopathological examination ', ' histopathologic examination ', ' Cerebral small vessel disease ', ' cerebral small vessel disorder ', ' ']",NINDS,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R01,2016,589160,-0.036338122988385554
"Exploring the Effects of Strength Training on Depressive Symptoms and Cardiovascular Risk in Black Men Project Summary/Abstract Depression is severely undertreated in Black men. Significant reasons for this include that traditional psychiatric treatments (i.e., psychotherapy and medication) are less acceptable to Black men, and that Black men report significant stigma regarding seeking these treatments. Depression also has major health consequences, including increased occurrence and worsening of cardiovascular disease (CVD), and even CVD mortality. We propose to address gaps in the literature and advance the field of minority men’s health by conducting the first randomized controlled trial testing the effects of strength training (i.e., weight lifting) on depression and cardiovascular health in a sample of depressed Black men. A total of 50 self-identifying Black men who meet a clinical level of depression will be randomized into a 12-week strength training (ST) program or a 12-week contact control. Both groups will meet on-site twice per week during the 12-week program, and follow-up assessments will occur at the end of the 12-weeks and at a 3-month follow-up. Blind to condition research staff will conduct assessments at baseline, end-of-treatment, and 3-month follow-up. Qualitative interviews will be conducted immediately after the 3-month follow-up to gather input on participants’ experiences and preferences. The primary outcome will be depression severity (measured by interview). Secondary outcomes will be inflammatory markers and CVD indicators (e.g., blood lipids, blood pressure, waist-to-hip ratio, body composition). The overall aim of this exploratory (R21) study is to establish the feasibility, acceptability, and initial efficacy of strength training as an intervention for depression in Black men. Specific aims are (1) To assess the feasibility and acceptability of recruitment, retention, assessment, and intervention procedures among depressed Black men, (2) To obtain preliminary evidence of efficacy in preparation for a future R01-supported randomized clinical trial, and (3) To explore potential mediators of the effect of ST on depression, including physiological (i.e., sleep quality) and psychological (i.e., self-esteem, acute changes in affect, enjoyment of exercise, physical self-concept) variables. The proposed research will lay the groundwork for a larger efficacy study of ST for Black men that will be fully powered to detect changes in both depression and CVD risk over long-term follow-up. Such a trial would be an initial step to combating major health disparities regarding CVD and treatment for depression among Black men. Depressive disorders account for the largest percentage of the global burden of disease and predict future cardiac disease, but remain under recognized and under treated in Black and African American men. Strength training (i.e., weight or resistance training) has shown promise for treating depression, and is a preferred form of exercise for men. The purpose of this exploratory R21 is to conduct the first randomized controlled trial testing of the efficacy of strength training for reducing depression and cardiovascular risk in depressed Black and African American men.",Exploring the Effects of Strength Training on Depressive Symptoms and Cardiovascular Risk in Black Men,9182593,R21NR016112,"['abstracting ', ' Accounting ', ' Affect ', ' American Heart Association ', ' Blood Pressure ', ' Body Composition ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' circulatory system ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Cardio-vascular ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' Depressive disorder ', ' Diagnosis ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Exercise ', ' Female ', ' Future ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' heart disorder ', ' Cardiac Disorders ', ' Cardiac Diseases ', ' Heart Diseases ', ' Interviewer ', ' Interview ', ' Literature ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Methods ', ' Moods ', ' mortality ', ' Psychotherapy ', ' Public Health ', ' recruit ', ' active recruitment ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' Research ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Self Concept ', ' self esteem ', ' Sleep ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' brain attack ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Apoplexy ', ' stroke ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Testing ', ' Training Programs ', ' Weight Lifting ', ' Weight ', ' Measures ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' depressive symptoms ', ' depressive ', ' depression symptom ', ' Emotional Depression ', ' Blinded ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' psychiatric treatment ', ' psychiatric therapy ', ' psychiatric care ', ' Psychiatric therapeutic procedure ', ' Site ', ' Acute ', ' Clinical ', ' sedentary ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' psychological ', ' psychologic ', ' waist-to-hip ratio ', ' Waist-Hip Ratio ', ' Randomized Clinical Trials ', ' Link ', ' Masculine ', ' Individual ', ' Funding ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' Smoker ', ' sadness ', ' depressed ', ' Depressed mood ', ' programs ', ' Severities ', ' Techniques ', ' meetings ', ' preference ', ' blood lipid ', ' experience ', ' Participant ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' cardiovascular risk ', ' cardiovascular risk factor ', ' Sampling ', ' stigma ', ' social stigma ', ' resistance training ', ' muscle strengthening ', ' strength training ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' cardiovascular disease risk ', ' cardiovascular disorder risk ', ' Risk Reduction ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Address ', ' Aerobic ', ' Data ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Randomized ', ' Cognitive ', ' Pharmacological Treatment ', ' Preparation ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' years of life lost to disease ', ' years of life lost to disability ', ' disease burden ', ' burden of disease ', ' burden of illness ', ' Minority ', ' blind ', ' prospective ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' male health ', "" men's health "", ' combat ', ' primary outcome ', ' secondary outcome ', ' inflammatory marker ', ' inflammation marker ', ' efficacy testing ', ' cardiovascular health ', ' Physical Exercise ', ' exercise program ', ' fitness program ', ' ']",NINR,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY TEACHERS COLLEGE,R21,2016,188584,0.08366022054349015
"Community Partnered Approach to Implement EBPs for Depression DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): African Americans with major depressive disorder (MDD) have greater disease burden, receive lower quality care, and under-utilize traditional mental health services compared to white Americans with MDD. Because clergy are regarded as trusted ""gatekeepers,"" they are the primary source of mental health education and/or services for socioeconomically diverse African Americans. However, few studies investigate how to translate evidence-based practices (EBPs) for depression into faith-based settings. This K23 proposes a concurrent, mixed-methods study to investigate the feasibility and acceptability of utilizing a community-partnered participatory research (CPPR) approach to support clergy in implementing Interpersonal Counseling (IPC) in faith-based settings. IPC is a manualized, 3-session depression intervention that was designed for delivery by non-mental health professionals, such as clergy. We aim to contribute an understanding of the factors involved in translating EBPs into real world settings, knowledge that could be used to disseminate interventions to underserved populations and reduce health disparities. This study has three main phases. The first phase (Vision) is designed to initiate a community-partnered approach to plan how to implement IPC in faith-based settings. It will yield a Community Steering Council that will guide all research activities and develop a specific implementation strategy for clergy. The second phase (Valley) is the implementation of a CPPR informed model to test the feasibility and acceptability of training 8 clergy in IPC at two African American churches. Implementation will be staggered across churches to incorporate community input. Patient outcomes will be depressive symptomatology and level of functioning. Implementation outcomes will be feasibility, acceptability, adoption, implementation, and maintenance. The third phase (Victory) will allow community members to provide feedback on the study design and celebrate results.  Execution of these studies will be combined with a comprehensive training program that integrates didactic lectures with mentored experiences. Led by co-mentors, Dr. Myrna Weissman, Dr. Ken Wells, and Ms. Loretta Jones, the application encompasses the following career training goals: (1) to learn and apply principles of dissemination and implementation science (Drs. Lisa Dixon, Sherry Glied, Gail Wyatt, and Helen Verdeli); (2) to develop expertise in community engagement (Dr. Alfiee Breland-Noble, Dr. Alwyn Cohall, and Mr. Richard Ferreira); and (3) to gain skills in mixed-methods (qualitative/quantitative) study designs (Drs. Jennifer Wisdom, Mindy Fullilove, and Priya Wickramaratne). The research plan produces data for a R01 to conduct a cluster-randomized controlled trial to test different ways to implement IPC in faith-based settings. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:     This K23 Career Development Award prepares the candidate to develop an independent program of research focused on the implementation of evidence-based practices (EBPs) in faith-based settings to reduce racial/ethnic disparities in depression treatment. This research wil advance the NIMH strategic plan by incorporating the needs of diverse people with mental illness (Objective 3) and strengthening the public health impact of NIMH supported research (Objective 4). It also addresses the NIMH Division of Services and Intervention Research (DSIR) area of high priority to ""employ strategic partnerships and community engagement/participation to enhance research capacity and infrastructure to conduct research in underserved and diverse populations.""",Community Partnered Approach to Implement EBPs for Depression,9070776,K23MH102540,"['Adoption ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Affect ', ' post treatment ', ' After-Treatment ', ' After Care ', ' Aftercare ', ' Attitude ', ' psychological disorder ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Clergy ', ' Client ', ' Color ', ' Communities ', ' Community Participation ', ' Counseling ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Feedback ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' Health Promotion ', ' interventions research ', ' interventional study ', ' interventional research ', ' intervention research ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' Interview ', ' Maintenance ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene Services ', ' Mental Health Services ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' Persons ', ' NIMH ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' Patient Satisfaction ', ' Client satisfaction ', ' Patients ', ' Public Health ', ' Questionnaires ', ' Research ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Research Design ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Support ', ' social adaptation ', ' Social Adjustment ', ' Specialty ', ' medical specialties ', ' Testing ', ' Training Programs ', ' Translating ', ' Vision ', ' visual function ', ' Sight ', ' Work ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Competence ', ' depressive symptoms ', ' depressive ', ' depression symptom ', ' Emotional Depression ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' population diversity ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' diverse populations ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Encapsulated ', ' Phase ', ' Training ', ' white American ', ' caucasian American ', ' Trust ', ' African ', ' satisfaction ', ' Policies ', ' Research Activity ', ' Collaborations ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' Staging ', ' sadness ', ' depressed ', ' Depressed mood ', ' Knowledge ', ' lectures ', ' programs ', ' Source ', ' Services ', ' Church ', ' experience ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' member ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' social ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' gatekeeper ', ' Gatekeeping ', ' Modeling ', ' QOC ', ' Quality of Care ', ' stigma ', ' social stigma ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Qualitative Research ', ' mental health education ', ' Provider ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' major depression disorder ', ' major depression ', ' clinical depression ', ' Major Depressive Disorder ', ' Institution ', ' Address ', ' Evidence based practice ', ' qualitative reasoning ', ' Qualitative Methods ', ' Data ', ' Research Career Program ', ' K-Awards ', ' Career Development Programs K-Series ', ' Career Development Awards and Programs ', ' Career Development Awards ', ' K-Series Research Career Programs ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Research Training ', ' Strategic Planning ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Process ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socio-economically ', ' socio-economic ', ' socioeconomics ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Healthcare professional ', ' Health Care Professional ', ' Health Professional ', ' cost ', ' years of life lost to disease ', ' years of life lost to disability ', ' disease burden ', ' burden of disease ', ' burden of illness ', ' underserved people ', ' under served population ', ' Underserved Population ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' interpersonal psychotherapy ', ' interpersonal therapy ', ' Outcome ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' Evidence based intervention ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' implementation science ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' community setting ', ' evidence base ', ' racial disparity ', ' race disparity ', ' disparities in race ', ' hands-on learning ', ' interactive learning ', ' interactive engagement ', ' applied learning ', ' community partnership ', ' health care disparity ', ' healthcare disparity ', ' disparity in healthcare ', ' disparity in care ', ' symptomatology ', ' ']",NIMH,NEW YORK STATE PSYCHIATRIC INSTITUTE,K23,2016,184045,0.07786104550753029
"Pathways to Reducing Disparities in Depression Outcomes DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Depression for ethnic minorities is a common, disabling condition with documented disparities in access, quality and outcomes of care, particularly in primary care, which is a main treatment setting for ethnic minority groups. Quality improvement programs in primary care can reduce disparities in depression outcomes but are seldom available in vulnerable communities. The proposed project will use the data, partnership infrastructure, and research approach of ""Community Partners in Care"" (CPIC)-augmented by new collection of qualitative data-to shed light on the pathways by which health and social disparities can be reduced, as well as to illuminate how scientific research can inform policy development for neighborhood-focused health improvement. CPIC is a community-partnered randomized trial comparing the effectiveness of a community engagement and planning (CEP) intervention that activates multi-agency networks versus a technical assistance model for individual agencies, in implementing evidence-based interventions for depression in two under-resourced communities of color in Los Angeles. Analyses of 6-month client outcomes indicate that the CEP intervention, relative to technical assistance, led to improved mental wellness and physical health and reduced prevalence of poor mental health, risk factors for homelessness, and missed work days due to health. CPIC was implemented with community participatory co-leadership, including leaders' self-reflection on racism and social justice. The proposed investigators are original developers of CPIC. The proposed new secondary analyses and new qualitative data collection will clarify pathways for intervention effects on key subgroups (each community, African Americans and Latinos, men and women, homeless); develop explanatory models using mixed-methods; document intervention implementation for these groups; and explore the applicability and generalizability of the CPIC approach for a new Los Angeles County neighborhood-based health improvement initiative. The public health significance of the research is enhanced by the fact that it will be conducted entirely in partnership with leaders and members from the affected communities using a Community Partnered Participatory Research approach, which promotes equality and collaborative responsibility for all phases of work. Through that model's focus on equity and self-reflection among all leaders on the impact of racism, the proposed project will serve as an early example of a fourth-generation approach to addressing health disparities, which combines comprehensive intervention models and research strategy that incorporates the community context for racial and ethnic differences and the interactions in partnered leadership. . PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed work will have public health impact in three ways: (1) it will shed light on pathways to reducing mental health and social disparities among specific subgroups (most notably African Americans, Latinos, gender groups, the homeless, and uninsured) who benefited from a community-partnered intervention to improve depression care in underserved communities; (2) it will explore the generalizability and replicability of the Community Partners in Care model to the implementation of a ""neighborhood health"" initiative in Los Angeles to reduce mental health and social disparities; and, more broadly, (3) it will serve as a model for how scientific research can be incorporated into policy in models for neighborhood-based initiatives aimed at reducing disparities in underserved communities of color.",Pathways to Reducing Disparities in Depression Outcomes,9246994,R01MD007721,"['Action Research ', ' Affect ', ' Awareness ', ' Client ', ' Color ', ' Communities ', ' Community Services ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Comorbidity ', ' Data Collection ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Discrimination ', ' Exercise ', ' Family ', ' Hair ', ' Health ', ' treatment access ', ' health services availability ', ' health service access ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' accessibility to health services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Access to Care ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' Housing ', ' Income ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Insurance ', ' Interview ', ' Leadership ', ' Length of Stay ', ' hospital stay ', ' hospital length of stay ', ' hospital days ', ' Number of Days in Hospital ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Los Angeles ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Methods ', ' Minority Groups ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' NIMH ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Outpatients ', ' Out-patients ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Primary Care ', ' Probability ', ' Public Health ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Recreation ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' recruit ', ' active recruitment ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Science ', ' Social Justice ', ' Social Work ', ' Social Service ', ' medical specialties ', ' Specialty ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Time ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' County ', ' Gender ', ' Generations ', ' Self-reflection ', ' Self-Surveillance ', ' Self evaluation ', ' Self-Examination ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' Administrator ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' case report ', ' Case Study ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Latino ', ' Uninsured ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Chronic ', ' Phase ', ' Medical ', ' racism ', ' Training ', ' Physical activity ', ' mental ', ' Psyche structure ', ' unhoused ', ' homeless ', ' Homelessness ', ' Individual ', ' Trust ', ' Policy Developments ', ' Policies ', ' Community Networks ', ' Depressed mood ', ' sadness ', ' depressed ', ' programs ', ' Location ', ' physical conditioning ', ' physical health ', ' Visit ', ' Services ', ' metropolitan ', ' member ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Self-Report ', ' racial difference ', ' race differences ', ' ethnic difference ', ' ethnicity difference ', ' outreach ', ' social ', ' Substance abuse problem ', ' substance abuse ', ' abuse of substances ', ' Modeling ', ' behavioral health ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Provider ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Subgroup ', ' Collection ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Process ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' effectiveness trial ', ' cost ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' social disparities ', ' Prevalence ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' Evidence based intervention ', ' comparative effectiveness ', ' compare effectiveness ', ' collaborative care ', ' parent grant ', ' public health relevance ', ' evidence base ', ' intervention effect ', ' health equity ', ' randomized trial ', ' Randomization trial ', ' screening ', ' disparity reduction ', ' reduce disparity ', ' secondary analysis ', ' ']",NIMHD,RAND CORPORATION,R01,2017,416161,0.08116516577926178
"An adaptive treatment intervention for depression and engagement in HIV care among Latinos living with HIV 6. PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT This K01 Mentored Research Scientist Development Award will support the training of the Principal Investigator and the conduct of original research in the area of mobile health, sequential multiple assignment randomized trial designs (SMART), and implementation science. The goal of the training and research will be to treat problems with depression in sample of Latinos living with HIV. The overall goal of this K01 is to use a SMART to build an adaptive treatment strategy (ATS) that has a mobile health tool to improve adherence to the treatments for depression that are being proposed, and then evaluate the SMART and ATS through an implementation science model. The treatments being tested are a behavioral activation therapy (BAT), a cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), and mobile health (mHealth) tool (i.e., text-messaging protocol). The outcomes are to assess the feasibility of the SMART and ATS in the HIV care site and acceptability of the SMART and ATS to patients and clinic staff. To achieve the overall goal, three specific aims are outlined. Aim 1 uses qualitative research methods for the conduct of focus groups and individual interviews with HIV+ Latinos in both English and Spanish. The goal of Aim 1 is to tailor the intervention to the cultural and linguistic needs of Latinos and the organization needs of the HIV clinic study site, which informs Aim 2. Aim 1 is guided by the CDCs Map of Adaptation tailoring framework, which consist of three Action Steps. Action Step 1-3 are to better understand and document: 1) expressions for depression in Spanish and barriers to care, 2) language issues in detecting and reporting depressive symptoms, 3) cultural perspectives of how depression presents as a barrier to care, and 4) attitudes (i.e., cognitive and emotional evaluations) toward BAT and CBT, and text- message preference and confidentiality concerns to promote adherence to the intervention activities. Aim 2 is to build and test a pilot SMART. An ATS is a set of decision rules that uses detectable changes in patient health status to inform the next course of treatment. Aim 3 is to determine an adoption, implementation, and sustainability plan for adaptive depression treatment strategies into HIV care settings. Aim 3 is guided by the Capability, Opportunity, and Motivation System (COM-B) system and related Behavioral Change Wheel. This K01 attempts to maximize the clinical benefit of the BAT, CBT and mHealth programs by personalizing them to the patient. Successful completion of the proposed study will yield pilot data on the feasibility and acceptability of an ATS for depression integrated into HIV primary care, which will support the submission of an R01 full- scale efficacy trial. The results of this K01 can lead to future studies to personalize treatment interventions to enhance engagement with HIV care and mental health care for vulnerable populations. 7. PROJECT NARRATIVE Latinos are disproportionately impacted by the domestic HIV epidemic and untreated mental health problems continue to be a major public health challenge. Untreated mental health problems are driving poor outcomes along the HIV Care Continuum and impeding efforts to reduce health disparities and new infections.

"Engaging self-regulation targets to understand the mechanisms of behavior change and improve mood and weight outcomes ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Background: Obesity affects 36% of US women and men and increases lifetime risk for diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Similarly, depression affects 20% of US women and 13% of men and is the leading cause of disability worldwide. Further, the 2 disorders have a bidirectional positive relationship. Proven behavioral interventions to treat obesity and depression exist; however, the underlying biological mechanisms remain unknown. This lack of understanding significantly hampers efforts to optimize the effectiveness of behavioral interventions and limits their dissemination and implementation into widespread practice to curtail the adverse consequences of obesity and depression and promote population health. Rapid advances in human neuroscience and behavioral science and integration of the two could provide unique opportunity to fill this gap. Objective: Leveraging a recently funded 2-year randomized controlled trial (""RAINBOW"" target n=404; PI Dr. Jun Ma) of a first-ever integrated treatment for comorbid obesity and depression in primary care that uniquely combines 2 nationally recognized behavioral interventions, we propose a 2-phased project to identify, validate and refine a set of assays to measure self-regulation targets; and to engage these targets to optimize behavioral treatment of obesity and depression. Specific Aims: In the UH2 phase, we will (1) Conduct secondary data analysis and hold workshops and a symposium to finalize selection of self-regulation targets and assays for testing; (2) Leverage the RAINBOW intervention to engage identified targets; and (3) Verify target engagement across multiple domains (neural, physiological, behavioral, psychological), settings (laboratory, virtual, and naturalistic), and time points (0, 4 weeks, 6, 12 and 24 months) Transitional milestones are to (1) Establish assay(s) that reliably and accurately measure the identified targets; (2) Demonstrate malleability of the self-regulation target(s) in response to th RAINBOW integrated treatment; and (3) Identify self-regulation profile(s) that predict treatment response in health behaviors (medical regimen adherence, physical activity, diet) and outcomes (weight, depression). In the UH3 phase, we will conduct a pilot randomized controlled trial in which an additional 100 obese and depressed adults will be randomized to intervention or wait-list control and assessed at baseline, 4 weeks and 6 months. Intervention subjects will receive the first 4 weeks of the RAINBOW intervention, followed by target-guided tailoring of the intervention components in order to optimize target engagement and enhance behavioral change based on their individual self-regulation profile during the first 4 weeks. We will use the insights from intervention subjects to then further refine the tailoring strategies for the waitlis subjects. Implications: This research will provide a toolkit of well-validated assays of self-regulation targets important for health behavior change, as well as target- guided personalization of intervention strategies, in the treatment of comorbid obesity and depression. Impact: Given the widespread relevance of these disorders and the targeted health behaviors, this research will be a prototype for treating multiple chronic conditions with profound potential impacts on population health. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: In this project we propose to understand self-regulation processes and mechanisms underlying evidence- based behavioral interventions for the treatment of obesity and depression, 2 of the top contributors to the burden of disease and disability in the US and globally. The project synergistically integrates human neuroscience and behavioral science to identify which self-regulation targets are engaged by the intervention among which subgroups of the population and how we can harness these target mechanisms to promote greater health behavior change, better weight management and improved mood. In a series of 3 interrelated studies we will identify, validate and refine a set of assays to measure self-regulation targets; and to engage these targets to optimize behavioral treatment of coexisting obesity and depression among adults. Given the widespread relevance of these disorders and the targeted health behaviors (adherence to self-tracking and medications, physical activity, diet), this research will be a prototype for understanding and optimizing behavioral interventions for multiple chronic conditions, with profound potential impacts on population health.",Engaging self-regulation targets to understand the mechanisms of behavior change and improve mood and weight outcomes,9307951,UH2HL132368,"['adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Affect ', ' Behavior ', ' lifestyle modification ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' behavior intervention ', ' Life Style Modification ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' Behavioral Sciences ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Brain ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Comorbidity ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' dietary ', ' Diet ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' drug treatment ', ' Drug Therapy ', ' Pharmacotherapy ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' balance function ', ' balance ', ' Equilibrium ', ' Health behavior ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' interventions research ', ' interventional study ', ' interventional research ', ' intervention research ', ' Laboratories ', ' Life Style ', ' Lifestyle ', ' Maintenance ', ' Medicine ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Moods ', ' Neurosciences ', ' Obesity ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Patients ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Primary Care ', ' Research ', ' Science ', ' Informal Social Control ', ' Self Regulation ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Waiting Lists ', ' wt-loss ', ' body weight loss ', ' Weight Reduction ', ' Weight Loss ', ' Body Weight decreased ', ' Weight ', ' Woman ', ' Measures ', ' symposia ', ' summit ', ' convention ', ' conference ', ' symposium ', ' depressive ', ' depression symptom ', ' Emotional Depression ', ' depressive symptoms ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Phase ', ' Biological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' Medical ', ' psychological ', ' psychologic ', ' Series ', ' Training ', ' Physical activity ', ' disability ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Workshop ', ' Educational workshop ', ' Funding ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' Depressed mood ', ' sadness ', ' depressed ', ' programs ', ' Diet Research ', ' good diet ', ' Healthy diet ', ' Health behavior outcomes ', ' behavior change ', ' Disease remission ', ' Remission ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' neural ', ' Participant ', ' research study ', ' Emotional ', ' Regulation ', ' response ', ' theories ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Weight maintenance regimen ', ' weight management ', ' weight control ', ' diabetes risk ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Effectiveness ', ' problem solving therapy ', ' Adherence ', ' Behavioral Mechanisms ', ' behavior mechanism ', ' Mechanisms of Behavior and Behavior Change ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Subgroup ', ' Cognitive ', ' Lifetime Risk ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' Behavioral ', ' pilot trial ', ' obesity treatment ', ' years of life lost to disease ', ' years of life lost to disability ', ' disease burden ', ' burden of disease ', ' burden of illness ', ' virtual ', ' Antidepressant adherence ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Health behavior change ', ' Early treatment ', ' early therapy ', ' disability burden ', ' prototype ', ' public health relevance ', ' evidence base ', ' treatment as usual ', ' usual care ', ' population health ', ' Regimen ', ' adverse outcome ', ' adverse consequence ', ' multiple chronic conditions ', ' multimorbidity ', ' individualized medicine ', ' unique treatment ', ' tailored treatment ', ' tailored medical treatment ', ' individualized treatment ', ' individualized patient treatment ', ' customized treatment ', ' customized therapy ', ' personalized intervention ', ' precision interventions ', ' predictive of treatment response ', ' treatment response prediction ', ' ']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT CHICAGO,UH2,2017,833000,0.1621694059801449
"A Systems-Level Intervention for Rural Adults with Depression Abstract This career development award seeks to prepare the candidate for a career as a mental health intervention and implementation researcher who adapts and packages evidence-based practices (EBPs) to be accessible, acceptable, and sustainable in rural communities. Rural Americans experience depression at rates similar to their urban peers; yet are significantly less likely to receive treatment. Substantial barriers, including a lack of mental health professionals, cost, travel burden, stigma and preference for informal care, contribute to this disparity. Research is necessary to adapt and implement EBPs for depression in ways that reduce known barriers, align with rural residents' help-seeking preferences, and build internal capacity to delivery EBPs within rural communities. The proposed training goals and mentored research activities will prepare the candidate to bridge the gap between research and practice by successfully adapting and implementing EPBs in usual care settings. The candidate seeks to (1) develop expertise in implementation science and research to enhance her ability to integrate EBPs into usual care settings; (2) enhance her knowledge of community-based participatory research (CPBR) methods as they relate to adapting and implementing interventions with the best chance for acceptability and sustainbility in non-mental health settings; (3) increase her knowledge and skills in intervention development, randomized controlled trial designs, and quantitative analytic techniques; and (4) build upon her clinical background to enhance her expertise with cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for depression and anxiety through focused training supporting her ability to adapt CBT while retaining core components, train and supervise non-mental health professionals delivering interventions, and assess fidelity of adapted interventions. All career development goals are infused with relevant rural-focused content. The goals will be achieved through a rigorous training plan that includes coursework at the University of Michigan's (UM) top-ranked Schools of Social Work, Public Health, and Medicine; targeted off-site training and attendance at national conferences; state-of-the-art clinical training through UM Department of Psychiatry and the Beck Institute; as well as outstanding mentorship from leaders in mental health intervention and implementation research; depression and anxiety; and cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). Training goals are further supported by mentored research activities facilitated by UM's resource rich scientific environment. The proposed research, informed by the Replicating Effective Programs framework (REP) and CBPR, seeks to (1) adapt and package group CBT for depression for implementation in the rural church setting, and conduct an open pilot test of the adapted intervention; (2) conduct a pilot randomized controlled trial (pRCT) to assess the intervention's preliminary effect on depression and explore the relationship between potential mechanisms of change and expected outcomes; and (3) explore intervention acceptability and feasibility using mixed methods to assess multiple stakeholders perceptions of the intervention and its implementation. Relevance Public Health Relevance Statement: Rural Americans have faced decades-long disparities in access to mental health treatment and are significantly less likely to receive evidence-based care compared to urban peers. The lack of infrastructure and mental health professionals in rural areas requires consideration of ways to deliver evidence-based treatment within non-mental health settings to increase accessibility, acceptability, and sustainability of needed care. Adapting and packaging evidence-based practices in a context-specific way by incorporating rural residents' perspectives and treatment preferences, reducing practical barriers such as transportation and cost, and collaborating with informal providers within the de facto mental health system, has the potential to make an large impact by increasing access to care and ultimately improving the lives of rural residents with depression.",A Systems-Level Intervention for Rural Adults with Depression,9384528,K01MH110605,"['adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Anxiety ', ' Anxiety Disorders ', ' Attention ', ' Attitude ', ' psychological disorder ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Belief ', ' Clergy ', ' cognitive behavioral treatment ', ' cognitive behavioral therapy ', ' cognitive behavioral modification ', ' cognitive behavioral intervention ', ' cognitive behavior therapy ', ' cognitive behavior modification ', ' cognitive behavior intervention ', ' Cognitive Psychotherapy ', ' Cognition Therapy ', ' Cognitive Therapy ', ' Communities ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' Environment ', ' Exercise ', ' Goals ', ' treatment access ', ' health services availability ', ' health service access ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' accessibility to health services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Access to Care ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' Institutes ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' interventions research ', ' interventional study ', ' interventional research ', ' intervention research ', ' Manuals ', ' Medicine ', ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methods ', ' Michigan ', ' middle age ', ' midlife ', ' middle aged ', ' mid-life ', ' mid life ', ' mortality ', ' Persons ', ' Perception ', ' Psychiatry ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Rural Population ', ' Schools ', ' Social Work ', ' Social Service ', ' Supervision ', ' Testing ', ' Training Support ', ' Transportation ', ' Travel ', ' Universities ', ' case report ', ' Case Study ', ' symposia ', ' summit ', ' convention ', ' conference ', ' symposium ', ' depressive ', ' depression symptom ', ' Emotional Depression ', ' depressive symptoms ', ' population diversity ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' diverse populations ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' Research Methods ', ' Research Methodology ', ' Rural Community ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' career ', ' rural area ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Clinical ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' disability ', ' insight ', ' using substances ', ' substance using ', ' substance use ', ' AOD use ', ' Alcohol or Other Drugs use ', ' Individual ', ' Rural ', ' Research Activity ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Multimedia ', ' Multimedium ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Services ', ' preference ', ' Church ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' self reliance ', ' care seeking ', ' skills ', ' Participant ', ' peer ', ' Religion and Spirituality ', ' religious ', ' help-seeking behavior ', ' help seeking ', ' Reporting ', ' Modeling ', ' career development ', ' psychoeducation ', ' social stigma ', ' stigma ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Provider ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Health system ', ' Evidence based practice ', ' K-Series Research Career Programs ', ' Research Career Program ', ' K-Awards ', ' Career Development Programs K-Series ', ' Career Development Awards and Programs ', ' Career Development Awards ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Cognitive ', ' Process ', ' Behavioral ', ' Healthcare professional ', ' Health Care Professional ', ' Health Professional ', ' Evidence based treatment ', ' suicide rate ', ' cost ', ' care systems ', ' implementation research ', ' efficacy research ', ' Outcome ', ' community based participatory research ', ' participatory action research ', ' community based research ', ' community based design ', ' implementation science ', ' therapy development ', ' treatment development ', ' intervention development ', ' develop therapy ', ' public health relevance ', ' community setting ', ' evidence base ', ' treatment as usual ', ' usual care ', ' cognitive testing ', ' cognitive assessment ', ' trial design ', ' informal care ', ' comorbid depression ', ' depression comorbidity ', ' comorbidity with depression ', ' comorbid with depression ', ' rural Americans ', ' rural underserved ', ' rural setting ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,K01,2017,180361,0.07879737784338016
"Racial and Ethnic Disparities in Depression Care Utilization and Adherence among Older Adults ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): VITAL-DEP (Depression Endpoint Prevention in the VITamin D and OmegA-3 TriaL) is an ongoing, large- scale, 2x2 factorial randomized trial of vitamin D (vitamin D3 [cholecalciferol] 2000 IU/d) and omega-3 fatty acids (EPA and DHA, in 1:1 ratio, 1000 mg/d) for the prevention of late-life depression and promotion of long- term benefits for mood. In the first funding period (9/29/10-06/30/15), we completed baseline and early follow- up of depression outcomes among nearly 19,000 successfully randomized men and women, aged 50+ years (mean age=65y), who were eligible for incidence or recurrence of late-life depression; nearly 70% of participants have provided pre-randomization blood samples for nutrient biochemical assays. Furthermore, in the Clinical and Translational Science Center (CTSC) component, detailed phenotypic assessments were conducted among a subset of over 1,000 individuals who received in-person structured psychiatric diagnostic interviews, underwent neuropsychological testing, and provided data on dimensional measures of mood, well- being, and social and daily functioning. Finally, another landmark aspect of VITAL-DEP is its substantial racial and ethnic diversity: over 25% of participants are from minority racial and/or ethnic backgrounds, including 19% who are African American. Indeed, our first funding period aims emphasized potential differences in vitamin D response among African Americans, given high risk of low 25(OH)D in this group. However, late- breaking evidence indicates that bioavailable vitamin D is of greatest relevance to race/ethnic differences. In this 5-year renewal proposal, we expand upon what has been achieved in the first period - assembly of a unique trial cohort - and focus on the unprecedented scientific opportunities afforded by this RCT design. Our Primary Aims are: 1) to extend follow-up of mood to examine with high statistical power the long-term (up to 7 years) effects of vitamin D and marine omega-3 fatty acids on depression outcomes among all ~19,000 participants; 2) to examine with high power the impact of biochemical nutrients levels of vitamin D and omega- 3 fatty acids on depression outcomes as well as treatment interaction with baseline biochemical levels. Secondary Aims focus on two critical themes that our particular trial design is uniquely poised to address: 1) racial/ethnic differences in long-term treatment effects; 2) mechanisms, mediators and moderators of mood effects of vitamin D and fish oil in this diverse cohort. Specifically, in a sub-set of 2,000 participants, we will examine relations of bioavailable vitamin D to depression, with attention to race differences in outcomes. Further, among the entire eligible CTSC cohort, we will obtain pre- and post-randomization serum brain- derived neurotrophic factor and targeted plasma metabolite levels to examine biological paths involved in mood responses to vitamin D and fish oil treatment and to test whether biomarker change explains variation in treatment effects. Thus, this proposal not only will ensure comprehensive, definitive testing of the benefits of vitamin D and fish oil for late-life mood but also will inform specific mechanisms involved in a diverse sample. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Biologic and observational evidence supports potential mental health benefits of both vitamin D and marine omega-3 fatty acids. However, it remains unclear whether the use of these supplements can prevent depression or can significantly reduce depressive symptoms in late-life. This ongoing randomized trial, conducted among approximately 19,000 U.S. men and women, respectively aged =50 years =55 years, will: 1) clarify the effects of long-term daily vitamin D and/or omega-3 fatty acid supplementation on late-life depressive symptoms and 2) inform how these agents work to impact mood and for whom.",Racial and Ethnic Disparities in Depression Care Utilization and Adherence among Older Adults,9495217,R01MH091448,"['ages ', ' Age ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Elderly ', ' Anxiety ', ' Attention ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Biological Assay ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Vitamin D3 ', ' Vitamin D 3 ', ' VitD3 ', ' Calciol ', ' Cholecalciferol ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Research ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' Protocol Screening ', ' Eligibility ', ' Eligibility Determination ', ' ω-3 fatty acids ', ' omega-3 ', ' n-3 Fatty Acids ', ' Omega3 ', ' Omega-3 Polyunsaturated Fatty Acid ', ' Omega-3 PUFA ', ' Omega-3 Fatty Acids ', ' Seafood Oil ', ' Fish Oils ', ' Health ', ' Incidence ', ' Interview ', ' Long-Term Effects ', ' Longterm Effects ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Moods ', ' Persons ', ' Neuropsychological Tests ', ' Neuropsychologic Tests ', ' Parents ', ' Phenotype ', ' Plasma ', ' Reticuloendothelial System, Serum, Plasma ', ' Plasma Serum ', ' Blood Plasma ', ' Public Health ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Recurrence ', ' Recurrent ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' VIT D ', ' Vitamin D ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' depressive ', ' depression symptom ', ' Emotional Depression ', ' depressive symptoms ', ' Health Benefit ', ' Mediating ', ' BDNF ', ' Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Caring ', ' Blood Sample ', ' Blood specimen ', ' Specified ', ' Specific qualifier value ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Biological ', ' Biochemical ', ' Ensure ', ' Blood Serum ', ' Serum ', ' Individual ', ' Funding ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Dimensions ', ' treatment duration ', ' treatment days ', ' Treatment Period ', ' Marines ', ' Performance ', ' cohort ', ' Structure ', ' Nutrient ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Self-Report ', ' racial difference ', ' race differences ', ' ethnic difference ', ' ethnicity difference ', ' Prevention ', ' social ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' data integrity ', ' Bioavailable ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Address ', ' heart disease prevention ', ' heart disorder prevention ', ' Symptoms ', ' Adherence ', ' Data ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Supplementation ', ' Clinical Sciences ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' Behavioral ', ' late life depression ', ' Elderly depression ', ' geriatric depression ', ' Social Functioning ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' daily functioning ', ' positive mood ', ' Outcome ', ' aged ', ' treatment effect ', ' Center for Translational Science Activities ', ' translational sciences center ', ' translational research center ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' high risk ', ' public health relevance ', ' novel marker ', ' novel biomarker ', ' new marker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' randomized trial ', ' Randomization trial ', ' depression prevention ', ' trial design ', ' Minority Participation ', ' ethnic diversity ', ' ethnically diverse ', ' racial diversity ', ' racially diverse ', ' racial minority ', ' health difference ', ' differences in health ', ' ']",NIMH,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2017,153238,0.0949360749614185
"Gender, Racial, and Ethnic Disparities in Mental Health, Substance Use Disorders, and Behavioral Health Treatment Utilization in US Parolees and Probationers within 12 Months Post-Release ABSTRACT Background: Rates of depression in US parolees and probationers range from 9-40%, and depression is the most commonly co-occurring MH disorder in those with substance use disorders (SUDs). Depression and psychological distress (PD) are barriers to community re-integration, and contribute to risk taking behaviors, substance use relapse, and recidivism. However, rehabilitative reentry efforts typically focus on substance use treatment alone, resulting in unmet mental health (MH) treatment needs. About 40% of all US ex-offenders recidivate within one year, and correctional spending is individual state's second largest expenditure after Medicaid. Isolated studies indicate differences in depression rates among US parolees and probationers by gender, race, and ethnicity, but national estimates are limited. Methods: The proposed study recognizes the influence of social determinants of health and intersectionality of gender, race, and ethnicity on behavioral health (BH) outcomes and treatment disparities. A secondary analysis of cross-sectional data from the 2014 National Survey on Drug Use and Health, guided by a modified version of Meleis' Transitions Theory adapted to the BH needs of US parolees and probationers, will be used to understand the BH needs and barriers to BH treatment utilization by gender, race, and ethnicity, in a group of US parolees and probationers relative to a group of non-parolees and non-probationers. The specific aims of this study are to: Aim 1: Compare the prevalence of depression, PD, and/or SUD in the parolee and probationer group relative to the reference group, and determine whether these BH outcomes are related to gender, race, ethnicity, and their interactions with group. Aim 2: Compare BH treatment utilization in the parolee and probationer group relative to the reference group, and determine whether BH treatment utilization is related to BH (depression, PD, and/or SUD) and individual (gender, race, and ethnicity) characteristics, awareness of BH needs, and their interactions with group. Aim 3: Compare barriers to BH treatment utilization in the parolee and probationer group relative to the reference group, and determine which BH treatment utilization barriers are related to BH (depression, PD, and/or SUD) and individual (gender, race, and ethnicity) characteristics and their interactions with group. Significance: An understanding of the gender, racial, and ethnic disparities in BH among US parolees and probationers is integral to informing a population-based health approach that allows for strategic resource planning, and service design for the dual-integrative treatment of co-occurring MH and SUDs. This will inform targeted and tailored interventions, and improve equity in access and treatment for BH disorders among the numerous health disparity populations disproportionately represented among US parolees and probationers. Knowledge of gender, racial, and ethnic disparities in depression, psychological distress, and substance use disorders in US parolees and probationers will inform improved behavioral health interventions that promote successful community re-integration and improved public health.","Gender, Racial, and Ethnic Disparities in Mental Health, Substance Use Disorders, and Behavioral Health Treatment Utilization in US Parolees and Probationers within 12 Months Post-Release",9470598,F31MD012443,"['adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Affect ', ' Awareness ', ' Behavior ', ' lifestyle modification ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' behavior intervention ', ' Life Style Modification ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' psychological disorder ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Communities ', ' Continuum of Care ', ' Continuity of Care ', ' Continuity of Patient Care ', ' Disease Frequency Surveys ', ' Cross-Sectional Survey ', ' Cross-Sectional Analyses ', ' Cross Sectional Analysis ', ' Cross-Sectional Studies ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Expenditure ', ' Female ', ' Foundations ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Justice ', ' Medicaid ', ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Methods ', ' Prisons ', ' Public Health ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Rehabilitation therapy ', ' rehabilitative ', ' Rehabilitation ', ' Medical Rehabilitation ', ' Relapse ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk-Taking ', ' Substance Use Disorder ', ' Supervision ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Time ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', ' Treatment outcome ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Hispanics ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' incarceration ', ' incarcerated ', ' Imprisonment ', ' Specified ', ' Specific qualifier value ', ' mental ', ' Psyche structure ', ' using substances ', ' substance using ', ' substance use ', ' AOD use ', ' Alcohol or Other Drugs use ', ' Individual ', ' Measurement ', ' drug use ', ' Drug usage ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Knowledge ', ' Services ', ' experience ', ' knowledge base ', ' knowledgebase ', ' recidivism ', ' parolee ', ' probation ', ' offender ', ' criminal offender ', ' Reporting ', ' parole ', ' psychological distress ', ' Emotional ', ' Sampling ', ' behavioral health ', ' theories ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' DSM-V ', ' Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-V ', ' Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th edition ', ' DSM5 ', ' DSM-5 ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Address ', ' Jail ', ' Data ', ' Characteristics ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' probationer ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' post-doctoral training ', ' postdoctoral training ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' population based ', ' health equity ', ' social health determinants ', ' Healthy People 2020 ', ' screening ', ' behavioral health intervention ', ' racial minority ', ' treatment disparity ', ' disparities in treatment ', ' gender disparity ', ' intersectionality ', ' secondary analysis ', ' ']",NIMHD,DUKE UNIVERSITY,F31,2017,44044,0.02190814944311879
"Remote Supervision for Implementing Collaborative Care for Perinatal Depression ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Depression is a common and serious disorder among pregnant women but few from low income groups receive effective treatment. The highly evidence based collaborative care (CC) model for depression has been shown to work for women in pregnancy but has not been widely implemented. In cases where large scale pragmatic implementation of this innovation has been attempted there has been great variation in the success at individual health centers. A major obstacle to achieving the same success in large scale efforts to implement this care innovation as is seen in more controlled effectiveness trials is the limit of resources available to support the staff members carrying out this care. Although ongoing support in the form of training, technical assistance, quality improvement, and tools has been found to improve implementation and patient outcomes through longitudinal consultation by content experts in the health innovation being implemented most implementation efforts rely primarily on brief intensive training for staff. These content experts are complementary but distinct from general practice facilitators that address general processes that are applicable to implementation of any innovation. In order to achieve the potential public health benefits of CC an efficient and scalable model of longitudinal consultation may be needed to facilitate its effective implementation. We propose a pragmatic cluster randomized trial of longitudinal remote consultation (LRC) utilizing video conferencing to efficiently link providers to consultants who provide timely feedback and training. We plan to use a Hybrid Type III implementation design with a focus on implementation outcomes but also clinical outcomes. The proposed study will involve twenty federally qualified health centers (FQHCs) providing prenatal care and which are part of the national OCHIN Network with a shared electronic health record. All sites will receive a standard multifaceted approach to implementation used in many current broad implementation efforts. After pre-implementation training ten of the sites will be randomly selected to receive the LRC. Implementation and clinical outcomes as well as costs will be compared between the study conditions after a 12 month implementation period and a 13-21 month sustainment period. The results of the proposed study will provide critical generalizable knowledge regarding the benefits of ongoing consultation for implementation of complex interventions like collaborative care. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We plan to carry out a rigorous pragmatic evaluation of the Longitudinal Remote Consultation (LRC) implementation strategy to improve implementation and patient outcomes from team based collaborative care for perinatal depression in federally qualified health centers (FQHCs). LRC improves implementation of evidence based practices for mental health care provided by individual providers but has not been assessed for complex interventions such as collaborative care. Because of the negative impact of perinatal depression, particularly on low income women and their families seen in FQHCs, this promising strategy has great potential for public health impact nationally.",Remote Supervision for Implementing Collaborative Care for Perinatal Depression,9256545,R01MH108548,"['Affect ', ' psychological disorder ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Parturition ', ' Birth ', ' Consultations ', ' cost assessment ', ' assess cost ', ' Cost Analyses ', ' Cost Analysis ', ' cost effectiveness ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Elements ', ' Family ', ' Feedback ', ' Health ', ' Hybrids ', ' Infant ', ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health Services ', ' Mental Hygiene Services ', ' Patients ', ' Pregnancy ', ' Gestation ', ' Pregnant Women ', ' expecting mother ', ' expectant mother ', ' Prenatal care ', ' pregnancy care ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Primary Care ', ' Public Health ', ' Research Support ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Supervision ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' symposia ', ' summit ', ' convention ', ' conference ', ' symposium ', ' General Practices ', ' Health Benefit ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Clinical ', ' Penetration ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Link ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' disability ', ' Individual ', ' Perinatal Disorder ', ' Remote Consultation ', ' tool ', ' Knowledge ', ' Complex ', ' Services ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' skills ', ' member ', ' Modeling ', ' theories ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Provider ', ' Low income ', ' Address ', ' Evidence based practice ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Process ', ' Federally Qualified Health Center ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' effectiveness trial ', ' cost ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' efficacy trial ', ' Outcome ', ' scale up ', ' Population ', ' prospective ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' safety net ', ' collaborative care ', ' research to practice ', ' research into practice ', ' public health relevance ', ' evidence base ', ' effective therapy ', ' effective treatment ', ' clinical practice ', ' pragmatic trial ', ' peripartum depression ', ' perinatal depression ', ' Cluster randomized trial ', ' Cluster randomization trial ', ' racial minority ', ' disparity reduction ', ' reduce disparity ', ' health care disparity ', ' healthcare disparity ', ' disparity in healthcare ', ' disparity in care ', ' depression model ', ' depressive model ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2017,867291,0.11516465251601139
"Palliative care intervention for socioeconomically disadvantaged cancer patients ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Socioeconomic disadvantage is associated with a greater likelihood of being diagnosed with cancer, delays in cancer diagnosis, receiving less treatment, decreased access to palliative care and hospice services, and increased mortality. Although interventions have been developed to reduce the incidence of cancer and delays in diagnosis in those from socioeconomically disadvantaged backgrounds; few interventions exist to improve access to palliative care and hospice services for individuals with the least resources and greatest needs for these services. The NIH consensus statement on cancer-related symptoms concluded that the most common and debilitating are depression, pain and fatigue. Our team has observed that people from socioeconomically disadvantaged backgrounds with advanced cancer have disproportionately higher levels of depression, pain and fatigue and poorer quality of life than patients who reported higher socioeconomic status (SES). Although the comorbidity of these symptoms is well known, no intervention has been developed to reduce these symptoms concurrently. Experience from our successful pilot study of a web-based stepped collaborative care intervention for cancer patients from predominantly socioeconomically disadvantaged backgrounds, revealed that patients randomized to the intervention arm, reported statistically significant reductions in depression, pain, and fatigue an improved quality of life when compared to patients randomized to enhanced usual care (K07CA118576). Furthermore, patients randomized to the intervention had decreased serum levels of Interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, IL-8 and improved survival (R21CA127046). Post-hoc analyses revealed that family caregivers, of patients randomized to the intervention arm, had reductions in stress and depression, when compared to caregivers with spouses/partners randomized to enhanced usual care (K07CA118576S1). There is an urgent need to develop scalable, effective, and, cost-effective interventions, particularly for those who are socioeconomically disadvantaged. We plan to test a web-based stepped collaborative care intervention with 450 advanced cancer patients and their spousal or intimate partners in the context of a randomized controlled trial. The specific aims are: (1) to test the efficacy of a web-based stepped collaborative care intervention to reduce symptoms of depression, pain, and fatigue and improve health-related quality of life (HRQL) in advanced cancer patients when compared to patients randomized to the education and support arm; (2) to examine if advanced cancer patients randomized to the web-based stepped collaborative care intervention have reductions in biomarkers of inflammation and explore if these patients have slowed disease progression and improved survival when compared to patients in the education and support arm; (3) to investigate whether the spouses or intimate partners, of patients randomized to the web-based stepped collaborative care intervention, have reduced stress and depression, better HRQL and fewer risk factors for CVD than caregivers with spouses/partners randomized to education and support arm. In accordance with the goals of Healthy People 2020 ""to achieve health equity, eliminate disparities, and improve the health of all groups, regardless of differences that occur by gender, race or ethnicity, education or income, disability, geographic location, or sexual orientation"" this proposed web-based stepped collaborative care intervention was designed to improve HRQL for those in greatest need and least access to palliative care.

"Exploring the Effects of Strength Training on Depressive Symptoms and Cardiovascular Risk in Black Men Project Summary/Abstract Depression is severely undertreated in Black men. Significant reasons for this include that traditional psychiatric treatments (i.e., psychotherapy and medication) are less acceptable to Black men, and that Black men report significant stigma regarding seeking these treatments. Depression also has major health consequences, including increased occurrence and worsening of cardiovascular disease (CVD), and even CVD mortality. We propose to address gaps in the literature and advance the field of minority men’s health by conducting the first randomized controlled trial testing the effects of strength training (i.e., weight lifting) on depression and cardiovascular health in a sample of depressed Black men. A total of 50 self-identifying Black men who meet a clinical level of depression will be randomized into a 12-week strength training (ST) program or a 12-week contact control. Both groups will meet on-site twice per week during the 12-week program, and follow-up assessments will occur at the end of the 12-weeks and at a 3-month follow-up. Blind to condition research staff will conduct assessments at baseline, end-of-treatment, and 3-month follow-up. Qualitative interviews will be conducted immediately after the 3-month follow-up to gather input on participants’ experiences and preferences. The primary outcome will be depression severity (measured by interview). Secondary outcomes will be inflammatory markers and CVD indicators (e.g., blood lipids, blood pressure, waist-to-hip ratio, body composition). The overall aim of this exploratory (R21) study is to establish the feasibility, acceptability, and initial efficacy of strength training as an intervention for depression in Black men. Specific aims are (1) To assess the feasibility and acceptability of recruitment, retention, assessment, and intervention procedures among depressed Black men, (2) To obtain preliminary evidence of efficacy in preparation for a future R01-supported randomized clinical trial, and (3) To explore potential mediators of the effect of ST on depression, including physiological (i.e., sleep quality) and psychological (i.e., self-esteem, acute changes in affect, enjoyment of exercise, physical self-concept) variables. The proposed research will lay the groundwork for a larger efficacy study of ST for Black men that will be fully powered to detect changes in both depression and CVD risk over long-term follow-up. Such a trial would be an initial step to combating major health disparities regarding CVD and treatment for depression among Black men. Depressive disorders account for the largest percentage of the global burden of disease and predict future cardiac disease, but remain under recognized and under treated in Black and African American men. Strength training (i.e., weight or resistance training) has shown promise for treating depression, and is a preferred form of exercise for men. The purpose of this exploratory R21 is to conduct the first randomized controlled trial testing of the efficacy of strength training for reducing depression and cardiovascular risk in depressed Black and African American men.",Exploring the Effects of Strength Training on Depressive Symptoms and Cardiovascular Risk in Black Men,9357672,R21NR016112,"['Affect ', ' American Heart Association ', ' Blood Pressure ', ' Body Composition ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' circulatory system ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Cardio-vascular ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' Depressive disorder ', ' Diagnosis ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Exercise ', ' Female ', ' Future ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' heart disorder ', ' Cardiac Disorders ', ' Cardiac Diseases ', ' Heart Diseases ', ' Interviewer ', ' Interview ', ' Literature ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Methods ', ' Moods ', ' mortality ', ' Motivation ', ' Psychotherapy ', ' Public Health ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' recruit ', ' active recruitment ', ' Research ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Self Concept ', ' self esteem ', ' Sleep ', ' stroke ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' brain attack ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Apoplexy ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Testing ', ' Training Programs ', ' Weight Lifting ', ' Weight ', ' Measures ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' depressive ', ' depression symptom ', ' Emotional Depression ', ' depressive symptoms ', ' Blinded ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' psychiatric treatment ', ' psychiatric therapy ', ' psychiatric care ', ' Psychiatric therapeutic procedure ', ' Site ', ' Acute ', ' Clinical ', ' sedentary ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' psychological ', ' psychologic ', ' waist-to-hip ratio ', ' Waist-Hip Ratio ', ' Randomized Clinical Trials ', ' Link ', ' Masculine ', ' Individual ', ' Funding ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' Smoker ', ' Depressed mood ', ' sadness ', ' depressed ', ' programs ', ' Severities ', ' Techniques ', ' preference ', ' blood lipid ', ' experience ', ' Participant ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Self-Report ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' cardiovascular risk factor ', ' cardiovascular risk ', ' Sampling ', ' social stigma ', ' stigma ', ' strength training ', ' resistance training ', ' muscle strengthening ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' cardiovascular disorder risk ', ' cardiovascular disease risk ', ' Risk Reduction ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Address ', ' Aerobic ', ' Data ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Cognitive ', ' Pharmacological Treatment ', ' Preparation ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' years of life lost to disease ', ' years of life lost to disability ', ' disease burden ', ' burden of disease ', ' burden of illness ', ' Minority ', ' blind ', ' prospective ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' male health ', "" men's health "", ' combat ', ' primary outcome ', ' secondary outcome ', ' inflammatory marker ', ' inflammation marker ', ' efficacy testing ', ' follow up assessment ', ' cardiovascular health ', ' exercise program ', ' fitness program ', ' efficacy study ', ' ']",NINR,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY TEACHERS COLLEGE,R21,2017,212711,0.08366022054349015
"TRANSFORM DEPCARE: A Theoretical approach to improving patient engagement and shared decision making for minorities in collaborative depression care The goal of this proposal is to test whether an electronic shared decision making (eSDM) tool can increase the uptake of collaborative care (CC) for depression in primary care. Depression is projected to be the second largest contributor to chronic disease burden in the world by 2030, and contributes to disparities in quality of life and mortality. CC integrates primary and behavioral health through depression care managers who provide antidepressant adherence counseling and/or psychotherapy. CC doubles the rate of depression remission in comparison to primary care provider-led depression treatment alone, particularly in racial and ethnic minorities, and results in a 24% reduction in mortality and nearly $1300 in net annual savings per patient. Despite this model's potential to improve access to mental health, implementation efforts reveal low provider CC referral rates and low patient engagement rates of 9-50%, particularly in minority patients.  To identify factors contributing to poor patient engagement in CC, we conducted focus groups in 8 healthcare systems implementing CC, representing 33 clinics and 1 million predominantly Medicaid, minority patients. We learned that key physician-level barriers included limited time/resources to discuss treatment options and conduct “warm handoffs” to care managers; patient-level barriers included poor knowledge of treatment options, miscommunication, stigma, language barriers, and low motivation. We applied a theory- informed process of engaging stakeholders to select an acceptable, feasible intervention and determined that SDM would target the greatest number of barriers to CC engagement. SDM involves a collaborative process whereby providers and patients make health decision together, and is a proven approach for improving depression treatment initiation and guideline concordant care, particularly in minorities, but widespread use has been limited by time and resources. Accordingly, we developed and alpha tested an iPad delivered, video-assisted, interactive eSDM tool that would reduce barriers to SDM uptake and target CC engagement.  We hypothesize that a state-of-the-art eSDM tool that automates the SDM process, activates providers, staff, and patients and interfaces with the electronic health record will improve efficient CC enrollment (primary outcome). We propose to refine and adapt the eSDM prototype (Aim 1) and conduct a stepped wedge trial across 4 primary care medical homes to assess the effectiveness of implementing our eSDM tool on provider behavior (Aim 2), patient enrollment in CC (Aim 3), patient adherence to depression treatment (therapy or antidepressants) and depressive symptoms (Exploratory Aims) amongst 1440 primary care patients in our healthcare system. Our study has the potential to produce a theory-informed, scalable eSDM tool that improves the reach of CC programs and potentially other team-based approaches. Collaborative care for depression (CC), a team based approach to integrating primary and behavioral health, is effective in reducing depressive symptoms, but implementation has been hindered by suboptimal provider referral and patient engagement rates. Shared decision-making (SDM) is a promising approach for improving engagement in primary care settings but is limited by time and resources. We propose to automate the SDM process through an electronic SDM tool and to conduct a stepped wedge trial in our healthcare system (CC + SDM versus CC) to assess the effectiveness of eSDM on provider behavior and patient engagement in CC.",TRANSFORM DEPCARE: A Theoretical approach to improving patient engagement and shared decision making for minorities in collaborative depression care,9448788,R01HS025198,[''],AHRQ,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2017,337504,0.1497279454167799
"Reducing depressive symptoms among rural African Americans: REJOICE. ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Rural African Americans are disproportionately exposed to numerous stressors such as poverty, racism, and discrimination that place them at risk for experiencing elevated levels of depressive symptoms. Elevated levels of depressive symptoms can lead to a host of negative outcomes including both the development of and poor management of chronic illnesses (i.e., hypertension, diabetes, etc.), poor social functioning, poor occupational functioning, and development of clinical depression. Though effective treatments for decreasing depressive symptoms exist, rural African Americans often fail to receive adequate and timely care. African American churches have been identified as potential venues for providing depression education and treatment for rural African Americans. Within the African American rural community, churches represent a key portal through which a large proportion (as much as 85%) of the African American community can be reached. Churches have been used to address physical health outcomes in those communities but few have focused primarily on addressing mental health outcomes. Through the NIMHD-funded project entitled, ""Faith Academic Initiatives to Transform Health (FAITH) in the Delta"", our partnership, consisting of faith community leaders and UAMS researchers, culturally adapted an evidence-based behavioral activation intervention for use with rural African American churches. This 8- session behavioral activation therapy was adapted to include faith-based themes, Scripture, and other aspects of the rural African American faith culture (e.g., Bible studies, use of lay leaders o deliver the intervention). In addition to assessing the effectiveness of our intervention, ascertaining ways to implement this intervention with proper fidelity to maintain clinical outcomes is also critically important to increase the efficiency of translating research into practice. Work towards disseminating evidence-based depression interventions to ""real world"" settings is particularly salient in addressing depression disparities, whereby rural African Americans bear a disproportionate burden. Thus, this application proposes a Hybrid-2 pragmatic-effectiveness implementation trial that seeks to test the effectiveness of the culturally adapted evidence-based intervention and gather preliminary data on the strategies necessary to support successful implementation of this intervention in rural African American churches. Specifically, this study aims to: 1) Refine a culturally appropriate, evidence-based depression intervention (REJOICE) based on results from our NIMHD-funded pilot study, 2) Determine whether REJOICE is superior to a usual-care control group at post treatment and a 3-month follow-up, 3) Collect pilot data regarding ""real world"" implementation strategies (i.e. face to fac training and coaching calls) on the uptake and maintenance of REJOICE in rural African American churches. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Rural African Americans are disproportionately impacted by social stressors that place them at risk for experiencing elevated depressive symptoms. This project will test the effectiveness of a culturally adapted behavioral activation intervention (REJOICE) for use within rural African American churches. Further, this project will gather preliminary data on strategies necessary to promote the successful implementation of this intervention within rural African American churches.",Reducing depressive symptoms among rural African Americans: REJOICE.,9268663,U01MD010644,"['post treatment ', ' After-Treatment ', ' After Care ', ' Aftercare ', ' bear ', ' Ursidae ', ' Bears ', ' Ursidae Family ', ' Bible ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Communities ', ' Control Groups ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' diabetes ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Discrimination ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' Fear ', ' Fright ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' treatment access ', ' health services availability ', ' health service access ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' accessibility to health services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Access to Care ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' Hybrids ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' high blood pressure ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Hypertension ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Maintenance ', ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health Services ', ' Mental Hygiene Services ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Poverty ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Risk ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' Transportation ', ' Work ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' depressive ', ' depression symptom ', ' Emotional Depression ', ' depressive symptoms ', ' Rural Community ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' racism ', ' Training ', ' Failure ', ' African ', ' Rural ', ' Funding ', ' uptake ', ' Exposure to ', ' physical conditioning ', ' physical health ', ' Occupational ', ' Church ', ' empowered ', ' experience ', ' stressor ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' Sampling ', ' social stigma ', ' stigma ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Major Depressive Disorder ', ' major depression disorder ', ' major depression ', ' clinical depression ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' Evidence based treatment ', ' implementation trial ', ' depression outreach ', ' depression education ', ' Social Functioning ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Evidence based intervention ', ' research to practice ', ' research into practice ', ' public health relevance ', ' evidence base ', ' effective therapy ', ' effective treatment ', ' treatment as usual ', ' usual care ', ' randomized trial ', ' Randomization trial ', ' rural African American ', ' clinical development ', ' ']",NIMHD,UNIV OF ARKANSAS FOR MED SCIS,U01,2017,659544,0.05684669126187652
"Telehealth Treatments for Depression with Low-Income Homebound Seniors ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long-term objective of the proposed study is to improve access to depression treatments for low-income, racially diverse homebound seniors, a population experiencing significant disparities in mental health care due to their homebound and low-income status. Specific aims are to compare the acceptability, clinical effectiveness, treatment cost, and budget impact of the two teledelivered treatment delivery models: problem- solving therapy (PST) by licensed clinicians and self-care management (SCM) support by trained lay mental health workers/advisors. The interventionists will be integrated into an aging-service agency; hence, integrated tele-PST (IT-PST) ad integrated tele-SCM (IT-SCM). Although tele-psychotherapy is likely to be an effective mental health service delivery model for the target population, the current and projected shortage of such clinicians and the costs of deploying highly trained professionals pose barriers to this model's widespread real- world adoption and sustainability. A more plausible option may indeed have to utilize trained lay mental health workers. The study participants will be 276 low-income, racially diverse homebound seniors who are served by a home-delivered meal (HDM) program and other aging-service agencies in Austin, Tex. In a 3-arm, pragmatic clinical trial with randomization prior to consent (a preferred public health approach), the participants will receive five sessions of IT-PST, five sessions of IT-SCM, or five telephone check-in calls (for the usual care- UC-group). Our first hypothesis is that IT-PST and IT-SCM will be equally acceptable to the participants. Our second hypothesis is that both IT-PST and IT-SCM will be more effective than UC in reducing depressive symptoms, although IT-PST may be more effective than IT-SCM. Symptoms will be assessed with the 24-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD) at 12, 24, and 36 weeks after baseline. Additional outcomes will be depression-free days (DFDs) and disability (WHODAS 2.0). Our third hypothesis is that IT-SCM will have a lower delivery cost than IT-PST, but both IT-PST and IT-SCM will be more cost-effective than usual care. The analyses include (a) comparisons of delivery costs between IT-PST and IT-SCM; (b) assessment of cost- effectiveness (CEA) based on DFDs and health-related quality adjusted life-year measured by EuroQol-5 (EQ- 5D); and (3) budget impact (BIA) of IT-PST relative to IT-SCM. Both CEA and BIA will employ a hybrid public program perspective of the AoA and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid. Public health significance of this study is that the data will help aging-service providers and funders assess respective strengths and weaknesses of each model as a sustainable approach to providing depression care for an underserved and growing population group and improving their access to evidence-based mental health services. (We use the terms older adults and seniors interchangeably because the latter term is frequently used in aging services.) PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Significance This study aims to find an effective and sustainable approach to reducing disparities in accessing mental health services for an underserved and growing population group of low-income, racially diverse, homebound older adults. It will compare two aging-service integrated, tele delivered depression treatments for these seniors. One model is short-term problem-solving therapy by licensed clinicians; the second model is self-care management support by trained lay advisors.

"The Patient-Centered Medical Home: Impact on Disparities in Quality of Mental and Physical Care Objective: Mental illnesses exacerbate the disability associated with physical disorders and complicate their management, making persons with co-occurring mental illnesses such as depression particularly vulnerable to suboptimal quality of care. This intersection between psychiatric co-morbidity and chronic conditions may also be exacerbated among racial minorities. The patient-centered medical home (PCMH) model is an increasingly popular method to improve quality of care for this complex population. But while the rationale for PCMH transformation is well-documented, different patient populations may not benefit equally from this model, and the effect of PMCH on racial disparities in quality of care is unknown. The objective of this study is to investigate the effects of the PCMH model on disparities in quality of care among populations with co-morbid depression and chronic physical conditions. Methods: Using 2008-2012 Medicaid claims merged with practice-level data on NCQA-recognized PCMHs, aim 1 of this study will compare racial/ethnic disparities in quality of care for adults with depression and co- morbid physical conditions who are enrolled in a PCMH to their counterparts receiving usual primary care under Medicaid. Outcomes analyzed will include claims-based disease-specific quality measures for depression and chronic physical conditions. The analysis will control for selection into the PCMH using county rates of PCMH adoption as an instrumental variable. Aim 2 will use provider-level fixed effects and the same mental health and physical health quality indicators as aim 1 to assess variations in quality of care for Medicaid-enrolled adults receiving care in PCMHs with differing levels of NCQA recognition (levels 1, 2, or 3). Finally, aim 3 will use a person-centered treatment (PeT) effects model to understand heterogeneity of individual-level treatment effects among diverse subpopulations of PCMH enrollees, including the intersecting effects of age, gender, rurality, and number of co-morbid conditions. Contribution and Significance: This project will generate new knowledge on the potential of the PCMH to reduce racial/ethnic disparities in care and provide a more detailed understanding of which patients benefit the most from the PCMH model. The proposed research will focus on racial minorities, low-income individuals, and patients requiring complex chronic care, all populations identified by AHRQ as high-priority. The findings from this study will be useful for policymakers and health administrators considering or currently implementing the PCMH model, especially for racially diverse populations and for patients with co-morbid mental and physical illness. The patient-centered medical home (PCMH) model is being widely incentivized, especially for populations with co-morbid mental and physical chronic conditions. But while the rationale for PCMH transformation is well-documented, it is less clear whether all patient populations benefit equally from this model, and whether and how the PCMH may affect racial disparities in quality of care. This project will investigate the effects of the PCMH model on racial disparities in quality among Medicaid beneficiaries with co-morbid depression and physical conditions.",The Patient-Centered Medical Home: Impact on Disparities in Quality of Mental and Physical Care,9378961,R36HS025562,[''],AHRQ,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R36,2017,40286,0.055535835486963885
"A Systems-Level Intervention for Rural Adults with Depression Abstract This career development award seeks to prepare the candidate for a career as a mental health intervention and implementation researcher who adapts and packages evidence-based practices (EBPs) to be accessible, acceptable, and sustainable in rural communities. Rural Americans experience depression at rates similar to their urban peers; yet are significantly less likely to receive treatment. Substantial barriers, including a lack of mental health professionals, cost, travel burden, stigma and preference for informal care, contribute to this disparity. Research is necessary to adapt and implement EBPs for depression in ways that reduce known barriers, align with rural residents' help-seeking preferences, and build internal capacity to delivery EBPs within rural communities. The proposed training goals and mentored research activities will prepare the candidate to bridge the gap between research and practice by successfully adapting and implementing EPBs in usual care settings. The candidate seeks to (1) develop expertise in implementation science and research to enhance her ability to integrate EBPs into usual care settings; (2) enhance her knowledge of community-based participatory research (CPBR) methods as they relate to adapting and implementing interventions with the best chance for acceptability and sustainbility in non-mental health settings; (3) increase her knowledge and skills in intervention development, randomized controlled trial designs, and quantitative analytic techniques; and (4) build upon her clinical background to enhance her expertise with cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for depression and anxiety through focused training supporting her ability to adapt CBT while retaining core components, train and supervise non-mental health professionals delivering interventions, and assess fidelity of adapted interventions. All career development goals are infused with relevant rural-focused content. The goals will be achieved through a rigorous training plan that includes coursework at the University of Michigan's (UM) top-ranked Schools of Social Work, Public Health, and Medicine; targeted off-site training and attendance at national conferences; state-of-the-art clinical training through UM Department of Psychiatry and the Beck Institute; as well as outstanding mentorship from leaders in mental health intervention and implementation research; depression and anxiety; and cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). Training goals are further supported by mentored research activities facilitated by UM's resource rich scientific environment. The proposed research, informed by the Replicating Effective Programs framework (REP) and CBPR, seeks to (1) adapt and package group CBT for depression for implementation in the rural church setting, and conduct an open pilot test of the adapted intervention; (2) conduct a pilot randomized controlled trial (pRCT) to assess the intervention's preliminary effect on depression and explore the relationship between potential mechanisms of change and expected outcomes; and (3) explore intervention acceptability and feasibility using mixed methods to assess multiple stakeholders perceptions of the intervention and its implementation. Relevance Public Health Relevance Statement: Rural Americans have faced decades-long disparities in access to mental health treatment and are significantly less likely to receive evidence-based care compared to urban peers. The lack of infrastructure and mental health professionals in rural areas requires consideration of ways to deliver evidence-based treatment within non-mental health settings to increase accessibility, acceptability, and sustainability of needed care. Adapting and packaging evidence-based practices in a context-specific way by incorporating rural residents' perspectives and treatment preferences, reducing practical barriers such as transportation and cost, and collaborating with informal providers within the de facto mental health system, has the potential to make an large impact by increasing access to care and ultimately improving the lives of rural residents with depression.",A Systems-Level Intervention for Rural Adults with Depression,9546843,K01MH110605,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Anxiety ', '

"Reducing depressive symptoms among rural African Americans: REJOICE. ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Rural African Americans are disproportionately exposed to numerous stressors such as poverty, racism, and discrimination that place them at risk for experiencing elevated levels of depressive symptoms. Elevated levels of depressive symptoms can lead to a host of negative outcomes including both the development of and poor management of chronic illnesses (i.e., hypertension, diabetes, etc.), poor social functioning, poor occupational functioning, and development of clinical depression. Though effective treatments for decreasing depressive symptoms exist, rural African Americans often fail to receive adequate and timely care. African American churches have been identified as potential venues for providing depression education and treatment for rural African Americans. Within the African American rural community, churches represent a key portal through which a large proportion (as much as 85%) of the African American community can be reached. Churches have been used to address physical health outcomes in those communities but few have focused primarily on addressing mental health outcomes. Through the NIMHD-funded project entitled, ""Faith Academic Initiatives to Transform Health (FAITH) in the Delta"", our partnership, consisting of faith community leaders and UAMS researchers, culturally adapted an evidence-based behavioral activation intervention for use with rural African American churches. This 8- session behavioral activation therapy was adapted to include faith-based themes, Scripture, and other aspects of the rural African American faith culture (e.g., Bible studies, use of lay leaders o deliver the intervention). In addition to assessing the effectiveness of our intervention, ascertaining ways to implement this intervention with proper fidelity to maintain clinical outcomes is also critically important to increase the efficiency of translating research into practice. Work towards disseminating evidence-based depression interventions to ""real world"" settings is particularly salient in addressing depression disparities, whereby rural African Americans bear a disproportionate burden. Thus, this application proposes a Hybrid-2 pragmatic-effectiveness implementation trial that seeks to test the effectiveness of the culturally adapted evidence-based intervention and gather preliminary data on the strategies necessary to support successful implementation of this intervention in rural African American churches. Specifically, this study aims to: 1) Refine a culturally appropriate, evidence-based depression intervention (REJOICE) based on results from our NIMHD-funded pilot study, 2) Determine whether REJOICE is superior to a usual-care control group at post treatment and a 3-month follow-up, 3) Collect pilot data regarding ""real world"" implementation strategies (i.e. face to fac training and coaching calls) on the uptake and maintenance of REJOICE in rural African American churches. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Rural African Americans are disproportionately impacted by social stressors that place them at risk for experiencing elevated depressive symptoms. This project will test the effectiveness of a culturally adapted behavioral activation intervention (REJOICE) for use within rural African American churches. Further, this project will gather preliminary data on strategies necessary to promote the successful implementation of this intervention within rural African American churches.",Reducing depressive symptoms among rural African Americans: REJOICE.,9413927,U01MD010644,"['Aftercare ', ' post treatment ', ' After-Treatment ', ' After Care ', ' Ursidae Family ', ' bear ', ' Ursidae ', ' Bears ', ' Bible ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Communities ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Face ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Fright ', ' Fear ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' treatment access ', ' health services availability ', ' health service access ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' accessibility to health services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Access to Care ', ' Hybrids ', ' Hypertension ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' high blood pressure ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Maintenance ', ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health Services ', ' Mental Hygiene Services ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Poverty ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Risk ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' Transportation ', ' Work ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' depressive symptoms ', ' depressive ', ' depression symptom ', ' Emotional Depression ', ' Rural Community ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' racism ', ' Training ', ' Failure ', ' African ', ' Rural ', ' Funding ', ' uptake ', ' Exposure to ', ' physical conditioning ', ' physical health ', ' Occupational ', ' Church ', ' empowered ', ' experience ', ' stressor ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' Sampling ', ' social stigma ', ' stigma ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Major Depressive Disorder ', ' major depression disorder ', ' major depression ', ' clinical depression ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' Evidence based treatment ', ' implementation trial ', ' depression outreach ', ' depression education ', ' Social Functioning ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Evidence based intervention ', ' research into practice ', ' research to practice ', ' public health relevance ', ' evidence base ', ' effective treatment ', ' effective therapy ', ' Randomization trial ', ' randomized trial ', ' rural African American ', ' clinical development ', ' implementation strategy ', ' usual care control group ', ' usual care arm ', ' ']",NIMHD,UNIV OF ARKANSAS FOR MED SCIS,U01,2018,718543,0.05684669126187652
"Responsive eHealth Intervention for Perinatal Depression in Healthcare Settings PROJECT SUMMARY Perinatal depression (experienced by at least 14-20% of pregnant and postpartum women) is recognized as the most common complication of childbirth and as having extremely serious consequences, including significant suffering for pregnant women/new mothers and their families, and adverse impacts on infant development. Unfortunately, there are many barriers that make it difficult for women with perinatal depression to access clinic-based mental health treatments, and participation is low. Treatment uptake is limited by psychological barriers (stigma, feelings of failure, and embarrassment); knowledge barriers (poor understanding about impact of perinatal depression on infant health, uncertainty about where to get treatment); infrastructure barriers (fear of negative judgment from care providers, avoidance of prescription medications while breastfeeding); physical barriers in rural settings (too few care providers, unacceptable logistical demands on time, transportation, and childcare); and provider-level barriers (inadequate skills, fear of liability, dearth of treatment options, and inadequate reimbursement). To address this need, we obtained NIMH funding (R01MH084931) to develop and test the MomMoodBooster program (MMB), an innovative Web-based program for treating postpartum depression (PPD). Based on cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and incorporating multimedia modeling and engaging activities, MMB is designed to enable women to identify patterns in their thoughts and behaviors and to develop a personal action plan to make helpful changes. MMB also has an administrative website designed for use by both project managers and supportive phone coaches to monitor the overall progress of participants. In our SBIR Phase I grant (R43MH109191), we began a redesign of MMB so that it could be used more effectively as a product for delivering PPD treatment by practical healthcare delivery organizations. Specifically, we enhanced the underlying database architecture (and the related administration website interface) to make it easier for multiple organizations in multiple settings to use MMB. In our proposed SBIR Phase II, we propose to complete the process of making a commercial-ready product (MMB 2.0) that fits the workflow and staffing of healthcare organizations. Specifically, we propose to finish the enhancement of the database architecture and its administrative site, to expand MMB to include prenatal as well as postpartum depressed women, and to deliver MMB using a new responsive design technology so that women will be able to use it interchangeably with any internet-accessible computer device (desktop, laptop, tablet, smartphone). Finally, we plan to use a 2-arm randomized controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy of MMB 2.0 compared to treatment as usual in a large healthcare setting.

"Social Media Use and Depression Outcomes among U.S. Lesbian, Gay, and Bisexual Young Adults PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT The overarching goal of this Pathway to Independence Award is to facilitate the development of César G. Escobar-Viera, PhD, MD, MPH, into an independent researcher, with expertise in advanced quantitative and qualitative methods to determine the role of social media on depression among lesbian, gay, and bisexual U.S. young adults (LGBYA). Ultimately, the PI seeks to leverage evidence-based SM interventions to ameliorate depression among LGBYA, which will ultimately help to reduce mental health disparities for this group. This long-term goal will be achieved via a 5-year training and research plan that will launch Dr. Escobar-Viera’s independent program of research and academic career. The career objectives of this award are to: (1) become an expert in the field of social media research applied to depression; (2) advance the PI’s knowledge in LGBT mental health disparities; and (3) gain expertise in the application of advanced quantitative and qualitative methodologies. These career objectives will be achieved via formal coursework, trainings, seminars, national conferences, mentorship, and research experience. The knowledge derived from this training plan will prepare Dr. Escobar-Viera to pursue the following aims. In the first aim, pre-existing survey data from a nationally- representative sample of young adults will be leveraged to explore cross-sectional associations between SMU and depression among LGBYA. During the second aim, qualitative assessments about SMU and depression among LGBYA. The influence of SMU on depression will be explored by inquiring about what type of use is helpful and generates social support and which use result in negative feelings and experiences (e.g., discrimination). Finally, the third aim will consist of a longitudinal examination of the associations between SMU and depression among LGBYA. Results of this aim will inform the PI’s next step of developing an SM-based intervention for LGBYA at risk for depression, mitigating identified risk factors while enhancing protective ones. Feasibility and efficacy of the intervention will be then tested via a series of R21 and R01 projects during Dr. Escobar-Viera’s independent research career. An outstanding team of experts in LGBT research, qualitative research, longitudinal analyses, survey research, and mobile and social media interventions will provide mentorship to ensure the success of this project. Brian Primack, MD, PhD, will serve as the primary mentor. Dr. Primack leveraged his own K07 into multiple R01 and R21 awards. Co-mentorship will be provided by Michael Marshal, PhD and Ron Stall, PhD. Moreover, Galen Switzer, PhD and Sherry Pagoto, PhD will serve as consultants. This study proposes to lay a theoretical foundation needed to develop evidence-based social media interventions to improve mental health outcomes among sexual minorities. In addition, it will contribute to developing a model to study the influence of social media on health disparities among other minority groups. This award will forge the PI’s pathway to independence by laying a foundation for a career in social media interventions to reduce depression among LGBYA, thus decreasing health disparities for this population. PROJECT NARRATIVE Compared with their heterosexual counterparts, lesbian, gay, and bisexual young adults (LGBYA) consistently experience higher rates of depression, which is the leading cause of disability worldwide, with a burden of $200 billion per year in the U.S. alone. Given that it is now part of the fabric LGBYA use to build and maintain social networks, it is crucial to grasp the impact SM might have on mental health, in this population. The proposed research will use an innovative version of the Minority Stress Model to understand the extent and under which circumstances characteristics of social media use might become either a risk or protective factor for depression among LGBYA.","Social Media Use and Depression Outcomes among U.S. Lesbian, Gay, and Bisexual Young Adults",9582850,K99MD012813,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Award ', ' Data Analyses ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Elements ', ' Environment ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Foundations ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methodology ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Motivation ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Support ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Social Characteristics ', ' Social support ', ' social support network ', ' Stereotyping ', ' Stress ', ' Suicide ', ' suicidality ', ' intent to die ', ' fatal suicide ', ' fatal attempt ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Testing ', ' Textiles ', ' fabric ', ' Thinking ', ' thoughts ', ' Time ', ' Translations ', ' Work ', ' Friends ', ' Gender ', ' symposium ', ' symposia ', ' summit ', ' convention ', ' conference ', ' depressive symptoms ', ' depressive ', ' depression symptom ', ' Emotional Depression ', ' Longitudinal Surveys ', ' Social Network ', ' base ', ' Bi-sexual ', ' Bisexual ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Phase ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Series ', ' Ensure ', ' Grips ', ' grasp ', ' Training ', ' disability ', ' young adulthood ', ' adult youth ', ' young adult ', ' Sample Size ', ' Gays ', ' Lesbian ', ' Collaborations ', ' Expressed Emotion ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' bullying ', ' bully ', ' Well in self ', ' sense of wellbeing ', ' self wellness ', ' psychological wellness ', ' psychological wellbeing ', ' mental wellbeing ', ' mental well-being ', ' emotional wellbeing ', ' Sense of well-being ', ' Psychological Well Being ', ' Normal psyche ', ' Normal mental state ', ' Normal mental condition ', ' Feels well ', ' Emotional well being ', ' Hour ', ' Pattern ', ' Marshal ', ' Equation ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' Participant ', ' General Population ', ' General Public ', ' social ', ' Emotional ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' career development ', ' theories ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Qualitative Research ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Address ', ' Qualitative Methods ', ' qualitative reasoning ', ' Data ', ' Doctor of Philosophy ', ' PhD ', ' Ph.D. ', ' Effectiveness of Interventions ', ' Media Intervention ', ' Communication Tools ', ' R21 Award ', ' Exploratory/Developmental Grant for Diagnostic Cancer Imaging ', ' Characteristics ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' feelings ', ' Feeling ', ' Heterosexuals ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' time use ', ' Minority ', ' therapy efficacy ', ' therapeutically effective ', ' therapeutic efficacy ', ' intervention efficacy ', ' Treatment Efficacy ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' treatment development ', ' intervention development ', ' develop therapy ', ' therapy development ', ' evidence base ', ' longitudinal analysis ', ' sexual minority ', ' LGBT ', ' Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender ', ' lesbian, gay, bisexual ', ' social media ', ' recruit ', ' protective factors ', ' ']",NIMHD,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,K99,2018,137542,0.13286733542515358
"Gender, Racial, and Ethnic Disparities in Mental Health, Substance Use Disorders, and Behavioral Health Treatment Utilization in US Parolees and Probationers within 12 Months Post-Release ABSTRACT Background: Rates of depression in US parolees and probationers range from 9-40%, and depression is the most commonly co-occurring MH disorder in those with substance use disorders (SUDs). Depression and psychological distress (PD) are barriers to community re-integration, and contribute to risk taking behaviors, substance use relapse, and recidivism. However, rehabilitative reentry efforts typically focus on substance use treatment alone, resulting in unmet mental health (MH) treatment needs. About 40% of all US ex-offenders recidivate within one year, and correctional spending is individual state's second largest expenditure after Medicaid. Isolated studies indicate differences in depression rates among US parolees and probationers by gender, race, and ethnicity, but national estimates are limited. Methods: The proposed study recognizes the influence of social determinants of health and intersectionality of gender, race, and ethnicity on behavioral health (BH) outcomes and treatment disparities. A secondary analysis of cross-sectional data from the 2014 National Survey on Drug Use and Health, guided by a modified version of Meleis' Transitions Theory adapted to the BH needs of US parolees and probationers, will be used to understand the BH needs and barriers to BH treatment utilization by gender, race, and ethnicity, in a group of US parolees and probationers relative to a group of non-parolees and non-probationers. The specific aims of this study are to: Aim 1: Compare the prevalence of depression, PD, and/or SUD in the parolee and probationer group relative to the reference group, and determine whether these BH outcomes are related to gender, race, ethnicity, and their interactions with group. Aim 2: Compare BH treatment utilization in the parolee and probationer group relative to the reference group, and determine whether BH treatment utilization is related to BH (depression, PD, and/or SUD) and individual (gender, race, and ethnicity) characteristics, awareness of BH needs, and their interactions with group. Aim 3: Compare barriers to BH treatment utilization in the parolee and probationer group relative to the reference group, and determine which BH treatment utilization barriers are related to BH (depression, PD, and/or SUD) and individual (gender, race, and ethnicity) characteristics and their interactions with group. Significance: An understanding of the gender, racial, and ethnic disparities in BH among US parolees and probationers is integral to informing a population-based health approach that allows for strategic resource planning, and service design for the dual-integrative treatment of co-occurring MH and SUDs. This will inform targeted and tailored interventions, and improve equity in access and treatment for BH disorders among the numerous health disparity populations disproportionately represented among US parolees and probationers. Knowledge of gender, racial, and ethnic disparities in depression, psychological distress, and substance use disorders in US parolees and probationers will inform improved behavioral health interventions that promote successful community re-integration and improved public health.","Gender, Racial, and Ethnic Disparities in Mental Health, Substance Use Disorders, and Behavioral Health Treatment Utilization in US Parolees and Probationers within 12 Months Post-Release",9573240,F31MD012443,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Affect ', ' Awareness ', ' Behavior ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' behavior intervention ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Mental disorders ', ' psychological disorder ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Communities ', ' Continuity of Patient Care ', ' Continuum of Care ', ' Continuity of Care ', ' Cross-Sectional Studies ', ' Disease Frequency Surveys ', ' Cross-Sectional Survey ', ' Cross-Sectional Analyses ', ' Cross Sectional Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Expenditure ', ' Female ', ' Foundations ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Justice ', ' Medicaid ', ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Methods ', ' Prisons ', ' Public Health ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Rehabilitation therapy ', ' rehabilitative ', ' Rehabilitation ', ' Medical Rehabilitation ', ' Relapse ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk-Taking ', ' Substance Use Disorder ', ' Supervision ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Time ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', ' Treatment outcome ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Hispanics ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' incarceration ', ' incarcerated ', ' Imprisonment ', ' Specified ', ' Specific qualifier value ', ' using substances ', ' substance using ', ' substance use ', ' AOD use ', ' Alcohol or Other Drugs use ', ' Individual ', ' Measurement ', ' drug use ', ' Drug usage ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Knowledge ', ' Well in self ', ' sense of wellbeing ', ' self wellness ', ' psychological wellness ', ' psychological wellbeing ', ' mental wellbeing ', ' mental well-being ', ' emotional wellbeing ', ' Sense of well-being ', ' Psychological Well Being ', ' Normal psyche ', ' Normal mental state ', ' Normal mental condition ', ' Feels well ', ' Emotional well being ', ' Services ', ' experience ', ' recidivism ', ' parolee ', ' probation ', ' offender ', ' criminal offender ', ' Reporting ', ' parole ', ' psychological distress ', ' Emotional ', ' Sampling ', ' behavioral health ', ' theories ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' DSM-V ', ' Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-V ', ' Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th edition ', ' DSM5 ', ' DSM-5 ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Address ', ' Jail ', ' Data ', ' Characteristics ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' probationer ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' postdoctoral training ', ' post-doctoral training ', ' ethnic minority ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' population based ', ' health equity ', ' social health determinants ', ' Healthy People 2020 ', ' screening ', ' behavioral health intervention ', ' racial minority ', ' disparities in treatment ', ' treatment disparity ', ' gender disparity ', ' intersectionality ', ' secondary analysis ', ' treatment services ', ' Integrative Treatment ', ' Integrative Therapy ', ' ']",NIMHD,DUKE UNIVERSITY,F31,2018,35848,0.02190814944311879
"TRANSFORM DEPCARE: A Theoretical approach to improving patient engagement and shared decision making for minorities in collaborative depression care The goal of this proposal is to test whether an electronic shared decision making (eSDM) tool can increase the uptake of collaborative care (CC) for depression in primary care. Depression is projected to be the second largest contributor to chronic disease burden in the world by 2030, and contributes to disparities in quality of life and mortality. CC integrates primary and behavioral health through depression care managers who provide antidepressant adherence counseling and/or psychotherapy. CC doubles the rate of depression remission in comparison to primary care provider-led depression treatment alone, particularly in racial and ethnic minorities, and results in a 24% reduction in mortality and nearly $1300 in net annual savings per patient. Despite this model's potential to improve access to mental health, implementation efforts reveal low provider CC referral rates and low patient engagement rates of 9-50%, particularly in minority patients.  To identify factors contributing to poor patient engagement in CC, we conducted focus groups in 8 healthcare systems implementing CC, representing 33 clinics and 1 million predominantly Medicaid, minority patients. We learned that key physician-level barriers included limited time/resources to discuss treatment options and conduct “warm handoffs” to care managers; patient-level barriers included poor knowledge of treatment options, miscommunication, stigma, language barriers, and low motivation. We applied a theory- informed process of engaging stakeholders to select an acceptable, feasible intervention and determined that SDM would target the greatest number of barriers to CC engagement. SDM involves a collaborative process whereby providers and patients make health decision together, and is a proven approach for improving depression treatment initiation and guideline concordant care, particularly in minorities, but widespread use has been limited by time and resources. Accordingly, we developed and alpha tested an iPad delivered, video-assisted, interactive eSDM tool that would reduce barriers to SDM uptake and target CC engagement.  We hypothesize that a state-of-the-art eSDM tool that automates the SDM process, activates providers, staff, and patients and interfaces with the electronic health record will improve efficient CC enrollment (primary outcome). We propose to refine and adapt the eSDM prototype (Aim 1) and conduct a stepped wedge trial across 4 primary care medical homes to assess the effectiveness of implementing our eSDM tool on provider behavior (Aim 2), patient enrollment in CC (Aim 3), patient adherence to depression treatment (therapy or antidepressants) and depressive symptoms (Exploratory Aims) amongst 1440 primary care patients in our healthcare system. Our study has the potential to produce a theory-informed, scalable eSDM tool that improves the reach of CC programs and potentially other team-based approaches. Collaborative care for depression (CC), a team based approach to integrating primary and behavioral health, is effective in reducing depressive symptoms, but implementation has been hindered by suboptimal provider referral and patient engagement rates. Shared decision-making (SDM) is a promising approach for improving engagement in primary care settings but is limited by time and resources. We propose to automate the SDM process through an electronic SDM tool and to conduct a stepped wedge trial in our healthcare system (CC + SDM versus CC) to assess the effectiveness of eSDM on provider behavior and patient engagement in CC.",TRANSFORM DEPCARE: A Theoretical approach to improving patient engagement and shared decision making for minorities in collaborative depression care,9569610,R01HS025198,[''],AHRQ,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2018,343666,0.1497279454167799
"Genes, Education, and Gene-Education Interactions in Obesity and Mental Health PROJECT SUMMARY  Tackling obesity and depression is vital for population health, not least because they are associated with diabetes, heart disease, strokes, and suicide, which in turn led to the decrease in US life expectancy in 2015. One policy advocated by Healthy People 2020 to reduce obesity and depression is increasing educational attainment, as it is viewed as a fundamental cause of health disparities. As obesity and depression also have strong genetic bases, it is possible that education additionally improves population health by moderating the underlying genetic risk of being obese/depressed through gene-environment (GxE) interactions. GxE interactions occur when the effect of genetic risk varies across the environment. The influence of genetic predisposition towards the likelihood of being obese may differ by educational attainment. A college graduate with a high genetic risk of being obese may never be obese because education is associated with higher income affording the individual to eat healthier and having peers who are conscious about leading a healthy lifestyle. In contrast, a high school dropout with a high genetic risk is more likely to be obese because he/she has a low income, is more likely to consume fast food, and interacts with peers who are obese. The proposed project will apply econometric methods, instrumental variables and within-sibling comparisons, that use quasi-experimental variation in educational attainment to increase our understanding of causal relations of education, genes, and GxE interactions on obesity and depression. The use of quasi-experimental variation will, under certain assumptions, produce estimates that are not confounded by (i) the influence of unobserved factors that are correlated with education and health, (ii) reverse causality, (iii) gene-environment correlations, and (iv) population stratification, and these estimates can therefore be given a causal interpretation conditional on these assumptions. The specific aims are to estimate main effects of education, genetic risk, and GxE interactions on obesity and depression using (i) the Easter School Leaving Rule as a natural experiment in the UK and data from the UK Biobank, (ii) local factors in the individual’s county of residence near secondary school completion age (college availability, education expenditures, unemployment rate) as instruments for education in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey and the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health) datasets, and (iii) the sibling fixed-effects approach in the Add Health dataset. Overall, the project will provide a comprehensive array of results and new insights as we compare results from different methods, datasets, across different educational levels, and by gender. This application is in direct response to NIH PAR- 16-080 “Education and Health: New Frontiers.” PROJECT NARRATIVE  The proposed research is relevant to public health because obesity and depression are major public health problems in the US. Both conditions have significant individual and societal costs. They are associated with other adverse health outcomes and behaviors such as diabetes, heart disease, strokes, and suicide, which in turn led to the decrease in US life expectancy in 2015. This research will make important contributions to our understanding of the relations between education and obesity, and depression, and how heterogeneities reflected in gene-environmental interactions shape those relations.","Genes, Education, and Gene-Education Interactions in Obesity and Mental Health",9425781,R01HD094011,"['Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Behavior ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Educational Status ', ' training status ', ' training level ', ' training achievement ', ' educational level ', ' Educational Achievement ', ' Environment ', ' Expenditure ', ' Family ', ' Genes ', ' Government ', ' Health ', ' Heart Diseases ', ' heart disorder ', ' Cardiac Disorders ', ' Cardiac Diseases ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Income ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Life Expectancy ', ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Methods ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' Obesity ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Population Control ', ' Probability ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Schools ', ' Secondary Schools ', ' secondary education ', ' Siblings ', ' Stroke ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' brain attack ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Apoplexy ', ' Student Dropouts ', ' School Dropouts ', ' Suicide ', ' suicidality ', ' intent to die ', ' fatal suicide ', ' fatal attempt ', ' Unemployment ', ' unemployed ', ' out of work ', ' joblessness ', ' jobless ', ' County ', ' Gender ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' insight ', ' Consciousness ', ' Conscious ', ' residential site ', ' residence ', ' Individual ', ' Policies ', ' Genetic ', ' Genetic Predisposition to Disease ', ' genetically predisposed ', ' genetic vulnerability ', ' genetic mechanism of disease ', ' genetic etiology ', ' Inherited Susceptibility ', ' Inherited Predisposition ', ' Genetic Susceptibility ', ' Genetic Predisposition ', ' Exposure to ', ' Shapes ', ' Depressed mood ', ' sadness ', ' depressed ', ' fast food ', ' convenience food ', ' instrument ', ' National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey ', ' NHANES ', ' Educational Background ', ' Education Level ', ' Adopted ', ' college ', ' collegiate ', ' preference ', ' gene environment interaction ', ' environment effect on gene ', ' GxE interaction ', ' Gene x Environment Interaction ', ' high school ', ' cohort ', ' peer ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Major Depressive Disorder ', ' major depression disorder ', ' major depression ', ' clinical depression ', ' Etiology ', ' disease causation ', ' causation ', ' Causality ', ' Low income ', ' Advocate ', ' Data ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Genetic Risk ', ' Outcome ', ' frontier ', ' aged ', ' Natural experiment ', ' biorepository ', ' biobank ', ' population health ', ' Healthy People 2020 ', ' healthy lifestyle ', ' adolescent health ', ' Healthy Eating ', ' population stratification ', ' National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health ', ' Add Health ', ' National Longitudinal Survey of Adolescent to Adult Health ', ' societal costs ', ' ']",NICHD,CENTRAL MICHIGAN UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,336633,0.0644829036274226
"Optimizing Diabetes Care Quality for Low-Income Patients This K23 award will establish the candidate, Dr. Elizabeth Rogers, as an independent physician-investigator with expertise in development, implementation, and evaluation of patient-centered primary care interventions that are strategically designed to address patient complexity – both medical and social – to optimize care for low-income patients with multiple chronic diseases. Most of the 29.1 million Americans with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) have at least one additional chronic condition, but existing management guidelines fail to account for patient complexity. Despite evidence of effective clinic-based interventions, diabetes care quality remains low, particularly in safety net settings serving patients with low incomes, who are disproportionately racial and ethnic minorities, and who carry a larger burden of chronic disease. Until patient complexity factors are meaningfully addressed with specific, pragmatic interventions, patients with comorbid T2DM will remain at risk for poor-quality care. To address this critical need, Dr. Rogers's K23 project will identify key clinic and patient influences on care quality by using a “cumulative complexity model” as a framework. This model focuses on patients' experiences of (1) “workload” (disease-specific work such as attending appointments and self-care, plus “life” demands such as job, family, and transportation) and (2) “capacity” (e.g. fatigue and physical symptoms, plus factors such as literacy, finances, and social support). The project will be conducted in urban Minnesota clinics that are certified Patient-Centered Medical Homes and part of the Hennepin County Medical Center's safety net care system. After stratifying clinics by diabetes care quality, researchers will administer clinician and staff surveys in 3 high- and 3 low-scoring clinics to identify clinic resources associated with optimal diabetes care quality (Aim 1). They will conduct surveys and in-depth interviews with “at-risk” patients from these sites to discern their perspectives on social vulnerabilities that impede their engagement in care and specific clinic resources that are helpful in overcoming these obstacles (Aim 2). They will apply these results using the multiphase optimization strategy (MOST, used to design effective and efficient interventions) to develop and pilot test a clinic-based, multi-component behavioral intervention – one engineered to reduce patient workload, augment patient capacity, and thereby optimize patient-centered care for complex patients with T2DM and depression (Aim 3). A robust training plan, closely aligned with the research plan, will support the development of Dr. Rogers's expertise in patient-centered outcomes research, mixed methodology, and clinic-based intervention development and evaluation. She will be supported by a multidisciplinary team of mentors with expertise in these areas as well as in diabetes, depression, and multimorbidity, and with strong links to community stakeholders. This proposal addresses NIDDK priorities by positioning Dr. Rogers to advance patient-centeredness and improve care quality for patients at risk of experiencing low quality of care, and to test practical and sustainable strategies for improving care delivery and health outcomes in diabetes. PROJECT NARRATIVE Managing diabetes along with co-occurring chronic conditions is a common problem for low-income patients, many of whom also experience social vulnerabilities. Improving the quality of diabetes care in the clinics serving this patient population requires both clinic- and patient-level initiatives.

"Parental Depression and the Early Origins of Disease Across Three Generations. PROJECT SUMMARY Over 15 million children in the United States live with a depressed parent. Parental depression has been associated with negative social, emotional, and behavioral outcomes for children across development, but little is known about the possible physical health consequences for youth following exposure to parental depression. Further, existing research often relies on retrospective reports of parental mental health and typically includes only one assessment of parents' symptoms. Parental depression is not a static event, however, and these studies fail to capture the fluctuations in symptoms often observed in parents with depression. The proposed research capitalizes on an ongoing longitudinal study of 391 African American parents (Generation 1 [G1]) and their children (Generation 2 [G2]) starting when children were 11 years of age and continuing to age 25. These youth have faced challenging social and economic environments across development, and their parents similarly have faced wide-ranging stressors that increased their risk for depressive symptoms. The availability of this well characterized sample of rural African American families presents a unique opportunity to investigate the ways in which parental depression over a 10-year period across childhood and adolescence predicts youths' risk for precursors to chronic diseases of aging (CDAs; inflammation, metabolic syndrome) in early adulthood. Further, approximately half of the G2 youth now have children (Generation 3 [G3]) of their own, who to date have not been involved in the ongoing study. We propose to collect pilot data with this new generation of offspring. This data collection will allow us to start investigating the possibility that parental depression in one generation could influence development in subsequent generations, even when environmental influences change over time. We propose to examine how G1 parental depression trajectories predict G2 offspring depression and CDA precursors in early adulthood (Aim 1). Then, we will examine potential mediators (e.g., family environments) and moderators (e.g., offspring self-control, external supports) that may alter the degree to which fluctuations in parental depression trajectories are associated with G2 CDA precursors (Aim 2). Finally, we will collect pilot data on 60 G3 offspring to examine the ways in which social determinants of health are transmitted across generations (Aim 3). This pilot project will serve as an exploratory investigation to aid in planning for a larger study of the intergenerational transmission of health disparities. This proposal tests questions surrounding the possibility that parental depression and unsupportive family environments could influence children's development across generations. Findings from this proposal could be used to inform interventions designed to improve children's well being and to identify naturally occurring factors that could protect youth from adverse outcomes. PROJECT NARRATIVE Exposure to parental depression is a consistent risk factor for poor social and emotional functioning for children across development, but little is known about (a) its effects on youths' physical health or (b) the extent to which these risks are transmitted across generations. This proposal seeks to investigate how variability in level and chronicity of parental depression across a 10-year period is associated with offspring health across generations and whether risk and protective factors can modulate the extent to which exposure to parental depression confers risk to offspring.

"Engaging self-regulation targets to understand the mechanisms of behavior change and improve mood and weight outcomes ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Background: Obesity affects 36% of US women and men and increases lifetime risk for diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Similarly, depression affects 20% of US women and 13% of men and is the leading cause of disability worldwide. Further, the 2 disorders have a bidirectional positive relationship. Proven behavioral interventions to treat obesity and depression exist; however, the underlying biological mechanisms remain unknown. This lack of understanding significantly hampers efforts to optimize the effectiveness of behavioral interventions and limits their dissemination and implementation into widespread practice to curtail the adverse consequences of obesity and depression and promote population health. Rapid advances in human neuroscience and behavioral science and integration of the two could provide unique opportunity to fill this gap. Objective: Leveraging a recently funded 2-year randomized controlled trial (""RAINBOW"" target n=404; PI Dr. Jun Ma) of a first-ever integrated treatment for comorbid obesity and depression in primary care that uniquely combines 2 nationally recognized behavioral interventions, we propose a 2-phased project to identify, validate and refine a set of assays to measure self-regulation targets; and to engage these targets to optimize behavioral treatment of obesity and depression. Specific Aims: In the UH2 phase, we will (1) Conduct secondary data analysis and hold workshops and a symposium to finalize selection of self-regulation targets and assays for testing; (2) Leverage the RAINBOW intervention to engage identified targets; and (3) Verify target engagement across multiple domains (neural, physiological, behavioral, psychological), settings (laboratory, virtual, and naturalistic), and time points (0, 4 weeks, 6, 12 and 24 months) Transitional milestones are to (1) Establish assay(s) that reliably and accurately measure the identified targets; (2) Demonstrate malleability of the self-regulation target(s) in response to th RAINBOW integrated treatment; and (3) Identify self-regulation profile(s) that predict treatment response in health behaviors (medical regimen adherence, physical activity, diet) and outcomes (weight, depression). In the UH3 phase, we will conduct a pilot randomized controlled trial in which an additional 100 obese and depressed adults will be randomized to intervention or wait-list control and assessed at baseline, 4 weeks and 6 months. Intervention subjects will receive the first 4 weeks of the RAINBOW intervention, followed by target-guided tailoring of the intervention components in order to optimize target engagement and enhance behavioral change based on their individual self-regulation profile during the first 4 weeks. We will use the insights from intervention subjects to then further refine the tailoring strategies for the waitlis subjects. Implications: This research will provide a toolkit of well-validated assays of self-regulation targets important for health behavior change, as well as target- guided personalization of intervention strategies, in the treatment of comorbid obesity and depression. Impact: Given the widespread relevance of these disorders and the targeted health behaviors, this research will be a prototype for treating multiple chronic conditions with profound potential impacts on population health. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: In this project we propose to understand self-regulation processes and mechanisms underlying evidence- based behavioral interventions for the treatment of obesity and depression, 2 of the top contributors to the burden of disease and disability in the US and globally. The project synergistically integrates human neuroscience and behavioral science to identify which self-regulation targets are engaged by the intervention among which subgroups of the population and how we can harness these target mechanisms to promote greater health behavior change, better weight management and improved mood. In a series of 3 interrelated studies we will identify, validate and refine a set of assays to measure self-regulation targets; and to engage these targets to optimize behavioral treatment of coexisting obesity and depression among adults. Given the widespread relevance of these disorders and the targeted health behaviors (adherence to self-tracking and medications, physical activity, diet), this research will be a prototype for understanding and optimizing behavioral interventions for multiple chronic conditions, with profound potential impacts on population health.",Engaging self-regulation targets to understand the

"Sleep to Reduce Incident Depression Effectively (STRIDE) Abstract  Prevention of major depressive disorder (MDD) is a public health priority, and is in critical need of innovative strategies that preemptively identify those at-risk in order to enable early intervention. A recent meta-analysis of over 20 longitudinal studies found the risk for incident depression among individuals with insomnia disorder is nearly three times that for normal sleepers, thus making insomnia a potential point of entry for depression prevention.  Identification and treatment of insomnia typically occurs in primary care, and is commonly treated with hypnotic medications; however, hypnotics have significant limitations, including increased risk for residual impairment, falls in the elderly, and abuse. Cognitive behavioral treatment of insomnia (CBT-I) has been recommended as a first line approach with demonstrated efficacy that is sustained beyond initial therapeutic intervention. However, effective and widespread implementation of CBT-I is severely limited by the national shortage of trained practitioners in clinical practice. A stepped care approach rooted in primary care holds potential for innovative accessibility and delivery of CBT-I, improving insomnia therapeutics, and reducing rates of MDD by targeting a robust yet modifiable risk factor in insomnia. Our proposed stepped care model uses digital cognitive behavioral therapy (dCBT-I) as an accessible, least-restrictive, first line intervention that reduces specialist time and resources, and adds clinician based face-to-face CBT-I only for refractory patients who need a more personalized, flexible, and durable therapist driven approach.  We propose a large-scale clinical trial in the primary care setting that utilizes a stepped care model (SMART design) to determine the effectiveness of dCBT-I alone and in combination with face-to-face CBT-I for insomnia, and the effects of these sleep interventions on the prevention of MDD. An important innovative component of the trial is the 1 and 2-year follow-up assessments to determine the durability of effectiveness over time and assess the impact on depression incidence and relapse. Early risk-detection and prevention is especially critical in those at elevated risk for depression to reduce health disparities. Thus, individuals with significant vulnerability to MDD, such as high sleep-reactivity, low socioeconomic status, and racial minorities will be included in significant numbers to test for potential moderation of treatment effects stratified by risk.  Finally, improving sleep through insomnia treatment may reduce nocturnal rumination, which may mitigate progression toward MDD. As such, we will determine whether changes in nocturnal rumination (i.e., target), a modifiable risk-factor, mediates the effects of CBT-I and dCBT-I on MDD incidence and relapse.  This project will test a highly scalable model of sleep care in a large primary care system to determine the potential for wide dissemination to address the high volume of population need for safe and effective insomnia treatment and associated prevention of depression. Project Narrative Sleep To Reduce Incident Depression Effectively (STRIDE) is a proposed large-scale clinical trial that will take place in primary care utilizing a stepped-care model to determine the effectiveness of digital cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (dCBT-I) alone or in combination with face-to-face CBT-I and the effects of these sleep interventions for the prevention of depression in vulnerable populations (elevated sleep reactivity, minority, low income).

"An adaptive treatment intervention for depression and engagement in HIV care among Latinos living with HIV 6. PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT This K01 Mentored Research Scientist Development Award will support the training of the Principal Investigator and the conduct of original research in the area of mobile health, sequential multiple assignment randomized trial designs (SMART), and implementation science. The goal of the training and research will be to treat problems with depression in sample of Latinos living with HIV. The overall goal of this K01 is to use a SMART to build an adaptive treatment strategy (ATS) that has a mobile health tool to improve adherence to the treatments for depression that are being proposed, and then evaluate the SMART and ATS through an implementation science model. The treatments being tested are a behavioral activation therapy (BAT), a cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), and mobile health (mHealth) tool (i.e., text-messaging protocol). The outcomes are to assess the feasibility of the SMART and ATS in the HIV care site and acceptability of the SMART and ATS to patients and clinic staff. To achieve the overall goal, three specific aims are outlined. Aim 1 uses qualitative research methods for the conduct of focus groups and individual interviews with HIV+ Latinos in both English and Spanish. The goal of Aim 1 is to tailor the intervention to the cultural and linguistic needs of Latinos and the organization needs of the HIV clinic study site, which informs Aim 2. Aim 1 is guided by the CDCs Map of Adaptation tailoring framework, which consist of three Action Steps. Action Step 1-3 are to better understand and document: 1) expressions for depression in Spanish and barriers to care, 2) language issues in detecting and reporting depressive symptoms, 3) cultural perspectives of how depression presents as a barrier to care, and 4) attitudes (i.e., cognitive and emotional evaluations) toward BAT and CBT, and text- message preference and confidentiality concerns to promote adherence to the intervention activities. Aim 2 is to build and test a pilot SMART. An ATS is a set of decision rules that uses detectable changes in patient health status to inform the next course of treatment. Aim 3 is to determine an adoption, implementation, and sustainability plan for adaptive depression treatment strategies into HIV care settings. Aim 3 is guided by the Capability, Opportunity, and Motivation System (COM-B) system and related Behavioral Change Wheel. This K01 attempts to maximize the clinical benefit of the BAT, CBT and mHealth programs by personalizing them to the patient. Successful completion of the proposed study will yield pilot data on the feasibility and acceptability of an ATS for depression integrated into HIV primary care, which will support the submission of an R01 full- scale efficacy trial. The results of this K01 can lead to future studies to personalize treatment interventions to enhance engagement with HIV care and mental health care for vulnerable populations. 7. PROJECT NARRATIVE Latinos are disproportionately impacted by the domestic HIV epidemic and untreated mental health problems continue to be a major public health challenge. Untreated mental health problems are driving poor outcomes along the HIV Care Continuum and impeding efforts to reduce health disparities and new infections. An adaptive treatment strategy integrated into HIV care and that uses a mobile health approach is an innovative way to more effectively treat depression and improve HIV treatment outcomes among Latinos living with HIV.",An adaptive treatment intervention for depression and engagement in HIV care among Latinos living with HIV,9552923,K01MH113475,"['Adoption ', ' Appointment ', ' Attitude ', ' Automobile Driving ', ' driving ', ' Award ', ' California ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Cognitive Therapy ', ' cognitive behavioral treatment ', ' cognitive behavioral therapy ', ' cognitive behavioral modification ', ' cognitive behavioral intervention ', ' cognitive behavior therapy ', ' cognitive behavior modification ', ' cognitive behavior intervention ', ' Cognitive Psychotherapy ', ' Cognition Therapy ', ' Communities ', ' Continuity of Patient Care ', ' Continuum of Care ', ' Continuity of Care ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Epidemic ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Health Status ', ' Level of Health ', ' HIV ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' Infection ', ' Interview ', ' Language ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Linguistics ', ' Linguistic ', ' Maps ', ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health Services ', ' Mental Hygiene Services ', ' Methods ', ' Moods ', ' mortality ', ' Motivation ', ' Persons ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' NIMH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' Patients ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Primary Care ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Telephone ', ' Phone ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Training Support ', ' Treatment outcome ', ' depressive symptoms ', ' depressive ', ' depression symptom ', ' Emotional Depression ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Latino ', ' Research Methodology ', ' Research Methods ', ' Caring ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' Ensure ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Funding ', ' uptake ', ' Immigrant ', ' tool ', ' Research Priority ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Clinic ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' System ', ' Viral ', ' Mood Disorders ', ' Affective Disorders ', ' Visit ', ' preference ', ' Reporting ', ' Health Technology ', ' Health Care Technology ', ' psychological distress ', ' Emotional ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Qualitative Research ', ' Car Phone ', ' Mobile Phones ', ' Provider ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Address ', ' Qualitative Methods ', ' qualitative reasoning ', ' Adherence ', ' Data ', ' Health Care Visit ', ' Healthcare Visit ', ' High Prevalence ', ' Mentored Research Scientist Development Award ', ' Research Scientist Development Award ', ' Mentored Training Award ', ' K01 Program ', ' K01 Mechanism ', ' K01 Award ', ' Cognitive ', ' Principal Investigator ', ' Process ', ' Modification ', ' Behavioral ', ' medication adherence ', ' drug compliance ', ' drug adherence ', ' medication compliance ', ' Evidence based treatment ', ' cost ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' efficacy trial ', ' Outcome ', ' blind ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' safety net ', ' implementation science ', ' evidence base ', ' treatment strategy ', ' treatment adherence ', ' compare efficacy ', ' comparative efficacy ', ' Randomization trial ', ' randomized trial ', ' mobile health ', ' m-Health ', ' mHealth ', ' mobile app ', ' mobile application ', ' personalized treatment ', ' personalized therapy ', ' personalization of treatment ', ' personalized medicine ', ' trial design ', ' health service utilization ', ' health service use ', ' Text Messaging ', ' obstacle to healthcare ', ' obstacle to care ', ' barrier to treatment ', ' barrier to healthcare ', ' barrier to health care ', ' barrier to care ', ' ']",NIMH,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",K01,2018,197059,0.011236491283326051
"Remote Supervision for Implementing Collaborative Care for Perinatal Depression ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Depression is a common and serious disorder among pregnant women but few from low income groups receive effective treatment. The highly evidence based collaborative care (CC) model for depression has been shown to work for women in pregnancy but has not been widely implemented. In cases where large scale pragmatic implementation of this innovation has been attempted there has been great variation in the success at individual health centers. A major obstacle to achieving the same success in large scale efforts to implement this care innovation as is seen in more controlled effectiveness trials is the limit of resources available to support the staff members carrying out this care. Although ongoing support in the form of training, technical assistance, quality improvement, and tools has been found to improve implementation and patient outcomes through longitudinal consultation by content experts in the health innovation being implemented most implementation efforts rely primarily on brief intensive training for staff. These content experts are complementary but distinct from general practice facilitators that address general processes that are applicable to implementation of any innovation. In order to achieve the potential public health benefits of CC an efficient and scalable model of longitudinal consultation may be needed to facilitate its effective implementation. We propose a pragmatic cluster randomized trial of longitudinal remote consultation (LRC) utilizing video conferencing to efficiently link providers to consultants who provide timely feedback and training. We plan to use a Hybrid Type III implementation design with a focus on implementation outcomes but also clinical outcomes. The proposed study will involve twenty federally qualified health centers (FQHCs) providing prenatal care and which are part of the national OCHIN Network with a shared electronic health record. All sites will receive a standard multifaceted approach to implementation used in many current broad implementation efforts. After pre-implementation training ten of the sites will be randomly selected to receive the LRC. Implementation and clinical outcomes as well as costs will be compared between the study conditions after a 12 month implementation period and a 13-21 month sustainment period. The results of the proposed study will provide critical generalizable knowledge regarding the benefits of ongoing consultation for implementation of complex interventions like collaborative care. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We plan to carry out a rigorous pragmatic evaluation of the Longitudinal Remote Consultation (LRC) implementation strategy to improve implementation and patient outcomes from team based collaborative care for perinatal depression in federally qualified health centers (FQHCs). LRC improves implementation of evidence based practices for mental health care provided by individual providers but has not been assessed for complex interventions such as collaborative care. Because of the negative impact of perinatal depression, particularly on low income women and their families seen in FQHCs, this promising strategy has great potential for public health impact nationally.",Remote Supervision for Implementing Collaborative Care for Perinatal Depression,9462228,R01MH108548,"['Affect ', ' Mental disorders ', ' psychological disorder ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Birth ', ' Parturition ', ' Consultations ', ' Cost Analysis ', ' cost assessment ', ' assess cost ', ' Cost Analyses ', ' cost effectiveness ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Elements ', ' Family ', ' Feedback ', ' Health ', ' Hybrids ', ' Infant ', ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health Services ', ' Mental Hygiene Services ', ' Patients ', ' Pregnancy ', ' Gestation ', ' Pregnant Women ', ' pregnant mothers ', ' expecting mother ', ' expectant mother ', ' Prenatal care ', ' prenatal visit ', ' prenatal checkup ', ' prenatal appointment ', ' pregnancy care ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Primary Care ', ' Public Health ', ' Research Support ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Supervision ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' symposium ', ' symposia ', ' summit ', ' convention ', ' conference ', ' General Practices ', ' Health Benefit ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Clinical ', ' Penetration ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Link ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' disability ', ' Individual ', ' Perinatal Disorder ', ' Remote Consultation ', ' tool ', ' Knowledge ', ' Complex ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' skills ', ' member ', ' Modeling ', ' theories ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Provider ', ' Low income ', ' Address ', ' Evidence based practice ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Process ', ' Federally Qualified Health Center ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' effectiveness trial ', ' cost ', ' care services ', ' care systems ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Clinical effectiveness ', ' efficacy trial ', ' Outcome ', ' scale up ', ' Population ', ' prospective ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' safety net ', ' collaborative care ', ' research into practice ', ' research to practice ', ' public health relevance ', ' evidence base ', ' effective treatment ', ' effective therapy ', ' clinical practice ', ' pragmatic trial ', ' perinatal depression ', ' peripartum depression ', ' Cluster randomization trial ', ' Cluster randomized trial ', ' racial minority ', ' reduce disparity ', ' disparity reduction ', ' healthcare disparity ', ' disparity in healthcare ', ' disparity in care ', ' health care disparity ', ' depressive model ', ' depression model ', ' evaluate cost-effectiveness ', ' cost-effectiveness evaluation ', ' implementation strategy ', ' perinatal phase ', ' perinatal period ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2018,783091,0.11516465251601139
"Palliative care intervention for socioeconomically disadvantaged cancer patients ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Socioeconomic disadvantage is associated with a greater likelihood of being diagnosed with cancer, delays in cancer diagnosis, receiving less treatment, decreased access to palliative care and hospice services, and increased mortality. Although interventions have been developed to reduce the incidence of cancer and delays in diagnosis in those from socioeconomically disadvantaged backgrounds; few interventions exist to improve access to palliative care and hospice services for individuals with the least resources and greatest needs for these services. The NIH consensus statement on cancer-related symptoms concluded that the most common and debilitating are depression, pain and fatigue. Our team has observed that people from socioeconomically disadvantaged backgrounds with advanced cancer have disproportionately higher levels of depression, pain and fatigue and poorer quality of life than patients who reported higher socioeconomic status (SES). Although the comorbidity of these symptoms is well known, no intervention has been developed to reduce these symptoms concurrently. Experience from our successful pilot study of a web-based stepped collaborative care intervention for cancer patients from predominantly socioeconomically disadvantaged backgrounds, revealed that patients randomized to the intervention arm, reported statistically significant reductions in depression, pain, and fatigue an improved quality of life when compared to patients randomized to enhanced usual care (K07CA118576). Furthermore, patients randomized to the intervention had decreased serum levels of Interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, IL-8 and improved survival (R21CA127046). Post-hoc analyses revealed that family caregivers, of patients randomized to the intervention arm, had reductions in stress and depression, when compared to caregivers with spouses/partners randomized to enhanced usual care (K07CA118576S1). There is an urgent need to develop scalable, effective, and, cost-effective interventions, particularly for those who are socioeconomically disadvantaged. We plan to test a web-based stepped collaborative care intervention with 450 advanced cancer patients and their spousal or intimate partners in the context of a randomized controlled trial. The specific aims are: (1) to test the efficacy of a web-based stepped collaborative care intervention to reduce symptoms of depression, pain, and fatigue and improve health-related quality of life (HRQL) in advanced cancer patients when compared to patients randomized to the education and support arm; (2) to examine if advanced cancer patients randomized to the web-based stepped collaborative care intervention have reductions in biomarkers of inflammation and explore if these patients have slowed disease progression and improved survival when compared to patients in the education and support arm; (3) to investigate whether the spouses or intimate partners, of patients randomized to the web-based stepped collaborative care intervention, have reduced stress and depression, better HRQL and fewer risk factors for CVD than caregivers with spouses/partners randomized to education and support arm. In accordance with the goals of Healthy People 2020 ""to achieve health equity, eliminate disparities, and improve the health of all groups, regardless of differences that occur by gender, race or ethnicity, education or income, disability, geographic location, or sexual orientation"" this proposed web-based stepped collaborative care intervention was designed to improve HRQL for those in greatest need and least access to palliative care. This innovative and scalable web-based stepped collaborative care intervention is expected to improve patients' and caregivers' HRQL and potentially reduce mortality. Findings are expected to lead to studies examining scalability and cost-effectiveness of the proposed intervention.

"Telehealth Treatments for Depression with Low-Income Homebound Seniors ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long-term objective of the proposed study is to improve access to depression treatments for low-income, racially diverse homebound seniors, a population experiencing significant disparities in mental health care due to their homebound and low-income status. Specific aims are to compare the acceptability, clinical effectiveness, treatment cost, and budget impact of the two teledelivered treatment delivery models: problem- solving therapy (PST) by licensed clinicians and self-care management (SCM) support by trained lay mental health workers/advisors. The interventionists will be integrated into an aging-service agency; hence, integrated tele-PST (IT-PST) ad integrated tele-SCM (IT-SCM). Although tele-psychotherapy is likely to be an effective mental health service delivery model for the target population, the current and projected shortage of such clinicians and the costs of deploying highly trained professionals pose barriers to this model's widespread real- world adoption and sustainability. A more plausible option may indeed have to utilize trained lay mental health workers. The study participants will be 276 low-income, racially diverse homebound seniors who are served by a home-delivered meal (HDM) program and other aging-service agencies in Austin, Tex. In a 3-arm, pragmatic clinical trial with randomization prior to consent (a preferred public health approach), the participants will receive five sessions of IT-PST, five sessions of IT-SCM, or five telephone check-in calls (for the usual care- UC-group). Our first hypothesis is that IT-PST and IT-SCM will be equally acceptable to the participants. Our second hypothesis is that both IT-PST and IT-SCM will be more effective than UC in reducing depressive symptoms, although IT-PST may be more effective than IT-SCM. Symptoms will be assessed with the 24-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD) at 12, 24, and 36 weeks after baseline. Additional outcomes will be depression-free days (DFDs) and disability (WHODAS 2.0). Our third hypothesis is that IT-SCM will have a lower delivery cost than IT-PST, but both IT-PST and IT-SCM will be more cost-effective than usual care. The analyses include (a) comparisons of delivery costs between IT-PST and IT-SCM; (b) assessment of cost- effectiveness (CEA) based on DFDs and health-related quality adjusted life-year measured by EuroQol-5 (EQ- 5D); and (3) budget impact (BIA) of IT-PST relative to IT-SCM. Both CEA and BIA will employ a hybrid public program perspective of the AoA and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid. Public health significance of this study is that the data will help aging-service providers and funders assess respective strengths and weaknesses of each model as a sustainable approach to providing depression care for an underserved and growing population group and improving their access to evidence-based mental health services. (We use the terms older adults and seniors interchangeably because the latter term is frequently used in aging services.) PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Significance This study aims to find an effective and sustainable approach to reducing disparities in accessing mental health services for an underserved and growing population group of low-income, racially diverse, homebound older adults. It will compare two aging-service integrated, tele delivered depression treatments for these seniors. One model is short-term problem-solving therapy by licensed clinicians; the second model is self-care management support by trained lay advisors.

A recent meta-analysis of over 20 longitudinal studies found the risk for incident depression among individuals with insomnia disorder is nearly three times that for normal sleepers, thus making insomnia a potential point of entry for depression prevention.  Identification and treatment of insomnia typically occurs in primary care, and is commonly treated with hypnotic medications; however, hypnotics have significant limitations, including increased risk for residual impairment, falls in the elderly, and abuse. Cognitive behavioral treatment of insomnia (CBT-I) has been recommended as a first line approach with demonstrated efficacy that is sustained beyond initial therapeutic intervention. However, effective and widespread implementation of CBT-I is severely limited by the national shortage of trained practitioners in clinical practice. A stepped care approach rooted in primary care holds potential for innovative accessibility and delivery of CBT-I, improving insomnia therapeutics, and reducing rates of MDD by targeting a robust yet modifiable risk factor in insomnia. Our proposed stepped care model uses digital cognitive behavioral therapy (dCBT-I) as an accessible, least-restrictive, first line intervention that reduces specialist time and resources, and adds clinician based face-to-face CBT-I only for refractory patients who need a more personalized, flexible, and durable therapist driven approach.  We propose a large-scale clinical trial in the primary care setting that utilizes a stepped care model (SMART design) to determine the effectiveness of dCBT-I alone and in combination with face-to-face CBT-I for insomnia, and the effects of these sleep interventions on the prevention of MDD. An important innovative component of the trial is the 1 and 2-year follow-up assessments to determine the durability of effectiveness over time and assess the impact on depression incidence and relapse. Early risk-detection and prevention is especially critical in those at elevated risk for depression to reduce health disparities. Thus, individuals with significant vulnerability to MDD, such as high sleep-reactivity, low socioeconomic status, and racial minorities will be included in significant numbers to test for potential moderation of treatment effects stratified by risk.  Finally, improving sleep through insomnia treatment may reduce nocturnal rumination, which may mitigate progression toward MDD. As such, we will determine whether changes in nocturnal rumination (i.e., target), a modifiable risk-factor, mediates the effects of CBT-I and dCBT-I on MDD incidence and relapse.  This project will test a highly scalable model of sleep care in a large primary care system to determine the potential for wide dissemination to address the high volume of population need for safe and effective insomnia treatment and associated prevention of depression. Project Narrative Sleep To Reduce Incident Depression Effectively (STRIDE) is a proposed large-scale clinical trial that will take place in primary care utilizing a stepped-care model to determine the effectiveness of digital cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (dCBT-I) alone or in combination with face-to-face CBT-I and the effects of these sleep interventions for the prevention of depression in vulnerable populations (elevated sleep reactivity, minority, low income).

"Remote Supervision for Implementing Collaborative Care for Perinatal Depression ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Depression is a common and serious disorder among pregnant women but few from low income groups receive effective treatment. The highly evidence based collaborative care (CC) model for depression has been shown to work for women in pregnancy but has not been widely implemented. In cases where large scale pragmatic implementation of this innovation has been attempted there has been great variation in the success at individual health centers. A major obstacle to achieving the same success in large scale efforts to implement this care innovation as is seen in more controlled effectiveness trials is the limit of resources available to support the staff members carrying out this care. Although ongoing support in the form of training, technical assistance, quality improvement, and tools has been found to improve implementation and patient outcomes through longitudinal consultation by content experts in the health innovation being implemented most implementation efforts rely primarily on brief intensive training for staff. These content experts are complementary but distinct from general practice facilitators that address general processes that are applicable to implementation of any innovation. In order to achieve the potential public health benefits of CC an efficient and scalable model of longitudinal consultation may be needed to facilitate its effective implementation. We propose a pragmatic cluster randomized trial of longitudinal remote consultation (LRC) utilizing video conferencing to efficiently link providers to consultants who provide timely feedback and training. We plan to use a Hybrid Type III implementation design with a focus on implementation outcomes but also clinical outcomes. The proposed study will involve twenty federally qualified health centers (FQHCs) providing prenatal care and which are part of the national OCHIN Network with a shared electronic health record. All sites will receive a standard multifaceted approach to implementation used in many current broad implementation efforts. After pre-implementation training ten of the sites will be randomly selected to receive the LRC. Implementation and clinical outcomes as well as costs will be compared between the study conditions after a 12 month implementation period and a 13-21 month sustainment period. The results of the proposed study will provide critical generalizable knowledge regarding the benefits of ongoing consultation for implementation of complex interventions like collaborative care. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We plan to carry out a rigorous pragmatic evaluation of the Longitudinal Remote Consultation (LRC) implementation strategy to improve implementation and patient outcomes from team based collaborative care for perinatal depression in federally qualified health centers (FQHCs). LRC improves implementation of evidence based practices for mental health care provided by individual providers but has not been assessed for complex interventions such as collaborative care. Because of the negative impact of perinatal depression, particularly on low income women and their families seen in FQHCs, this promising strategy has great potential for public health impact nationally.",Remote Supervision for Implementing Collaborative Care for Perinatal Depression,9689106,R01MH108548,"['Affect ', ' Mental disorders ', ' psychological disorder ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Birth ', ' Parturition ', ' Consultations ', ' cost assessment ', ' assess cost ', ' Cost Analyses ', ' Cost Analysis ', ' cost effectiveness ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Elements ', ' Family ', ' Feedback ', ' Health ', ' Hybrids ', ' Infant ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene Services ', ' Mental Health Services ', ' Patients ', ' Gestation ', ' Pregnancy ', ' pregnant mothers ', ' expecting mother ', ' expectant mother ', ' Pregnant Women ', ' prenatal visit ', ' prenatal checkup ', ' prenatal appointment ', ' pregnancy care ', ' Prenatal care ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Primary Care ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Public Health ', ' Research Support ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Supervision ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' symposia ', ' summit ', ' convention ', ' conference ', ' symposium ', ' General Practices ', ' Health Benefit ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Clinical ', ' Penetration ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Link ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' disability ', ' Individual ', ' Perinatal Disorder ', ' Remote Consultation ', ' tool ', ' Knowledge ', ' Complex ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' skills ', ' member ', ' Modeling ', ' theories ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Provider ', ' Low income ', ' Address ', ' Evidence based practice ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Process ', ' Federally Qualified Health Center ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' electronic health care record ', ' effectiveness trial ', ' cost ', ' care systems ', ' care services ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Clinical effectiveness ', ' efficacy trial ', ' Outcome ', ' scale up ', ' Population ', ' prospective ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' safety net ', ' collaborative care ', ' research to practice ', ' research into practice ', ' public health relevance ', ' evidence base ', ' effective therapy ', ' effective treatment ', ' clinical practice ', ' pragmatic trial ', ' peripartum depression ', ' perinatal depression ', ' Cluster randomized trial ', ' Cluster randomization trial ', ' racial minority ', ' disparity reduction ', ' reduce disparity ', ' health care disparity ', ' healthcare disparity ', ' disparity in healthcare ', ' disparity in care ', ' depression model ', ' depressive model ', ' cost-effectiveness evaluation ', ' evaluate cost-effectiveness ', ' implementation strategy ', ' perinatal period ', ' perinatal phase ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2019,677818,0.11516465251601139
"Responsive eHealth Intervention for Perinatal Depression in Healthcare Settings PROJECT SUMMARY Perinatal depression (experienced by at least 14-20% of pregnant and postpartum women) is recognized as the most common complication of childbirth and as having extremely serious consequences, including significant suffering for pregnant women/new mothers and their families, and adverse impacts on infant development. Unfortunately, there are many barriers that make it difficult for women with perinatal depression to access clinic-based mental health treatments, and participation is low. Treatment uptake is limited by psychological barriers (stigma, feelings of failure, and embarrassment); knowledge barriers (poor understanding about impact of perinatal depression on infant health, uncertainty about where to get treatment); infrastructure barriers (fear of negative judgment from care providers, avoidance of prescription medications while breastfeeding); physical barriers in rural settings (too few care providers, unacceptable logistical demands on time, transportation, and childcare); and provider-level barriers (inadequate skills, fear of liability, dearth of treatment options, and inadequate reimbursement). To address this need, we obtained NIMH funding (R01MH084931) to develop and test the MomMoodBooster program (MMB), an innovative Web-based program for treating postpartum depression (PPD). Based on cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and incorporating multimedia modeling and engaging activities, MMB is designed to enable women to identify patterns in their thoughts and behaviors and to develop a personal action plan to make helpful changes. MMB also has an administrative website designed for use by both project managers and supportive phone coaches to monitor the overall progress of participants. In our SBIR Phase I grant (R43MH109191), we began a redesign of MMB so that it could be used more effectively as a product for delivering PPD treatment by practical healthcare delivery organizations. Specifically, we enhanced the underlying database architecture (and the related administration website interface) to make it easier for multiple organizations in multiple settings to use MMB. In our proposed SBIR Phase II, we propose to complete the process of making a commercial-ready product (MMB 2.0) that fits the workflow and staffing of healthcare organizations. Specifically, we propose to finish the enhancement of the database architecture and its administrative site, to expand MMB to include prenatal as well as postpartum depressed women, and to deliver MMB using a new responsive design technology so that women will be able to use it interchangeably with any internet-accessible computer device (desktop, laptop, tablet, smartphone). Finally, we plan to use a 2-arm randomized controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy of MMB 2.0 compared to treatment as usual in a large healthcare setting.

"Engaging self-regulation targets to understand the mechanisms of behavior change and improve mood and weight outcomes ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Background: Obesity affects 36% of US women and men and increases lifetime risk for diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Similarly, depression affects 20% of US women and 13% of men and is the leading cause of disability worldwide. Further, the 2 disorders have a bidirectional positive relationship. Proven behavioral interventions to treat obesity and depression exist; however, the underlying biological mechanisms remain unknown. This lack of understanding significantly hampers efforts to optimize the effectiveness of behavioral interventions and limits their dissemination and implementation into widespread practice to curtail the adverse consequences of obesity and depression and promote population health. Rapid advances in human neuroscience and behavioral science and integration of the two could provide unique opportunity to fill this gap. Objective: Leveraging a recently funded 2-year randomized controlled trial (""RAINBOW"" target n=404; PI Dr. Jun Ma) of a first-ever integrated treatment for comorbid obesity and depression in primary care that uniquely combines 2 nationally recognized behavioral interventions, we propose a 2-phased project to identify, validate and refine a set of assays to measure self-regulation targets; and to engage these targets to optimize behavioral treatment of obesity and depression. Specific Aims: In the UH2 phase, we will (1) Conduct secondary data analysis and hold workshops and a symposium to finalize selection of self-regulation targets and assays for testing; (2) Leverage the RAINBOW intervention to engage identified targets; and (3) Verify target engagement across multiple domains (neural, physiological, behavioral, psychological), settings (laboratory, virtual, and naturalistic), and time points (0, 4 weeks, 6, 12 and 24 months) Transitional milestones are to (1) Establish assay(s) that reliably and accurately measure the identified targets; (2) Demonstrate malleability of the self-regulation target(s) in response to th RAINBOW integrated treatment; and (3) Identify self-regulation profile(s) that predict treatment response in health behaviors (medical regimen adherence, physical activity, diet) and outcomes (weight, depression). In the UH3 phase, we will conduct a pilot randomized controlled trial in which an additional 100 obese and depressed adults will be randomized to intervention or wait-list control and assessed at baseline, 4 weeks and 6 months. Intervention subjects will receive the first 4 weeks of the RAINBOW intervention, followed by target-guided tailoring of the intervention components in order to optimize target engagement and enhance behavioral change based on their individual self-regulation profile during the first 4 weeks. We will use the insights from intervention subjects to then further refine the tailoring strategies for the waitlis subjects. Implications: This research will provide a toolkit of well-validated assays of self-regulation targets important for health behavior change, as well as target- guided personalization of intervention strategies, in the treatment of comorbid obesity and depression. Impact: Given the widespread relevance of these disorders and the targeted health behaviors, this research will be a prototype for treating multiple chronic conditions with profound potential impacts on population health. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: In this project we propose to understand self-regulation processes and mechanisms underlying evidence- based behavioral interventions for the treatment of obesity and depression, 2 of the top contributors to the burden of disease and disability in the US and globally. The project synergistically integrates human neuroscience and behavioral science to identify which self-regulation targets are engaged by the intervention among which subgroups of the population and how we can harness these target mechanisms to promote greater health behavior change, better weight management and improved mood. In a series of 3 interrelated studies we will identify, validate and refine a set of assays to measure self-regulation targets; and to engage these targets to optimize behavioral treatment of coexisting obesity and depression among adults. Given the widespread relevance of these disorders and the targeted health behaviors (adherence to self-tracking and medications, physical activity, diet), this research will be a prototype for understanding and optimizing behavioral interventions for multiple chronic conditions, with profound potential impacts on population health.",Engaging self-regulation targets to understand the

"Parental Depression and the Early Origins of Disease Across Three Generations. PROJECT SUMMARY Over 15 million children in the United States live with a depressed parent. Parental depression has been associated with negative social, emotional, and behavioral outcomes for children across development, but little is known about the possible physical health consequences for youth following exposure to parental depression. Further, existing research often relies on retrospective reports of parental mental health and typically includes only one assessment of parents' symptoms. Parental depression is not a static event, however, and these studies fail to capture the fluctuations in symptoms often observed in parents with depression. The proposed research capitalizes on an ongoing longitudinal study of 391 African American parents (Generation 1 [G1]) and their children (Generation 2 [G2]) starting when children were 11 years of age and continuing to age 25. These youth have faced challenging social and economic environments across development, and their parents similarly have faced wide-ranging stressors that increased their risk for depressive symptoms. The availability of this well characterized sample of rural African American families presents a unique opportunity to investigate the ways in which parental depression over a 10-year period across childhood and adolescence predicts youths' risk for precursors to chronic diseases of aging (CDAs; inflammation, metabolic syndrome) in early adulthood. Further, approximately half of the G2 youth now have children (Generation 3 [G3]) of their own, who to date have not been involved in the ongoing study. We propose to collect pilot data with this new generation of offspring. This data collection will allow us to start investigating the possibility that parental depression in one generation could influence development in subsequent generations, even when environmental influences change over time. We propose to examine how G1 parental depression trajectories predict G2 offspring depression and CDA precursors in early adulthood (Aim 1). Then, we will examine potential mediators (e.g., family environments) and moderators (e.g., offspring self-control, external supports) that may alter the degree to which fluctuations in parental depression trajectories are associated with G2 CDA precursors (Aim 2). Finally, we will collect pilot data on 60 G3 offspring to examine the ways in which social determinants of health are transmitted across generations (Aim 3). This pilot project will serve as an exploratory investigation to aid in planning for a larger study of the intergenerational transmission of health disparities. This proposal tests questions surrounding the possibility that parental depression and unsupportive family environments could influence children's development across generations. Findings from this proposal could be used to inform interventions designed to improve children's well being and to identify naturally occurring factors that could protect youth from adverse outcomes. PROJECT NARRATIVE Exposure to parental depression is a consistent risk factor for poor social and emotional functioning for children across development, but little is known about (a) its effects on youths' physical health or (b) the extent to which these risks are transmitted across generations. This proposal seeks to investigate how variability in level and chronicity of parental depression across a 10-year period is associated with offspring health across generations and whether risk and protective factors can modulate the extent to which exposure to parental depression confers risk to offspring. Findings from this investigation could be used to inform interventions and to identify naturally occurring factors that could protect youth from adverse outcomes.",Parental Depression and the Early Origins of Disease Across Three Generations.,9754224,R03HD093918,"['Adolescence ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Aging ', ' Anxiety ', ' Attention ', ' Behavior ', ' Mental disorders ', ' psychological disorder ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Blood Pressure ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Infant and Child Development ', ' Child Development ', ' childrearing ', ' Parenting behavior ', ' Parenting ', ' Child Rearing ', ' child wellbeing ', ' child well being ', ' adolescent welfare ', ' Child Welfare ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Data Collection ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' diabetes ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' disruptive behavioral disorder ', ' Disruptive Behavior Disorder ', ' Economics ', ' England ', ' Environment ', ' Family ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' heart disorder ', ' Cardiac Disorders ', ' Cardiac Diseases ', ' Heart Diseases ', ' Inflammation ', ' Literature ', ' lifespan ', ' life span ', ' Length of Life ', ' Longevity ', ' longterm study ', ' long-term study ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Parents ', ' wellbeing ', ' well-being ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' pilot study ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' Reading ', ' Relapse ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Self Regulation ', ' Informal Social Control ', ' Stress ', ' Substance Dependence ', ' Substance Addiction ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Generations ', ' Measures ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' depressive ', ' depression symptom ', ' Emotional Depression ', ' depressive symptoms ', ' Research Methods ', ' Research Methodology ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Youth ', ' improved ', ' Chronic ', ' Residual state ', ' Residual ', ' Link ', ' teacher ', ' Childhood ', ' pediatric ', ' Individual ', ' young adult ', ' young adulthood ', ' adult youth ', ' Rural ', ' Hares ', ' Lepus ', ' Funding ', ' Exposure to ', ' Depressed mood ', ' sadness ', ' depressed ', ' Investigation ', ' Event ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' physical conditioning ', ' physical health ', ' psychosocial ', ' interest ', ' Disease remission ', ' Remission ', ' experience ', ' stressor ', ' intergenerational ', ' Participant ', ' offspring ', ' Self-control as a personality trait ', ' self control ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' Substance abuse problem ', ' substance abuse ', ' abuse of substances ', ' Emotional ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Adverse event ', ' Adverse Experience ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Metabolic syndrome ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Consent ', ' Data ', ' National Institute of Child Health and Human Development ', "" National Institute of Children's Health and Human Development "", ' NICHD ', ' transmission process ', ' Transmission ', ' Preparation ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' caregiving ', ' care giving ', ' Social Functioning ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' child depression ', ' youth depression ', ' pediatric depression ', ' depression in adolescence ', ' depressed adolescents ', ' childhood onset depression ', ' childhood depression ', ' adolescents with depression ', ' adolescent depression ', ' Outcome ', ' 11 year old ', ' eleven years of age ', ' eleven year old ', ' age 11 years ', ' 11 years of age ', ' therapy design ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' emerging adult ', ' early adulthood ', ' social health determinants ', ' early life exposure ', ' adverse outcome ', ' adverse consequence ', ' behavioral outcome ', ' behavior outcome ', ' rural African American ', ' protective factors ', ' childhood adversity ', ' pediatric adversity ', ' ']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF GEORGIA,R03,2019,75500,0.12833700236293688
"Social Media Use and Depression Outcomes among U.S. Lesbian, Gay, and Bisexual Young Adults PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT The overarching goal of this Pathway to Independence Award is to facilitate the development of César G. Escobar-Viera, PhD, MD, MPH, into an independent researcher, with expertise in advanced quantitative and qualitative methods to determine the role of social media on depression among lesbian, gay, and bisexual U.S. young adults (LGBYA). Ultimately, the PI seeks to leverage evidence-based SM interventions to ameliorate depression among LGBYA, which will ultimately help to reduce mental health disparities for this group. This long-term goal will be achieved via a 5-year training and research plan that will launch Dr. Escobar-Viera’s independent program of research and academic career. The career objectives of this award are to: (1) become an expert in the field of social media research applied to depression; (2) advance the PI’s knowledge in LGBT mental health disparities; and (3) gain expertise in the application of advanced quantitative and qualitative methodologies. These career objectives will be achieved via formal coursework, trainings, seminars, national conferences, mentorship, and research experience. The knowledge derived from this training plan will prepare Dr. Escobar-Viera to pursue the following aims. In the first aim, pre-existing survey data from a nationally- representative sample of young adults will be leveraged to explore cross-sectional associations between SMU and depression among LGBYA. During the second aim, qualitative assessments about SMU and depression among LGBYA. The influence of SMU on depression will be explored by inquiring about what type of use is helpful and generates social support and which use result in negative feelings and experiences (e.g., discrimination). Finally, the third aim will consist of a longitudinal examination of the associations between SMU and depression among LGBYA. Results of this aim will inform the PI’s next step of developing an SM-based intervention for LGBYA at risk for depression, mitigating identified risk factors while enhancing protective ones. Feasibility and efficacy of the intervention will be then tested via a series of R21 and R01 projects during Dr. Escobar-Viera’s independent research career. An outstanding team of experts in LGBT research, qualitative research, longitudinal analyses, survey research, and mobile and social media interventions will provide mentorship to ensure the success of this project. Brian Primack, MD, PhD, will serve as the primary mentor. Dr. Primack leveraged his own K07 into multiple R01 and R21 awards. Co-mentorship will be provided by Michael Marshal, PhD and Ron Stall, PhD. Moreover, Galen Switzer, PhD and Sherry Pagoto, PhD will serve as consultants. This study proposes to lay a theoretical foundation needed to develop evidence-based social media interventions to improve mental health outcomes among sexual minorities. In addition, it will contribute to developing a model to study the influence of social media on health disparities among other minority groups. This award will forge the PI’s pathway to independence by laying a foundation for a career in social media interventions to reduce depression among LGBYA, thus decreasing health disparities for this population. PROJECT NARRATIVE Compared with their heterosexual counterparts, lesbian, gay, and bisexual young adults (LGBYA) consistently experience higher rates of depression, which is the leading cause of disability worldwide, with a burden of $200 billion per year in the U.S. alone. Given that it is now part of the fabric LGBYA use to build and maintain social networks, it is crucial to grasp the impact SM might have on mental health, in this population. The proposed research will use an innovative version of the Minority Stress Model to understand the extent and under which circumstances characteristics of social media use might become either a risk or protective factor for depression among LGBYA.","Social Media Use and Depression Outcomes among U.S. Lesbian, Gay, and Bisexual Young Adults",9784903,K99MD012813,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Award ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Discrimination ', ' Elements ', ' Environment ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Foundations ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' longterm study ', ' long-term study ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methodology ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Motivation ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Support ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Social Characteristics ', ' social support network ', ' Social support ', ' Stereotyping ', ' Stress ', ' suicidality ', ' intent to die ', ' fatal suicide ', ' fatal attempt ', ' Suicide ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Testing ', ' fabric ', ' Textiles ', ' thoughts ', ' Thinking ', ' Time ', ' Translations ', ' Work ', ' Friends ', ' Gender ', ' symposia ', ' summit ', ' convention ', ' conference ', ' symposium ', ' depressive ', ' depression symptom ', ' Emotional Depression ', ' depressive symptoms ', ' Longitudinal Surveys ', ' Social Network ', ' base ', ' Bisexual ', ' Bi-sexual ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Phase ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Series ', ' Ensure ', ' grasp ', ' Grips ', ' Training ', ' disability ', ' young adult ', ' young adulthood ', ' adult youth ', ' Sample Size ', ' Gays ', ' Lesbian ', ' Collaborations ', ' Expressed Emotion ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' bullying ', ' bully ', ' Well in self ', ' sense of wellbeing ', ' self wellness ', ' psychological wellness ', ' psychological wellbeing ', ' mental wellbeing ', ' mental well-being ', ' emotional wellbeing ', ' Sense of well-being ', ' Psychological Well Being ', ' Normal psyche ', ' Normal mental state ', ' Normal mental condition ', ' Feels well ', ' Emotional well being ', ' Hour ', ' Pattern ', ' Marshal ', ' Equation ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' Structure ', ' Participant ', ' General Population ', ' General Public ', ' social ', ' Emotional ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' career development ', ' theories ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Qualitative Research ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Address ', ' Qualitative Methods ', ' qualitative reasoning ', ' Data ', ' Doctor of Philosophy ', ' PhD ', ' Ph.D. ', ' Effectiveness of Interventions ', ' Media Intervention ', ' Communication Tools ', ' Exploratory/Developmental Grant for Diagnostic Cancer Imaging ', ' R21 Award ', ' Characteristics ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Feeling ', ' feelings ', ' Heterosexuals ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' time use ', ' Minority ', ' Treatment Efficacy ', ' therapy efficacy ', ' therapeutically effective ', ' therapeutic efficacy ', ' intervention efficacy ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' therapy development ', ' treatment development ', ' intervention development ', ' develop therapy ', ' evidence base ', ' longitudinal analysis ', ' sexual minority ', ' Lesbian Gay Bisexual Transgender ', ' LGBT ', ' Lesbian Gay Bisexual ', ' LGB ', ' social media ', ' recruit ', ' protective factors ', ' sexual identity ', ' sociodemographics ', ' socio-demographics ', ' ']",NIMHD,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,K99,2019,137590,0.13286733542515358
"Engaging self-regulation targets to understand the mechanisms of behavior change and improve mood and weight outcomes ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Background: Obesity affects 36% of US women and men and increases lifetime risk for diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Similarly, depression affects 20% of US women and 13% of men and is the leading cause of disability worldwide. Further, the 2 disorders have a bidirectional positive relationship. Proven behavioral interventions to treat obesity and depression exist; however, the underlying biological mechanisms remain unknown. This lack of understanding significantly hampers efforts to optimize the effectiveness of behavioral interventions and limits their dissemination and implementation into widespread practice to curtail the adverse consequences of obesity and depression and promote population health. Rapid advances in human neuroscience and behavioral science and integration of the two could provide unique opportunity to fill this gap. Objective: Leveraging a recently funded 2-year randomized controlled trial (""RAINBOW"" target n=404; PI Dr. Jun Ma) of a first-ever integrated treatment for comorbid obesity and depression in primary care that uniquely combines 2 nationally recognized behavioral interventions, we propose a 2-phased project to identify, validate and refine a set of assays to measure self-regulation targets; and to engage these targets to optimize behavioral treatment of obesity and depression. Specific Aims: In the UH2 phase, we will (1) Conduct secondary data analysis and hold workshops and a symposium to finalize selection of self-regulation targets and assays for testing; (2) Leverage the RAINBOW intervention to engage identified targets; and (3) Verify target engagement across multiple domains (neural, physiological, behavioral, psychological), settings (laboratory, virtual, and naturalistic), and time points (0, 4 weeks, 6, 12 and 24 months) Transitional milestones are to (1) Establish assay(s) that reliably and accurately measure the identified targets; (2) Demonstrate malleability of the self-regulation target(s) in response to th RAINBOW integrated treatment; and (3) Identify self-regulation profile(s) that predict treatment response in health behaviors (medical regimen adherence, physical activity, diet) and outcomes (weight, depression). In the UH3 phase, we will conduct a pilot randomized controlled trial in which an additional 100 obese and depressed adults will be randomized to intervention or wait-list control and assessed at baseline, 4 weeks and 6 months. Intervention subjects will receive the first 4 weeks of the RAINBOW intervention, followed by target-guided tailoring of the intervention components in order to optimize target engagement and enhance behavioral change based on their individual self-regulation profile during the first 4 weeks. We will use the insights from intervention subjects to then further refine the tailoring strategies for the waitlis subjects. Implications: This research will provide a toolkit of well-validated assays of self-regulation targets important for health behavior change, as well as target- guided personalization of intervention strategies, in the treatment of comorbid obesity and depression. Impact: Given the widespread relevance of these disorders and the targeted health behaviors, this research will be a prototype for treating multiple chronic conditions with profound potential impacts on population health. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: In this project we propose to understand self-regulation processes and mechanisms underlying evidence- based behavioral interventions for the treatment of obesity and depression, 2 of the top contributors to the burden of disease and disability in the US and globally. The project synergistically integrates human neuroscience and behavioral science to identify which self-regulation targets are engaged by the intervention among which subgroups of the population and how we can harness these target mechanisms to promote greater health behavior change, better weight management and improved mood. In a series of 3 interrelated studies we will identify, validate and refine a set of assays to measure self-regulation targets; and to engage these targets to optimize behavioral treatment of coexisting obesity and depression among adults. Given the widespread relevance of these disorders and the targeted health behaviors (adherence to self-tracking and medications, physical activity, diet), this research will be a prototype for understanding and optimizing behavioral interventions for multiple chronic conditions, with profound potential impacts on population health.",Engaging self-regulation targets to understand the

"A Systems-Level Intervention for Rural Adults with Depression Abstract This career development award seeks to prepare the candidate for a career as a mental health intervention and implementation researcher who adapts and packages evidence-based practices (EBPs) to be accessible, acceptable, and sustainable in rural communities. Rural Americans experience depression at rates similar to their urban peers; yet are significantly less likely to receive treatment. Substantial barriers, including a lack of mental health professionals, cost, travel burden, stigma and preference for informal care, contribute to this disparity. Research is necessary to adapt and implement EBPs for depression in ways that reduce known barriers, align with rural residents' help-seeking preferences, and build internal capacity to delivery EBPs within rural communities. The proposed training goals and mentored research activities will prepare the candidate to bridge the gap between research and practice by successfully adapting and implementing EPBs in usual care settings. The candidate seeks to (1) develop expertise in implementation science and research to enhance her ability to integrate EBPs into usual care settings; (2) enhance her knowledge of community-based participatory research (CPBR) methods as they relate to adapting and implementing interventions with the best chance for acceptability and sustainbility in non-mental health settings; (3) increase her knowledge and skills in intervention development, randomized controlled trial designs, and quantitative analytic techniques; and (4) build upon her clinical background to enhance her expertise with cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for depression and anxiety through focused training supporting her ability to adapt CBT while retaining core components, train and supervise non-mental health professionals delivering interventions, and assess fidelity of adapted interventions. All career development goals are infused with relevant rural-focused content. The goals will be achieved through a rigorous training plan that includes coursework at the University of Michigan's (UM) top-ranked Schools of Social Work, Public Health, and Medicine; targeted off-site training and attendance at national conferences; state-of-the-art clinical training through UM Department of Psychiatry and the Beck Institute; as well as outstanding mentorship from leaders in mental health intervention and implementation research; depression and anxiety; and cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). Training goals are further supported by mentored research activities facilitated by UM's resource rich scientific environment. The proposed research, informed by the Replicating Effective Programs framework (REP) and CBPR, seeks to (1) adapt and package group CBT for depression for implementation in the rural church setting, and conduct an open pilot test of the adapted intervention; (2) conduct a pilot randomized controlled trial (pRCT) to assess the intervention's preliminary effect on depression and explore the relationship between potential mechanisms of change and expected outcomes; and (3) explore intervention acceptability and feasibility using mixed methods to assess multiple stakeholders perceptions of the intervention and its implementation. Relevance Public Health Relevance Statement: Rural Americans have faced decades-long disparities in access to mental health treatment and are significantly less likely to receive evidence-based care compared to urban peers. The lack of infrastructure and mental health professionals in rural areas requires consideration of ways to deliver evidence-based treatment within non-mental health settings to increase accessibility, acceptability, and sustainability of needed care. Adapting and packaging evidence-based practices in a context-specific way by incorporating rural residents' perspectives and treatment preferences, reducing practical barriers such as transportation and cost, and collaborating with informal providers within the de facto mental health system, has the potential to make an large impact by increasing access to care and ultimately improving the lives

"Evaluating the Contribution of Synthetic Oxytocin Exposure in the Peripartum Period to Postpartum Depressive Symptoms in African American Women PROJECT SUMMARY Background: Synthetic oxytocin is a medication commonly administered perinatally to induce or augment labor and prevent postpartum hemorrhage. However, its long term consequences, especially related to postpartum mood, are largely unknown. This is especially pertinent in African American mothers, a population at higher risk of postpartum depression. African American women have higher rates, in general, of variables that lead to slow labor and therefore are theoretically at greater risk of synthetic oxytocin exposure than Caucasian mothers. Purpose: The purpose of this study is firstly to characterize the indication for and exposure rate of African American women to perinatal synthetic oxytocin. Secondly, we will evaluate the association between exposure to perinatal synthetic oxytocin and depressive symptomatology in African American women at 1 week, 3 months, and 6 months postpartum, after controlling for identified potential confounding variables. Methods: We will enroll a socioeconomically diverse cohort of 160 African American women for this study. As part of two larger, longitudinal studies, participants were recruited between 10-14 weeks gestation and followed through 6 months postpartum. They were visited in their homes at 1 week, 3 months, and 6 months postpartum and assessed for postpartum depression symptomatology using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale. For the selected subset, we will review their labor and delivery records for detailed data on perinatal synthetic oxytocin exposure. We will combine prenatal, intrapartum, and postpartum variables into a novel dataset to describe synthetic oxytocin exposure and evaluate its relationship to postpartum depression. Implications: The results of this study will provide, for the first time, information on exposure rates to a synthetic hormone that may carry with it increased risk of postpartum depression in this population of African American women, already at high risk of health disparities in birth and infant outcomes. Findings have the potential to impact practice in many ways, including consideration of revising dosing standards and improved risk assessment and surveillance for postpartum depression in exposed women. PROJECT NARRATIVE Postpartum depression is a significant health concern, especially in African American women, a population at highest risk of poor birth outcomes. This study will firstly describe African American women's exposure to synthetic oxytocin, a common labor and delivery drug, of which the long-term mood impact is unknown, and secondly examine synthetic oxytocin exposure as a novel biological risk factor for postpartum depression.

"Genes, Education, and Gene-Education Interactions in Obesity and Mental Health PROJECT SUMMARY  Tackling obesity and depression is vital for population health, not least because they are associated with diabetes, heart disease, strokes, and suicide, which in turn led to the decrease in US life expectancy in 2015. One policy advocated by Healthy People 2020 to reduce obesity and depression is increasing educational attainment, as it is viewed as a fundamental cause of health disparities. As obesity and depression also have strong genetic bases, it is possible that education additionally improves population health by moderating the underlying genetic risk of being obese/depressed through gene-environment (GxE) interactions. GxE interactions occur when the effect of genetic risk varies across the environment. The influence of genetic predisposition towards the likelihood of being obese may differ by educational attainment. A college graduate with a high genetic risk of being obese may never be obese because education is associated with higher income affording the individual to eat healthier and having peers who are conscious about leading a healthy lifestyle. In contrast, a high school dropout with a high genetic risk is more likely to be obese because he/she has a low income, is more likely to consume fast food, and interacts with peers who are obese. The proposed project will apply econometric methods, instrumental variables and within-sibling comparisons, that use quasi-experimental variation in educational attainment to increase our understanding of causal relations of education, genes, and GxE interactions on obesity and depression. The use of quasi-experimental variation will, under certain assumptions, produce estimates that are not confounded by (i) the influence of unobserved factors that are correlated with education and health, (ii) reverse causality, (iii) gene-environment correlations, and (iv) population stratification, and these estimates can therefore be given a causal interpretation conditional on these assumptions. The specific aims are to estimate main effects of education, genetic risk, and GxE interactions on obesity and depression using (i) the Easter School Leaving Rule as a natural experiment in the UK and data from the UK Biobank, (ii) local factors in the individual’s county of residence near secondary school completion age (college availability, education expenditures, unemployment rate) as instruments for education in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey and the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health) datasets, and (iii) the sibling fixed-effects approach in the Add Health dataset. Overall, the project will provide a comprehensive array of results and new insights as we compare results from different methods, datasets, across different educational levels, and by gender. This application is in direct response to NIH PAR- 16-080 “Education and Health: New Frontiers.” PROJECT NARRATIVE  The proposed research is relevant to public health because obesity and depression are major public health problems in the US. Both conditions have significant individual and societal costs. They are associated with other adverse health outcomes and behaviors such as diabetes, heart disease, strokes, and suicide, which in turn led to the decrease in US life expectancy in 2015. This research will make important contributions to our understanding of the relations between education and obesity, and depression, and how heterogeneities reflected in gene-environmental interactions shape those relations.","Genes, Education, and Gene-Education Interactions in Obesity and Mental Health",9769107,R01HD094011,"['Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Behavior ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' diabetes ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' training status ', ' training level ', ' training achievement ', ' educational level ', ' Educational Achievement ', ' Educational Status ', ' Environment ', ' Expenditure ', ' Family ', ' Genes ', ' Government ', ' Health ', ' heart disorder ', ' Cardiac Disorders ', ' Cardiac Diseases ', ' Heart Diseases ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Income ', ' Life Expectancy ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Methods ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Obesity ', ' Population Control ', ' Probability ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Schools ', ' secondary education ', ' Secondary Schools ', ' Siblings ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' brain attack ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Apoplexy ', ' Stroke ', ' School Dropouts ', ' Student Dropouts ', ' suicidality ', ' intent to die ', ' fatal suicide ', ' fatal attempt ', ' Suicide ', ' unemployed ', ' out of work ', ' joblessness ', ' jobless ', ' Unemployment ', ' County ', ' Gender ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' insight ', ' Conscious ', ' Consciousness ', ' residence ', ' residential site ', ' Individual ', ' Policies ', ' Genetic ', ' Genetic Predisposition to Disease ', ' genetically predisposed ', ' genetic vulnerability ', ' genetic mechanism of disease ', ' genetic etiology ', ' Inherited Susceptibility ', ' Inherited Predisposition ', ' Genetic Susceptibility ', ' Genetic Predisposition ', ' Exposure to ', ' Shapes ', ' Depressed mood ', ' sadness ', ' depressed ', ' fast food ', ' convenience food ', ' instrument ', ' National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey ', ' NHANES ', ' Educational Background ', ' Education Level ', ' Adopted ', ' college ', ' collegiate ', ' preference ', ' gene environment interaction ', ' environment effect on gene ', ' GxE interaction ', ' Gene x Environment Interaction ', ' high school ', ' cohort ', ' peer ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' major depression disorder ', ' major depression ', ' clinical depression ', ' Major Depressive Disorder ', ' disease causation ', ' causation ', ' Causality ', ' Etiology ', ' Low income ', ' Advocate ', ' Data ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Genetic Risk ', ' Outcome ', ' frontier ', ' aged ', ' Natural experiment ', ' Consumption ', ' biobank ', ' biorepository ', ' population health ', ' Healthy People 2020 ', ' healthy lifestyle ', ' healthy life-style ', ' adolescent health ', ' Healthy Eating ', ' population stratification ', ' National Longitudinal Survey of Adolescent to Adult Health ', ' National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health ', ' Add Health ', ' societal costs ', ' econometrics ', ' ']",NICHD,CENTRAL MICHIGAN UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,309116,0.0644829036274226
"An adaptive treatment intervention for depression and engagement in HIV care among Latinos living with HIV 6. PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT This K01 Mentored Research Scientist Development Award will support the training of the Principal Investigator and the conduct of original research in the area of mobile health, sequential multiple assignment randomized trial designs (SMART), and implementation science. The goal of the training and research will be to treat problems with depression in sample of Latinos living with HIV. The overall goal of this K01 is to use a SMART to build an adaptive treatment strategy (ATS) that has a mobile health tool to improve adherence to the treatments for depression that are being proposed, and then evaluate the SMART and ATS through an implementation science model. The treatments being tested are a behavioral activation therapy (BAT), a cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), and mobile health (mHealth) tool (i.e., text-messaging protocol). The outcomes are to assess the feasibility of the SMART and ATS in the HIV care site and acceptability of the SMART and ATS to patients and clinic staff. To achieve the overall goal, three specific aims are outlined. Aim 1 uses qualitative research methods for the conduct of focus groups and individual interviews with HIV+ Latinos in both English and Spanish. The goal of Aim 1 is to tailor the intervention to the cultural and linguistic needs of Latinos and the organization needs of the HIV clinic study site, which informs Aim 2. Aim 1 is guided by the CDCs Map of Adaptation tailoring framework, which consist of three Action Steps. Action Step 1-3 are to better understand and document: 1) expressions for depression in Spanish and barriers to care, 2) language issues in detecting and reporting depressive symptoms, 3) cultural perspectives of how depression presents as a barrier to care, and 4) attitudes (i.e., cognitive and emotional evaluations) toward BAT and CBT, and text- message preference and confidentiality concerns to promote adherence to the intervention activities. Aim 2 is to build and test a pilot SMART. An ATS is a set of decision rules that uses detectable changes in patient health status to inform the next course of treatment. Aim 3 is to determine an adoption, implementation, and sustainability plan for adaptive depression treatment strategies into HIV care settings. Aim 3 is guided by the Capability, Opportunity, and Motivation System (COM-B) system and related Behavioral Change Wheel. This K01 attempts to maximize the clinical benefit of the BAT, CBT and mHealth programs by personalizing them to the patient. Successful completion of the proposed study will yield pilot data on the feasibility and acceptability of an ATS for depression integrated into HIV primary care, which will support the submission of an R01 full- scale efficacy trial. The results of this K01 can lead to future studies to personalize treatment interventions to enhance engagement with HIV care and mental health care for vulnerable populations. 7. PROJECT NARRATIVE Latinos are disproportionately impacted by the domestic HIV epidemic and untreated mental health problems continue to be a major public health challenge. Untreated mental health problems are driving poor outcomes along the HIV Care Continuum and impeding efforts to reduce health disparities and new infections.

"Palliative care intervention for socioeconomically disadvantaged cancer patients ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Socioeconomic disadvantage is associated with a greater likelihood of being diagnosed with cancer, delays in cancer diagnosis, receiving less treatment, decreased access to palliative care and hospice services, and increased mortality. Although interventions have been developed to reduce the incidence of cancer and delays in diagnosis in those from socioeconomically disadvantaged backgrounds; few interventions exist to improve access to palliative care and hospice services for individuals with the least resources and greatest needs for these services. The NIH consensus statement on cancer-related symptoms concluded that the most common and debilitating are depression, pain and fatigue. Our team has observed that people from socioeconomically disadvantaged backgrounds with advanced cancer have disproportionately higher levels of depression, pain and fatigue and poorer quality of life than patients who reported higher socioeconomic status (SES). Although the comorbidity of these symptoms is well known, no intervention has been developed to reduce these symptoms concurrently. Experience from our successful pilot study of a web-based stepped collaborative care intervention for cancer patients from predominantly socioeconomically disadvantaged backgrounds, revealed that patients randomized to the intervention arm, reported statistically significant reductions in depression, pain, and fatigue an improved quality of life when compared to patients randomized to enhanced usual care (K07CA118576). Furthermore, patients randomized to the intervention had decreased serum levels of Interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, IL-8 and improved survival (R21CA127046). Post-hoc analyses revealed that family caregivers, of patients randomized to the intervention arm, had reductions in stress and depression, when compared to caregivers with spouses/partners randomized to enhanced usual care (K07CA118576S1). There is an urgent need to develop scalable, effective, and, cost-effective interventions, particularly for those who are socioeconomically disadvantaged. We plan to test a web-based stepped collaborative care intervention with 450 advanced cancer patients and their spousal or intimate partners in the context of a randomized controlled trial. The specific aims are: (1) to test the efficacy of a web-based stepped collaborative care intervention to reduce symptoms of depression, pain, and fatigue and improve health-related quality of life (HRQL) in advanced cancer patients when compared to patients randomized to the education and support arm; (2) to examine if advanced cancer patients randomized to the web-based stepped collaborative care intervention have reductions in biomarkers of inflammation and explore if these patients have slowed disease progression and improved survival when compared to patients in the education and support arm; (3) to investigate whether the spouses or intimate partners, of patients randomized to the web-based stepped collaborative care intervention, have reduced stress and depression, better HRQL and fewer risk factors for CVD than caregivers with spouses/partners randomized to education and support arm. In accordance with the goals of Healthy People 2020 ""to achieve health equity, eliminate disparities, and improve the health of all groups, regardless of differences that occur by gender, race or ethnicity, education or income, disability, geographic location, or sexual orientation"" this proposed web-based stepped collaborative care intervention was designed to improve HRQL for those in greatest need and least access to palliative care. This innovative and scalable web-based stepped collaborative care intervention is expected to improve patients' and caregivers' HRQL and potentially reduce mortality. Findings are expected to lead to studies examining scalability and cost-effectiveness of the proposed intervention. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Socioeconomic disadvantage is associated with a greater likelihood of being diagnosed with cancer, delays in cancer diagnosis, receiving less treatment, decreased access to palliative care and hospice services, and increased mortality. Although interventions have been developed to reduce the incidence of cancer and delays in diagnosis in those from socioeconomically disadvantaged backgrounds; few interventions exist to improve access to palliative care for individuals with the least resources and greatest needs for these services. Our team has shown that socioeconomically disadvantaged advanced cancer patients have disproportionally higher levels of depression, pain, fatigue and poorer quality of life. The pilot study testing the web- based collaborative care intervention demonstrated significant reductions in these symptoms and biomarkers of inflammation. Further, we observed reductions in the patients' spouse or partners' levels of stress and depression.

"Telehealth Treatments for Depression with Low-Income Homebound Seniors ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long-term objective of the proposed study is to improve access to depression treatments for low-income, racially diverse homebound seniors, a population experiencing significant disparities in mental health care due to their homebound and low-income status. Specific aims are to compare the acceptability, clinical effectiveness, treatment cost, and budget impact of the two teledelivered treatment delivery models: problem- solving therapy (PST) by licensed clinicians and self-care management (SCM) support by trained lay mental health workers/advisors. The interventionists will be integrated into an aging-service agency; hence, integrated tele-PST (IT-PST) ad integrated tele-SCM (IT-SCM). Although tele-psychotherapy is likely to be an effective mental health service delivery model for the target population, the current and projected shortage of such clinicians and the costs of deploying highly trained professionals pose barriers to this model's widespread real- world adoption and sustainability. A more plausible option may indeed have to utilize trained lay mental health workers. The study participants will be 276 low-income, racially diverse homebound seniors who are served by a home-delivered meal (HDM) program and other aging-service agencies in Austin, Tex. In a 3-arm, pragmatic clinical trial with randomization prior to consent (a preferred public health approach), the participants will receive five sessions of IT-PST, five sessions of IT-SCM, or five telephone check-in calls (for the usual care- UC-group). Our first hypothesis is that IT-PST and IT-SCM will be equally acceptable to the participants. Our second hypothesis is that both IT-PST and IT-SCM will be more effective than UC in reducing depressive symptoms, although IT-PST may be more effective than IT-SCM. Symptoms will be assessed with the 24-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD) at 12, 24, and 36 weeks after baseline. Additional outcomes will be depression-free days (DFDs) and disability (WHODAS 2.0). Our third hypothesis is that IT-SCM will have a lower delivery cost than IT-PST, but both IT-PST and IT-SCM will be more cost-effective than usual care. The analyses include (a) comparisons of delivery costs between IT-PST and IT-SCM; (b) assessment of cost- effectiveness (CEA) based on DFDs and health-related quality adjusted life-year measured by EuroQol-5 (EQ- 5D); and (3) budget impact (BIA) of IT-PST relative to IT-SCM. Both CEA and BIA will employ a hybrid public program perspective of the AoA and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid. Public health significance of this study is that the data will help aging-service providers and funders assess respective strengths and weaknesses of each model as a sustainable approach to providing depression care for an underserved and growing population group and improving their access to evidence-based mental health services. (We use the terms older adults and seniors interchangeably because the latter term is frequently used in aging services.) PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Significance This study aims to find an effective and sustainable approach to reducing disparities in accessing mental health services for an underserved and growing population group of low-income, racially diverse, homebound older adults. It will compare two aging-service integrated, tele delivered depression treatments for these seniors. One model is short-term problem-solving therapy by licensed clinicians; the second model is self-care management support by trained lay advisors.

"Reducing depressive symptoms among rural African Americans: REJOICE. ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Rural African Americans are disproportionately exposed to numerous stressors such as poverty, racism, and discrimination that place them at risk for experiencing elevated levels of depressive symptoms. Elevated levels of depressive symptoms can lead to a host of negative outcomes including both the development of and poor management of chronic illnesses (i.e., hypertension, diabetes, etc.), poor social functioning, poor occupational functioning, and development of clinical depression. Though effective treatments for decreasing depressive symptoms exist, rural African Americans often fail to receive adequate and timely care. African American churches have been identified as potential venues for providing depression education and treatment for rural African Americans. Within the African American rural community, churches represent a key portal through which a large proportion (as much as 85%) of the African American community can be reached. Churches have been used to address physical health outcomes in those communities but few have focused primarily on addressing mental health outcomes. Through the NIMHD-funded project entitled, ""Faith Academic Initiatives to Transform Health (FAITH) in the Delta"", our partnership, consisting of faith community leaders and UAMS researchers, culturally adapted an evidence-based behavioral activation intervention for use with rural African American churches. This 8- session behavioral activation therapy was adapted to include faith-based themes, Scripture, and other aspects of the rural African American faith culture (e.g., Bible studies, use of lay leaders o deliver the intervention). In addition to assessing the effectiveness of our intervention, ascertaining ways to implement this intervention with proper fidelity to maintain clinical outcomes is also critically important to increase the efficiency of translating research into practice. Work towards disseminating evidence-based depression interventions to ""real world"" settings is particularly salient in addressing depression disparities, whereby rural African Americans bear a disproportionate burden. Thus, this application proposes a Hybrid-2 pragmatic-effectiveness implementation trial that seeks to test the effectiveness of the culturally adapted evidence-based intervention and gather preliminary data on the strategies necessary to support successful implementation of this intervention in rural African American churches. Specifically, this study aims to: 1) Refine a culturally appropriate, evidence-based depression intervention (REJOICE) based on results from our NIMHD-funded pilot study, 2) Determine whether REJOICE is superior to a usual-care control group at post treatment and a 3-month follow-up, 3) Collect pilot data regarding ""real world"" implementation strategies (i.e. face to fac training and coaching calls) on the uptake and maintenance of REJOICE in rural African American churches.

"Recurrent Hemorrhagic Stroke in Minority Populations ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cerebral small vessel disease (CSVD) is a common, progressive condition of aging, and a leading contributor to age-related disability due to stroke, cognitive decline, late-life onset depression and gait deterioration. In most cases the underlying vessel pathology can be classified as one of the two most common subtypes, arteriolosclerosis (AS) and cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA). Although classically recognized as white matter changes on MRI, CSVD frequently comes to clinical attention for the first time when a patient presents with intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). Discovering the biological underpinnings of CSVD is a vital next step toward development of effective preventative strategies. Because their CSVD is uniformly severe, ICH survivors are ideal subjects in which to study CSVD and also form the group most likely to benefit from novel therapies. The proposed studies are motivated by the striking observation that ICH disproportionately affects African- American (AA) and Hispanic-American (HA) populations. Our preliminary analyses demonstrate that these differences extend to post-ICH risk for recurrent ICH, cognitive decline and late-life depression and that blood pressure (BP) may play a fundamental role in these differences. Our revised proposal, best titled ""Longitudinal Follow-up of ICH Survivors in ERICH,"" will systematically determine whether 1) AA and HA are predisposed to CSVD of all types, 2) are predisposed solely to increased risk of AS, or 3) have no inherent predisposition but, through the effects of BP suffer more severe CSVD. To test the central hypothesis that discovering the mechanisms for this health disparity ICH will yield biological insights for CSVD, advance the search for treatments and have impact at the bedside, we propose to leverage the soon- to-conclude Ethnic/Racial Variations of ICH (ERICH) study to perform longitudinal follow-up of a cohort of 900 ICH survivors (300 each of AA, HA, and NHW), recruited in the last two years of ERICH, who have had neuroimaging, genetic, epidemiologic, and socio-ethnic variables ascertained at time of enrollment. Subjects will be followed by telephone every 6 months according to established and validated protocols. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Cerebral small vessel disease (CSVD) is a common, progressive condition of aging, and a leading contributor to age-related disability due to stroke, cognitive decline, gait deterioration, and late-life depression. The most severe and acute manifestation of CSVD is intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), which is frequently the sentinel event that brings a patient's CSVD to clinical attention for the first time. ICH and CSVD affect African-American and Hispanic individuals differently compared to non-Hispanic Whites. The proposed study seeks to better characterize the mechanisms for this health disparity by determining why African-American and Hispanic survivors of ICH are at higher risk of recurrent ICH, cognitive decline and incident depression, all of which are manifestations of progressive CSVD.",Recurrent Hemorrhagic Stroke in Minority Populations,9617817,R01NS093870,"['Affect ', ' Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aging ', ' Attention ', ' Biology ', ' Blood Pressure ', ' Intracerebral Hemorrhage ', ' Cerebrum Hemorrhage ', ' Cerebral Parenchymal Hemorrhage ', ' Cerebral Hemorrhage ', ' Cerebral Brain Hemorrhage ', ' Cerebral hemisphere hemorrhage ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' Gait ', ' Spanish Americans ', ' Hispanic Americans ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' high blood pressure ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Hypertension ', ' Investments ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' MRI ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MR Imaging ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' Pathology ', ' Patients ', ' Play ', ' Recurrent ', ' Recurrence ', ' Risk ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' brain attack ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Apoplexy ', ' Stroke ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Phone ', ' Telephone ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Measures ', ' cerebrovascular amyloidosis ', ' Congophilic Angiopathy ', ' Cerebral Amyloid Angiopathy ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Hispanics ', ' Acute ', ' Clinical ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Biological ', ' Survivors ', ' Predisposition ', ' Susceptibility ', ' disability ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Genetic ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' cognitive loss ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Life ', ' Severities ', ' Event ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' Brain hemorrhage ', ' hemorrhagic stroke ', ' American ', ' cohort ', ' blood pressure regulation ', ' regulate blood pressure ', ' regulate BP ', ' blood pressure management ', ' blood pressure homeostasis ', ' blood pressure control ', ' BP regulation ', ' BP management ', ' BP homeostasis ', ' BP control ', ' neuroimaging ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' Prevention strategy ', ' Preventive strategy ', ' Preventative strategy ', ' Deterioration ', ' Sentinel ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' Nonhispanic ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' follow-up ', ' followup ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' active followup ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' geriatric depression ', ' late life depression ', ' Elderly depression ', ' age related ', ' age dependent ', ' Minority ', ' Population ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' novel therapeutics ', ' novel therapy ', ' novel drugs ', ' novel drug treatments ', ' next generation therapeutics ', ' new therapy ', ' new therapeutics ', ' new drugs ', ' new drug treatments ', ' white matter change ', ' high risk ', ' public health relevance ', ' clinical risk ', ' personalized approach ', ' tailored approach ', ' precision approach ', ' individualized approach ', ' Personalized medical approach ', ' histopathological examination ', ' histopathologic examination ', ' Cerebral small vessel disease ', ' cerebral small vessel disorder ', ' recruit ', ' ']",NINDS,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R01,2019,554637,-0.036338122988385554
"TRANSFORM DEPCARE: A Theoretical approach to improving patient engagement and shared decision making for minorities in collaborative depression care The goal of this proposal is to test whether an electronic shared decision making (eSDM) tool can increase the uptake of collaborative care (CC) for depression in primary care. Depression is projected to be the second largest contributor to chronic disease burden in the world by 2030, and contributes to disparities in quality of life and mortality. CC integrates primary and behavioral health through depression care managers who provide antidepressant adherence counseling and/or psychotherapy. CC doubles the rate of depression remission in comparison to primary care provider-led depression treatment alone, particularly in racial and ethnic minorities, and results in a 24% reduction in mortality and nearly $1300 in net annual savings per patient. Despite this model's potential to improve access to mental health, implementation efforts reveal low provider CC referral rates and low patient engagement rates of 9-50%, particularly in minority patients.  To identify factors contributing to poor patient engagement in CC, we conducted focus groups in 8 healthcare systems implementing CC, representing 33 clinics and 1 million predominantly Medicaid, minority patients. We learned that key physician-level barriers included limited time/resources to discuss treatment options and conduct “warm handoffs” to care managers; patient-level barriers included poor knowledge of treatment options, miscommunication, stigma, language barriers, and low motivation. We applied a theory- informed process of engaging stakeholders to select an acceptable, feasible intervention and determined that SDM would target the greatest number of barriers to CC engagement. SDM involves a collaborative process whereby providers and patients make health decision together, and is a proven approach for improving depression treatment initiation and guideline concordant care, particularly in minorities, but widespread use has been limited by time and resources. Accordingly, we developed and alpha tested an iPad delivered, video-assisted, interactive eSDM tool that would reduce barriers to SDM uptake and target CC engagement.  We hypothesize that a state-of-the-art eSDM tool that automates the SDM process, activates providers, staff, and patients and interfaces with the electronic health record will improve efficient CC enrollment (primary outcome). We propose to refine and adapt the eSDM prototype (Aim 1) and conduct a stepped wedge trial across 4 primary care medical homes to assess the effectiveness of implementing our eSDM tool on provider behavior (Aim 2), patient enrollment in CC (Aim 3), patient adherence to depression treatment (therapy or antidepressants) and depressive symptoms (Exploratory Aims) amongst 1440 primary care patients in our healthcare system. Our study has the potential to produce a theory-informed, scalable eSDM tool that improves the reach of CC programs and potentially other team-based approaches. Collaborative care for depression (CC), a team based approach to integrating primary and behavioral health, is effective in reducing depressive symptoms, but implementation has been hindered by suboptimal provider referral and patient engagement rates. Shared decision-making (SDM) is a promising approach for improving engagement in primary care settings but is limited by time and resources. We propose to automate the SDM process through an electronic SDM tool and to conduct a stepped wedge trial in our healthcare system (CC + SDM versus CC) to assess the effectiveness of eSDM on provider behavior and patient engagement in CC.",TRANSFORM DEPCARE: A Theoretical approach to improving patient engagement and shared decision making for minorities in collaborative depression care,9750127,R01HS025198,[''],AHRQ,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2019,383128,0.1497279454167799
"Optimizing Diabetes Care Quality for Low-Income Patients This K23 award will establish the candidate, Dr. Elizabeth Rogers, as an independent physician-investigator with expertise in development, implementation, and evaluation of patient-centered primary care interventions that are strategically designed to address patient complexity – both medical and social – to optimize care for low-income patients with multiple chronic diseases. Most of the 29.1 million Americans with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) have at least one additional chronic condition, but existing management guidelines fail to account for patient complexity. Despite evidence of effective clinic-based interventions, diabetes care quality remains low, particularly in safety net settings serving patients with low incomes, who are disproportionately racial and ethnic minorities, and who carry a larger burden of chronic disease. Until patient complexity factors are meaningfully addressed with specific, pragmatic interventions, patients with comorbid T2DM will remain at risk for poor-quality care. To address this critical need, Dr. Rogers's K23 project will identify key clinic and patient influences on care quality by using a “cumulative complexity model” as a framework. This model focuses on patients' experiences of (1) “workload” (disease-specific work such as attending appointments and self-care, plus “life” demands such as job, family, and transportation) and (2) “capacity” (e.g. fatigue and physical symptoms, plus factors such as literacy, finances, and social support). The project will be conducted in urban Minnesota clinics that are certified Patient-Centered Medical Homes and part of the Hennepin County Medical Center's safety net care system. After stratifying clinics by diabetes care quality, researchers will administer clinician and staff surveys in 3 high- and 3 low-scoring clinics to identify clinic resources associated with optimal diabetes care quality (Aim 1). They will conduct surveys and in-depth interviews with “at-risk” patients from these sites to discern their perspectives on social vulnerabilities that impede their engagement in care and specific clinic resources that are helpful in overcoming these obstacles (Aim 2). They will apply these results using the multiphase optimization strategy (MOST, used to design effective and efficient interventions) to develop and pilot test a clinic-based, multi-component behavioral intervention – one engineered to reduce patient workload, augment patient capacity, and thereby optimize patient-centered care for complex patients with T2DM and depression (Aim 3). A robust training plan, closely aligned with the research plan, will support the development of Dr. Rogers's expertise in patient-centered outcomes research, mixed methodology, and clinic-based intervention development and evaluation. She will be supported by a multidisciplinary team of mentors with expertise in these areas as well as in diabetes, depression, and multimorbidity, and with strong links to community stakeholders. This proposal addresses NIDDK priorities by positioning Dr. Rogers to advance patient-centeredness and improve care quality for patients at risk of experiencing low quality of care, and to test practical and sustainable strategies for improving care delivery and health outcomes in diabetes. PROJECT NARRATIVE Managing diabetes along with co-occurring chronic conditions is a common problem for low-income patients, many of whom also experience social vulnerabilities. Improving the quality of diabetes care in the clinics serving this patient population requires both clinic- and patient-level initiatives.

"Identification and Prediction of Peripartum Depression from Natural Language Collected in a Mobile Health App PROJECT SUMMARY Background: Depression during pregnancy and the postpartum period affects up to 15% of US mothers, imposing costs on mother, child, and society. Early detection can significantly reduce the incidence of depression, yet depressive symptoms are often missed during prenatal visits, which tend to focus on maternal and fetal physical health, leaving less time for maternal mental health. Even if mental health is addressed during prenatal care, women may not feel comfortable answering questions that are perceived to be embarrassing or invasive. Failing to detect depression is even more likely during the postpartum period due to infrequent physician visits once the baby has been born. Measurement in the form of daily journals, which can be analyzed using natural language processing, can promote early and more frequent detection of depression during pregnancy and the postpartum period. Study Aims: 1) Model which dynamic features of language used over time best predict changes in depression status in the pregnancy and postpartum periods, creating phenotypes of depression risk; 2) examine how the language patterns that predict depression differ for African-American and Caucasian women; and 3) identify the relationship between the characteristics of what depressed peripartum women say and their treatment-seeking behavior. Innovation: The proposed research is innovative in its use of high frequency natural language measurements, captured in daily journals using a smartphone app, combined with advances in natural language processing models, to assess the onset and trajectory of depression during pregnancy and the postpartum period. This is the first prospective longitudinal study using natural language collection for risk prediction in a clinical population and the first to: 1) characterize the critical topics women discuss during the peripartum period over time using open-ended journals; 2) evaluate multiple facets of language to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the relationship between language and depression; 3) use a longitudinal design approach allowing for optimal modeling of language changes associated with depression onset. Methodology and Expected Results: Monthly depression risk identified from the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale. will be collected through the MyHealthyPregnancy smartphone app, a mobile health application developed through close collaboration between decision scientists, clinicians, statisticians, and local peripartum women. A daily journal embedded in the MyHealthyPregnancy app will collect natural language text from the participants for 10 months (from their first prenatal visit through two months postpartum). Using three distinct natural language processing algorithmic approaches, this study will characterize how the natural language used by peripartum women in their daily journal entries is connected to the onset and experience of peripartum depression, as measured through monthly-administered depression scales. Group- based trajectory modeling will then classify women according to the patterns in their depression scores over time. Potential Impact: This work lays the foundation for developing and evaluating real-time interventions that could be deployed at scale to women who are using language that signals high depression risk. PROJECT NARRATIVE This research will examine how the topics (the people and events mentioned), sentiment (the positive, negative, and neutral affect), and other aspects of language expressed in daily journal entries correspond to diagnostic measures of depression and treatment-seeking in a peripartum clinical population. Psychometric and daily journal entry data will be gathered through an existing smartphone app, MyHealthyPregnancy, which monitors risk and delivers actionable information as part of routine prenatal

"African-American Social Support Effectiveness Treatment- Partners Alleviating Perinatal Depression (ASSET-PPD) Project Summary/Abstract  This Exploratory/Developmental Research Grant Program (R21) addresses perinatal depression in African- American (AA) women. AA mothers have a higher risk for perinatal depression than Caucasian women that is attributable to increased socio-environmental stressors. AA women have poor healthcare utilization and compliance with psychiatric treatment compared to Caucasian women. An intervention is required to supplement and support the clinical objectives of the mother’s depression care without requiring the mother’s direct involvement. Fathers are an underutilized resource to reduce the mother’s environmental stress and encourage healthy maternal behaviors. The PI will test the African-American Social Support Effectiveness Treatment- Partners alleviating Perinatal Depression (ASSET-PPD) protocol, a supplemental intervention to maternal perinatal psychiatric treatment. ASSET-PPD will target the fathers’ support of the mothers’ mental health treatment and their active engagement in the family to reduce maternal stress.  The ASSET-PPD intervention will be designed to have 4 active modules that address key factors to reduce maternal stress during the prenatal period and 2 postpartum review sessions. ASSET-PPD is designed as individual sessions. The intervention is based on the theoretical models of the stress-generation and cognitive- behavior theories. The modules will be individual sessions constructed to provide training, information, and behavioral assignments to increase fathers’: 1) prenatal and postpartum family involvement; 2) mental health psychoeducation; 3) interparental communication and relationship skills; and 4) balanced division of family tasks. A post-intervention focus group of mothers and fathers will inform the PI of the utility and acceptability of the intervention. In addition, a panel of subject matter experts will be part of an external advisory board to provide feedback on the intervention development. The finalization of the manual will be executed based on the intervention’s performance, and the focus groups’ and advisory board’s feedback.  ASSET-PPD will be evaluated in a pilot RCT with 50 cohabitating fathers and AA mothers who will be randomized into the ASSET-PPD intervention or the comparator group. Fathers only will participate in the intervention, and mothers and fathers will complete measures of mental health and parental experiences. Maternal depressive symptoms will be assessed as a primary outcome, and breastfeeding and parent-infant interactions will be assessed as secondary outcomes to inform the utility of the selected measures for a future large-scale RCT. The objective of this protocol is to: 1) assess the acceptability of the intervention to couples; 2) determine the recruitment rate; 3) evaluate the utility of each module’s key components; 4) assess the adequacy of each measure to evaluate the outcomes targeted by the interventions; and 5) determine whether the pilot data warrant a large-scale RCT.

Disparities in depression screening contribute to poor clinical outcomes, as AAs with depression are more disabled, sicker longer, and less likely to seek treatment compared to Whites. Black churches are trusted settings that provide “de facto” mental health services for depression. Indeed, in the first study of its kind, the study team found that 20% of adults in Black churches screened positive for depression using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9). However, no subjects with a positive screen (PHQ-9 ≥10) accepted a treatment referral when offered by research coordinators onsite for each screening. Community Health Workers (CHWs), who are trusted para-professionals from the target community, may bridge the gap between depression screening and treatment. We have trained and certified 102 CHWs from 42 Black churches in Harlem to deliver an evidence-based intervention called Screening, Brief Intervention, and Referral to Treatment (SBIRT), which is centered on culturally tailored Motivational Interviewing (MI). Thus, the scientific premise of this study is that employing CHWs to implement depression screening in Black churches will bridge the gap between church-based depression-screening and engagement with clinical providers. Using a Hybrid Type 1 Effectiveness- Implementation design, we propose a 2-arm, mixed-methods Cluster-Randomized Controlled Trial within 30 Black churches our CHWs currently attend. Based on our pilot data, we expect 20% of adults (n=600) to have a positive depression screen. Adults will be randomized based on church study site to either SBIRT (n=15 churches) or Referral As Usual (RAU, n=15 churches). We will then compare the effectiveness of SBIRT (Intervention arm) to RAU (Usual Care arm) on treatment engagement (primary outcome), defined as attending a depression-related clinical visit for which the subject reported receiving information, referral, counseling, or medication for depression (Aim 1). We will then compare changes in Mental Health Related Quality of Life and depressive symptoms (secondary outcomes) at 3- and 6-months post-screening (Aim 2). Finally, we will conduct a concurrent, mixed-methods (qualitative-quantitative) process evaluation to assess contextual facilitators and barriers of screening and referral (Aim 3). This study has potential for large-scale public health impact as 20 to 22 million Americans attend the 65,000 to 70,000 Black churches in the U.S. PROJECT NARRATIVE The overall aim of this study is to employ Community Health Workers (CHWs) to screen for depression in 30 Black churches and compare the effectiveness of Screening, Brief Intervention, and Referral to Treatment (SBIRT) (Intervention arm) to Referral As Usual (Control arm) on treatment engagement. We will assess patient-level outcomes (Mental-Health Related Quality of Life and depressive symptoms) at 3- and 6-months post-screening and conduct a mixed-methods process evaluation to assess multi-level facilitators and barriers of screening uptake.

"Optimizing Diabetes Care Quality for Low-Income Patients This K23 award will establish the candidate, Dr. Elizabeth Rogers, as an independent physician-investigator with expertise in development, implementation, and evaluation of patient-centered primary care interventions that are strategically designed to address patient complexity – both medical and social – to optimize care for low-income patients with multiple chronic diseases. Most of the 29.1 million Americans with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) have at least one additional chronic condition, but existing management guidelines fail to account for patient complexity. Despite evidence of effective clinic-based interventions, diabetes care quality remains low, particularly in safety net settings serving patients with low incomes, who are disproportionately racial and ethnic minorities, and who carry a larger burden of chronic disease. Until patient complexity factors are meaningfully addressed with specific, pragmatic interventions, patients with comorbid T2DM will remain at risk for poor-quality care. To address this critical need, Dr. Rogers's K23 project will identify key clinic and patient influences on care quality by using a “cumulative complexity model” as a framework. This model focuses on patients' experiences of (1) “workload” (disease-specific work such as attending appointments and self-care, plus “life” demands such as job, family, and transportation) and (2) “capacity” (e.g. fatigue and physical symptoms, plus factors such as literacy, finances, and social support). The project will be conducted in urban Minnesota clinics that are certified Patient-Centered Medical Homes and part of the Hennepin County Medical Center's safety net care system. After stratifying clinics by diabetes care quality, researchers will administer clinician and staff surveys in 3 high- and 3 low-scoring clinics to identify clinic resources associated with optimal diabetes care quality (Aim 1). They will conduct surveys and in-depth interviews with “at-risk” patients from these sites to discern their perspectives on social vulnerabilities that impede their engagement in care and specific clinic resources that are helpful in overcoming these obstacles (Aim 2). They will apply these results using the multiphase optimization strategy (MOST, used to design effective and efficient interventions) to develop and pilot test a clinic-based, multi-component behavioral intervention – one engineered to reduce patient workload, augment patient capacity, and thereby optimize patient-centered care for complex patients with T2DM and depression (Aim 3). A robust training plan, closely aligned with the research plan, will support the development of Dr. Rogers's expertise in patient-centered outcomes research, mixed methodology, and clinic-based intervention development and evaluation. She will be supported by a multidisciplinary team of mentors with expertise in these areas as well as in diabetes, depression, and multimorbidity, and with strong links to community stakeholders. This proposal addresses NIDDK priorities by positioning Dr. Rogers to advance patient-centeredness and improve care quality for patients at risk of experiencing low quality of care, and to test practical and sustainable strategies for improving care delivery and health outcomes in diabetes. PROJECT NARRATIVE Managing diabetes along with co-occurring chronic conditions is a common problem for low-income patients, many of whom also experience social vulnerabilities. Improving the quality of diabetes care in the clinics serving this patient population requires both clinic- and patient-level initiatives. We will develop and pilot test a multi-component, patient-centered intervention intended to address this complexity in patients with diabetes and depression.",Optimizing Diabetes Care Quality for

"Perinatal Social Support in Underserved and Minority Populations Over half a million childbearing individuals in the United States (US) each year experience perinatal (pre- and postpartum) depression. When combined with other perinatal mood and anxiety disorders, this illness costs society upwards of $14.2 billion in productivity losses, healthcare expenditures, and other costs. Some key risk factors for perinatal depression include a history of depression and low levels of social support. Sexual and gender minorities (SGM) are a growing population disproportionally affected by depression and social isolation due to the discrimination that stems from having a marginalized identity. Discrimination may similarly increase the risk for perinatal depressive symptoms and other adverse outcomes among SGM gestational parents; however, little is known about their perinatal health as they are an understudied perinatal population.  SGM gestational parents include pregnant or postpartum individuals assigned female at birth who identify as a sexual minority (e.g., a lesbian or bisexual woman), a transmasculine individual (e.g., a self-identified man, transgender man, or non-binary person), or both (e.g., a gay, transgender man). Approximately 2.6-8.7 million SGMs have biological children, and population estimates of SGM gestational parents continue to rise. The scant studies on SGM gestational parents have been primarily limited to small, cross-sectional samples of lesbian or bisexual woman outside the US, yet preliminary findings indicate profound loneliness and social isolation, as well as postpartum depression at rates twice as high as heterosexual women. Social support has been a promising modifiable target for intervention to prevent or reduce the length and intensity of perinatal depression. Yet, the specific sources, settings, and types of social support that protect heterosexual women from perinatal depression are often not available to or inclusive of SGMs due to high rates of estrangement from biological families and anticipatory fear of experiencing rejection and discrimination in public settings.  To address these gaps, the specific aims of this longitudinal, qualitative study are to: (1) describe multidimensional social support among SGM gestational parents across the perinatal period, and (2) characterize SGM gestational parents' perceptions of gaps in and assets of perinatal social support through photos. We will achieve these aims through three online, descriptive, semi-structured interviews across six months complemented with modified photovoice methods, an established visual elicitation method that allows participants to capture and share their experiences through photos. Findings may provide valuable insights on how discrimination influences the multidimensional aspects of perinatal social support SGMs experience at multiple levels of their social environment. This research aligns with the NINR wellness area of scientific focus and will lay the foundation for this predoctoral applicant's program of research by generating foundational knowledge for developing and testing future culturally-competent, community-based social support intervention studies to prevent illness (reduce the risk for perinatal depressive symptoms) in a health disparity population. PROJECT NARRATIVE Perinatal (pre- and postpartum) depression is among the leading health conditions of all childbearing populations and a costly public health issue, yet sexual and gender minorities (SGM) are at-risk and understudied in perinatal research; relatively little is known about their health outcomes, particularly their risk for perinatal depressive symptoms. This research will characterize the multidimensional aspects of social support experiences (a modifiable risk factor for perinatal depressive symptoms) among SGM childbearing parents across the perinatal period in the United States. Results may inform future community-based intervention studies with an overall goal of reducing perinatal health disparities among this underrepresented minority population.",Perinatal Social Support in Underserved and Minority Populations,9988055,F31NR019203,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Affect ', ' Anxiety Disorders ', ' Attitude ', ' Award ', ' Birth ', ' Parturition ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' children ', "" childrens' "", ' youngster ', ' Communities ', ' Complement ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Eligibility Determination ', ' Eligibility ', ' Protocol Screening ', ' Environment ', ' Health Expenditures ', ' health care expenditure ', ' healthcare expenditure ', ' Family ', ' Fright ', ' Fear ', ' Female ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Gender Identity ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' intervention research ', ' interventional research ', ' interventional study ', ' interventions research ', ' Interview ', ' Legal Rights ', ' Loneliness ', ' lonely ', ' Maternal Mortality ', ' maternal death ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Persons ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Nurses ', ' nurse ', ' Parents ', ' Perception ', ' Pregnancy ', ' Gestation ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Social Change ', ' Social modification ', ' Social transformation ', ' Social Environment ', ' social climate ', ' social context ', ' socioenvironment ', ' socioenvironmental ', ' Social isolation ', ' Social support ', ' social support network ', ' Societies ', ' Stress ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Testing ', ' United States ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Friends ', ' Emotional Depression ', ' depression symptom ', ' depressive ', ' depressive symptoms ', ' Postpartum ', ' post-partum ', ' Postpartum Period ', ' TimeLine ', ' Disease Costs ', ' Sickness Cost ', ' Cost of Illness ', ' base ', ' Bi-sexual ', ' Bisexual ', ' Peripartum ', ' Perinatal ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Biological ', ' Training ', ' Post-Natal Depression ', ' Post-Partum Depression ', ' Postnatal Depression ', ' Postpartum Depression ', ' insight ', ' Visual ', ' Individual ', ' Populations at Risk ', ' Gays ', ' Lesbian ', ' Reproductive Health ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Source ', ' Affective Disorders ', ' Mood Disorders ', ' interest ', ' experience ', ' Neural Development ', ' neurodevelopment ', ' Structure ', ' Participant ', ' social ', ' Health Care Technology ', ' Healthcare Technology ', ' Health Technology ', ' Emotional ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' stigma ', ' social stigma ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' Length ', ' Videoconferences ', ' Sexual Health ', ' Data ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Underrepresented Ethnic Minority ', ' under-representation of minorities ', ' underrepresentation of minorities ', ' Underrepresented Minority ', ' sex ', ' Heterosexuals ', ' productivity loss ', ' cost ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' bear children ', ' bearing children ', ' childbearing ', ' child bearing ', ' pre-doc ', ' predoc ', ' predoctoral ', ' pre-doctoral ', ' modifiable risk ', "" man's "", ' man ', ' perinatal health ', ' stem ', ' high risk ', ' pregnant ', ' community setting ', ' social health determinants ', ' adverse consequence ', ' adverse outcome ', ' sexual minority ', ' Homophobic ', ' Homophobia ', ' trans-men ', ' transman ', ' transmen ', ' transgender men ', ' Gender and Sexual Minorities ', ' Sexual and Gender Minorities ', ' transphobic ', ' transphobia ', ' perinatal depression ', ' peripartum depression ', ' on-line community ', ' virtual community ', ' online community ', ' cis-gender ', ' cisgender ', ' underserved minority ', ' recruit ', ' protective factors ', ' perinatal phase ', ' perinatal period ', ' transmasculine ', ' perinatal women ', ' adverse birth outcomes ', ' ']",NINR,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,F31,2020,45520,0.09464558672330937
"Remote Supervision for Implementing Collaborative Care for Perinatal Depression ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Depression is a common and serious disorder among pregnant women but few from low income groups receive effective treatment. The highly evidence based collaborative care (CC) model for depression has been shown to work for women in pregnancy but has not been widely implemented. In cases where large scale pragmatic implementation of this innovation has been attempted there has been great variation in the success at individual health centers. A major obstacle to achieving the same success in large scale efforts to implement this care innovation as is seen in more controlled effectiveness trials is the limit of resources available to support the staff members carrying out this care. Although ongoing support in the form of training, technical assistance, quality improvement, and tools has been found to improve implementation and patient outcomes through longitudinal consultation by content experts in the health innovation being implemented most implementation efforts rely primarily on brief intensive training for staff. These content experts are complementary but distinct from general practice facilitators that address general processes that are applicable to implementation of any innovation. In order to achieve the potential public health benefits of CC an efficient and scalable model of longitudinal consultation may be needed to facilitate its effective implementation. We propose a pragmatic cluster randomized trial of longitudinal remote consultation (LRC) utilizing video conferencing to efficiently link providers to consultants who provide timely feedback and training. We plan to use a Hybrid Type III implementation design with a focus on implementation outcomes but also clinical outcomes. The proposed study will involve twenty federally qualified health centers (FQHCs) providing prenatal care and which are part of the national OCHIN Network with a shared electronic health record. All sites will receive a standard multifaceted approach to implementation used in many current broad implementation efforts. After pre-implementation training ten of the sites will be randomly selected to receive the LRC. Implementation and clinical outcomes as well as costs will be compared between the study conditions after a 12 month implementation period and a 13-21 month sustainment period. The results of the proposed study will provide critical generalizable knowledge regarding the benefits of ongoing consultation for implementation of complex interventions like collaborative care. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We plan to carry out a rigorous pragmatic evaluation of the Longitudinal Remote Consultation (LRC) implementation strategy to improve implementation and patient outcomes from team based collaborative care for perinatal depression in federally qualified health centers (FQHCs). LRC improves implementation of evidence based practices for mental health care provided by individual providers but has not been assessed for complex interventions such as collaborative care. Because of the negative impact of perinatal depression, particularly on low income women and their families seen in FQHCs, this promising strategy has great potential for public health impact nationally.",Remote Supervision for Implementing Collaborative Care for Perinatal Depression,9923752,R01MH108548,"['Affect ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' psychological disorder ', ' Birth ', ' Parturition ', ' Consultations ', ' Cost Analysis ', ' Cost Analyses ', ' assess cost ', ' cost assessment ', ' cost effectiveness ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Elements ', ' Family ', ' Feedback ', ' Health ', ' Hybrids ', ' Infant ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Health Services ', ' Mental Hygiene Services ', ' Patients ', ' Pregnancy ', ' Gestation ', ' Pregnant Women ', ' expectant mother ', ' expecting mother ', ' pregnant mothers ', ' Prenatal care ', ' pregnancy care ', ' prenatal appointment ', ' prenatal checkup ', ' prenatal visit ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Primary Care ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Public Health ', ' Research Support ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Supervision ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' conference ', ' convention ', ' summit ', ' symposia ', ' symposium ', ' General Practices ', ' Health Benefit ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Clinical ', ' Penetration ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Link ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' disability ', ' Individual ', ' Perinatal Disorder ', ' Remote Consultation ', ' tool ', ' Knowledge ', ' Complex ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' skills ', ' member ', ' Modeling ', ' theories ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' Provider ', ' Low income ', ' Address ', ' Evidence based practice ', ' randomisation ', ' randomization ', ' randomly assigned ', ' Randomized ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Process ', ' Federally Qualified Health Center ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' effectiveness trial ', ' cost ', ' care services ', ' care systems ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Clinical effectiveness ', ' efficacy trial ', ' Outcome ', ' scale up ', ' Population ', ' prospective ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' safety net ', ' collaborative care ', ' research into practice ', ' research to practice ', ' public health relevance ', ' evidence base ', ' effective treatment ', ' effective therapy ', ' clinical practice ', ' pragmatic effectiveness trial ', ' pragmatic trial ', ' perinatal depression ', ' peripartum depression ', ' Cluster randomization trial ', ' Cluster randomized trial ', ' racial minority ', ' reduce disparity ', ' disparity reduction ', ' disparity in care ', ' disparity in healthcare ', ' healthcare disparity ', ' health care disparity ', ' depressive model ', ' depression model ', ' evaluate cost-effectiveness ', ' cost-effectiveness evaluation ', ' implementation strategy ', ' perinatal phase ', ' perinatal period ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2020,648730,0.11516465251601139
"Palliative care intervention for socioeconomically disadvantaged cancer patients ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Socioeconomic disadvantage is associated with a greater likelihood of being diagnosed with cancer, delays in cancer diagnosis, receiving less treatment, decreased access to palliative care and hospice services, and increased mortality. Although interventions have been developed to reduce the incidence of cancer and delays in diagnosis in those from socioeconomically disadvantaged backgrounds; few interventions exist to improve access to palliative care and hospice services for individuals with the least resources and greatest needs for these services. The NIH consensus statement on cancer-related symptoms concluded that the most common and debilitating are depression, pain and fatigue. Our team has observed that people from socioeconomically disadvantaged backgrounds with advanced cancer have disproportionately higher levels of depression, pain and fatigue and poorer quality of life than patients who reported higher socioeconomic status (SES). Although the comorbidity of these symptoms is well known, no intervention has been developed to reduce these symptoms concurrently. Experience from our successful pilot study of a web-based stepped collaborative care intervention for cancer patients from predominantly socioeconomically disadvantaged backgrounds, revealed that patients randomized to the intervention arm, reported statistically significant reductions in depression, pain, and fatigue an improved quality of life when compared to patients randomized to enhanced usual care (K07CA118576). Furthermore, patients randomized to the intervention had decreased serum levels of Interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, IL-8 and improved survival (R21CA127046). Post-hoc analyses revealed that family caregivers, of patients randomized to the intervention arm, had reductions in stress and depression, when compared to caregivers with spouses/partners randomized to enhanced usual care (K07CA118576S1). There is an urgent need to develop scalable, effective, and, cost-effective interventions, particularly for those who are socioeconomically disadvantaged. We plan to test a web-based stepped collaborative care intervention with 450 advanced cancer patients and their spousal or intimate partners in the context of a randomized controlled trial. The specific aims are: (1) to test the efficacy of a web-based stepped collaborative care intervention to reduce symptoms of depression, pain, and fatigue and improve health-related quality of life (HRQL) in advanced cancer patients when compared to patients randomized to the education and support arm; (2) to examine if advanced cancer patients randomized to the web-based stepped collaborative care intervention have reductions in biomarkers of inflammation and explore if these patients have slowed disease progression and improved survival when compared to patients in the education and support arm; (3) to investigate whether the spouses or intimate partners, of patients randomized to the web-based stepped collaborative care intervention, have reduced stress and depression, better HRQL and fewer risk factors for CVD than caregivers with spouses/partners randomized to education and support arm. In accordance with the goals of Healthy People 2020 ""to achieve health equity, eliminate disparities, and improve the health of all groups, regardless of differences that occur by gender, race or ethnicity, education or income, disability, geographic location, or sexual orientation"" this proposed web-based stepped collaborative care intervention was designed to improve HRQL for those in greatest need and least access to palliative care. This innovative and scalable web-based stepped collaborative care intervention is expected to improve patients' and caregivers' HRQL and potentially reduce mortality. Findings are expected to lead to studies examining scalability and cost-effectiveness of the proposed intervention. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Socioeconomic disadvantage is associated with a greater likelihood of being diagnosed with cancer, delays in cancer diagnosis, receiving less treatment, decreased access to palliative care and hospice services, and increased mortality. Although interventions have been developed to reduce the incidence of cancer and delays in diagnosis in those from socioeconomically disadvantaged backgrounds; few interventions exist to improve access to palliative care for individuals with the least resources and greatest needs for these services. Our team has shown that socioeconomically disadvantaged advanced cancer patients have disproportionally higher levels of depression, pain, fatigue and poorer quality of life. The pilot study testing the web- based collaborative care intervention demonstrated significant reductions in these symptoms and biomarkers of inflammation. Further, we observed reductions in the patients' spouse or partners' levels of stress and depression. The proposed trial will test the efficacy of this innovative and scalable web-based collaborative care intervention which is expected to improve patients' and caregivers' HRQL and potentially reduce mortality.",Palliative care intervention for socioeconomically disadvantaged cancer patients,9901463,R01CA196953,"['Blood Pressure ', ' Blood Vessels ', ' vascular ', ' C-reactive protein ', '

"Sleep to Reduce Incident Depression Effectively (STRIDE) Prevention of major depressive disorder (MDD) is a public health priority. Innovative strategies to identify those at-risk for MDD are in critical need to appropriately direct preventive care. Individuals with insomnia are >3 times more likely to develop depression than normal sleepers. Insomnia precedes ~50% of all incident and relapse depression cases. Thus, insomnia may serve as an entry point for preventing MDD. Our preliminary data not only show that insomnia treatment alleviates depressive symptoms, but may also reduce likelihood of future depression development, thereby identifying insomnia a viable target for depression prevention.  Identification and treatment of insomnia typically occurs in primary care and is commonly treated with hypnotic medications. However, hypnotics have significant limitations, including residual impairment, injury due to falls and accidents, and abuse potential. Cognitive-behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) is recommended as first-line treatment for its safety advantages and superior treatment efficacy. Unfortunately, widespread implementation of CBT-I is severely limited by the national shortage of trained practitioners in clinical practice. Innovative stepped care approaches rooted in primary care hold potential to increase access to care, which may improve insomnia therapeutics and reduce rates of MDD by targeting a robust yet modifiable risk factor in insomnia. Our proposal uses digital CBT-I (dCBT-I) as a widely available first-line intervention to increase care access and reduce need for specialist resources. Our proposal also adds clinician-based face-to-face CBT-I only for treatment-resistant patients who need a more personalized and flexible approach from specialty care.  We propose a large-scale stepped care clinical trial in the primary care setting that utilizes sequential, multiple assignment, randomized trial (SMART) design to determine the effectiveness of dCBT-I alone and in combination with face-to-face CBT-I for insomnia and the prevention of MDD. An important innovative component of the trial is the 1- and 2-year follow-up assessments to determine the durability of effectiveness over time and assess the impact on MDD incidence and relapse. Early risk-detection and prevention is especially critical in those at elevated risk for depression to reduce health disparities. Thus, individuals with elevated vulnerability to MDD (e.g., low socioeconomic status and racial minorities) will be included in significant numbers to test for potential moderation of treatment effects stratified by risk.  Finally, dCBT-I and CBT-I have been shown to reduce rumination (negative repetitive thinking), which may help mitigate MDD development. As such, we will determine whether changes in rumination (a modifiable risk- factor and potential key therapy target) mediates the effects of our stepped care model on MDD prevention.  This project will test a highly scalable model of sleep care in a large primary care system to determine the potential for wide dissemination and implementation to address the high volume of population need for safe and effective insomnia treatment and associated prevention of depression. Project Narrative Sleep To Reduce Incident Depression Effectively (STRIDE) is a proposed large-scale clinical trial that will take place in primary care utilizing a stepped-care model to determine the effectiveness of digital cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (dCBT-I) alone or in combination with face-to-face CBT-I and the effects of these sleep interventions for the prevention of depression.

"TRANSFORM DEPCARE: A Theoretical approach to improving patient engagement and shared decision making for minorities in collaborative depression care The goal of this proposal is to test whether an electronic shared decision making (eSDM) tool can increase the uptake of collaborative care (CC) for depression in primary care. Depression is projected to be the second largest contributor to chronic disease burden in the world by 2030, and contributes to disparities in quality of life and mortality. CC integrates primary and behavioral health through depression care managers who provide antidepressant adherence counseling and/or psychotherapy. CC doubles the rate of depression remission in comparison to primary care provider-led depression treatment alone, particularly in racial and ethnic minorities, and results in a 24% reduction in mortality and nearly $1300 in net annual savings per patient. Despite this model's potential to improve access to mental health, implementation efforts reveal low provider CC referral rates and low patient engagement rates of 9-50%, particularly in minority patients.  To identify factors contributing to poor patient engagement in CC, we conducted focus groups in 8 healthcare systems implementing CC, representing 33 clinics and 1 million predominantly Medicaid, minority patients. We learned that key physician-level barriers included limited time/resources to discuss treatment options and conduct “warm handoffs” to care managers; patient-level barriers included poor knowledge of treatment options, miscommunication, stigma, language barriers, and low motivation. We applied a theory- informed process of engaging stakeholders to select an acceptable, feasible intervention and determined that SDM would target the greatest number of barriers to CC engagement. SDM involves a collaborative process whereby providers and patients make health decision together, and is a proven approach for improving depression treatment initiation and guideline concordant care, particularly in minorities, but widespread use has been limited by time and resources. Accordingly, we developed and alpha tested an iPad delivered, video-assisted, interactive eSDM tool that would reduce barriers to SDM uptake and target CC engagement.  We hypothesize that a state-of-the-art eSDM tool that automates the SDM process, activates providers, staff, and patients and interfaces with the electronic health record will improve efficient CC enrollment (primary outcome). We propose to refine and adapt the eSDM prototype (Aim 1) and conduct a stepped wedge trial across 4 primary care medical homes to assess the effectiveness of implementing our eSDM tool on provider behavior (Aim 2), patient enrollment in CC (Aim 3), patient adherence to depression treatment (therapy or antidepressants) and depressive symptoms (Exploratory Aims) amongst 1440 primary care patients in our healthcare system. Our study has the potential to produce a theory-informed, scalable eSDM tool that improves the reach of CC programs and potentially other team-based approaches. Collaborative care for depression (CC), a team based approach to integrating primary and behavioral health, is effective in reducing depressive symptoms, but implementation has been hindered by suboptimal provider referral and patient engagement rates. Shared decision-making (SDM) is a promising approach for improving engagement in primary care settings but is limited by time and resources. We propose to automate the SDM process through an electronic SDM tool and to conduct a stepped wedge trial in our healthcare system (CC + SDM versus CC) to assess the effectiveness of eSDM on provider behavior and patient engagement in CC.",TRANSFORM DEPCARE: A Theoretical approach to improving patient engagement and shared decision making for minorities in collaborative depression care,9982263,R01HS025198,[''],AHRQ,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2020,387832,0.1497279454167799
"Equity in Depression Care for Primary Care Patients with Language Barriers Project Summary Depression is a leading cause of disability in the United States. Patients with limited English proficiency (LEP), particularly Asians and Latinos, who represent the largest demographics with LEP in the country, are at increased risk of poor provider recognition of depressive symptoms and under-treatment of depression. Universal depression screening in primary care, with a focus on initial depression treatment, may be a way to systematically identify patients with LEP who could benefit from treatment. However, barriers to depression care are likely multifactorial and are still poorly understood. The objective of this application is to understand whether universal approaches to depression screening and initial care for depression are equally effective for all groups, or whether targeted efforts are needed to increase depression screening, diagnosis and treatment in primary care among patients with LEP. Within the context of a primary care setting, the specific aims are to (1) evaluate differences in depression screening and initial treatment by patient preferred language after adoption of annual universal depression screening, (2) examine patterns of patient-provider communication about depressive symptoms, and (3) to involve key stakeholders to develop a patient- and provider-facing, practice-based intervention prototype to improve annual depression screening, elicit patient concerns and treatment preferences, foster improved communication and patient empowerment about initial treatment, and increase engagement in depression care. These aims will be achieved using mixed methods and health disparities research frameworks, and they address the NIMHD research priority areas of developing healthcare interventions to reduce health disparities and to improve patient-clinician communication and shared-decision making. The studies are novel in their focus on the mental health needs of primary care patients with LEP as well as the proposed use of mixed methods to develop a theory-driven intervention prototype. The proposed studies are informed by Dr. Maria Esteli Garcia’s experience as an internist working in diverse, urban primary care settings. Dr. Garcia’s long- term career goal is to improve depression care for patients with LEP in primary care. During the course of this award, Dr. Garcia will undertake didactic and experiential training to improve knowledge and skills in three areas: (1) mixed methods, (2) evidence-based depression care, and (3) experimental designs for use in real world settings. Dr. Garcia has assembled a mentorship team with expertise in mixed methods, health services and implementation science research, evidence-based depression treatment, and intervention design to ensure completion of the proposed research and training and successful transition to independence. Ultimately, these projects are expected to provide the foundation for future R34 and R01 applications and further refinement of an intervention to reduce mental health disparities by improving depression screening and initial depression care for patients with LEP. Project Narrative Depression leads to increased morbidity and mortality. Furthermore, patients with limited English proficiency (LEP) face additional challenges when obtaining treatment for depressive symptoms in primary care; systematic depression screening and a focus on initial treatment may help reduce these disparities in depression care. Completion of the proposed studies is expected to improve depression care for patients with LEP in primary care, by (1) evaluating implementation of depression screening and initial depression care in a large health care system, (2) examining patient-physician communication about depressive symptoms, and (3) incorporating stakeholder perspectives in the development of an intervention prototype to promote depression screening and patient-provider discussion of diagnosis and treatment preferences in routine primary care visits.",Equity in Depression Care for Primary Care Patients with Language Barriers,9953361,K23MD015115,"['Adoption ', ' Antidepressive Agents ', ' Antidepressant Agent ', ' Antidepressant Drugs ', ' Antidepressants ', ' anti-depressant agent ', ' anti-depressant drugs ', ' anti-depressants ', ' anti-depressive agents ', ' Award ', ' California ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Communication ', ' Decision Making ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disclosure ', ' Information Disclosure ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Experimental Designs ', ' Face ', ' faces ', ' facial ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Health Services ', ' Interview ', ' Language ', ' Linguistics ', ' Linguistic ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methods ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Primary Care ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Risk ', ' San Francisco ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Testing ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Transcription ', ' United States ', ' Asians ', ' oriental ', ' Emotional Depression ', ' depression symptom ', ' depressive ', ' depressive symptoms ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Latino ', ' Caring ', ' Chinese ', ' Chinese People ', ' Custom ', ' base ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Ensure ', ' Training ', ' disability ', ' Individual ', ' Fostering ', ' Summary Reports ', ' Funding ', ' Internist ', ' Review Literature ', ' tool ', ' Research Priority ', ' Knowledge ', ' Clinic ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' Country ', ' Remission ', ' Disease remission ', ' Visit ', ' preference ', ' skills training ', ' experience ', ' care delivery ', ' cohort ', ' Structure ', ' skills ', ' Disease Outcome ', ' novel ', ' empowerment ', ' depression screening ', ' Depression screen ', ' theories ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Provider ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Address ', ' Health system ', ' Data ', ' Career Development Awards ', ' Career Development Awards and Programs ', ' Career Development Programs K-Series ', ' K-Awards ', ' Research Career Program ', ' K-Series Research Career Programs ', ' Research Training ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' follow-up ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' Behavioral ', ' systematic review ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' patient centered ', ' patient oriented ', ' demographics ', ' implementation science ', ' intervention design ', ' treatment design ', ' therapy design ', ' develop therapy ', ' intervention development ', ' treatment development ', ' therapy development ', ' prototype ', ' evidence base ', ' primary care setting ', ' shared decision making ', ' screening ', ' Limited English Proficiency ', ' Conversation analysis ', ' Discourse analysis ', ' reduce disparity ', ' disparity reduction ', ' symptomatic treatment ', ' treat symptom ', ' symptom treatment ', ' primary care provider ', ' care providers ', ' patient-doctor communication ', ' patient-provider communication ', ' patient-clinician communication ', ' death risk ', ' mortality risk ', ' ']",NIMHD,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",K23,2020,172098,0.24160425471498215
"Reducing depressive symptoms among rural African Americans: REJOICE. DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Rural African Americans are disproportionately exposed to numerous stressors such as poverty, racism, and discrimination that place them at risk for experiencing elevated levels of depressive symptoms. Elevated levels of depressive symptoms can lead to a host of negative outcomes including both the development of and poor management of chronic illnesses (i.e., hypertension, diabetes, etc.), poor social functioning, poor occupational functioning, and development of clinical depression. Though effective treatments for decreasing depressive symptoms exist, rural African Americans often fail to receive adequate and timely care. African American churches have been identified as potential venues for providing depression education and treatment for rural African Americans. Within the African American rural community, churches represent a key portal through which a large proportion (as much as 85%) of the African American community can be reached. Churches have been used to address physical health outcomes in those communities but few have focused primarily on addressing mental health outcomes. Through the NIMHD-funded project entitled, ""Faith Academic Initiatives to Transform Health (FAITH) in the Delta"", our partnership, consisting of faith community leaders and UAMS researchers, culturally adapted an evidence-based behavioral activation intervention for use with rural African American churches. This 8- session behavioral activation therapy was adapted to include faith-based themes, Scripture, and other aspects of the rural African American faith culture (e.g., Bible studies, use of lay leaders o deliver the intervention). In addition to assessing the effectiveness of our intervention, ascertaining ways to implement this intervention with proper fidelity to maintain clinical outcomes is also critically important to increase the efficiency of translating research into practice. Work towards disseminating evidence-based depression interventions to ""real world"" settings is particularly salient in addressing depression disparities, whereby rural African Americans bear a disproportionate burden. Thus, this application proposes a Hybrid-2 pragmatic-effectiveness implementation trial that seeks to test the effectiveness of the culturally adapted evidence-based intervention and gather preliminary data on the strategies necessary to support successful implementation of this intervention in rural African American churches. Specifically, this study aims to: 1) Refine a culturally appropriate, evidence-based depression intervention (REJOICE) based on results from our NIMHD-funded pilot study, 2) Determine whether REJOICE is superior to a usual-care control group at post treatment and a 3-month follow-up, 3) Collect pilot data regarding ""real world"" implementation strategies (i.e. face to fac training and coaching calls) on the uptake and maintenance of REJOICE in rural African American churches. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Rural African Americans are disproportionately impacted by social stressors that place them at risk for experiencing elevated depressive symptoms. This project will test the effectiveness of a culturally adapted behavioral activation intervention (REJOICE) for use within rural African American churches.

"Improving Preschool Outcomes by Addressing Maternal Depression in Head Start PROJECT SUMMARY Children of low-income families face myriad social risks that interfere with healthy development, behavior, and academic achievement. Mothers of these children experience a high rate of depression, itself associated with lasting effects on children. In 2009, the National Academy of Medicine published a landmark report, Depression in Parents, Parenting, and Children, in which it called for community-based interventions to prevent parental depression and to help engage depressed parents in treatment. Consistent with this report, our research group has conducted a series of NIH-funded studies aimed at alleviating symptoms among mothers at risk for depression in Head Start – a federally funded preschool program that provides services for ~1 million low-income US families.  In the present project, we aim to improve outcomes for Head Start children by deploying a stepped-care intervention, in which mothers with low level depressive symptoms are offered a prevention program based on the Problem Solving Education model, and mothers with greater symptoms are offered Engagement Sessions to link them with formal mental health services. Both components of the model have strong randomized trial evidence; but they have yet to be synthesized and tested within a coordinated intervention, applicable to a broad population base. Harnessing a research network of Head Start centers in Massachusetts, we propose an efficacy trial (n=388) of this stepped-care model.  Our primary aim is to determine the model’s efficacy in decreasing the rate at which Head Start mothers experience depressive symptom episodes; mothers’ likelihood of engaging with mental health services when referred; parental functioning; and child absenteeism from Head Start. Our second aim is to determine mechanisms of action by which improved maternal wellbeing promotes child resiliency. To do this, we will assess mothers’ perceptions of stress, family conflict, and mother-child interaction patterns; and we will assess child outcomes in the affective, interpersonal and cognitive domains. Finally, to prepare for a subsequent effectiveness trial, we will conduct a single arm pilot study among 20 additional mothers to assess the feasibility of incorporating intervention delivery into usual Head Start workflow.  Our proposal represents a high-priority research area for NICHD because it addresses social and environmental factors that impact children’s adaptive behaviors and school readiness. Our study plan enhances the rigor of prior research because it tests the efficacy of a comprehensive depression management model, and because our design allows us to study both maternal and child outcomes – and the mechanisms that link them – among a true community-based sample. Our ultimate goal is to reduce mental health disparities for low-income mothers and to improve outcomes for them and their children. PROJECT NARRATIVE Maternal depression disproportionately affects low-income and minority women and has negative impacts on their children. In the present proposal, we aim to improve outcomes for Head Start children by deploying a stepped-care intervention, in which mothers with low level depressive symptoms are offered a prevention program based on the Problem Solving Education model, and mothers with greater symptoms are offered Engagement Sessions to link them with formal mental health services. We propose to test the efficacy of this model among both mothers and children, and determine mechanisms of action by which improved maternal wellbeing promotes child resiliency.",Improving Preschool Outcomes by Addressing Maternal Depression in Head Start,9884948,R01HD092456,"['Absenteeism ', ' Academy ', ' Affect ', ' Award ', ' Behavior ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' children ', "" childrens' "", ' youngster ', ' Child Rearing ', ' Parenting ', ' Parenting behavior ', ' childrearing ', ' Communities ', ' Conflict (Psychology) ', ' Conflict ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Face ', ' faces ', ' facial ', ' Family ', ' Feasibility Studies ', ' Goals ', ' Massachusetts ', ' Medicine ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Health Services ', ' Mental Hygiene Services ', ' Mother-Child Relations ', ' Mother-Child Relationship ', ' mother child interaction ', ' Mothers ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Parents ', ' Perception ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' well-being ', ' wellbeing ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Problem Solving ', ' Public Health ', ' Publishing ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Schools ', ' Nursery Schools ', ' pre-k ', ' pre-kindergarten ', ' preschool ', ' Social Work ', ' Social Service ', ' Stress ', ' Testing ', ' Woman ', ' Measures ', ' adaptation behavior ', ' adaptive behavior ', ' Adaptive Behaviors ', ' Emotional Depression ', ' depression symptom ', ' depressive ', ' depressive symptoms ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Caring ', ' stress buffering ', ' stress management ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Series ', ' Link ', ' Funding ', ' depressed ', ' sadness ', ' Depressed mood ', ' Research Priority ', ' programs ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Pattern ', ' Services ', ' experience ', ' Employee ', ' Head Start ', ' Head Start Program ', ' skills ', ' Preventative strategy ', ' Preventive strategy ', ' Prevention strategy ', ' Prevention program ', ' interpersonal competence ', ' interpersonal competency ', ' social competence ', ' social competency ', ' social skills ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' Prevention ', ' Academic achievement ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Provider ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Effectiveness ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Preparedness ', ' Readiness ', ' Low income ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Adherence ', ' NICHD ', "" National Institute of Children's Health and Human Development "", ' National Institute of Child Health and Human Development ', ' randomisation ', ' randomization ', ' randomly assigned ', ' Randomized ', ' Cognitive ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' effectiveness trial ', ' pilot trial ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Minority ', ' resilience ', ' efficacy trial ', ' Outcome ', ' coping ', ' Population ', ' depressed mother ', ' maternal depression ', ' Affective ', ' population based ', ' intervention effect ', ' efficacy testing ', ' Randomization trial ', ' randomized trial ', ' arm ', ' multi-faceted intervention ', ' multi-modal intervention ', ' multicomponent intervention ', ' multifaceted intervention ', ' multimodal intervention ', ' multi-component intervention ', ' improved outcome ', ' symptomatology ', ' alleviate symptom ', ' ameliorating symptom ', ' decrease symptom ', ' fewer symptoms ', ' relieves symptoms ', ' symptom alleviation ', ' symptom reduction ', ' symptom relief ', ' reduce symptoms ', ' lower income families ', ' social factors ', ' ']",NICHD,BOSTON MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2020,770035,0.07997957160381695
"Evaluating the Contribution of Synthetic Oxytocin Exposure in the Peripartum Period to Postpartum Depressive Symptoms in African American Women PROJECT SUMMARY Background: Synthetic oxytocin is a medication commonly administered perinatally to induce or augment labor and prevent postpartum hemorrhage. However, its long term consequences, especially related to postpartum mood, are largely unknown. This is especially pertinent in African American mothers, a population at higher risk of postpartum depression. African American women have higher rates, in general, of variables that lead to slow labor and therefore are theoretically at greater risk of synthetic oxytocin exposure than Caucasian mothers. Purpose: The purpose of this study is firstly to characterize the indication for and exposure rate of African American women to perinatal synthetic oxytocin. Secondly, we will evaluate the association between exposure to perinatal synthetic oxytocin and depressive symptomatology in African American women at 1 week, 3 months, and 6 months postpartum, after controlling for identified potential confounding variables. Methods: We will enroll a socioeconomically diverse cohort of 160 African American women for this study. As part of two larger, longitudinal studies, participants were recruited between 10-14 weeks gestation and followed through 6 months postpartum. They were visited in their homes at 1 week, 3 months, and 6 months postpartum and assessed for postpartum depression symptomatology using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale. For the selected subset, we will review their labor and delivery records for detailed data on perinatal synthetic oxytocin exposure. We will combine prenatal, intrapartum, and postpartum variables into a novel dataset to describe synthetic oxytocin exposure and evaluate its relationship to postpartum depression. Implications: The results of this study will provide, for the first time, information on exposure rates to a synthetic hormone that may carry with it increased risk of postpartum depression in this population of African American women, already at high risk of health disparities in birth and infant outcomes. Findings have the potential to impact practice in many ways, including consideration of revising dosing standards and improved risk assessment and surveillance for postpartum depression in exposed women. PROJECT NARRATIVE Postpartum depression is a significant health concern, especially in African American women, a population at highest risk of poor birth outcomes. This study will firstly describe African American women's exposure to synthetic oxytocin, a common labor and delivery drug, of which the long-term mood impact is unknown, and secondly examine synthetic oxytocin exposure as a novel biological risk factor for postpartum depression.

"Diversity Supplement to R01-Palliative care intervention for socioeconomically disadvantaged cancer patients Socioeconomic disadvantage is associated with a greater likelihood of being diagnosed with cancer, delays in cancer diagnosis, receiving less treatment, decreased access to palliative care and hospice services, and increased mortality. Although interventions have been developed to reduce the incidence of cancer and delays in diagnosis in those from socioeconomically disadvantaged backgrounds; few interventions exist to improve access to palliative care and hospice services for individuals with the least resources and greatest needs for these services. The NIH consensus statement on cancer-related symptoms concluded that the most common and debilitating are depression, pain and fatigue. Our team has observed that people from socioeconomically disadvantaged backgrounds with advanced cancer have disproportionately higher levels of depression, pain and fatigue and poorer quality of life than patients who reported higher socioeconomic status (SES). Although the comorbidity of these symptoms is well known, no intervention has been developed to reduce these symptoms concurrently. Experience from our successful pilot study of a web-based stepped collaborative care intervention for cancer patients from predominantly socioeconomically disadvantaged backgrounds, revealed that patients randomized to the intervention arm, reported statistically significant reductions in depression, pain, and fatigue and improved quality of life when compared to patients randomized to enhanced usual care (K07CA118576). Furthermore, patients randomized to the intervention had decreased serum levels of Interleukin (IL)-1 IL-6, IL-8 and improved survival (R21CA127046). Post-hoc analyses revealed that family caregivers, of patients randomized to the intervention arm, had reductions in stress and depression, when compared to caregivers with spouses/partners randomized to enhanced usual care (K07CA118576S1). There is an urgent need to develop scalable, effective, and, cost-effective interventions, particularly for those who are socioeconomically disadvantaged. We plan to test a web-based stepped collaborative care intervention with 450 advanced cancer patients and their spousal or intimate partners in the context of a randomized controlled trial. The specific aims are: (1) to test the efficacy of a web-based stepped collaborative care intervention to reduce symptoms of depression, pain, and fatigue and improve health-related quality of life (HRQL) in advanced cancer patients when compared to patients randomized to the education and support arm; (2) to examine if advanced cancer patients randomized to the web-based stepped collaborative care intervention have reductions in biomarkers of inflammation and explore if these patients have slowed disease progression and improved survival when compared to patients in the education and support arm; (3) to investigate whether the spouses or intimate partners, of patients randomized to the web-based stepped collaborative care intervention, have reduced stress and depression, better HRQL and fewer risk factors for CVD than caregivers with spouses/partners randomized to education and support arm. In accordance with the goals of Healthy People 2020 ""to achieve health equity, eliminate disparities, and improve the health of all groups, regardless of differences that occur by gender, race or ethnicity, education or income, disability, geographic location, or sexual orientation” this proposed web-based stepped collaborative care intervention was designed to improve HRQL for those in greatest need and least access to palliative care. This innovative and scalable web-based stepped collaborative care intervention is expected to improve patients’ and caregivers’ HRQL and potentially reduce mortality. Findings are expected to lead to studies examining scalability and cost-effectiveness of the proposed intervention.

Our team has shown that socioeconomically disadvantaged advanced cancer patients have disproportionally higher levels of depression, pain, fatigue and poorer quality of life. The pilot study testing the web- based collaborative care intervention demonstrated significant reductions in these symptoms and biomarkers of inflammation. Further, we observed reductions in the patients’ spouse or partners’ levels of stress and depression.

"Social Media Use and Depression Outcomes among U.S. Lesbian, Gay, and Bisexual Young Adults PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT The overarching goal of this Pathway to Independence Award is to facilitate the development of César G. Escobar-Viera, PhD, MD, MPH, into an independent researcher, with expertise in advanced quantitative and qualitative methods to determine the role of social media on depression among lesbian, gay, and bisexual U.S. young adults (LGBYA). Ultimately, the PI seeks to leverage evidence-based SM interventions to ameliorate depression among LGBYA, which will ultimately help to reduce mental health disparities for this group. This long-term goal will be achieved via a 5-year training and research plan that will launch Dr. Escobar-Viera’s independent program of research and academic career. The career objectives of this award are to: (1) become an expert in the field of social media research applied to depression; (2) advance the PI’s knowledge in LGBT mental health disparities; and (3) gain expertise in the application of advanced quantitative and qualitative methodologies. These career objectives will be achieved via formal coursework, trainings, seminars, national conferences, mentorship, and research experience. The knowledge derived from this training plan will prepare Dr. Escobar-Viera to pursue the following aims. In the first aim, pre-existing survey data from a nationally- representative sample of young adults will be leveraged to explore cross-sectional associations between SMU and depression among LGBYA. During the second aim, qualitative assessments about SMU and depression among LGBYA. The influence of SMU on depression will be explored by inquiring about what type of use is helpful and generates social support and which use result in negative feelings and experiences (e.g., discrimination). Finally, the third aim will consist of a longitudinal examination of the associations between SMU and depression among LGBYA. Results of this aim will inform the PI’s next step of developing an SM-based intervention for LGBYA at risk for depression, mitigating identified risk factors while enhancing protective ones. Feasibility and efficacy of the intervention will be then tested via a series of R21 and R01 projects during Dr. Escobar-Viera’s independent research career. An outstanding team of experts in LGBT research, qualitative research, longitudinal analyses, survey research, and mobile and social media interventions will provide mentorship to ensure the success of this project. Brian Primack, MD, PhD, will serve as the primary mentor. Dr. Primack leveraged his own K07 into multiple R01 and R21 awards. Co-mentorship will be provided by Michael Marshal, PhD and Ron Stall, PhD. Moreover, Galen Switzer, PhD and Sherry Pagoto, PhD will serve as consultants. This study proposes to lay a theoretical foundation needed to develop evidence-based social media interventions to improve mental health outcomes among sexual minorities. In addition, it will contribute to developing a model to study the influence of social media on health disparities among other minority groups. This award will forge the PI’s pathway to independence by laying a foundation for a career in social media interventions to reduce depression among LGBYA, thus decreasing health disparities for this population. PROJECT NARRATIVE Compared with their heterosexual counterparts, lesbian, gay, and bisexual young adults (LGBYA) consistently experience higher rates of depression, which is the leading cause of disability worldwide, with a burden of $200 billion per year in the U.S. alone. Given that it is now part of the fabric LGBYA use to build and maintain social networks, it is crucial to grasp the impact SM might have on mental health, in this population. The proposed research will use an innovative version of the Minority Stress Model to understand the extent and under which circumstances characteristics of social media use might become either a risk or protective factor for depression among LGBYA.","Social Media Use and Depression Outcomes among U.S. Lesbian, Gay, and Bisexual Young Adults",9993691,R00MD012813,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Award ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Elements ', ' Environment ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Foundations ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' longitudinal outcome studies ', ' longterm study ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methodology ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Motivation ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Research Support ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Social Characteristics ', ' Social support ', ' social support network ', ' Stereotyping ', ' Stress ', ' Suicide ', ' fatal attempt ', ' fatal suicide ', ' intent to die ', ' suicidality ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Testing ', ' Textiles ', ' fabric ', ' Thinking ', ' thoughts ', ' Time ', ' Translations ', ' Work ', ' Friends ', ' Gender ', ' conference ', ' convention ', ' summit ', ' symposia ', ' symposium ', ' Emotional Depression ', ' depression symptom ', ' depressive ', ' depressive symptoms ', ' Longitudinal Surveys ', ' Social Network ', ' base ', ' Bi-sexual ', ' Bisexual ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Phase ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Series ', ' Ensure ', ' Grips ', ' grasp ', ' Training ', ' disability ', ' adult youth ', ' young adulthood ', ' young adult ', ' Sample Size ', ' Gays ', ' Lesbian ', ' Collaborations ', ' Expressed Emotion ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' bully ', ' bullying ', ' Emotional well being ', ' Feels well ', ' Normal mental condition ', ' Normal mental state ', ' Normal psyche ', ' Psychological Well Being ', ' Sense of well-being ', ' emotional wellbeing ', ' mental well-being ', ' mental wellbeing ', ' psychological wellbeing ', ' psychological wellness ', ' self wellness ', ' sense of wellbeing ', ' Well in self ', ' Hour ', ' Pattern ', ' Marshal ', ' Equation ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' Structure ', ' Participant ', ' General Public ', ' General Population ', ' social ', ' Emotional ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' career development ', ' theories ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Qualitative Research ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Address ', ' qualitative reasoning ', ' Qualitative Methods ', ' Data ', ' Ph.D. ', ' PhD ', ' Doctor of Philosophy ', ' Effectiveness of Interventions ', ' Media Intervention ', ' Communication Tools ', ' R21 Award ', ' Exploratory/Developmental Grant for Diagnostic Cancer Imaging ', ' Characteristics ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' feelings ', ' Feeling ', ' Heterosexuals ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' time use ', ' Minority ', ' intervention efficacy ', ' therapeutic efficacy ', ' therapeutically effective ', ' therapy efficacy ', ' Treatment Efficacy ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' develop therapy ', ' intervention development ', ' treatment development ', ' therapy development ', ' evidence base ', ' longitudinal analysis ', ' sexual minority ', ' LGBT ', ' Lesbian Gay Bisexual Transgender ', ' LGB ', ' Lesbian Gay Bisexual ', ' social media ', ' recruit ', ' protective factors ', ' sex risk behavior ', ' sexual risk behavior ', ' sexual identity ', ' socio-demographic factors ', ' sociodemographic factors ', ' socio-cultural ', ' sociocultural ', ' social culture ', ' large scale data sets ', ' large scale datasets ', ' large scale data ', ' ']",NIMHD,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R00,2020,248455,0.13286733542515358
"A Systems-Level Intervention for Rural Adults with Depression Abstract This career development award seeks to prepare the candidate for a career as a mental health intervention and implementation researcher who adapts and packages evidence-based practices (EBPs) to be accessible, acceptable, and sustainable in rural communities. Rural Americans experience depression at rates similar to their urban peers; yet are significantly less likely to receive treatment. Substantial barriers, including a lack of mental health professionals, cost, travel burden, stigma and preference for informal care, contribute to this disparity. Research is necessary to adapt and implement EBPs for depression in ways that reduce known barriers, align with rural residents' help-seeking preferences, and build internal capacity to delivery EBPs within rural communities. The proposed training goals and mentored research activities will prepare the candidate to bridge the gap between research and practice by successfully adapting and implementing EPBs in usual care settings. The candidate seeks to (1) develop expertise in implementation science and research to enhance her ability to integrate EBPs into usual care settings; (2) enhance her knowledge of community-based participatory research (CPBR) methods as they relate to adapting and implementing interventions with the best chance for acceptability and sustainbility in non-mental health settings; (3) increase her knowledge and skills in intervention development, randomized controlled trial designs, and quantitative analytic techniques; and (4) build upon her clinical background to enhance her expertise with cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for depression and anxiety through focused training supporting her ability to adapt CBT while retaining core components, train and supervise non-mental health professionals delivering interventions, and assess fidelity of adapted interventions. All career development goals are infused with relevant rural-focused content. The goals will be achieved through a rigorous training plan that includes coursework at the University of Michigan's (UM) top-ranked Schools of Social Work, Public Health, and Medicine; targeted off-site training and attendance at national conferences; state-of-the-art clinical training through UM Department of Psychiatry and the Beck Institute; as well as outstanding mentorship from leaders in mental health intervention and implementation research; depression and anxiety; and cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). Training goals are further supported by mentored research activities facilitated by UM's resource rich scientific environment. The proposed research, informed by the Replicating Effective Programs framework (REP) and CBPR, seeks to (1) adapt and package group CBT for depression for implementation in the rural church setting, and conduct an open pilot test of the adapted intervention; (2) conduct a pilot randomized controlled trial (pRCT) to assess the intervention's preliminary effect on depression and explore the relationship between potential mechanisms of change and expected outcomes; and (3) explore intervention acceptability and feasibility using mixed methods to assess multiple stakeholders perceptions of the intervention and its implementation. Relevance Public Health Relevance Statement: Rural Americans have faced decades-long disparities in access to mental health treatment and are significantly less likely to receive evidence-based care compared to urban peers. The lack of infrastructure and mental health professionals in rural areas requires consideration of ways to deliver evidence-based treatment within non-mental health settings to increase accessibility, acceptability, and sustainability of needed care. Adapting and packaging evidence-based practices in a context-specific way by incorporating rural residents' perspectives and treatment preferences, reducing practical barriers such as transportation and cost, and collaborating with informal providers within the de facto mental health system, has the potential to make an large impact by increasing access to care and ultimately improving the lives

"Genes, Education, and Gene-Education Interactions in Obesity and Mental Health PROJECT SUMMARY  Tackling obesity and depression is vital for population health, not least because they are associated with diabetes, heart disease, strokes, and suicide, which in turn led to the decrease in US life expectancy in 2015. One policy advocated by Healthy People 2020 to reduce obesity and depression is increasing educational attainment, as it is viewed as a fundamental cause of health disparities. As obesity and depression also have strong genetic bases, it is possible that education additionally improves population health by moderating the underlying genetic risk of being obese/depressed through gene-environment (GxE) interactions. GxE interactions occur when the effect of genetic risk varies across the environment. The influence of genetic predisposition towards the likelihood of being obese may differ by educational attainment. A college graduate with a high genetic risk of being obese may never be obese because education is associated with higher income affording the individual to eat healthier and having peers who are conscious about leading a healthy lifestyle. In contrast, a high school dropout with a high genetic risk is more likely to be obese because he/she has a low income, is more likely to consume fast food, and interacts with peers who are obese. The proposed project will apply econometric methods, instrumental variables and within-sibling comparisons, that use quasi-experimental variation in educational attainment to increase our understanding of causal relations of education, genes, and GxE interactions on obesity and depression. The use of quasi-experimental variation will, under certain assumptions, produce estimates that are not confounded by (i) the influence of unobserved factors that are correlated with education and health, (ii) reverse causality, (iii) gene-environment correlations, and (iv) population stratification, and these estimates can therefore be given a causal interpretation conditional on these assumptions. The specific aims are to estimate main effects of education, genetic risk, and GxE interactions on obesity and depression using (i) the Easter School Leaving Rule as a natural experiment in the UK and data from the UK Biobank, (ii) local factors in the individual’s county of residence near secondary school completion age (college availability, education expenditures, unemployment rate) as instruments for education in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey and the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health) datasets, and (iii) the sibling fixed-effects approach in the Add Health dataset. Overall, the project will provide a comprehensive array of results and new insights as we compare results from different methods, datasets, across different educational levels, and by gender. This application is in direct response to NIH PAR- 16-080 “Education and Health: New Frontiers.” PROJECT NARRATIVE  The proposed research is relevant to public health because obesity and depression are major public health problems in the US. Both conditions have significant individual and societal costs. They are associated with other adverse health outcomes and behaviors such as diabetes, heart disease, strokes, and suicide, which in turn led to the decrease in US life expectancy in 2015. This research will make important contributions to our understanding of the relations between education and obesity, and depression, and how heterogeneities reflected in gene-environmental interactions shape those relations.","Genes, Education, and Gene-Education Interactions in Obesity and Mental Health",9996747,R01HD094011,"['Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Behavior ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' children ', "" childrens' "", ' youngster ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Educational Status ', ' Educational Achievement ', ' educational level ', ' training achievement ', ' training level ', ' training status ', ' Environment ', ' Expenditure ', ' Family ', ' Genes ', ' Government ', ' Health ', ' Heart Diseases ', ' Cardiac Diseases ', ' Cardiac Disorders ', ' heart disorder ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Economical Income ', ' Life Expectancy ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Methods ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Obesity ', ' adiposity ', ' corpulence ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulentia ', ' obese ', ' obese people ', ' obese person ', ' obese population ', ' Population Control ', ' Probability ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Schools ', ' Secondary Schools ', ' secondary education ', ' Siblings ', ' Stroke ', ' Apoplexy ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' brain attack ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' Student Dropouts ', ' School Dropouts ', ' Suicide ', ' fatal attempt ', ' fatal suicide ', ' intent to die ', ' suicidality ', ' Unemployment ', ' jobless ', ' joblessness ', ' out of work ', ' unemployed ', ' County ', ' Gender ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' insight ', ' Consciousness ', ' Conscious ', ' residential building ', ' residential site ', ' residence ', ' Individual ', ' Policies ', ' Genetic ', ' Genetic Predisposition ', ' Genetic Susceptibility ', ' Inherited Predisposition ', ' Inherited Susceptibility ', ' genetic etiology ', ' genetic mechanism of disease ', ' genetic vulnerability ', ' genetically predisposed ', ' Genetic Predisposition to Disease ', ' Exposure to ', ' Shapes ', ' depressed ', ' sadness ', ' Depressed mood ', ' convenience food ', ' fast food ', ' instrument ', ' NHANES ', ' National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey ', ' Education Level ', ' Educational Background ', ' Adopted ', ' collegiate ', ' college ', ' preference ', ' Gene x Environment Interaction ', ' GxE interaction ', ' environment effect on gene ', ' gene environment interaction ', ' high school ', ' cohort ', ' peer ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' clinical depression ', ' major depression ', ' major depression disorder ', ' Major Depressive Disorder ', ' Causality ', ' causation ', ' disease causation ', ' Etiology ', ' Low income ', ' Advocate ', ' Data ', ' randomisation ', ' randomization ', ' randomly assigned ', ' Randomized ', ' Genetic Risk ', ' Outcome ', ' frontier ', ' aged ', ' Natural experiment ', ' Consumption ', ' biorepository ', ' biobank ', ' population health ', ' Healthy People 2020 ', ' healthy life-style ', ' healthy lifestyle ', ' adolescent health ', ' Healthy Eating ', ' population stratification ', ' Add Health ', ' National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health ', ' National Longitudinal Survey of Adolescent to Adult Health ', ' societal costs ', ' econometrics ', ' ']",NICHD,CENTRAL MICHIGAN UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,309063,0.0644829036274226
"Recurrent Hemorrhagic Stroke in Minority Populations ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cerebral small vessel disease (CSVD) is a common, progressive condition of aging, and a leading contributor to age-related disability due to stroke, cognitive decline, late-life onset depression and gait deterioration. In most cases the underlying vessel pathology can be classified as one of the two most common subtypes, arteriolosclerosis (AS) and cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA). Although classically recognized as white matter changes on MRI, CSVD frequently comes to clinical attention for the first time when a patient presents with intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). Discovering the biological underpinnings of CSVD is a vital next step toward development of effective preventative strategies. Because their CSVD is uniformly severe, ICH survivors are ideal subjects in which to study CSVD and also form the group most likely to benefit from novel therapies. The proposed studies are motivated by the striking observation that ICH disproportionately affects African- American (AA) and Hispanic-American (HA) populations. Our preliminary analyses demonstrate that these differences extend to post-ICH risk for recurrent ICH, cognitive decline and late-life depression and that blood pressure (BP) may play a fundamental role in these differences. Our revised proposal, best titled ""Longitudinal Follow-up of ICH Survivors in ERICH,"" will systematically determine whether 1) AA and HA are predisposed to CSVD of all types, 2) are predisposed solely to increased risk of AS, or 3) have no inherent predisposition but, through the effects of BP suffer more severe CSVD. To test the central hypothesis that discovering the mechanisms for this health disparity ICH will yield biological insights for CSVD, advance the search for treatments and have impact at the bedside, we propose to leverage the soon- to-conclude Ethnic/Racial Variations of ICH (ERICH) study to perform longitudinal follow-up of a cohort of 900 ICH survivors (300 each of AA, HA, and NHW), recruited in the last two years of ERICH, who have had neuroimaging, genetic, epidemiologic, and socio-ethnic variables ascertained at time of enrollment. Subjects will be followed by telephone every 6 months according to established and validated protocols. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Cerebral small vessel disease (CSVD) is a common, progressive condition of aging, and a leading contributor to age-related disability due to stroke, cognitive decline, gait deterioration, and late-life depression. The most severe and acute manifestation of CSVD is intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), which is frequently the sentinel event that brings a patient's CSVD to clinical attention for the first time. ICH and CSVD affect African-American and Hispanic individuals differently compared to non-Hispanic Whites. The proposed study seeks to better characterize the mechanisms for this health disparity by determining why African-American and Hispanic survivors of ICH are at higher risk of recurrent ICH, cognitive decline and incident depression, all of which are manifestations of progressive CSVD.",Recurrent Hemorrhagic Stroke in Minority Populations,9855077,R01NS093870,"['Affect ', ' Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', ' Aging ', ' Attention ', ' Biology ', ' Blood Pressure ', ' Cerebral hemisphere hemorrhage ', ' Cerebral Brain Hemorrhage ', ' Cerebral Hemorrhage ', ' Cerebral Parenchymal Hemorrhage ', ' Cerebrum Hemorrhage ', ' Intracerebral Hemorrhage ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiologic ', ' epidemiological ', ' Gait ', ' Hispanic Americans ', ' Spanish Americans ', ' Hypertension ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' high blood pressure ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' Investments ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' MR Imaging ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MRI ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Pathology ', ' Patients ', ' Play ', ' Recurrence ', ' Recurrent ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Stroke ', ' Apoplexy ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' brain attack ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Telephone ', ' Phone ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Measures ', ' Cerebral Amyloid Angiopathy ', ' Congophilic Angiopathy ', ' cerebrovascular amyloidosis ', ' Afro American ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Black Populations ', ' black American ', ' African American ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Latino Population ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' hispanic community ', ' Hispanics ', ' Acute ', ' Clinical ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Biological ', ' Survivors ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Predisposition ', ' disability ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Genetic ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' cognitive loss ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' Life ', ' Severities ', ' Event ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' hemorrhagic stroke ', ' Brain hemorrhage ', ' American ', ' cohort ', ' BP control ', ' BP homeostasis ', ' BP management ', ' BP regulation ', ' blood pressure control ', ' blood pressure homeostasis ', ' blood pressure management ', ' regulate BP ', ' regulate blood pressure ', ' blood pressure regulation ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' neuroimaging ', ' Preventative strategy ', ' Preventive strategy ', ' Prevention strategy ', ' Deterioration ', ' Sentinel ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Nonhispanic ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' follow-up ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Elderly depression ', ' late life depression ', ' geriatric depression ', ' age dependent ', ' age related ', ' Minority ', ' Population ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' new drug treatments ', ' new drugs ', ' new therapeutics ', ' new therapy ', ' next generation therapeutics ', ' novel drug treatments ', ' novel drugs ', ' novel therapy ', ' novel therapeutics ', ' white matter change ', ' high risk ', ' public health relevance ', ' clinical risk ', ' Personalized medical approach ', ' individualized approach ', ' precision approach ', ' tailored approach ', ' personalized approach ', ' histopathologic examination ', ' histopathological examination ', ' cerebral small vessel disorder ', ' Cerebral small vessel disease ', ' recruit ', ' ']",NINDS,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R01,2020,354157,-0.036338122988385554
"An adaptive treatment intervention for depression and engagement in HIV care among Latinos living with HIV 6. PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT This K01 Mentored Research Scientist Development Award will support the training of the Principal Investigator and the conduct of original research in the area of mobile health, sequential multiple assignment randomized trial designs (SMART), and implementation science. The goal of the training and research will be to treat problems with depression in sample of Latinos living with HIV. The overall goal of this K01 is to use a SMART to build an adaptive treatment strategy (ATS) that has a mobile health tool to improve adherence to the treatments for depression that are being proposed, and then evaluate the SMART and ATS through an implementation science model. The treatments being tested are a behavioral activation therapy (BAT), a cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), and mobile health (mHealth) tool (i.e., text-messaging protocol). The outcomes are to assess the feasibility of the SMART and ATS in the HIV care site and acceptability of the SMART and ATS to patients and clinic staff. To achieve the overall goal, three specific aims are outlined. Aim 1 uses qualitative research methods for the conduct of focus groups and individual interviews with HIV+ Latinos in both English and Spanish. The goal of Aim 1 is to tailor the intervention to the cultural and linguistic needs of Latinos and the organization needs of the HIV clinic study site, which informs Aim 2. Aim 1 is guided by the CDCs Map of Adaptation tailoring framework, which consist of three Action Steps. Action Step 1-3 are to better understand and document: 1) expressions for depression in Spanish and barriers to care, 2) language issues in detecting and reporting depressive symptoms, 3) cultural perspectives of how depression presents as a barrier to care, and 4) attitudes (i.e., cognitive and emotional evaluations) toward BAT and CBT, and text- message preference and confidentiality concerns to promote adherence to the intervention activities. Aim 2 is to build and test a pilot SMART. An ATS is a set of decision rules that uses detectable changes in patient health status to inform the next course of treatment. Aim 3 is to determine an adoption, implementation, and sustainability plan for adaptive depression treatment strategies into HIV care settings. Aim 3 is guided by the Capability, Opportunity, and Motivation System (COM-B) system and related Behavioral Change Wheel. This K01 attempts to maximize the clinical benefit of the BAT, CBT and mHealth programs by personalizing them to the patient. Successful completion of the proposed study will yield pilot data on the feasibility and acceptability of an ATS for depression integrated into HIV primary care, which will support the submission of an R01 full- scale efficacy trial. The results of this K01 can lead to future studies to personalize treatment interventions to enhance engagement with HIV care and mental health care for vulnerable populations. 7. PROJECT NARRATIVE Latinos are disproportionately impacted by the domestic HIV epidemic and untreated mental health problems continue to be a major public health challenge. Untreated mental health problems are driving poor outcomes along the HIV Care Continuum and impeding efforts to reduce health disparities and new infections.

"Telehealth Treatments for Depression with Low-Income Homebound Seniors ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long-term objective of the proposed study is to improve access to depression treatments for low-income, racially diverse homebound seniors, a population experiencing significant disparities in mental health care due to their homebound and low-income status. Specific aims are to compare the acceptability, clinical effectiveness, treatment cost, and budget impact of the two teledelivered treatment delivery models: problem- solving therapy (PST) by licensed clinicians and self-care management (SCM) support by trained lay mental health workers/advisors. The interventionists will be integrated into an aging-service agency; hence, integrated tele-PST (IT-PST) ad integrated tele-SCM (IT-SCM). Although tele-psychotherapy is likely to be an effective mental health service delivery model for the target population, the current and projected shortage of such clinicians and the costs of deploying highly trained professionals pose barriers to this model's widespread real- world adoption and sustainability. A more plausible option may indeed have to utilize trained lay mental health workers. The study participants will be 276 low-income, racially diverse homebound seniors who are served by a home-delivered meal (HDM) program and other aging-service agencies in Austin, Tex. In a 3-arm, pragmatic clinical trial with randomization prior to consent (a preferred public health approach), the participants will receive five sessions of IT-PST, five sessions of IT-SCM, or five telephone check-in calls (for the usual care- UC-group). Our first hypothesis is that IT-PST and IT-SCM will be equally acceptable to the participants. Our second hypothesis is that both IT-PST and IT-SCM will be more effective than UC in reducing depressive symptoms, although IT-PST may be more effective than IT-SCM. Symptoms will be assessed with the 24-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD) at 12, 24, and 36 weeks after baseline. Additional outcomes will be depression-free days (DFDs) and disability (WHODAS 2.0). Our third hypothesis is that IT-SCM will have a lower delivery cost than IT-PST, but both IT-PST and IT-SCM will be more cost-effective than usual care. The analyses include (a) comparisons of delivery costs between IT-PST and IT-SCM; (b) assessment of cost- effectiveness (CEA) based on DFDs and health-related quality adjusted life-year measured by EuroQol-5 (EQ- 5D); and (3) budget impact (BIA) of IT-PST relative to IT-SCM. Both CEA and BIA will employ a hybrid public program perspective of the AoA and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid. Public health significance of this study is that the data will help aging-service providers and funders assess respective strengths and weaknesses of each model as a sustainable approach to providing depression care for an underserved and growing population group and improving their access to evidence-based mental health services. (We use the terms older adults and seniors interchangeably because the latter term is frequently used in aging services.) PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Significance This study aims to find an effective and sustainable approach to reducing disparities in accessing mental health services for an underserved and growing population group of low-income, racially diverse, homebound older adults. It will compare two aging-service integrated, tele delivered depression treatments for these seniors. One model is short-term problem-solving therapy by licensed clinicians; the second model is self-care management support by trained lay advisors.

"Optimizing Diabetes Care Quality for Low-Income Patients This K23 award will establish the candidate, Dr. Elizabeth Rogers, as an independent physician-investigator with expertise in development, implementation, and evaluation of patient-centered primary care interventions that are strategically designed to address patient complexity – both medical and social – to optimize care for low-income patients with multiple chronic diseases. Most of the 29.1 million Americans with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) have at least one additional chronic condition, but existing management guidelines fail to account for patient complexity. Despite evidence of effective clinic-based interventions, diabetes care quality remains low, particularly in safety net settings serving patients with low incomes, who are disproportionately racial and ethnic minorities, and who carry a larger burden of chronic disease. Until patient complexity factors are meaningfully addressed with specific, pragmatic interventions, patients with comorbid T2DM will remain at risk for poor-quality care. To address this critical need, Dr. Rogers's K23 project will identify key clinic and patient influences on care quality by using a “cumulative complexity model” as a framework. This model focuses on patients' experiences of (1) “workload” (disease-specific work such as attending appointments and self-care, plus “life” demands such as job, family, and transportation) and (2) “capacity” (e.g. fatigue and physical symptoms, plus factors such as literacy, finances, and social support). The project will be conducted in urban Minnesota clinics that are certified Patient-Centered Medical Homes and part of the Hennepin County Medical Center's safety net care system. After stratifying clinics by diabetes care quality, researchers will administer clinician and staff surveys in 3 high- and 3 low-scoring clinics to identify clinic resources associated with optimal diabetes care quality (Aim 1). They will conduct surveys and in-depth interviews with “at-risk” patients from these sites to discern their perspectives on social vulnerabilities that impede their engagement in care and specific clinic resources that are helpful in overcoming these obstacles (Aim 2). They will apply these results using the multiphase optimization strategy (MOST, used to design effective and efficient interventions) to develop and pilot test a clinic-based, multi-component behavioral intervention – one engineered to reduce patient workload, augment patient capacity, and thereby optimize patient-centered care for complex patients with T2DM and depression (Aim 3). A robust training plan, closely aligned with the research plan, will support the development of Dr. Rogers's expertise in patient-centered outcomes research, mixed methodology, and clinic-based intervention development and evaluation. She will be supported by a multidisciplinary team of mentors with expertise in these areas as well as in diabetes, depression, and multimorbidity, and with strong links to community stakeholders. This proposal addresses NIDDK priorities by positioning Dr. Rogers to advance patient-centeredness and improve care quality for patients at risk of experiencing low quality of care, and to test practical and sustainable strategies for improving care delivery and health outcomes in diabetes. PROJECT NARRATIVE Managing diabetes along with co-occurring chronic conditions is a common problem for low-income patients, many of whom also experience social vulnerabilities. Improving the quality of diabetes care in the clinics serving this patient population requires both clinic- and patient-level initiatives.
