"CANCER - REACHING MEDICALLY UNDERSERVED POPULATIONS The purpose of the  Cancer:-Reaching Medically Underserved Populations: Low Literacy and Culturally Specific Barriers Symposium to be held on November 12, 1999 is threefold: 1) to identify literacy and cultural barriers which negatively impact on cancer prevention and treatment in minority and other medically underserved populations 2) to present strategies for developing research programs which address the specific needs of minority and medically underserved populations 3) to disseminate information regarding unique, effective programs which increase access to early detection, prevention and treatment programs targeting minority and medically underserved populations.  The Symposium is sponsored by the Robert H. Lurie Comprehensive Cancer Center, Northwestern University Medical School, the Center for Outcomes Research and Education of Evanston Northwestern Healthcare, the Midwest Regional Research Center for the VA and the Chicago VA Health Care System-Lakeside Division.  The impetus for the meeting was a 1999 report to Congress titled,  Assessment of NIH Research and Programs for Ethnic Minorities and the Medically Underserved , prepared by an Institute on Medicine task force.  The report summarized that although significant research funding is aimed at this special population and despite the fact that cancer mortality seems to be declining in the total population, persistent disparities exist between ethnic minorities and the general public with regard to cancer incidence and mortality rates.  The Symposium will be divided into two sessions: a morning session,  Low Literacy, the Unrecognized Barriers to Cancer Treatment and Prevention  and an afternoon session,  Culturally Specific Interventions:: What Works, What Doesn t .  Topics to be discussed include cultural barriers to cancer prevention and early detection, strategies for recruiting minority group members for clinical research, methodologies for assessing quality of life during cancer treatment and cancer screening programs in low income communities.  Symposium speakers will include M. Alfred Haynes, MD, MPD, former President and Dean, Drew Meharry Morehouse Consortium Cancer Center (keynote speaker); Frank Baker, Ph.D., Director, Behavioral Research Center, American Cancer Society; Gilbert Friedell, MD, Director Emeritus, Markey Cancer Center; Terry Davis, Ph.D., Louisiana State University; Sara Moody-Thomas, MD, Stanley S.

The Center is organized into nine major programs:  Tumor Immunology, Structural Biology, Virology, Tumor Biology, Experimental Therapeutics, Neuro-Oncology, Women's Cancer, Cancer Chemoprevention, and Cancer Control & Population Science.  The Administration component of the Center provides fiscal management of more than 500 accounts (more than $80 million), personnel (464), planning, coordination, and evaluation.  The Center provides 15 Core grant supported Shared Facilities involving research technology, biostatistics and bioinformatics, tissue procurement, and patient recruitment and retention.  The Cancer Center has 3,444 tumor registry new patient accruals annually and places 779 patients on clinical trials annually including 539 accruals to therapeutic trials in the most recent 12 months.  There is an emphasis on investigator-initiated trials and early phase I and II trials.  The Center has successfully competed for four SPORE grants in Breast Cancer, Ovarian Cancer, Brain Tumors, and Pancreatic Cancer.  The major thrust of the Cancer Control & Population Science Program is minority health disparity with an emphasis on rural, underserved populations in Alabama and Mississippi. In addition, there have been over 24,828 accruals to Cancer Prevention and Control trials over the last funding period primarily related to screening and early detection studies.  The Center has had a successful development funding component with recruitment of vital scientific and leadership individuals and an active pilot project program.  Internal committees and External Advisory Committee provide advice to the senior leadership of the Center.  The Center has strong support by the University and the community with a productive record of successful grant support and scientific publications.

"University of New Mexico Cancer Center Support Located in a region of rich multicultural and multiethnic diversity, tremendous scientific and technological capability, and challenging health and socioeconomic disparity, The University of New Mexico Cancer Research and Treatment Center (UNM CRTC) is uniquely poised to make significant contributions to the Nation's mission to reduce cancer incidence and eliminate death and suffering from cancer. The special characteristics of the UNM CRTC are the multiethnic populations that it serves with their strikingly different patterns of cancer incidence and mortality, the integration of regional scientific and technologic strengths into its Research Programs, and the extensive networks and partnerships that it has developed for participatory community-based research. Funded by a NCI P20 Cancer Center Planning Grant since 9/1/2000, the Center has made tremendous progress. With significant institutional, State, and community support, the CRTC has hired 36 new cancer specialists and scientists; doubled its annual NCI ($9,730,273 in direct costs + $2,004,977 in direct costs to the UNM NCI SEER program) and total peer-reviewed cancer funding ($25,257,828 in direct and $35,517,100 in total costs); formalized consortium arrangements with the Lovelace Respiratory Research Institute (LRRI) and partnerships with Sandia National Laboratory; doubled the number of newly diagnosed patients treated at the CRTC; significantly increased patient participation in clinical trials (35% of all patients were accrued to intervention studies, 13% to therapeutic studies); and maintained very high rates of care to underserved and minority patients (in a State where 33% of cancer cases occur in ethnic minorities, 52% of the patients treated at the UNM CRTC were minorities; minority accrual to all types of cancer protocols was 52% and 38% to therapeutic studies). The 91 Members of the UNM CRTC are clustered into 4 Research Programs: Cancer Epidemiology and Prevention, Cancer Biology, Hematologic Malignancies, and Women's Cancers that are focused on the following overall goals: 1. To conduct outstanding multidisciplinary and trandisciplinary cancer research in our laboratories, clinics, and communities that builds on unique institutional and regional scientific strengths and collaborative research partnerships with the Lovelace Respiratory Research Institute and New Mexico's National Laboratories. 2. To reduce cancer incidence and mortality by discovering the genetic, environmental, social, and behavioral factors that contribute to the distinct cancer patterns in the multiethnic populations of New Mexico. 3. To reduce cancer health disparities in the historically underserved populations of the Southwest through collaborative community networks with the State Department of Health; New Mexico Pueblos, Tribes, and American Indian Nations; the Indian Health Service; and local communities by developing culturally appropriate cancer education, screening, and prevention programs. 4. To provide outstanding cancer treatment for all New Mexicans, by improving access to quality cancer care and innovative therapies through increased referrals and formal affiliations with community cancer care providers. 5.

NCI grant support has increased from $79M to $118M (49%) with the largest number of NCI grants for any center (more than 240), including 10 SPOREs and 11 P01s. Research Programs remain at 19 with three additional programs in development. Since the last CCSG renewal, basic science has been strengthened substantially in immunology, signaling, genetics, non-mammalian models and structural biology, to complement traditional strengths in carcinogenesis, metastasis and developmental biology. Translational research has been enhanced at each organ site, a program initiated in molecular diagnostics and new leaders and faculty recruited in molecular imaging and targeted therapy. In-house drug development has been encouraged with more than 30 drugs and agents in different stages of development. Clinical research has been strengthened with the recruitment of new leadership, further development of infrastructure and data bases, initiation of an institution-wide phase I program and emphasis on hypothesis driven, investigator initiated trials. Clinical trials conducted at MDACC have prompted the approval of six new drugs and antibodies by the FDA. Strategic alliances have been established selectively with major pharmaceutical companies to accelerate the pace of drug development. Cancer prevention has continued to flourish with development of new methods in behavioral research, a major epidemiologic study in the Hispanic community of Houston, a program in health disparities research and the completion of major trials in chemoprevention. Support is requested for 21 shared resources that have facilitated these many activities and enhanced our research productivity. Funds are also requested for Planning and Evaluation, Senior Leaders, Program Leaders and for Development to enhance faculty recruitment, to provide seed support for multi-investigator grants and to develop a limited number of new shared resources.

"Enhancement of Two Key Research Programs within the Sylvester Cancer Center DESCRIPTION (Provided by the applicant): The Sylvester Cancer Center (Sylvester) is a membership-based, matrix organization which brings together 121 members and 133 affiliate faculty investigators from 18 different departments in two different schools of the University of Miami to conduct multidisciplinary cancer research. Interdisciplinary translational research is facilitated through the center's seven multidisciplinary research programs (MRPs). Total NCI funding is currently $19,297,201 million for 70 projects. Continuing development of Sylvester's Viral Oncology and Bio-behavioral Oncology MRPs are among the highest priorities of the Center. Each address unique community needs through cohesive research themes that take advantage of faculty strengths. Both are relatively small programs which have identified critical gaps that can be best filled through recruitment. We are proposing two candidates for recruitment - one into each of these Programs. The investigators named in this application were identified following strategic planning at the Center's membership retreat in the fall of last year, and had already made initial visits to the Center when recruiting was suspended due to financial challenges in the University. Fortunately (for Sylvester) they are still available and highly interested. Detailed plans for development of their research have been completed as has a plan for evaluation of overall success. The Sylvester research budget is highly dependent on fundraising, endowment, institutional support, and State funding. All four of these sources of support have been adversely impacted by the current recession. Funding of this P30 would provide critical support for strengthening two of the Center's seven MRPs. As a regional resource, the Center has a direct impact on a primary catchment area that includes 5.4 million people living along 125 miles of coastline in the three counties of southeast Florida. Because of its tourist oriented and growth based economy, this area has been particularly hard hit by the current recession. Sylvester is also highly interactive within the School of Medicine. All faculty recruitment is done jointly with the most appropriate academic department. Collaborations with other centers and institutes also abound, including the Interdisciplinary Stem Cell Institute, the Miami Institute for Human Genomics and the Miami CTSA initiative. It follows that enhancing these two MRPs will strengthen Sylvester and this Academic Health Science Center. Collaborative research is essential to reduce the human burden from cancer. This project would strengthen multidisciplinary research programs studying 1. cancers caused by viruses, and 2. biobehavioral and physical aspects of cancer survival - both of which are especially relevant to the South Florida community",Enhancement of Two Key Research Programs within the Sylvester Cancer Center,7860786,P30CA147890,"['Late Effects ', ' Adverse Late Effects ', ' Endowment ', '

"Minority-Based CCOP at UMDNJ-NJ Medical School/University Hospital Cancer Center    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We are proposing to establish a Minority-Based Community Clinical Oncology Program at the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey-New Jersey Medical School/University Hospital Cancer Center. We serve a patient population which is primarily from the inner city neighborhoods of Newark, surrounding towns and urban communities of Essex County. The patients are more than 60% African American and Latino, have disproportionately low income, high poverty rates and high mortality from cancer. The University Hospital Tumor Registry records over 1100 new cancer cases a year, with disproportionately high incidence of head and neck, liver, and cervical cancer. We also see a high number of cases with breast, gastrointestinal, prostate, lung and brain tumors. The Cancer Center physicians work in collaboration to provide a team approach to therapy. Each new patient is presented at one of 9 disease-specific tumor boards or Grand Rounds. The Cancer Center Community has an extraordinary track record in outreach to the surrounding community with programs that include the Institute for the Elimination of Health Disparities, Community Partnership for Better Health, screening and education programs through the Cancer Control Committee, Screening Access of Value to Essex (S.A.V.E.) mobile screening program, the Women's Health Initiative prevention studies, the Institute for Complementary and Alternative Medicine, Improving Minority and Medically Under-Served Participation and Access in Cancer Clinical Trials (IMPACT) and the Essex County Coalition, all of which have pledged to recruit minority patients to our MBCCOP studies. We propose to develop a coordinated research program through the MBCCOP by opening more than 43 prevention/control and treatment trials from 9 research bases to make available clinical protocols for most tumor types. Our Cancer Center Clinical Research Office and its staff have extensive experience with accruing and maintaining minority patients on studies. We will expand a novel approach of using patient study navigators form the community who communicate and develop trust with patients. This has resulted in an increase in accrual to clinical trials. We outlined a model that will ensure accrual of more than 50 minority patients a year each on prevention/control and on treatment protocols.          ",Minority-Based CCOP at UMDNJ-NJ Medical School/University Hospital Cancer Center,7658448,U10CA128506,"['Dentistry ', ' Complementary and alternative medicine ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Low income ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Minority-Based Community Clinical Oncology Program ', ' Cancer Center ', ' Cancer Control ', ' Cancer Control Science ', ' Community Clinical Oncology Program ', ' Community Oncology ', ' CCOP ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Health ', ' tumor registry ', ' University Hospitals ', ' Incidence ', ' Institutes ', ' Ensure ', ' Screening procedure ', ' screenings ', ' screening ', ' Trust ', ' Liver ', ' hepatic organ system ', ' hepatic body system ', ' Lung ', ' pulmonary ', ' Lung Respiratory System ', ' Medicine ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Mortality ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' New Jersey ', ' Collaborations ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Poverty ', ' Prostate ', ' Prostatic Gland ', ' Prostate Gland ', ' Records ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' recruit ', ' Research ', ' medical schools ', ' school of medicine ', ' medical college ', ' programs ', ' Treatment Protocols ', ' Treatment Schedule ', ' Treatment Regimen ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Head and neck structure ', ' Head and Neck ', ' gastrointestinal ', ' inner city ', ' experience ', ' Brain Neoplasms ', ' tumors in the brain ', ' Brain Tumors ', ' Brain Neoplasia ', ' Breast ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' outreach ', ' Prevention ', ' Malignant neoplasm of cervix uteri ', ' Uterine Cervix Cancer ', ' Malignant Uterine Cervix Tumor ', ' Malignant Uterine Cervix Neoplasm ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Cervix Uteri ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Cervix ', ' Malignant Neoplasm of the Cervix ', ' Malignant Cervical Tumor ', ' Malignant Cervical Neoplasm ', ' Cervix Cancer ', ' Cervical Cancer ', ' County ', "" Women's Health "", ' Female Health ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Latino ', ' Modeling ', ' Clinical Protocols ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' clinical investigation ', ' Communities ', ' treatment trial ', ' Minority ', ' novel strategies ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel approaches ', ' new approaches ', ' tumor ', ' patient population ', ' ']",NCI,RBHS-NEW JERSEY MEDICAL SCHOOL,U10,2009,600052,0.046598435426243576

Anderson Cancer Center (MDACC) is a free-standing comprehensive cancer center within the University of Texas system. The mission of the MDACC is to eliminate cancer in Texas, the nation and the world through outstanding integrated programs of patient care, research, education and prevention. MDACC is dedicated wholly to the study of cancer involving a continuum of basic, clinical and population-based investigation, with an emphasis on multidisciplinary translational research. During the last 5 years, the number of cancer center members has increased 35%, facilities including those under construction have increased 39% and new patients have increased 70%. Annual citations in Pub Med have increased to 1179 (9.4%), including many articles in journals with the highest impact factors, reflecting substantial contributions to cancer research. During the last 4 years, total grant funding has increased 39%. NCI grant support has increased from $79M to $118M (49%) with the largest number of NCI grants for any center (more than 240), including 10 SPOREs and 11 P01s. Research Programs remain at 19 with three additional programs in development. Since the last CCSG renewal, basic science has been strengthened substantially in immunology, signaling, genetics, non-mammalian models and structural biology, to complement traditional strengths in carcinogenesis, metastasis and developmental biology. Translational research has been enhanced at each organ site, a program initiated in molecular diagnostics and new leaders and faculty recruited in molecular imaging and targeted therapy. In-house drug development has been encouraged with more than 30 drugs and agents in different stages of development. Clinical research has been strengthened with the recruitment of new leadership, further development of infrastructure and data bases, initiation of an institution-wide phase I program and emphasis on hypothesis driven, investigator initiated trials. Clinical trials conducted at MDACC have prompted the approval of six new drugs and antibodies by the FDA. Strategic alliances have been established selectively with major pharmaceutical companies to accelerate the pace of drug development. Cancer prevention has continued to flourish with development of new methods in behavioral research, a major epidemiologic study in the Hispanic community of Houston, a program in health disparities research and the completion of major trials in chemoprevention. Support is requested for 21 shared resources that have facilitated these many activities and enhanced our research productivity. Funds are also requested for Planning and Evaluation, Senior Leaders, Program Leaders and for Development to enhance faculty recruitment, to provide seed support for multi-investigator grants and to develop a limited number of new shared resources.

"Cancer Therapy & Research Center at UTHSCSA    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This application is to renew the NCI Cancer Center P30 Support Grant for the Cancer Therapy & Research Center (CTRC) at the University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio (UTHSCSA) for years 17-21. The CTRC at UTHSCSA merged with the formerly-independent CTRC to form this new entity (hereinafter called ""CTRC""). This merger, in the form of a $150 million gift, the largest gift in UTHSCSA history, and among the largest in University of Texas history, brings full alignment to our Cancer Center activities. With this merger and realignment, the CTRC has re-entered a period of significant growth and improvement in the quality of its clinical, basic, translational and population-based research programs. Our NCI funding base has increased from $8,453,756 in 2006 to $11,050,146 in 2007. We serve a vast geographic region in and around San Antonio and South Texas, larger than the state of Pennsylvania and comprising 4.4 million inhabitants. Our population is predominantly Hispanic and dominated by individuals in lower socioeconomic strata with the lowest rates of health insurance coverage in the nation. We have worked to serve the disadvantaged for years, and are now also re-focusing more research and clinical efforts to understand better the specific cancer-related risks and disease patterns in Hispanics, and to serve the needs of our citizens better. We have significant community outreach, wellness and cancer screening programs reaching these disadvantaged populations. These efforts are greatly helped in that leaders in our Cancer Center and at UTHSCSA are Hispanic.

"Cancer Center Support (Core) Grant    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center (MDACC) is a free-standing comprehensive cancer center within the University of Texas system. The mission of the MDACC is to eliminate cancer in Texas, the nation and the world through outstanding integrated programs of patient care, research, education and prevention. MDACC is dedicated wholly to the study of cancer involving a continuum of basic, clinical and population-based investigation, with an emphasis on multidisciplinary translational research. During the last 5 years, the number of cancer center members has increased 35%, facilities including those under construction have increased 39% and new patients have increased 70%. Annual citations in Pub Med have increased to 1179 (9.4%), including many articles in journals with the highest impact factors, reflecting substantial contributions to cancer research. During the last 4 years, total grant funding has increased 39%. NCI grant support has increased from $79M to $118M (49%) with the largest number of NCI grants for any center (more than 240), including 10 SPOREs and 11 P01s. Research Programs remain at 19 with three additional programs in development. Since the last CCSG renewal, basic science has been strengthened substantially in immunology, signaling, genetics, non-mammalian models and structural biology, to complement traditional strengths in carcinogenesis, metastasis and developmental biology. Translational research has been enhanced at each organ site, a program initiated in molecular diagnostics and new leaders and faculty recruited in molecular imaging and targeted therapy. In-house drug development has been encouraged with more than 30 drugs and agents in different stages of development. Clinical research has been strengthened with the recruitment of new leadership, further development of infrastructure and data bases, initiation of an institution-wide phase I program and emphasis on hypothesis driven, investigator initiated trials. Clinical trials conducted at MDACC have prompted the approval of six new drugs and antibodies by the FDA. Strategic alliances have been established selectively with major pharmaceutical companies to accelerate the pace of drug development. Cancer prevention has continued to flourish with development of new methods in behavioral research, a major epidemiologic study in the Hispanic community of Houston, a program in health disparities research and the completion of major trials in chemoprevention.

"University of New Mexico Cancer Center Support Serving a vast geographic region of great beauty, with rich multicultural and multiethnic diversity, tremendous scientific opportunity, and challenging health and socioeconomic disparities, the University of New Mexico Cancer Center and its consortium institutions, Lovelace Respiratory Research Institute, Los Alamos National Laboratory, and Sandia National Laboratories, are uniquely poised to make significant advances in cancer research and to serve our communities and our nation. As the only NCI Cancer Center within a 500 mile radius, the special characteristics of the UNM Cancer Center include: the multiethnic and multicultural populations that it serves, primarily Hispanic/Latino, American Indian, and non-Hispanic White, with their strikingly different patterns of cancer incidence, mortality, and disparity; the integration of regional scientific strengths in engineering, biotechnology, nanotechnology, radioisotopes, drug discovery, imaging, and high performance computing into its Research Programs and Shared Resources; and the extensive statewide outreach networks it has built for the delivery of cancer care, for culturally appropriate community-based education and participatory research, and for the participation of community oncologists in UNM Cancer Center clinical trials. Since the previous NCI P30 CCSG review in 2005, the Center's annual peer-reviewed research funding has increased 40% to over $46.8 million dollars in total costs, while annual funding from NCI increased 30% to over $13.8 million dollars. Intra-programmatic and inter-programmatic collaborations among the 117 members of the Center have increased markedly and range from 20-48% in each of the 4 Research Programs: Cancer Population Sciences, Cancer Biology and Biotechnology, Hematologic Malignancies, and Women's Cancers. Cancer Center members lead one of 9 NIH-funded Roadmap Centers for High Throughput Target Screening and Molecular Discovery {U54MH084690), one of 10 NIH-funded National Centers for Systems Biology (P50GM085273), one of 4 NSF/NCI Centers for Integrative Nanoscience and Microsystems Training (DGE0504276), one of 20 LLS Specialized Centers of Leukemia Research (LLS SCOR 7388-06), and an Interdisciplinary HPV Prevention Center (NIH U19AI084081). To assure that all New Mexicans have access to outstanding cancer diagnosis and treatment, the UNM Cancer Center opened its new 206,432 sq. ft., $90 million, Cancer Treatment and Clinical Research Facility in August 2009 which serves as the hub of the UNM Statewide Cancer Care Network. In collaboration with Siemens, this new facility contains a radioisotope production laboratory and experimental radiopharmacy, which will accelerate the Center's research programs. From 7/1/08-7/1/09, while maintaining its mission to the underserved and uninsured, the UNM Cancer Center accrued 443 (17%) of the 2640 newly diagnosed patients treated at the Center to therapeutic clinical trials; 51% of these patients were Hispanic or American Indian. Community affiliates accrued another 101 patients to UNM therapeutic trials. In addition, the Center had 845 accruals to non-intervention protocols in this time period. The overall goals of the UNM Cancer Center are to: 1) conduct outstanding transdisciplinary research in our laboratories, clinics and multiethnic and multicultural communities that builds upon our unique scientific and regional strengths; 2) reduce the burden of cancer incidence and mortality by discovering the genetic, environmental, social, and behavioral factors that contribute to the distinct cancer patterns and cancer disparities in the peoples of the American Southwest; 3) translate our scientific discoveries to novel diagnostic, screening, prevention, and therapeutic tools and clinical trials; and 4) provide access to outstanding cancer treatment and clinical trials for all New Mexicans.

"Duke Comp Cancer Inst. Core Support Grant    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   The recently reorganized Duke Comprehensive Cancer Institute (DCCI) is charged to serve as the center of all Duke activities in cancer, with an imperative to oversee all of the Duke cancer operations in the future. As a matrix center in one of the largest biomedical research institutes, the DCCI has been continuously supported by the National Cancer Institute (NCI) for over 36 years, by leveraging Duke's basic research strengths with significant clinical oncology research excellence which is enabled by treating 5,581 new cancer patients annually, enrolling over 1,000 patients annually onto therapeutic clinical trials, and enhanced by the presence of national oncology research resources, such as the data and statistical centers of two NCI-funded cooperative groups. Total membership in the DCCI is 285 members, with members having an increasingly prominent focus in cancer research and increased amount of NCI funding since 2004. Total funding for program members is $331,617,013, of which $269,525,804 is from peer-reviewed sources. A cancer focus is illustrated by $77,785,582 or 23.5% of funding from the NCI, the American Cancer Society or the Department of Defense. From 2004-2008, program members published 6,941 papers in peer-reviewed journals cited in PubMed. Of these publications, 10% are the result of intra-programmatic collaborations and 19% due to inter-programmatic collaborations. In this competitive renewal application, we request support for our membership in 11 Research Programs supported by 17 Shared Resources. DCCI members made significant scientific advances including:  the development of innovative genomic tests to predict which cancer patients would respond to specific chemotherapy, and basic insight into critical signaling pathways in cancer and developmental biology. The DCCI oversees all cancer related philanthropy at Duke, and these funds have been used to support recruitment of new members, innovative pilot projects, support of multidisciplinary research, and new laboratory and administrative space. This application for ongoing support of the DCC articulates the principles, goals and strategies for propelling the DCCI to fully leverage the enormous advances in biomedical research at Duke and beyond, to improve and extend the lives of cancer patients with cancer and at risk for cancer, and delivering these to society.      OVERALL CRITIQUE: The mission statement of the Duke Comprehensive Cancer Institute (DCCI) is that it seeks to: 1) extend and improve the quality of life for the patient with cancer, to extend and improve the lives of populations with cancer or at risk of cancer, and to contribute to society via cancer research; 2) perform research of the cause, prevention, treatment and cure of cancer and associated conditions; and 3) serve as a focal point for discovery, development and delivery of novel concepts in cancer detection, prevention and treatment to patients and to society.       The DCCI was recently reorganized. Formerly the Duke Comprehensive Cancer Center (DCCC), which was founded in 1972 and which had been funded since 1972, the DCCI was formed in 2008. The primary goal of this realignment, completed with the support of the Dean Nancy Andrews, M.D., of the School of Medicine, was to better align cancer research and care. The DCCI is distinct from the DCCC in that it possesses additional institutional resources and infrastructure; much of this is in the form of clinical trials support. The designation as an institute at Duke also enables enhanced oversight over components of the departments, as well as over the Health System and improved cancer-related communication and coordination among basic science departments. Because of the recency and significance of the administrative changes of the past year, the DCCI has not yet implemented a strategic plan; however, the strategic plan, under development at the time of application submission, was available at the site visit.       There is now a new structure of leadership for the DCCI. The Cancer Medicine Leadership Council is comprised of representatives of the relevant Duke clinical and research units (i.e., Health System, hospital, departments, centers and institutes). This council has input into major strategic and operational decision-making.   The Senior Leadership Committee, described as the major decision-making body of the DCCI, meets bi-weekly, with attendance mandatory. There is also an Executive Committee which meets monthly is charged with reviewing membership, resource allocation, and policy.      Although basic science is well represented among the research programs, the application emphasizes translation from cancer control to basic science to phase l and ll clinical trials and to participation in the NCI cooperative groups, in large scale epidemiologic studies and health services research. Overall accrual to clinical trials, a key element of impact, is impressive. Most of the diseases studied at DCCI accrue well to clinical trials. Overall, accrual to investigator initiated clinical trials is high.       The DCCI is comprised of 11 research programs: Cell Regulation Transmembrane Signaling; Nucleic Acid Biology; Structural and Chemical Biology; Cancer Genetics and Genomics; Cancer Biology; Radiation Oncology; Neuro-Oncology; Experimental Therapeutics; Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation and Hematological Malignancies; Breast and Ovarian Cancer; and Cancer Prevention, Detection and Control.       The DCCI defines in cancer-related funding sources include the NCI, American Cancer Society (ACS), Department of Defense (DOD) and Komen Foundation. The Cell Regulation and Transmembrane Signaling Program, with 36 members and 732 cancer-related publications and $26 million  in peer-reviewed funding, including $3 million  from NCI, the DOD and ACS, was rated very good to excellent. Although the overall quality of science in this program is outstanding, cancer focus and collaboration among the members could be improved. The Nucleic Acid Biology Program, with 20 members and 290 peer-reviewed publications and $7.2 million in peer-reviewed funding, including $790,000 from NCI, DOD and ACS, was rated very good to good. This program was seen as comprised of two groups that did not really share a common focus; collaboration was limited, and its leaders did not demonstrate sufficient evidence of intent in improving the program. Previous reviews, including external advisory board (EAB) reviews, had questioned the cancer focus of the program, but this did not appear to have changed significantly. The Structural and Chemical Biology Program, with 21 members and 432 peer-reviewed publications and $8.7 million in peer-reviewed funding, including $1.3 million from NCI, DOD and ACS, was rated very good; while there is some very strong research in the program, there is a lack of apparent cancer focus and a clearly articulated vision of the program. The Cancer Genetics and Genomics Program, with 21 members and 449 peer-reviewed publications and $25 million peer-reviewed funding, including $8.7 million from NCI, the DOD and ACS, was rated outstanding to excellent. The Cancer Biology Program, with 37 members and 625 publications and $22 million in peer-reviewed funding, including $6.2 million from NCI, DOD and ACS, was rated good to very good; the degree to which the three themes of emphases of this program actually come together as a program was not clear.       The Radiation Oncology Program, with 24 members and 424 peer-reviewed publications and $12.8 million in peer reviewed funding, including $4.8 million from NCI, DOD and ACS, was rated outstanding to exceptional. The Neuro-oncology Program, with 26 members and 612 peer-reviewed publications and $10 million in peer-reviewed funding, including $5.1 million from the NCI, DOD and ACS, was rated exceptional to outstanding; it was described by one reviewer as the paradigmatic translational program. The Experimental Therapeutics Program, with 27 members and 628 peer-reviewed publications and $13.7 million in peer-reviewed funding, including $9.4 million from NCI, DOD and ACS, was rated excellent to very good to outstanding. Strengths noted in this program included the phase I research, grants support, and the publications in high impact journals. The Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation and Hematological Malignancies Program, with 35 members and 706 publications and $64 million in peer reviewed funding, including $2.7 million from the NCI, DOD and ACS, was rated very good to excellent to good; a major concern regarding this program was its heavy dependence on industry funding. The Breast and Ovarian Oncology Program, with 29 members and 737 peer-reviewed publications and $10.5 million in peer-reviewed funding, including $8.1 million from NCI, DOD and ACS, was rated exceptional to outstanding; the program is highly translational, yet it has basic science strengths and has contributed significantly to high-impact journals. The Cancer Prevention, Detection and Control Program, with 45 members and over 1,100 peer-reviewed publications and $21 million in peer reviewed funding, including about $3 million from the NCI, DOD and ACS was rated excellent. Dr. Abernethy's presentation was excellent; she is doing an excellent job of melding the elements of the program into a more coherent unit.  The Overall Quality of the Program was rated excellent to very good. Several very impressive programs are part of the DCCI, however there were concerns regarding several programs having diffuse cancer focus and weakness in their intra-programmatic and inter-programmatic synergy.       The research programs are supported by 17 shared resources. These shared resources were rated as follows:  High Resolution NMR Spectroscopy/X-ray Crystallography, very good; DNA Analysis/ Automated Sequencing and Phosphorimaging, very good; Light Microscopy, outstanding; Flow Cytometry, excellent; Transgenic and Knockout Mouse, outstanding; Immunoincompetent Rodent and Biohazard, very good to excellent; DNA Microarray, outstanding to exceptional; Radiochemistry, very good to excellent; Optical Molecular Imaging and Analysis, outstanding to excellent; Proteomics, outstanding; Tissue and Blood Procurement, very good to good; Pharmaceutical Research, excellent to outstanding; Clinical Cell Processing and Cell Culture, good to very good to satisfactory; Information Systems, outstanding to excellent to exceptional; Bioinformatics, excellent; Biostatistics, excellent to very good; and Clinical Trials was rated excellent to very good.       The Protocol Review and Monitoring System (PRMS) was conditionally approved. There is a need for closer scrutiny of accrual and closure of poorly accruing trials; the accrual monitoring should be part of the PRMS activities.  There are also concerns that need to be addressed regarding committee appointments, and that protocol reviews should be provided in more detail and the protocol document should include pertinent drug and toxicity data.  Protocol-specific research support received an excellent to very good rating.  Data and Safety Monitoring/NIH Policy was rated acceptable (approval).       The component, Inclusion of Women in Clinical Research, was approved as was the Inclusion of Minorities in Clinical Research; a minority report recommending disapproval was made for the latter component. The Inclusion of Children in Clinical Research was approved.       Senior leadership was evaluated as very good to excellent. Planning and evaluation was rated very good to excellent.  Developmental funds was rated excellent to very good.  Administration was rated good to satisfactory.  Under the current leadership, there are notable discoveries which impact directly on cancer detection and treatment as well as strengths in basic science research. The leadership team consists of prominent scientists with the majority having significant administrative experience. A number of them are also departmental heads and leaders of the medical school, and as such, play important roles in providing strong cancer advocacy to the University. Many members of the leadership team have a history of working together in the development of this Center.       All of the essential characteristics were met.  Among the essential characteristics, facilities were rated excellent; organizational capabilities was rated good to very good; transdisciplinary collaboration was rated very good to excellent; cancer focus was rated very good to excellent; institutional commitment was rated outstanding to excellent; and the center director was rated excellent to outstanding.      As strengths, the Center has recruited well and excelled in research, which contributes to the areas of outstanding science seen in many of the programs. To the leadership's credit, the Center has been able to attract high caliber scientists to serve as program leaders.  Based on the overall increase in cancer related funding, the overall cancer focus has improved; however the membership definition of cancer focus appears to be somewhat overly inclusive and there are missed opportunities for some of the basic science programs to move outstanding researchers to be directly involved in research. The uneven quality of the programs and issues related to the program reorganization raised in the critiques require the leadership's attention; variability in the quality of the information provided by the programs detracted from enthusiasm for the application. Although the overall translational activities at the Center are impressive, the limited emphasis on translational aspects, by some of the basic science programs, requires the attention of the leadership. In addition, guidance is needed for the improvement of the intra- and inter-programmatic collaborations, especially for those programs with limited joint publications and participations in P01 and SPORE grants.         The overall evaluation of the DCCI notes that there are pockets of very strong research within the Center and the reviewers were convinced that there is great potential for the Center to continue, under Dr. Lyerly's leadership, to advance under its new status as an institute within Duke University.  This application is rated Very Good; range of scores:  Excellent to Very Good.  Support for five years is recommended as requested.       COMPREHENSIVENESS (Stage I)      Research exists in the areas of basic, clinical, and cancer control, prevention, and population studies that is productive.  The Cancer Center has programmatic areas with breath and depth, including research in the areas of cancer control, prevention, and population studies.  There is at the DCCI significant depth and strength in cancer research, with much of that research appearing as publications in extremely strong, influential journals.  Evidence was presented in the application and at the site visit that interactions occur between these three essential areas of research, some notable.  Although overall the translational activities at the Cancer Center are impressive, enhancement of translational activities of some basic science programs would be beneficial, as would improvements of intra- and inter-programmatic collaborations among some programs.  The potential for further growth is noted.  This Cancer Center fulfills the scientific requirements of comprehensive designation.  Thus, the research-related aspects of comprehensiveness were approved.      Assessment:  Approval      IRG NOTE      In response to the draft Site Visit Report, written comments were received from the principal investigator in a letter dated August 3, 2009.  The comments and the draft Site Visit Report were carefully considered by the NCI IRG, Subcommittee A, members during the discussion, final assessment, and scoring of the application. A motion to re-vote the merit of the Structural and Chemical Biology Program did not pass.  The component, Inclusion of Minorities in Clinical Research, was recommended for approval; a minority report recommending disapproval was made for this component. Clarifications and corrections of the text have been made, where appropriate. This application is rated Very Good; range of scores:  Excellent to Very Good.  The motion for five years of support, as requested, passed.  In the Overall Budget Recommendation, based on its assessment of the overall quality of science in the Center, the Subcommittee recommended $6,343,041 (total costs); this recommendation is made to provide the Center an amount of support appropriate to its level of total National Cancer Institute funding.  The motion for approval of the scientific requirements of comprehensive designation (Stage I) was approved; see heading, Comprehensiveness (Stage I).                              HUMAN SUBJECTS RESUME      THE FOLLOWING RESUME SECTIONS WERE PREPARED BY THE SCIENTIFIC REVIEW ADMINISTRATOR TO SUMMARIZE THE OUTCOME OF DISCUSSIONS OF THE REVIEW COMMITTEE ON THE FOLLOWING ISSUES:      PROTECTION OF HUMAN SUBJECTS (Resume):  ACCEPTABLE (Also, see the heading, Data and Safety Monitoring/ NIH Policy)      INCLUSION OF WOMEN PLAN (Resume):  ACCEPTABLE (Also, see the heading, Inclusion of Women in Clinical Research.)      INCLUSION OF MINORITIES PLAN (Resume):  ACCEPTABLE (Also, see the headings, Inclusion of Minorities in Clinical Research and Scientific Review Officer's Note.)      INCLUSION OF CHILDREN PLAN (Resume):  ACCEPTABLE (Also, see the heading, Inclusion of Children in Clinical Research.)      VERTEBRATE ANIMAL (Resume): ACCEPTABLE       SCIENTIFIC REVIEW OFFICER'S NOTE:  Clinical Cell Processing and Cell Culture Shared Resource: This budget is contingent upon evidence of funded cell therapy trials. The early development of the human cancer stem cell purification is not yet established and would be more appropriately covered under Developmental Funds.  Also, aspects of this shared resource appear to overlap with the functions of a core in P01 CA78673 (PI: Dr. Clay).       Minority Report: Inclusion of Minorities in Clinical Research:  A minority of the review team voted against the motion for approval; it is the minority opinion that this component be recommended for disapproval. Little progress has occurred in the accrual of minorities to clinical trials at DCCI.  Even more striking is the recognition by DCCI that their referral base is in excess of 30% minority population. In 2002, minorities represented approximately 14.5% of the patients accrued to clinical trials; in 2008 minorities accounted for 12.4% of the accrual. Of the minority accrual, 10.9% were African American (similar to 10.7% in 2002). In contrast, the DCCI tumor registry lists 18.9% of the patients treated at DCCI as minorities of which 16.7% are African American. Thus, based on the data provided at the time of the site visit, when compared to the demographics in the DCCI Tumor Registry and when compared to the DCCI catchment area, the under-representation of minorities accrued to therapeutic clinical trials continues as a concern. Information regarding accrual to non-therapeutic trials as distributed at the site visit indicated 25.6% of the accruals were minorities and 23.2 % were African Americans; details of the regional demographics were not presented. Minority accrual, however, needs to be referenced against the catchment area, not just those registered at the Center.       The deficiency in the accrual of minorities to clinical trials is again acknowledged by the applicants and some plans previously articulated are outlined.  These plans include the use of the Duke Oncology Network and the plans to draw upon the expertise of the cancer prevention research group, who in the prior application were shown to have slightly more success in accruing minorities to their non-therapeutic trials. An area of some success has been the increase in minority accrual onto CALGB and breast cancer trials, and the establishment of a patient navigator is seen as a positive step. Of concern, however, is despite a formal health disparities theme in the Breast and Ovarian Cancer Program, the overall minority accrual remains unchanged and metrics to evaluate the plan for interventions are still lacking. Overall, the efforts in the intervening years have not been enough to bring about sufficient change; thus, concerns remain that the strategies proposed now may not be sufficiently different.  Part of the problem may rest in not having an individual specifically identified with responsibility for oversight of the recruitment of minorities. The hiring of a treatment navigator is recognized as an appropriate first step, but not sufficient to bridge this deficiency. Given that this deficiency was noted in the two prior CCSG reviews, this matter deserves greater attention at the level of the DCCI Director's Office and perhaps other Medical Center leadership.  Recruitment of a Health Disparities Program Coordinator to manage disparities may also be helpful, but should not dissuade the leadership from relocating this responsibility to the Director's office. It is noted that the prior CCSG review expressed concern that without greater intervention, this component might be disapproved.      NIH Policy on Sharing of Model Organisms for Biomedical Research: The application does not specifically address the NIH Policy on Sharing of Model Organisms for Biomedical Research.        Policy for Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS): The applicant does not specifically address this policy. A plan is not provided for GWAS studies supported through CCSG elements.  [NIH is interested in advancing genome-wide association studies (GWAS) to identify common genetic factors that influence health and disease through a centralized GWAS data repository. For the purposes of this policy, a genome-wide association study is defined as any study of genetic variation across the entire human genome that is designed to identify genetic associations with observable traits (such as blood pressure or weight), or the presence or absence of a disease or condition. All applications, regardless of the amount requested, proposing a genome-wide association study are expected to provide a plan for submission of GWAS data to the NIH-designated GWAS data repository, or provide an appropriate explanation why submission to the repository is not possible. Data repository management (submission and access) is governed by the Policy for Sharing of Data Obtained in NIH Supported or Conducted Genome-Wide Association Studies, NIH Guide NOT-OD-07-088.]  For additional information, see http://grants.nih.gov/grants/gwas/.  Program staff is responsible for assessing the appropriateness and adequacy of proposed data sharing plans.  Program concerns regarding data sharing plans must be resolved prior to making awards.      ESTABLISHED RESEARCH PROGRAMS        Cell Regulation and Transmembrane Signaling      DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   The goal of the Program in Cell Regulation and Transmembrane Signaling is to foster scientific interactions between members of the Duke Comprehensive Cancer Institute (DCCI) who have interest in understanding the biology involved in regulating cell proliferation and death. The Program continues to attract individuals interested in aspects of cell signaling. Currently, the Program includes 36 members from 9 different basic and clinical departments. To foster an outstanding forum for scientific discourse and collaboration, the Program remains organized into one of four interest groups that include:  1) transmembrane signaling; 2) intracellular signaling; 3) cell proliferation and death; and 4) signaling and disease. The program sponsors three distinct educational activities, the University-wide weekly seminar series ""The Signal Transduction Colloquium"" (STQ), the most attended series on campus; a graduate course in Cellular Signaling, taken by the majority of biomedical graduate students; and an Annual Offsite Retreat. The last two years' retreats each featured more than 20 platform and 100 poster presentations by members, students and fellows. Speakers for the STQ selected by a panel of Program members come primarily from outside the Duke University Medical Center to represent the broad interests of the membership (See list of invited speakers since 2004, Appendix P1). Each colloquium speaker meets with interested members of the Program and lunches with students in the Molecular Cancer Biology Graduate Program immediately after completion of the seminar. The diversity of experimental approaches used by the members of this Program represents an effective asset for promoting cross-fertilization of ideas aimed at understanding cell growth and regulation. During the last grant period, members of the Program have published 800 papers in primary peer-reviewed journals of which 732 or 90% bear directly on cancer-related problems. Finally nearly 15% of the cancer-related publications (98) are the result of intra-programmatic or inter-programmatic collaboration among DCCI members.

"University of New Mexico Cancer Center Support Serving a vast geographic region of great beauty, with rich multicultural and multiethnic diversity, tremendous scientific opportunity, and challenging health and socioeconomic disparities, the University of New Mexico Cancer Center and its consortium institutions, Lovelace Respiratory Research Institute, Los Alamos National Laboratory, and Sandia National Laboratories, are uniquely poised to make significant advances in cancer research and to serve our communities and our nation. As the only NCI Cancer Center within a 500 mile radius, the special characteristics of the UNM Cancer Center include: the multiethnic and multicultural populations that it serves, primarily Hispanic/Latino, American Indian, and non-Hispanic White, with their strikingly different patterns of cancer incidence, mortality, and disparity; the integration of regional scientific strengths in engineering, biotechnology, nanotechnology, radioisotopes, drug discovery, imaging, and high performance computing into its Research Programs and Shared Resources; and the extensive statewide outreach networks it has built for the delivery of cancer care, for culturally appropriate community-based education and participatory research, and for the participation of community oncologists in UNM Cancer Center clinical trials. Since the previous NCI P30 CCSG review in 2005, the Center's annual peer-reviewed research funding has increased 40% to over $46.8 million dollars in total costs, while annual funding from NCI increased 30% to over $13.8 million dollars. Intra-programmatic and inter-programmatic collaborations among the 117 members of the Center have increased markedly and range from 20-48% in each of the 4 Research Programs: Cancer Population Sciences, Cancer Biology and Biotechnology, Hematologic Malignancies, and Women's Cancers. Cancer Center members lead one of 9 NIH-funded Roadmap Centers for High Throughput Target Screening and Molecular Discovery {U54MH084690), one of 10 NIH-funded National Centers for Systems Biology (P50GM085273), one of 4 NSF/NCI Centers for Integrative Nanoscience and Microsystems Training (DGE0504276), one of 20 LLS Specialized Centers of Leukemia Research (LLS SCOR 7388-06), and an Interdisciplinary HPV Prevention Center (NIH U19AI084081). To assure that all New Mexicans have access to outstanding cancer diagnosis and treatment, the UNM Cancer Center opened its new 206,432 sq. ft., $90 million, Cancer Treatment and Clinical Research Facility in August 2009 which serves as the hub of the UNM Statewide Cancer Care Network. In collaboration with Siemens, this new facility contains a radioisotope production laboratory and experimental radiopharmacy, which will accelerate the Center's research programs. From 7/1/08-7/1/09, while maintaining its mission to the underserved and uninsured, the UNM Cancer Center accrued 443 (17%) of the 2640 newly diagnosed patients treated at the Center to therapeutic clinical trials; 51% of these patients were Hispanic or American Indian. Community affiliates accrued another 101 patients to UNM therapeutic trials. In addition, the Center had 845 accruals to non-intervention protocols in this time period. The overall goals of the UNM Cancer Center are to: 1) conduct outstanding transdisciplinary research in our laboratories, clinics and multiethnic and multicultural communities that builds upon our unique scientific and regional strengths; 2) reduce the burden of cancer incidence and mortality by discovering the genetic, environmental, social, and behavioral factors that contribute to the distinct cancer patterns and cancer disparities in the peoples of the American Southwest; 3) translate our scientific discoveries to novel diagnostic, screening, prevention, and therapeutic tools and clinical trials; and 4) provide access to outstanding cancer treatment and clinical trials for all New Mexicans. The University of New Mexico Cancer Center serves a vast geographic region in the American Southwest with striking ethnic and cultural diversity and significant cancer health disparities. Its transdisciplinary research programs focus on integrating advanced scientific capabilities in nanotechnology, drug discovery, radioisotopes and imaging, engineering, and computing with biomedical science to make novel discoveries and translate these discoveries to new and more effective cancer diagnostics and therapeutics. It is focused on the delivery of outstanding care to the peoples of the region and overcoming their cancer health disparities through community programs and partnerships.

"University of New Mexico Cancer Center Support    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Serving a vast geographic region of great beauty, with rich multicultural and multiethnic diversity, tremendous scientific opportunity, and challenging health and socioeconomic disparities, the University of New Mexico Cancer Center and its consortium institutions, Lovelace Respiratory Research Institute, Los Alamos National Laboratory, and Sandia National Laboratories, are uniquely poised to make significant advances in cancer research and to serve our communities and our nation. As the only NCI Cancer Center within a 500 mile radius, the special characteristics of the UNM Cancer Center include: the multiethnic and multicultural populations that it serves, primarily Hispanic/Latino, American Indian, and non-Hispanic White, with their strikingly different patterns of cancer incidence, mortality, and disparity; the integration of regional scientific strengths in engineering, biotechnology, nanotechnology, radioisotopes, drug discovery, imaging, and high performance computing into its Research Programs and Shared Resources; and the extensive statewide outreach networks it has built for the delivery of cancer care, for culturally appropriate community-based education and participatory research, and for the participation of community oncologists in UNM Cancer Center clinical trials. Since the previous NCI P30 CCSG review in 2005, the Center's annual peer-reviewed research funding has increased 40% to over $46.8 million dollars in total costs, while annual funding from NCI increased 30% to over $13.8 million dollars. Intra-programmatic and inter-programmatic collaborations among the 117 members of the Center have increased markedly and range from 20-48% in each of the 4 Research Programs: Cancer Population Sciences, Cancer Biology and Biotechnology, Hematologic Malignancies, and Women's Cancers. Cancer Center members lead one of 9 NIH-funded Roadmap Centers for High Throughput Target Screening and Molecular Discovery {U54MH084690), one of 10 NIH-funded National Centers for Systems Biology (P50GM085273), one of 4 NSF/NCI Centers for Integrative Nanoscience and Microsystems Training (DGE0504276), one of 20 LLS Specialized Centers of Leukemia Research (LLS SCOR 7388-06), and an Interdisciplinary HPV Prevention Center (NIH U19AI084081). To assure that all New Mexicans have access to outstanding cancer diagnosis and treatment, the UNM Cancer Center opened its new 206,432 sq. ft., $90 million, Cancer Treatment and Clinical Research Facility in August 2009 which serves as the hub of the UNM Statewide Cancer Care Network. In collaboration with Siemens, this new facility contains a radioisotope production laboratory and experimental radiopharmacy, which will accelerate the Center's research programs. From 7/1/08-7/1/09, while maintaining its mission to the underserved and uninsured, the UNM Cancer Center accrued 443 (17%) of the 2640 newly diagnosed patients treated at the Center to therapeutic clinical trials; 51% of these patients were Hispanic or American Indian. Community affiliates accrued another 101 patients to UNM therapeutic trials. In addition, the Center had 845 accruals to non-intervention protocols in this time period. The overall goals of the UNM Cancer Center are to: 1) conduct outstanding transdisciplinary research in our laboratories, clinics and multiethnic and multicultural communities that builds upon our unique scientific and regional strengths; 2) reduce the burden of cancer incidence and mortality by discovering the genetic, environmental, social, and behavioral factors that contribute to the distinct cancer patterns and cancer disparities in the peoples of the American Southwest; 3) translate our scientific discoveries to novel diagnostic, screening, prevention, and therapeutic tools and clinical trials; and 4) provide access to outstanding cancer treatment and clinical trials for all New Mexicans. The University of New Mexico Cancer Center serves a vast geographic region in the American Southwest with striking ethnic and cultural diversity and significant cancer health disparities. Its transdisciplinary research programs focus on integrating advanced scientific capabilities in nanotechnology, drug discovery, radioisotopes and imaging, engineering, and computing with biomedical science to make novel discoveries and translate these discoveries to new and more effective cancer diagnostics and therapeutics. It is focused on the delivery of outstanding care to the peoples of the region and overcoming their cancer health disparities through community programs and partnerships.          ",University of New Mexico Cancer Center Support,7944373,P30CA118100,[''],NCI,UNIVERSITY OF NEW MEXICO HEALTH SCIS CTR,P30,2010,2035899,0.16689767444247103
"Minority-Based CCOP at UMDNJ-NJ Medical School/University Hospital Cancer Center    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We are proposing to establish a Minority-Based Community Clinical Oncology Program at the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey-New Jersey Medical School/University Hospital Cancer Center. We serve a patient population which is primarily from the inner city neighborhoods of Newark, surrounding towns and urban communities of Essex County. The patients are more than 60% African American and Latino, have disproportionately low income, high poverty rates and high mortality from cancer. The University Hospital Tumor Registry records over 1100 new cancer cases a year, with disproportionately high incidence of head and neck, liver, and cervical cancer. We also see a high number of cases with breast, gastrointestinal, prostate, lung and brain tumors. The Cancer Center physicians work in collaboration to provide a team approach to therapy. Each new patient is presented at one of 9 disease-specific tumor boards or Grand Rounds. The Cancer Center Community has an extraordinary track record in outreach to the surrounding community with programs that include the Institute for the Elimination of Health Disparities, Community Partnership for Better Health, screening and education programs through the Cancer Control Committee, Screening Access of Value to Essex (S.A.V.E.) mobile screening program, the Women's Health Initiative prevention studies, the Institute for Complementary and Alternative Medicine, Improving Minority and Medically Under-Served Participation and Access in Cancer Clinical Trials (IMPACT) and the Essex County Coalition, all of which have pledged to recruit minority patients to our MBCCOP studies. We propose to develop a coordinated research program through the MBCCOP by opening more than 43 prevention/control and treatment trials from 9 research bases to make available clinical protocols for most tumor types. Our Cancer Center Clinical Research Office and its staff have extensive experience with accruing and maintaining minority patients on studies. We will expand a novel approach of using patient study navigators form the community who communicate and develop trust with patients. This has resulted in an increase in accrual to clinical trials. We outlined a model that will ensure accrual of more than 50 minority patients a year each on prevention/control and on treatment protocols.          ",Minority-Based CCOP at UMDNJ-NJ Medical School/University Hospital Cancer Center,7919283,U10CA128506,"['Dentistry ', ' Complementary and alternative medicine ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Low income ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Minority-Based Community Clinical Oncology Program ', ' Cancer Center ', ' Cancer Control ', ' Cancer Control Science ', ' Community Clinical Oncology Program ', ' Community Oncology ', ' CCOP ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Health ', ' tumor registry ', ' University Hospitals ', ' Incidence ', ' Institutes ', ' Ensure ', ' Screening procedure ', ' screenings ', ' screening ', ' Trust ', ' Liver ', ' hepatic organ system ', ' hepatic body system ', ' Lung ', ' pulmonary ', ' Lung Respiratory System ', ' Medicine ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Mortality ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' New Jersey ', ' Collaborations ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Poverty ', ' Prostate ', ' Prostatic Gland ', ' Prostate Gland ', ' Records ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' recruit ', ' Research ', ' medical schools ', ' school of medicine ', ' medical college ', ' programs ', ' Treatment Protocols ', ' Treatment Schedule ', ' Treatment Regimen ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Head and neck structure ', ' Head and Neck ', ' gastrointestinal ', ' inner city ', ' experience ', ' Brain Neoplasms ', ' tumors in the brain ', ' Brain Tumors ', ' Brain Neoplasia ', ' Breast ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' outreach ', ' Prevention ', ' Malignant neoplasm of cervix uteri ', ' Uterine Cervix Cancer ', ' Malignant Uterine Cervix Tumor ', ' Malignant Uterine Cervix Neoplasm ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Cervix Uteri ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Cervix ', ' Malignant Neoplasm of the Cervix ', ' Malignant Cervical Tumor ', ' Malignant Cervical Neoplasm ', ' Cervix Cancer ', ' Cervical Cancer ', ' County ', "" Women's Health "", ' Female Health ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Latino ', ' Modeling ', ' Clinical Protocols ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' clinical investigation ', ' Communities ', ' treatment trial ', ' Minority ', ' novel strategies ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel approaches ', ' new approaches ', ' tumor ', ' patient population ', ' ']",NCI,UNIV OF MED/DENT OF NJ-NJ MEDICAL SCHOOL,U10,2010,630052,0.046598435426243576

"Cancer Center Support Grant The genetic understanding of cancer has led to enhanced individual risk assessment, improved screening  guidelines, and improved outcomes based on cancer prevention, early detection, and, in some cases,  targeted therapy. Huntsman Cancer Institute (HOI) is positioned to make exceptional contributions in this  individualized oncology arena. HCi has a unique research resource to support genetic and population  studies, the Utah Population Database (UPDB), a compelling history of genetic discovery in oncology, and a  strategic plan to accelerate translational advances from this platform. We have forged an alliance with  intermountain Healthcare, a nationally acclaimed Utah health network, linking data for more than 80-85  percent of the cancer patients in our State to the UPDB, enabling the entire population of Utah to comprise a  cancer research laboratory for genetic, population, and outcomes research. Utah is home to seven Native  American tribes or nations as well as extensive rural and frontier populations that have poor cancer  outcomes. We aim to serve as a national research resource for addressing the needs of these underserved  populations to improve cancer prevention and care.  HCI research is organized into five Programs that provide an environment of cancer focus, transdisciplinary  exchange, and collaboration: Nuclear Control of Cell Growth and Differentiation; Cell Response and  Regulation; Imaging, Diagnostics, and Therapeutics; Gastrointestinal Cancers; and Cancer Control and  Population Sciences. These Programs integrate the activities of 133 members who have $45 million in  extramural grant support, with more than $17 million in NCI direct costs. Cancer-focused research during the  current award period is documented in 1,374 unique publications, of which 26 percent are collaborative with  one or more Cancer Center members. Thirteen Cancer Center Shared Resources support our scientists,  providing access to specialized instrumentation, assays, services, research materials, and expert  consultation and collaboration.  We request funds to support Years 21-25 of our Cancer Center Support Grant (CCSG). A new Executive  Director, Mary Beckerle, PhD, was appointed in August 2006. Under her leadership, HCI has developed a  plan to guide the next five years, including expansion of HCI's cancer specialty hospital, expansion of HCI's  genetic platform for pre-clinical studies, development of a Center for Investigational Therapeutics (including a  Phase I program), and expansion of population science (including epidemiological and behavioral research)  to impact care of cancer survivors and reduce health disparities.

"Cancer Center Support (Core) Grant    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center (MDACC) is a free-standing comprehensive cancer center within the University of Texas system. The mission of the MDACC is to eliminate cancer in Texas, the nation and the world through outstanding integrated programs of patient care, research, education and prevention. MDACC is dedicated wholly to the study of cancer involving a continuum of basic, clinical and population-based investigation, with an emphasis on multidisciplinary translational research. During the last 5 years, the number of cancer center members has increased 35%, facilities including those under construction have increased 39% and new patients have increased 70%. Annual citations in Pub Med have increased to 1179 (9.4%), including many articles in journals with the highest impact factors, reflecting substantial contributions to cancer research. During the last 4 years, total grant funding has increased 39%. NCI grant support has increased from $79M to $118M (49%) with the largest number of NCI grants for any center (more than 240), including 10 SPOREs and 11 P01s. Research Programs remain at 19 with three additional programs in development. Since the last CCSG renewal, basic science has been strengthened substantially in immunology, signaling, genetics, non-mammalian models and structural biology, to complement traditional strengths in carcinogenesis, metastasis and developmental biology. Translational research has been enhanced at each organ site, a program initiated in molecular diagnostics and new leaders and faculty recruited in molecular imaging and targeted therapy. In-house drug development has been encouraged with more than 30 drugs and agents in different stages of development. Clinical research has been strengthened with the recruitment of new leadership, further development of infrastructure and data bases, initiation of an institution-wide phase I program and emphasis on hypothesis driven, investigator initiated trials. Clinical trials conducted at MDACC have prompted the approval of six new drugs and antibodies by the FDA.

In this application, UMGCC seeks its first competitive renewal of the successful Cancer Center Support Grant (CCSG) application that was awarded in August 2008, in the present application, UMGCC is represented by 215 members working in five full and one developing research programs with 10 full and 3 developing shared services. UMGCC provides an effective umbrella supporting the multidisciplinary cancer research activities of this talented group of investigators. Total cancer funding rose from $47.1 million in 2007 to $62.0 million in 2009. NCI funding in that time increased from $14.4 million to $25.7 million. Supplements will push total cancer funding above $80 million in 2010. In FY2009, UMGCC served almost 2,300 new cancer patients and handled 43,547 outpatient visits, 32,405 infusion visits, and 1,327 inpatient admissions. During FY2009, 1,198 patients participated in over 200 clinical trials. Remarkably, 33 percent of clinical trial participants in FY2009 were underrepresented minorities, reflecting UMGCC's unique position and mission to involve the minority community in state-of-the-art clinical/translational research. UMGCC researchers have made outstanding contributions to our understanding of cancer biology, and important recent work from our laboratories and clinics is now the standard of care worldwide.

"Cancer Center Support Grant    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The genetic understanding of cancer has led to enhanced individual risk assessment, improved screening guidelines, and improved outcomes based on cancer prevention, early detection, and, in some cases, targeted therapy. Huntsman Cancer Institute (HCI) is positioned to make exceptional contributions in this individualized oncology arena. HCI has a unique research resource to support genetic and population studies, the Utah Population Database (UPDB), a compelling history of genetic discovery in oncology, and a strategic plan to accelerate translational advances from this platform. We have forged an alliance with Intermountain Healthcare, a nationally acclaimed Utah health network, linking data for more than 80-85 percent of the cancer patients in our State to the UPDB, enabling the entire population of Utah to comprise a cancer research laboratory for genetic, population, and outcomes research. Utah is home to seven Native American tribes or nations as well as extensive rural and frontier populations that have poor cancer outcomes. We aim to serve as a national research resource for addressing the needs of these underserved populations to improve cancer prevention and care.       HCI research is organized into five Programs that provide an environment of cancer focus, transdisciplinary exchange, and collaboration:  Nuclear Control of Cell Growth and Differentiation; Cell Response and Regulation; Imaging, Diagnostics, and Therapeutics; Gastrointestinal Cancers; and Cancer Control and Population Sciences.

"Cancer Center Core Support Grant DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The UNC Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center requests renewal of its National Cancer Institute (NCI) Center Core Support Grant (CCSG) for Years 36-40. Over the past CCSG cycle, the Center has grown in funding, membership, facilities and productivity. NCI funding has increased from $45M to $64M and total cancer-related extramural funding rose from $150M to $220M yearly. The Center's 295 members (up from 235) span the basic, clinical and population sciences; all areas have seen an increase in faculty funding and research productivity. A tradition of interaction among disciplines, fostered by a proactive matrix cancer center at a highly-regarded public university provides an outstanding venue for integrating forward-looking interdisciplinary cancer research. Cancer center members hold 34 multi-investigator program grants and 26 training grants. Faculty additions in the physical and pharmaceutical sciences created new opportunities in drug discovery and delivery. Substantial investment in faculty, equipment and bioinformatics dramatically expanded our cancer genetics research effort; UNC was again selected as a site of The Cancer Genome Atlas. Thirty-eight clinical researchers were recruited, strengthening our multidisciplinary cancer care and research teams. Our publication rate in top clinical oncology journals increased by four-fold. Accruals to therapeutic trials, including investigator-initiated trials, more than doubled to 850 and 434 respectively. Our population scientists initiated new endeavors in cancer communication, dissemination, survivorship, and molecular epidemiology. Groundbreaking observations in breast cancer minority disparity research have emerged from the Center's epidemiology and clinical programs. The formation of transdisciplinary teams stimulates progress toward implementing the Center's and NCI's strategic objectives. Major events include opening the North Carolina Cancer Hospital, a new clinical structure that nearly triples patient care space, and new basic science buildings. The Center's significant and continued expansion, including 20 faculty recruitments now in progress, is driven by remarkable institutional support including direct support for cancer research from the state legislature. The UNC Lineberger requests funding for nine scientific programs, 20 shared resources, two staff investigators, and for leadership, planning and evaluation, administration, and developmental research. The increased CCSG budget will support technological and operational expansion of cores and faculty recruitment in the basic, translational, clinical, and population sciences. With these funds, a talented faculty integrated through cancer center mechanisms will make advances in the prevention, early detection, and treatment of cancer in North Carolina and the nation.

"Cancer Center Core Support Grant DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The UNC Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center requests renewal of its National Cancer Institute (NCI) Center Core Support Grant (CCSG) for Years 36-40. Over the past CCSG cycle, the Center has grown in funding, membership, facilities and productivity. NCI funding has increased from $45M to $64M and total cancer-related extramural funding rose from $150M to $220M yearly. The Center's 295 members (up from 235) span the basic, clinical and population sciences; all areas have seen an increase in faculty funding and research productivity. A tradition of interaction among disciplines, fostered by a proactive matrix cancer center at a highly-regarded public university provides an outstanding venue for integrating forward-looking interdisciplinary cancer research. Cancer center members hold 34 multi-investigator program grants and 26 training grants. Faculty additions in the physical and pharmaceutical sciences created new opportunities in drug discovery and delivery. Substantial investment in faculty, equipment and bioinformatics dramatically expanded our cancer genetics research effort; UNC was again selected as a site of The Cancer Genome Atlas. Thirty-eight clinical researchers were recruited, strengthening our multidisciplinary cancer care and research teams. Our publication rate in top clinical oncology journals increased by four-fold. Accruals to therapeutic trials, including investigator-initiated trials, more than doubled to 850 and 434 respectively. Our population scientists initiated new endeavors in cancer communication, dissemination, survivorship, and molecular epidemiology. Groundbreaking observations in breast cancer minority disparity research have emerged from the Center's epidemiology and clinical programs. The formation of transdisciplinary teams stimulates progress toward implementing the Center's and NCI's strategic objectives. Major events include opening the North Carolina Cancer Hospital, a new clinical structure that nearly triples patient care space, and new basic science buildings. The Center's significant and continued expansion, including 20 faculty recruitments now in progress, is driven by remarkable institutional support including direct support for cancer research from the state legislature. The UNC Lineberger requests funding for nine scientific programs, 20 shared resources, two staff investigators, and for leadership, planning and evaluation, administration, and developmental research. The increased CCSG budget will support technological and operational expansion of cores and faculty recruitment in the basic, translational, clinical, and population sciences.

"Minority-Based CCOP at UMDNJ-NJ Medical School/University Hospital Cancer Center    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We are proposing to establish a Minority-Based Community Clinical Oncology Program at the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey-New Jersey Medical School/University Hospital Cancer Center. We serve a patient population which is primarily from the inner city neighborhoods of Newark, surrounding towns and urban communities of Essex County. The patients are more than 60% African American and Latino, have disproportionately low income, high poverty rates and high mortality from cancer. The University Hospital Tumor Registry records over 1100 new cancer cases a year, with disproportionately high incidence of head and neck, liver, and cervical cancer. We also see a high number of cases with breast, gastrointestinal, prostate, lung and brain tumors. The Cancer Center physicians work in collaboration to provide a team approach to therapy. Each new patient is presented at one of 9 disease-specific tumor boards or Grand Rounds. The Cancer Center Community has an extraordinary track record in outreach to the surrounding community with programs that include the Institute for the Elimination of Health Disparities, Community Partnership for Better Health, screening and education programs through the Cancer Control Committee, Screening Access of Value to Essex (S.A.V.E.) mobile screening program, the Women's Health Initiative prevention studies, the Institute for Complementary and Alternative Medicine, Improving Minority and Medically Under-Served Participation and Access in Cancer Clinical Trials (IMPACT) and the Essex County Coalition, all of which have pledged to recruit minority patients to our MBCCOP studies. We propose to develop a coordinated research program through the MBCCOP by opening more than 43 prevention/control and treatment trials from 9 research bases to make available clinical protocols for most tumor types. Our Cancer Center Clinical Research Office and its staff have extensive experience with accruing and maintaining minority patients on studies. We will expand a novel approach of using patient study navigators form the community who communicate and develop trust with patients. This has resulted in an increase in accrual to clinical trials. We outlined a model that will ensure accrual of more than 50 minority patients a year each on prevention/control and on treatment protocols.          Minority patients in primarily urban, medically underserved neighborhoods do not have the same access to cancer prevention/control or treatment trials as more affluent, non-minority patients.

"University of New Mexico Cancer Center Support   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Serving a vast geographic region of great beauty, with rich multicultural and multiethnic diversity, tremendous scientific opportunity, and challenging health and socioeconomic disparities, the University of New Mexico Cancer Center and its consortium institutions, Lovelace Respiratory Research Institute, Los Alamos National Laboratory, and Sandia National Laboratories, are uniquely poised to make significant advances in cancer research and to serve our communities and our nation. As the only NCI Cancer Center within a 500 mile radius, the special characteristics of the UNM Cancer Center include: the multiethnic and multicultural populations that it serves, primarily Hispanic/Latino, American Indian, and non-Hispanic White, with their strikingly different patterns of cancer incidence, mortality, and disparity; the integration of regional scientific strengths in engineering, biotechnology, nanotechnology, radioisotopes, drug discovery, imaging, and high performance computing into its Research Programs and Shared Resources; and the extensive statewide outreach networks it has built for the delivery of cancer care, for culturally appropriate community-based education and participatory research, and for the participation of community oncologists in UNM Cancer Center clinical trials. Since the previous NCI P30 CCSG review in 2005, the Center's annual peer-reviewed research funding has increased 40% to over $46.8 million dollars in total costs, while annual funding from NCI increased 30% to over $13.8 million dollars. Intra-programmatic and inter-programmatic collaborations among the 117 members of the Center have increased markedly and range from 20-48% in each of the 4 Research Programs: Cancer Population Sciences, Cancer Biology and Biotechnology, Hematologic Malignancies, and Women's Cancers. Cancer Center members lead one of 9 NIH-funded Roadmap Centers for High Throughput Target Screening and Molecular Discovery {U54MH084690), one of 10 NIH-funded National Centers for Systems Biology (P50GM085273), one of 4 NSF/NCI Centers for Integrative Nanoscience and Microsystems Training (DGE0504276), one of 20 LLS Specialized Centers of Leukemia Research (LLS SCOR 7388-06), and an Interdisciplinary HPV Prevention Center (NIH U19AI084081). To assure that all New Mexicans have access to outstanding cancer diagnosis and treatment, the UNM Cancer Center opened its new 206,432 sq. ft., $90 million, Cancer Treatment and Clinical Research Facility in August 2009 which serves as the hub of the UNM Statewide Cancer Care Network. In collaboration with Siemens, this new facility contains a radioisotope production laboratory and experimental radiopharmacy, which will accelerate the Center's research programs. From 7/1/08-7/1/09, while maintaining its mission to the underserved and uninsured, the UNM Cancer Center accrued 443 (17%) of the 2640 newly diagnosed patients treated at the Center to therapeutic clinical trials; 51% of these patients were Hispanic or American Indian. Community affiliates accrued another 101 patients to UNM therapeutic trials. In addition, the Center had 845 accruals to non-intervention protocols in this time period. The overall goals of the UNM Cancer Center are to: 1) conduct outstanding transdisciplinary research in our laboratories, clinics and multiethnic and multicultural communities that builds upon our unique scientific and regional strengths; 2) reduce the burden of cancer incidence and mortality by discovering the genetic, environmental, social, and behavioral factors that contribute to the distinct cancer patterns and cancer disparities in the peoples of the American Southwest; 3) translate our scientific discoveries to novel diagnostic, screening, prevention, and therapeutic tools and clinical trials; and 4) provide access to outstanding cancer treatment and clinical trials for all New Mexicans.  The University of New Mexico Cancer Center serves a vast geographic region in the American Southwest with striking ethnic and cultural diversity and significant cancer health disparities. Its transdisciplinary research programs focus on integrating advanced scientific capabilities in nanotechnology, drug discovery, radioisotopes and imaging, engineering, and computing with biomedical science to make novel discoveries and translate these discoveries to new and more effective cancer diagnostics and therapeutics. It is focused on the delivery of outstanding care to the peoples of the region and overcoming their cancer health disparities through community programs and partnerships.",University of New Mexico Cancer Center Support,8134339,P30CA118100,[''],NCI,UNIVERSITY OF NEW MEXICO HEALTH SCIS CTR,P30,2011,1934104,0.16689767444247103

"Cancer Center Core Support Grant DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The UNC Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center requests renewal of its National Cancer Institute (NCI) Center Core Support Grant (CCSG) for Years 36-40. Over the past CCSG cycle, the Center has grown in funding, membership, facilities and productivity. NCI funding has increased from $45M to $64M and total cancer-related extramural funding rose from $150M to $220M yearly. The Center's 295 members (up from 235) span the basic, clinical and population sciences; all areas have seen an increase in faculty funding and research productivity. A tradition of interaction among disciplines, fostered by a proactive matrix cancer center at a highly-regarded public university provides an outstanding venue for integrating forward-looking interdisciplinary cancer research. Cancer center members hold 34 multi-investigator program grants and 26 training grants. Faculty additions in the physical and pharmaceutical sciences created new opportunities in drug discovery and delivery. Substantial investment in faculty, equipment and bioinformatics dramatically expanded our cancer genetics research effort; UNC was again selected as a site of The Cancer Genome Atlas. Thirty-eight clinical researchers were recruited, strengthening our multidisciplinary cancer care and research teams. Our publication rate in top clinical oncology journals increased by four-fold. Accruals to therapeutic trials, including investigator-initiated trials, more than doubled to 850 and 434 respectively. Our population scientists initiated new endeavors in cancer communication, dissemination, survivorship, and molecular epidemiology. Groundbreaking observations in breast cancer minority disparity research have emerged from the Center's epidemiology and clinical programs. The formation of transdisciplinary teams stimulates progress toward implementing the Center's and NCI's strategic objectives. Major events include opening the North Carolina Cancer Hospital, a new clinical structure that nearly triples patient care space, and new basic science buildings. The Center's significant and continued expansion, including 20 faculty recruitments now in progress, is driven by remarkable institutional support including direct support for cancer research from the state legislature. The UNC Lineberger requests funding for nine scientific programs, 20 shared resources, two staff investigators, and for leadership, planning and evaluation, administration, and developmental research. The increased CCSG budget will support technological and operational expansion of cores and faculty recruitment in the basic, translational, clinical, and population sciences.

"University of New Mexico Cancer Center Support Serving a vast geographic region of great beauty, with rich multicultural and multiethnic diversity, tremendous scientific opportunity, and challenging health and socioeconomic disparities, the University of New Mexico Cancer Center and its consortium institutions - Lovelace Respiratory Research Institute, Los Alamos National Laboratory, and Sandia National Laboratories - are uniquely poised to make significant advances in cancer research and to serve our communities and our nation. As the only NCI Cancer Center within a 500 mile radius, the special characteristics of the UNM Cancer Center include: the multiethnic and multicultural populations that it serves - primarily Hispanic/Latino, American Indian, and non-Hispanic White - with their strikingly different patterns of cancer incidence, mortality, and disparity; the integration of regional scientific strengths in engineering, biotechnology, nanotechnology, radioisotopes, drug discovery, imaging, and high performance computing into its Research Programs and Shared Resources; and the extensive statewide outreach networks it has built for the delivery of cancer care, for culturally appropriate community-based education and participatory research, and for the participation of community oncologists in UNM Cancer Center clinical trials. Since the previous NCI P30 CCSG review in 2005, the Center's annual peer-reviewed research funding has increased 40% to over $46.8 million dollars in total costs, while annual funding from NCI increased 30% to over $13.8 million dollars. Intra-programmatic and inter-programmatic collaborations among the 117 members of the Center have  increased markedly and range from 20-48% in each of the 4 Research Programs: Cancer Population Sciences,  Cancer Biology and Biotechnology, Hematologic Malignancies, and Women's Cancers. Cancer Center members  lead one of 9 NIH-funded Roadmap Centers for High Throughput Target Screening and Molecular Discovery  {U54MH084690), one of 10 NIH-funded National Centers for Systems Biology (P50GM085273), one of 4 NSF/NCI  Centers for Integrative Nanoscience and Microsystems Training (DGE0504276), one of 20 LLS Specialized Centers of Leukemia Research (LLS SCOR 7388-06), and an Interdisciplinary HPV Prevention Center (NIH U19AI084081). To assure that all New Mexicans have access to outstanding cancer diagnosis and treatment, the UNM Cancer Center opened its new 206,432 sq. ft., $90 million, Cancer Treatment and Clinical Research Facility in August 2009 which serves as the hub of the UNM Statewide Cancer Care Network. In collaboration with Siemens, this new facility contains a radioisotope production laboratory and experimental radiopharmacy, which will accelerate the Center's research programs. From 7/1/08-7/1/09, while maintaining its mission to the underserved and uninsured, the UNM Cancer Center ccrued 443 (17%) of the 2640 newly diagnosed patients treated at the Center to therapeutic clinical trials; 51% of these patients were Hispanic or American Indian. Community affiliates accrued another 101 patients to UNM therapeutic trials. In addition, the Center had 845 accruals to non-intervention protocols in this time period. The overall goals of the UNM Cancer Center are to: 1) conduct outstanding transdisciplinary research in our laboratories, clinics and multiethnic and multicultural communities that builds upon our unique scientific and regional strengths; 2) reduce the burden of cancer incidence and mortality by discovering the genetic, environmental, social, and behavioral factors that contribute to the distinct cancer patterns and cancer disparities in the peoples of the American Southwest; 3) translate our scientific discoveries to novel diagnostic, screening, prevention, and therapeutic tools and clinical trials; and 4) provide access to outstanding cancer treatment and clinical trials for all New Mexicans. RELEVANCE:  The University of New Mexico Cancer Center serves a vast geographic region in the American Southwest with striking ethnic and cultural diversity and significant cancer health disparities. Its transdisciplinary research programs focus on integrating advanced scientific capabilities in nanotechnology, drug discovery, radioisotopes and imaging, engineering, and computing with biomedical science to make novel discoveries and translate these discoveries to new and more effective cancer diagnostics and therapeutics.

"Cancer Center Support Grant    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The genetic understanding of cancer has led to enhanced individual risk assessment, improved screening guidelines, and improved outcomes based on cancer prevention, early detection, and, in some cases, targeted therapy. Huntsman Cancer Institute (HCI) is positioned to make exceptional contributions in this individualized oncology arena. HCI has a unique research resource to support genetic and population studies, the Utah Population Database (UPDB), a compelling history of genetic discovery in oncology, and a strategic plan to accelerate translational advances from this platform. We have forged an alliance with Intermountain Healthcare, a nationally acclaimed Utah health network, linking data for more than 80-85 percent of the cancer patients in our State to the UPDB, enabling the entire population of Utah to comprise a cancer research laboratory for genetic, population, and outcomes research. Utah is home to seven Native American tribes or nations as well as extensive rural and frontier populations that have poor cancer outcomes. We aim to serve as a national research resource for addressing the needs of these underserved populations to improve cancer prevention and care.       HCI research is organized into five Programs that provide an environment of cancer focus, transdisciplinary exchange, and collaboration:  Nuclear Control of Cell Growth and Differentiation; Cell Response and Regulation; Imaging, Diagnostics, and Therapeutics; Gastrointestinal Cancers; and Cancer Control and Population Sciences. These Programs integrate the activities of 133 members who have $45 million in extramural grant support, with more than $17 million in NCI direct costs. Cancer-focused research during the current award period is documented in 1,374 unique publications, of which 26 percent are collaborative with one or more Cancer Center members. Thirteen Cancer Center Shared Resources support our scientists, providing access to specialized instrumentation, assays, services, research materials, and expert consultation and collaboration.       We request funds to support Years 21-25 of our Cancer Center Support Grant (CCSG). A new Executive Director, Mary Beckerle, Ph.D., was appointed in August 2006.

NCI grant support has increased from $79M to $118M (49%) with the largest number of NCI grants for any center (more than 240), including 10 SPOREs and 11 P01s. Research Programs remain at 19 with three additional programs in development. Since the last CCSG renewal, basic science has been strengthened substantially in immunology, signaling, genetics, non-mammalian models and structural biology, to complement traditional strengths in carcinogenesis, metastasis and developmental biology. Translational research has been enhanced at each organ site, a program initiated in molecular diagnostics and new leaders and faculty recruited in molecular imaging and targeted therapy. In-house drug development has been encouraged with more than 30 drugs and agents in different stages of development. Clinical research has been strengthened with the recruitment of new leadership, further development of infrastructure and data bases, initiation of an institution-wide phase I program and emphasis on hypothesis driven, investigator initiated trials. Clinical trials conducted at MDACC have prompted the approval of six new drugs and antibodies by the FDA. Strategic alliances have been established selectively with major pharmaceutical companies to accelerate the pace of drug development. Cancer prevention has continued to flourish with development of new methods in behavioral research, a major epidemiologic study in the Hispanic community of Houston, a program in health disparities research and the completion of major trials in chemoprevention. Support is requested for 21 shared resources that have facilitated these many activities and enhanced our research productivity. Funds are also requested for Planning and Evaluation, Senior Leaders, Program Leaders and for Development to enhance faculty recruitment, to provide seed support for multi-investigator grants and to develop a limited number of new shared resources.

"Minority-Based CCOP at UMDNJ-NJ Medical School/University Hospital Cancer Center    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We are proposing to establish a Minority-Based Community Clinical Oncology Program at the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey-New Jersey Medical School/University Hospital Cancer Center. We serve a patient population which is primarily from the inner city neighborhoods of Newark, surrounding towns and urban communities of Essex County. The patients are more than 60% African American and Latino, have disproportionately low income, high poverty rates and high mortality from cancer. The University Hospital Tumor Registry records over 1100 new cancer cases a year, with disproportionately high incidence of head and neck, liver, and cervical cancer. We also see a high number of cases with breast, gastrointestinal, prostate, lung and brain tumors. The Cancer Center physicians work in collaboration to provide a team approach to therapy. Each new patient is presented at one of 9 disease-specific tumor boards or Grand Rounds. The Cancer Center Community has an extraordinary track record in outreach to the surrounding community with programs that include the Institute for the Elimination of Health Disparities, Community Partnership for Better Health, screening and education programs through the Cancer Control Committee, Screening Access of Value to Essex (S.A.V.E.) mobile screening program, the Women's Health Initiative prevention studies, the Institute for Complementary and Alternative Medicine, Improving Minority and Medically Under-Served Participation and Access in Cancer Clinical Trials (IMPACT) and the Essex County Coalition, all of which have pledged to recruit minority patients to our MBCCOP studies. We propose to develop a coordinated research program through the MBCCOP by opening more than 43 prevention/control and treatment trials from 9 research bases to make available clinical protocols for most tumor types. Our Cancer Center Clinical Research Office and its staff have extensive experience with accruing and maintaining minority patients on studies. We will expand a novel approach of using patient study navigators form the community who communicate and develop trust with patients. This has resulted in an increase in accrual to clinical trials. We outlined a model that will ensure accrual of more than 50 minority patients a year each on prevention/control and on treatment protocols.          Minority patients in primarily urban, medically underserved neighborhoods do not have the same access to cancer prevention/control or treatment trials as more affluent, non-minority patients.

To assure that all New Mexicans have access to outstanding cancer diagnosis and treatment, the UNM Cancer Center opened its new 206,432 sq. ft., $90 million, Cancer Treatment and Clinical Research Facility in August 2009 which serves as the hub of the UNM Statewide Cancer Care Network. In collaboration with Siemens, this new facility contains a radioisotope production laboratory and experimental radiopharmacy, which will accelerate the Center's research programs. From 7/1/08-7/1/09, while maintaining its mission to the underserved and uninsured, the UNM Cancer Center ccrued 443 (17%) of the 2640 newly diagnosed patients treated at the Center to therapeutic clinical trials; 51% of these patients were Hispanic or American Indian. Community affiliates accrued another 101 patients to UNM therapeutic trials. In addition, the Center had 845 accruals to non-intervention protocols in this time period. The overall goals of the UNM Cancer Center are to: 1) conduct outstanding transdisciplinary research in our laboratories, clinics and multiethnic and multicultural communities that builds upon our unique scientific and regional strengths; 2) reduce the burden of cancer incidence and mortality by discovering the genetic, environmental, social, and behavioral factors that contribute to the distinct cancer patterns and cancer disparities in the peoples of the American Southwest; 3) translate our scientific discoveries to novel diagnostic, screening, prevention, and therapeutic tools and clinical trials; and 4) provide access to outstanding cancer treatment and clinical trials for all New Mexicans.

"New Mexico Minority Based Community Clinical Oncology Program     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): As the Official Cancer Center of the State of New Mexico and as a National Cancer Institute-Designated Cancer Center (2P30CA118100-08), it is our mission and goal to improve the quality of cancer care in our region, to develop outreach programs throughout our State that lay a foundation for community-based participatory research, and, to increase awareness, access, and participation of all New Mexicans in NCI-sponsored cancer screening, prevention, and therapeutic trials. With the highest proportion of Hispanics and American Indians of any State (41% non-Hispanic White, 46% Hispanic, and 10% American Indian), many of New Mexico's almost 2.0 million people experience unusual cancer patterns and tremendous cancer health disparities. The State of New Mexico is ranked 43rd in the United States for per capita income. According to the 2011 Census Bureau 18.4% of New Mexicans live below the poverty level versus the national average of 13%. Over 50% of New Mexicans live in rural areas of the State with often limited access to healthcare and 22.9% of New Mexicans were uninsured in 2009, according to the New Mexico Department of Health with a range of 4.8% to 31.6% among the counties in our State. The UNM Cancer Center's Office of Community Partnerships and Health Disparities works with our New Mexico MBCCOP program to facilitate community partnerships and education programs in conjunction with community partners. The UNM Cancer Center has very active Hispanic/Latino and Native American outreach programs that provide education and services to New Mexico's minority populations.          PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Serving a vast geographic region of great beauty, with rich multicultural and multiethnic diversity, tremendous scientific opportunity, and challenging health and socioeconomic disparities, the NM MBCCOP is committed to making significant advances in cancer research and assuring access and participation in NCI-sponsored clinical trials to our regional communities.

"Cancer Center Support Grant    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The genetic understanding of cancer has led to enhanced individual risk assessment, improved screening guidelines, and improved outcomes based on cancer prevention, early detection, and, in some cases, targeted therapy. Huntsman Cancer Institute (HCI) is positioned to make exceptional contributions in this individualized oncology arena. HCI has a unique research resource to support genetic and population studies, the Utah Population Database (UPDB), a compelling history of genetic discovery in oncology, and a strategic plan to accelerate translational advances from this platform. We have forged an alliance with Intermountain Healthcare, a nationally acclaimed Utah health network, linking data for more than 80-85 percent of the cancer patients in our State to the UPDB, enabling the entire population of Utah to comprise a cancer research laboratory for genetic, population, and outcomes research. Utah is home to seven Native American tribes or nations as well as extensive rural and frontier populations that have poor cancer outcomes. We aim to serve as a national research resource for addressing the needs of these underserved populations to improve cancer prevention and care.       HCI research is organized into five Programs that provide an environment of cancer focus, transdisciplinary exchange, and collaboration:  Nuclear Control of Cell Growth and Differentiation; Cell Response and Regulation; Imaging, Diagnostics, and Therapeutics; Gastrointestinal Cancers; and Cancer Control and Population Sciences. These Programs integrate the activities of 133 members who have $45 million in extramural grant support, with more than $17 million in NCI direct costs. Cancer-focused research during the current award period is documented in 1,374 unique publications, of which 26 percent are collaborative with one or more Cancer Center members. Thirteen Cancer Center Shared Resources support our scientists, providing access to specialized instrumentation, assays, services, research materials, and expert consultation and collaboration.       We request funds to support Years 21-25 of our Cancer Center Support Grant (CCSG). A new Executive Director, Mary Beckerle, Ph.D., was appointed in August 2006. Under her leadership, HCI has developed a plan to guide the next five years, including expansion of HCI's cancer specialty hospital, expansion of HCI's genetic platform for pre-clinical studies, development of a Center for Investigational Therapeutics (including a Phase I program), and expansion of population science (including epidemiological and behavioral research) to impact care of cancer survivors and reduce health disparities.          ",Cancer Center Support Grant,8465101,P30CA042014,"['Award ', ' Behavioral Research ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Biological Assay ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cell Differentiation ', ' Cell Differentiation process ', ' Cellular Growth ', ' Cellular Expansion ', ' cell growth ', ' Cells ', ' Consultations ', ' Diagnostic Imaging ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Environment ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' Foundations ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' services research ', ' Medical Care Research ', ' Healthcare Research ', ' Health Services Evaluation ', ' Health Care Research ', ' Health Services Research ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' Hospitals ', ' Institutes ', ' instrumentation ', ' Leadership ', ' Patients ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Publications ', ' Research ', ' Research Institute ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Specialty ', ' medical specialties ', ' Tribes ', ' Utah ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Outcomes Research ', ' Risk Assessment ', ' Caring ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Link ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Rural ', ' Genetic Research ', ' Funding ', ' Oncology Cancer ', ' oncology ', ' cancer prevention ', ' Collaborations ', ' Native Americans ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Genetic ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' Home ', ' Home environment ', ' Nuclear ', ' cancer risk ', ' early detection ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' member ', ' Malignant Gastrointestinal Neoplasm ', ' Gastrointestinal Tract Cancer ', ' Gastrointestinal Cancer ', ' Malignant neoplasm of gastrointestinal tract ', ' Prevention ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Regulation ', ' response ', ' Genomics ', ' cancer care ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Direct Costs ', ' PhD ', ' Ph.D. ', ' Doctor of Philosophy ', ' Population Database ', ' Population Sciences ', ' Resource Sharing ', ' Strategic Planning ', ' Cancer Center ', ' Core Grant ', ' CCSG ', ' Cancer Center Support Grant ', ' Cancer Control Science ', ' Cancer Control ', ' Cancer Patient ', ' Cancer Survivor ', ' Extramural ', ' EXTMR ', ' Extramural Activities ', ' Genetic Population Study ', ' population genetics laboratory ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' preclinical trial ', ' pre-clinical trial ', ' pre-clinical study ', ' preclinical study ', ' forging ', ' cancer research ', ' anticancer research ', ' underserved people ', ' under served population ', ' Underserved Population ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' frontier ', ' screening ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,P30,2013,1433304,0.11268127022335685

The Center was established in 2002 and received NCI designation in July of 2007 and has since made significant progress strengthening its scientific research programs, taking into consideration the prior review and recommendations from our EAB. 37 new cancer faculty have been recruited to the DLDCC which now has 350 formal members, and our cancer-relevant peer reviewed research funding now exceeds $122 million (22% increase), with more than $36 million coming from the NCI. Several high-impact research accomplishments have been made by members, several with the potential to reduce cancer mortality. The DLDCC comprises 7 research programs: Cancer Biology, Viral and Molecular Oncogenesis, Nuclear Receptors, Breast Cancer, Cancer Cell and Gene Therapy, Cancer Prevention and Population Science, and Pediatric Cancer. Investments exceeding $10 million have strengthened the scientific resources, which offer leading technologies and expertise to members. CTSU has been significantly enhanced and accruals to clinical trials have increased over 40%. Accrual of racial and ethnic minorities continues to be outstanding. The Office of Outreach and Health Disparities, using tools developed from NCI funding, disseminates new information to the community, especially the underserved. In this renewal, we ask for increased funding for our 10 Shared Resources, 3 developing resources, and other activities important to our mission and goals, as well as consideration for comprehensive designation according to NCI guidelines. RELEVANCE: The investments made by the NCI, combined with the support of the Houston community and the hard work of exceptional scientists, clinicians and staff of the Dan L.

"University of New Mexico Cancer Center Support Serving a vast geographic region of great beauty, with rich multicultural and multiethnic diversity, tremendous scientific opportunity, and challenging health and socioeconomic disparities, the University of New Mexico Cancer Center and its consortium institutions - Lovelace Respiratory Research Institute, Los Alamos National Laboratory, and Sandia National Laboratories - are uniquely poised to make significant advances in cancer research and to serve our communities and our nation. As the only NCI Cancer Center within a 500 mile radius, the special characteristics of the UNM Cancer Center include: the multiethnic and multicultural populations that it serves - primarily Hispanic/Latino, American Indian, and non-Hispanic White - with their strikingly different patterns of cancer incidence, mortality, and disparity; the integration of regional scientific strengths in engineering, biotechnology, nanotechnology, radioisotopes, drug discovery, imaging, and high performance computing into its Research Programs and Shared Resources; and the extensive statewide outreach networks it has built for the delivery of cancer care, for culturally appropriate community-based education and participatory research, and for the participation of community oncologists in UNM Cancer Center clinical trials. Since the previous NCI P30 CCSG review in 2005, the Center's annual peer-reviewed research funding has increased 40% to over $46.8 million dollars in total costs, while annual funding from NCI increased 30% to over $13.8 million dollars. Intra-programmatic and inter-programmatic collaborations among the 117 members of the Center have  increased markedly and range from 20-48% in each of the 4 Research Programs: Cancer Population Sciences,  Cancer Biology and Biotechnology, Hematologic Malignancies, and Women's Cancers. Cancer Center members  lead one of 9 NIH-funded Roadmap Centers for High Throughput Target Screening and Molecular Discovery  {U54MH084690), one of 10 NIH-funded National Centers for Systems Biology (P50GM085273), one of 4 NSF/NCI  Centers for Integrative Nanoscience and Microsystems Training (DGE0504276), one of 20 LLS Specialized Centers of Leukemia Research (LLS SCOR 7388-06), and an Interdisciplinary HPV Prevention Center (NIH U19AI084081). To assure that all New Mexicans have access to outstanding cancer diagnosis and treatment, the UNM Cancer Center opened its new 206,432 sq. ft., $90 million, Cancer Treatment and Clinical Research Facility in August 2009 which serves as the hub of the UNM Statewide Cancer Care Network. In collaboration with Siemens, this new facility contains a radioisotope production laboratory and experimental radiopharmacy, which will accelerate the Center's research programs. From 7/1/08-7/1/09, while maintaining its mission to the underserved and uninsured, the UNM Cancer Center ccrued 443 (17%) of the 2640 newly diagnosed patients treated at the Center to therapeutic clinical trials; 51% of these patients were Hispanic or American Indian. Community affiliates accrued another 101 patients to UNM therapeutic trials. In addition, the Center had 845 accruals to non-intervention protocols in this time period. The overall goals of the UNM Cancer Center are to: 1) conduct outstanding transdisciplinary research in our laboratories, clinics and multiethnic and multicultural communities that builds upon our unique scientific and regional strengths; 2) reduce the burden of cancer incidence and mortality by discovering the genetic, environmental, social, and behavioral factors that contribute to the distinct cancer patterns and cancer disparities in the peoples of the American Southwest; 3) translate our scientific discoveries to novel diagnostic, screening, prevention, and therapeutic tools and clinical trials; and 4) provide access to outstanding cancer treatment and clinical trials for all New Mexicans. RELEVANCE:  The University of New Mexico Cancer Center serves a vast geographic region in the American Southwest with striking ethnic and cultural diversity and significant cancer health disparities.

"Cancer Center Support Grant DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The genetic understanding of cancer has led to enhanced individual risk assessment, improved screening guidelines, and improved outcomes based on cancer prevention, early detection, and, in some cases, targeted therapy. Huntsman Cancer Institute (HCI) is positioned to make exceptional contributions in this individualized oncology arena. HCI has a unique research resource to support genetic and population studies, the Utah Population Database (UPDB), a compelling history of genetic discovery in oncology, and a strategic plan to accelerate translational advances from this platform. We have forged an alliance with Intermountain Healthcare, a nationally acclaimed Utah health network, linking data for more than 80-85 percent of the cancer patients in our State to the UPDB, enabling the entire population of Utah to comprise a cancer research laboratory for genetic, population, and outcomes research. Utah is home to seven Native American tribes or nations as well as extensive rural and frontier populations that have poor cancer outcomes. We aim to serve as a national research resource for addressing the needs of these underserved populations to improve cancer prevention and care.       HCI research is organized into five Programs that provide an environment of cancer focus, transdisciplinary exchange, and collaboration:  Nuclear Control of Cell Growth and Differentiation; Cell Response and Regulation; Imaging, Diagnostics, and Therapeutics; Gastrointestinal Cancers; and Cancer Control and Population Sciences. These Programs integrate the activities of 133 members who have $45 million in extramural grant support, with more than $17 million in NCI direct costs. Cancer-focused research during the current award period is documented in 1,374 unique publications, of which 26 percent are collaborative with one or more Cancer Center members. Thirteen Cancer Center Shared Resources support our scientists, providing access to specialized instrumentation, assays, services, research materials, and expert consultation and collaboration.       We request funds to support Years 21-25 of our Cancer Center Support Grant (CCSG). A new Executive Director, Mary Beckerle, Ph.D., was appointed in August 2006. Under her leadership, HCI has developed a plan to guide the next five years, including expansion of HCI's cancer specialty hospital, expansion of HCI's genetic platform for pre-clinical studies, development of a Center for Investigational Therapeutics (including a Phase I program), and expansion of population science (including epidemiological and behavioral research) to impact care of cancer survivors and reduce health disparities.

"Cancer Center Support Grant DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The genetic understanding of cancer has led to enhanced individual risk assessment, improved screening guidelines, and improved outcomes based on cancer prevention, early detection, and, in some cases, targeted therapy. Huntsman Cancer Institute (HCI) is positioned to make exceptional contributions in this individualized oncology arena. HCI has a unique research resource to support genetic and population studies, the Utah Population Database (UPDB), a compelling history of genetic discovery in oncology, and a strategic plan to accelerate translational advances from this platform. We have forged an alliance with Intermountain Healthcare, a nationally acclaimed Utah health network, linking data for more than 80-85 percent of the cancer patients in our State to the UPDB, enabling the entire population of Utah to comprise a cancer research laboratory for genetic, population, and outcomes research. Utah is home to seven Native American tribes or nations as well as extensive rural and frontier populations that have poor cancer outcomes. We aim to serve as a national research resource for addressing the needs of these underserved populations to improve cancer prevention and care.       HCI research is organized into five Programs that provide an environment of cancer focus, transdisciplinary exchange, and collaboration:  Nuclear Control of Cell Growth and Differentiation; Cell Response and Regulation; Imaging, Diagnostics, and Therapeutics; Gastrointestinal Cancers; and Cancer Control and Population Sciences. These Programs integrate the activities of 133 members who have $45 million in extramural grant support, with more than $17 million in NCI direct costs. Cancer-focused research during the current award period is documented in 1,374 unique publications, of which 26 percent are collaborative with one or more Cancer Center members. Thirteen Cancer Center Shared Resources support our scientists, providing access to specialized instrumentation, assays, services, research materials, and expert consultation and collaboration.       We request funds to support Years 21-25 of our Cancer Center Support Grant (CCSG). A new Executive Director, Mary Beckerle, Ph.D., was appointed in August 2006. Under her leadership, HCI has developed a plan to guide the next five years, including expansion of HCI's cancer specialty hospital, expansion of HCI's genetic platform for pre-clinical studies, development of a Center for Investigational Therapeutics (including a Phase I program), and expansion of population science (including epidemiological and behavioral research) to impact care of cancer survivors and reduce health disparities.

A tradition of interaction among disciplines, fostered by a proactive matrix cancer center at a highly-regarded public university provides an outstanding venue for integrating forward-looking interdisciplinary cancer research. Cancer center members hold 34 multi-investigator program grants and 26 training grants. Faculty additions in the physical and pharmaceutical sciences created new opportunities in drug discovery and delivery. Substantial investment in faculty, equipment and bioinformatics dramatically expanded our cancer genetics research effort; UNC was again selected as a site of The Cancer Genome Atlas. Thirty-eight clinical researchers were recruited, strengthening our multidisciplinary cancer care and research teams. Our publication rate in top clinical oncology journals increased by four-fold. Accruals to therapeutic trials, including investigator-initiated trials, more than doubled to 850 and 434 respectively. Our population scientists initiated new endeavors in cancer communication, dissemination, survivorship, and molecular epidemiology. Groundbreaking observations in breast cancer minority disparity research have emerged from the Center's epidemiology and clinical programs. The formation of transdisciplinary teams stimulates progress toward implementing the Center's and NCI's strategic objectives.  Major events include opening the North Carolina Cancer Hospital, a new clinical structure that nearly triples patient care space, and new basic science buildings. The Center's significant and continued expansion, including 20 faculty recruitments now in progress, is driven by remarkable institutional support including direct support for cancer research from the state legislature.  The UNC Lineberger requests funding for nine scientific programs, 20 shared resources, two staff investigators, and for leadership, planning and evaluation, administration, and developmental research. The increased CCSG budget will support technological and operational expansion of cores and faculty recruitment in the basic, translational, clinical, and population sciences.

"Cancer Center Support Grant DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The genetic understanding of cancer has led to enhanced individual risk assessment, improved screening guidelines, and improved outcomes based on cancer prevention, early detection, and, in some cases, targeted therapy. Huntsman Cancer Institute (HCI) is positioned to make exceptional contributions in this individualized oncology arena. HCI has a unique research resource to support genetic and population studies, the Utah Population Database (UPDB), a compelling history of genetic discovery in oncology, and a strategic plan to accelerate translational advances from this platform. We have forged an alliance with Intermountain Healthcare, a nationally acclaimed Utah health network, linking data for more than 80-85 percent of the cancer patients in our State to the UPDB, enabling the entire population of Utah to comprise a cancer research laboratory for genetic, population, and outcomes research. Utah is home to seven Native American tribes or nations as well as extensive rural and frontier populations that have poor cancer outcomes. We aim to serve as a national research resource for addressing the needs of these underserved populations to improve cancer prevention and care.       HCI research is organized into five Programs that provide an environment of cancer focus, transdisciplinary exchange, and collaboration:  Nuclear Control of Cell Growth and Differentiation; Cell Response and Regulation; Imaging, Diagnostics, and Therapeutics; Gastrointestinal Cancers; and Cancer Control and Population Sciences. These Programs integrate the activities of 133 members who have $45 million in extramural grant support, with more than $17 million in NCI direct costs. Cancer-focused research during the current award period is documented in 1,374 unique publications, of which 26 percent are collaborative with one or more Cancer Center members. Thirteen Cancer Center Shared Resources support our scientists, providing access to specialized instrumentation, assays, services, research materials, and expert consultation and collaboration.

"University of New Mexico Cancer Center Support Grant ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Cancer Control (CaC) Research Program is a newly restructured transdisciplinary program that serves as the hub for cancer control and population science research within the University of New Mexico Cancer Center (UNMCC) and the State of New Mexico (NM), our catchment area. The Program's overall goal is to reduce cancer incidence, morbidity, and mortality, particularly in the unique multiethnic and underserved populations of NM. Disparities research is a cross-cutting theme that fosters scientific focus and synergy across the research areas. Through vigorous strategic program planning and evaluation, recruitment of 9 new investigators to enhance expertise in molecular epidemiology and behavioral/community intervention, and guidance of the UNMCC External Advisory Committee, the CaC Program is now focused on three areas of cancer research: 1) Risk Prediction and Risk Reduction; 2) Screening; and 3) Post-Diagnosis Outcomes and Survivorship. Unique scientific strengths include research addressing disparities (geographic, race/ethnic, socioeconomic, medically underserved), particularly in etiologic, outcome, and intervention studies in Hispanics. By drawing on established and new partnerships, the Program is also building research that addresses American Indian cancer disparities and priorities identified by NM Tribes, Pueblos, and Indian Nations. Major scientific accomplishments in Risk Prediction and Risk Reduction include the identification of social, lifestyle, and genetic factors associated with lung cancer risk; gene-environment interactions in melanoma risk; and development and dissemination of a novel telehealth strategy for the prevention of hepatocellular cancer. In Screening, members have developed a statewide surveillance program of screening and diagnosis for cervical pre-cancer and cancer that informs real- world cervical cancer prevention through human papilloma virus (HPV) vaccination, screening practice and outcomes. Members have also identified barriers to use of early detection tests in colorectal cancer and have developed strategies to overcome these barriers to improve screening in underserved populations. In Post- Diagnosis Outcomes and Survivorship, members have identified factors that contribute to disparities in post- treatment outcomes and survivorship in endometrial and breast cancer and are developing interventions. Led by Linda Cook, Ph.D. and Anita Kinney, Ph.D., RN, the CaC Program is comprised of 28 members (19 full and 9 associate) from 7 UNM schools and departments, the Lovelace Respiratory Institute, and the Indian Health Service Unit of the Centers for Disease Control whose work is supported by $19,276,863 million in annual direct cost funding, of which $15,429,911 million is peer-reviewed and $3,137,820 million is from NCI as of 9/1/2014.

"University of New Mexico Cancer Center Support Grant ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Cancer Control (CaC) Research Program is a newly restructured transdisciplinary program that serves as the hub for cancer control and population science research within the University of New Mexico Cancer Center (UNMCC) and the State of New Mexico (NM), our catchment area. The Program's overall goal is to reduce cancer incidence, morbidity, and mortality, particularly in the unique multiethnic and underserved populations of NM. Disparities research is a cross-cutting theme that fosters scientific focus and synergy across the research areas. Through vigorous strategic program planning and evaluation, recruitment of 9 new investigators to enhance expertise in molecular epidemiology and behavioral/community intervention, and guidance of the UNMCC External Advisory Committee, the CaC Program is now focused on three areas of cancer research: 1) Risk Prediction and Risk Reduction; 2) Screening; and 3) Post-Diagnosis Outcomes and Survivorship. Unique scientific strengths include research addressing disparities (geographic, race/ethnic, socioeconomic, medically underserved), particularly in etiologic, outcome, and intervention studies in Hispanics. By drawing on established and new partnerships, the Program is also building research that addresses American Indian cancer disparities and priorities identified by NM Tribes, Pueblos, and Indian Nations. Major scientific accomplishments in Risk Prediction and Risk Reduction include the identification of social, lifestyle, and genetic factors associated with lung cancer risk; gene-environment interactions in melanoma risk; and development and dissemination of a novel telehealth strategy for the prevention of hepatocellular cancer. In Screening, members have developed a statewide surveillance program of screening and diagnosis for cervical pre-cancer and cancer that informs real- world cervical cancer prevention through human papilloma virus (HPV) vaccination, screening practice and outcomes. Members have also identified barriers to use of early detection tests in colorectal cancer and have developed strategies to overcome these barriers to improve screening in underserved populations. In Post- Diagnosis Outcomes and Survivorship, members have identified factors that contribute to disparities in post- treatment outcomes and survivorship in endometrial and breast cancer and are developing interventions. Led by Linda Cook, Ph.D. and Anita Kinney, Ph.D., RN, the CaC Program is comprised of 28 members (19 full and 9 associate) from 7 UNM schools and departments, the Lovelace Respiratory Institute, and the Indian Health Service Unit of the Centers for Disease Control whose work is supported by $19,276,863 million in annual direct cost funding, of which $15,429,911 million is peer-reviewed and $3,137,820 million is from NCI as of 9/1/2014. The discoveries made in this Program have resulted 294 publications, of which 19% are intra-programmatic collaborations and 16% are inter-programmatic collaborations; with a total UNMCC and external collaborative publication level of 30% and 80%, respectively.             OVERALL COMPONENT: THE UNIVERSITY OF NEW MEXICO CANCER CENTER PROJECT NARRATIVE Designated as one of the nation's National Cancer Institute Cancer Centers since 2005, the University of New Mexico Cancer Center is a cancer treatment, research, and education and training center that applies the scientific expertise of its investigators to those cancers that have high incidence, mortality, or disparity in the multiethnic and underserved populations of New Mexico. The Center is a hub for promoting discovery through its research, education and training, clinical care, statewide outreach programs and networks for community participatory research. The Center connects scientists, healthcare professionals, and communities to translate its discoveries to cancer clinical trials, and cancer control and behavioral interventions that reduce the cancer burden of New Mexico and serve as a national model. The goal of the Center is to assure that all of the people in New Mexico, its catchment area, have access to high quality cancer care and collaborate in and benefit from advances in cancer

"University of New Mexico Cancer Center Support Grant ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Cancer Control (CaC) Research Program is a newly restructured transdisciplinary program that serves as the hub for cancer control and population science research within the University of New Mexico Cancer Center (UNMCC) and the State of New Mexico (NM), our catchment area. The Program's overall goal is to reduce cancer incidence, morbidity, and mortality, particularly in the unique multiethnic and underserved populations of NM. Disparities research is a cross-cutting theme that fosters scientific focus and synergy across the research areas. Through vigorous strategic program planning and evaluation, recruitment of 9 new investigators to enhance expertise in molecular epidemiology and behavioral/community intervention, and guidance of the UNMCC External Advisory Committee, the CaC Program is now focused on three areas of cancer research: 1) Risk Prediction and Risk Reduction; 2) Screening; and 3) Post-Diagnosis Outcomes and Survivorship. Unique scientific strengths include research addressing disparities (geographic, race/ethnic, socioeconomic, medically underserved), particularly in etiologic, outcome, and intervention studies in Hispanics. By drawing on established and new partnerships, the Program is also building research that addresses American Indian cancer disparities and priorities identified by NM Tribes, Pueblos, and Indian Nations. Major scientific accomplishments in Risk Prediction and Risk Reduction include the identification of social, lifestyle, and genetic factors associated with lung cancer risk; gene-environment interactions in melanoma risk; and development and dissemination of a novel telehealth strategy for the prevention of hepatocellular cancer. In Screening, members have developed a statewide surveillance program of screening and diagnosis for cervical pre-cancer and cancer that informs real- world cervical cancer prevention through human papilloma virus (HPV) vaccination, screening practice and outcomes. Members have also identified barriers to use of early detection tests in colorectal cancer and have developed strategies to overcome these barriers to improve screening in underserved populations. In Post- Diagnosis Outcomes and Survivorship, members have identified factors that contribute to disparities in post- treatment outcomes and survivorship in endometrial and breast cancer and are developing interventions. Led by Linda Cook, Ph.D. and Anita Kinney, Ph.D., RN, the CaC Program is comprised of 28 members (19 full and 9 associate) from 7 UNM schools and departments, the Lovelace Respiratory Institute, and the Indian Health Service Unit of the Centers for Disease Control whose work is supported by $19,276,863 million in annual direct cost funding, of which $15,429,911 million is peer-reviewed and $3,137,820 million is from NCI as of 9/1/2014. The discoveries made in this Program have resulted 294 publications, of which 19% are intra-programmatic collaborations and 16% are inter-programmatic collaborations; with a total UNMCC and external collaborative publication level of 30% and 80%, respectively. OVERALL COMPONENT: THE UNIVERSITY OF NEW MEXICO CANCER CENTER PROJECT NARRATIVE Designated as one of the nation's National Cancer Institute Cancer Centers since 2005, the University of New Mexico Cancer Center is a cancer treatment, research, and education and training center that applies the scientific expertise of its investigators to those cancers that have high incidence, mortality, or disparity in the multiethnic and underserved populations of New Mexico. The Center is a hub for promoting discovery through its research, education and training, clinical care, statewide outreach programs and networks for community participatory research. The Center connects scientists, healthcare professionals, and communities to translate its discoveries to cancer clinical trials, and cancer control and behavioral interventions that reduce the cancer burden of New Mexico and serve as a national model. The goal of the Center is to assure that all of the people in New Mexico, its catchment area, have access to high quality cancer care and collaborate in and benefit from advances in cancer

"University of New Mexico Cancer Center Support Grant ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Cancer Control (CaC) Research Program is a newly restructured transdisciplinary program that serves as the hub for cancer control and population science research within the University of New Mexico Cancer Center (UNMCC) and the State of New Mexico (NM), our catchment area. The Program's overall goal is to reduce cancer incidence, morbidity, and mortality, particularly in the unique multiethnic and underserved populations of NM. Disparities research is a cross-cutting theme that fosters scientific focus and synergy across the research areas. Through vigorous strategic program planning and evaluation, recruitment of 9 new investigators to enhance expertise in molecular epidemiology and behavioral/community intervention, and guidance of the UNMCC External Advisory Committee, the CaC Program is now focused on three areas of cancer research: 1) Risk Prediction and Risk Reduction; 2) Screening; and 3) Post-Diagnosis Outcomes and Survivorship. Unique scientific strengths include research addressing disparities (geographic, race/ethnic, socioeconomic, medically underserved), particularly in etiologic, outcome, and intervention studies in Hispanics. By drawing on established and new partnerships, the Program is also building research that addresses American Indian cancer disparities and priorities identified by NM Tribes, Pueblos, and Indian Nations. Major scientific accomplishments in Risk Prediction and Risk Reduction include the identification of social, lifestyle, and genetic factors associated with lung cancer risk; gene-environment interactions in melanoma risk; and development and dissemination of a novel telehealth strategy for the prevention of hepatocellular cancer. In Screening, members have developed a statewide surveillance program of screening and diagnosis for cervical pre-cancer and cancer that informs real- world cervical cancer prevention through human papilloma virus (HPV) vaccination, screening practice and outcomes. Members have also identified barriers to use of early detection tests in colorectal cancer and have developed strategies to overcome these barriers to improve screening in underserved populations. In Post- Diagnosis Outcomes and Survivorship, members have identified factors that contribute to disparities in post- treatment outcomes and survivorship in endometrial and breast cancer and are developing interventions. Led by Linda Cook, Ph.D. and Anita Kinney, Ph.D., RN, the CaC Program is comprised of 28 members (19 full and 9 associate) from 7 UNM schools and departments, the Lovelace Respiratory Institute, and the Indian Health Service Unit of the Centers for Disease Control whose work is supported by $19,276,863 million in annual direct cost funding, of which $15,429,911 million is peer-reviewed and $3,137,820 million is from NCI as of 9/1/2014. The discoveries made in this Program have resulted 294 publications, of which 19% are intra-programmatic collaborations and 16% are inter-programmatic collaborations; with a total UNMCC and external collaborative publication level of 30% and 80%, respectively. OVERALL COMPONENT: THE UNIVERSITY OF NEW MEXICO CANCER CENTER PROJECT NARRATIVE Designated as one of the nation's National Cancer Institute Cancer Centers since 2005, the University of New Mexico Cancer Center is a cancer treatment, research, and education and training center that applies the scientific expertise of its investigators to those cancers that have high incidence, mortality, or disparity in the multiethnic and underserved populations of New Mexico. The Center is a hub for promoting discovery through its research, education and training, clinical care, statewide outreach programs and networks for community participatory research. The Center connects scientists, healthcare professionals, and communities to translate its discoveries to cancer clinical trials, and cancer control and behavioral interventions that reduce the cancer burden of New Mexico and serve as a national model. The goal of the Center is to assure that all of the people in New Mexico, its catchment area, have access to high quality cancer care and collaborate in and benefit from advances in cancer

"University of New Mexico Cancer Center Support Grant ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Cancer Control (CaC) Research Program is a newly restructured transdisciplinary program that serves as the hub for cancer control and population science research within the University of New Mexico Cancer Center (UNMCC) and the State of New Mexico (NM), our catchment area. The Program's overall goal is to reduce cancer incidence, morbidity, and mortality, particularly in the unique multiethnic and underserved populations of NM. Disparities research is a cross-cutting theme that fosters scientific focus and synergy across the research areas. Through vigorous strategic program planning and evaluation, recruitment of 9 new investigators to enhance expertise in molecular epidemiology and behavioral/community intervention, and guidance of the UNMCC External Advisory Committee, the CaC Program is now focused on three areas of cancer research: 1) Risk Prediction and Risk Reduction; 2) Screening; and 3) Post-Diagnosis Outcomes and Survivorship. Unique scientific strengths include research addressing disparities (geographic, race/ethnic, socioeconomic, medically underserved), particularly in etiologic, outcome, and intervention studies in Hispanics. By drawing on established and new partnerships, the Program is also building research that addresses American Indian cancer disparities and priorities identified by NM Tribes, Pueblos, and Indian Nations. Major scientific accomplishments in Risk Prediction and Risk Reduction include the identification of social, lifestyle, and genetic factors associated with lung cancer risk; gene-environment interactions in melanoma risk; and development and dissemination of a novel telehealth strategy for the prevention of hepatocellular cancer. In Screening, members have developed a statewide surveillance program of screening and diagnosis for cervical pre-cancer and cancer that informs real- world cervical cancer prevention through human papilloma virus (HPV) vaccination, screening practice and outcomes. Members have also identified barriers to use of early detection tests in colorectal cancer and have developed strategies to overcome these barriers to improve screening in underserved populations. In Post- Diagnosis Outcomes and Survivorship, members have identified factors that contribute to disparities in post- treatment outcomes and survivorship in endometrial and breast cancer and are developing interventions. Led by Linda Cook, Ph.D. and Anita Kinney, Ph.D., RN, the CaC Program is comprised of 28 members (19 full and 9 associate) from 7 UNM schools and departments, the Lovelace Respiratory Institute, and the Indian Health Service Unit of the Centers for Disease Control whose work is supported by $19,276,863 million in annual direct cost funding, of which $15,429,911 million is peer-reviewed and $3,137,820 million is from NCI as of 9/1/2014. The discoveries made in this Program have resulted 294 publications, of which 19% are intra-programmatic collaborations and 16% are inter-programmatic collaborations; with a total UNMCC and external collaborative publication level of 30% and 80%, respectively. OVERALL COMPONENT: THE UNIVERSITY OF NEW MEXICO CANCER CENTER PROJECT NARRATIVE Designated as one of the nation's National Cancer Institute Cancer Centers since 2005, the University of New Mexico Cancer Center is a cancer treatment, research, and education and training center that applies the scientific expertise of its investigators to those cancers that have high incidence, mortality, or disparity in the multiethnic and underserved populations of New Mexico. The Center is a hub for promoting discovery through its research, education and training, clinical care, statewide outreach programs and networks for community participatory research. The Center connects scientists, healthcare professionals, and communities to translate its discoveries to cancer clinical trials, and cancer control and behavioral interventions that reduce the cancer burden of New Mexico and serve as a national model. The goal of the Center is to assure that all of the people in New Mexico, its catchment area, have access to high quality cancer care and collaborate in and benefit from advances in cancer research.",University of New Mexico Cancer Center Support Grant,9128983,P30CA118100,"['cancer genetics ', ' social ', ' intervention therapy ', ' Therapeutic Intervention ', ' Bone Marrow Stem Cell Transplantation ', ' Modeling ', ' outreach program ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Genomics ', ' anticancer therapy ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Treatment ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Therapy ', ' Cancer Treatment ', ' cancer therapy ', ' cancer care ', ' Risk Reduction ', ' Provider ', ' Institution ', ' telehealth ', ' Address ', ' Health system ', ' Direct Costs ', ' PhD ', ' Ph.D. ', ' Doctor of Philosophy ', ' Improve Access ', ' NCI Organization ', ' National Cancer Institute ', ' Population Sciences ', ' Research Training ', ' Resource Sharing ', ' Surveillance Program ', ' Therapeutic Clinical Trial ', ' Cancer Biology ', ' National Cancer Burden ', ' Cancer Burden ', ' Cancer Center ', ' CCSG ', ' Cancer Center Support Grant ', ' Cancer Control Science ', ' Cancer Control ', ' Cancer Control Research ', ' Cancer Control Research Program ', ' Cancer Research Programs ', ' Cancer Research Project ', ' Cancer Survivorship ', ' Catchment Area ', ' Clinical Sciences ', ' Comprehensive Cancer Center ', ' Epigenetic Mechanism ', ' Epigenetic Change ', ' Epigenetic ', ' Epigenetic Process ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' Oncology Group ', ' scientific advances ', ' scientific accomplishments ', ' Scientific Advances and Accomplishments ', ' underserved minority ', ' under-represented minority ', ' Underrepresented Populations ', ' Underrepresented Groups ', ' Underrepresented Minority ', ' Characteristics ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomic ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio economic ', ' socioeconomics ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Colorectal Cancer ', ' Behavioral ', ' Healthcare professional ', ' Health Care Professional ', ' Health Professional ', ' working group ', ' community intervention ', ' cancer research ', ' anticancer research ', ' underserved people ', ' under served population ', ' Underserved Population ', ' Clinical Trials Network ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' site targeted delivery ', ' targeted delivery ', ' Population ', ' cancer disparity ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' medically underserved ', ' tumor ', ' neurooncology ', ' neuro-oncology ', ' clinical care ', ' undergraduate student ', ' screening ', ' Human Papillomavirus Vaccination ', ' HPV Vaccination ', ' Human Papilloma Virus Vaccination ', ' Adolescent and Young Adult ', ' post treatment ', ' After-Treatment ', ' After Care ', ' Aftercare ', ' American Indian ', ' American Indians ', ' lifestyle modification ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' behavior intervention ', ' Life Style Modification ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' CDC ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' Clinical Informatics ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Research ', ' clinical investigation ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Communities ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Faculty ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' liver carcinoma ', ' Liver Cells Carcinoma ', ' Hepatoma ', ' Hepatocellular cancer ', ' Hepatocellular Carcinoma ', ' Primary carcinoma of the liver cells ', ' Incidence ', ' Institutes ', ' interventions research ', ' interventional study ', ' interventional research ', ' intervention research ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' Laboratories ', ' Lifestyle ', ' Life Style ', ' Malignant Melanoma ', ' melanoma ', ' Mentors ', ' Mission ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity -

A tradition of interaction among disciplines, fostered by a proactive matrix cancer center at a highly-regarded public university provides an outstanding venue for integrating forward-looking interdisciplinary cancer research. Cancer center members hold 34 multi-investigator program grants and 26 training grants. Faculty additions in the physical and pharmaceutical sciences created new opportunities in drug discovery and delivery. Substantial investment in faculty, equipment and bioinformatics dramatically expanded our cancer genetics research effort; UNC was again selected as a site of The Cancer Genome Atlas. Thirty-eight clinical researchers were recruited, strengthening our multidisciplinary cancer care and research teams. Our publication rate in top clinical oncology journals increased by four-fold. Accruals to therapeutic trials, including investigator-initiated trials, more than doubled to 850 and 434 respectively. Our population scientists initiated new endeavors in cancer communication, dissemination, survivorship, and molecular epidemiology. Groundbreaking observations in breast cancer minority disparity research have emerged from the Center's epidemiology and clinical programs. The formation of transdisciplinary teams stimulates progress toward implementing the Center's and NCI's strategic objectives.  Major events include opening the North Carolina Cancer Hospital, a new clinical structure that nearly triples patient care space, and new basic science buildings.

"University of New Mexico Cancer Center Support Grant ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Cancer Control (CaC) Research Program is a newly restructured transdisciplinary program that serves as the hub for cancer control and population science research within the University of New Mexico Cancer Center (UNMCC) and the State of New Mexico (NM), our catchment area. The Program's overall goal is to reduce cancer incidence, morbidity, and mortality, particularly in the unique multiethnic and underserved populations of NM. Disparities research is a cross-cutting theme that fosters scientific focus and synergy across the research areas. Through vigorous strategic program planning and evaluation, recruitment of 9 new investigators to enhance expertise in molecular epidemiology and behavioral/community intervention, and guidance of the UNMCC External Advisory Committee, the CaC Program is now focused on three areas of cancer research: 1) Risk Prediction and Risk Reduction; 2) Screening; and 3) Post-Diagnosis Outcomes and Survivorship. Unique scientific strengths include research addressing disparities (geographic, race/ethnic, socioeconomic, medically underserved), particularly in etiologic, outcome, and intervention studies in Hispanics. By drawing on established and new partnerships, the Program is also building research that addresses American Indian cancer disparities and priorities identified by NM Tribes, Pueblos, and Indian Nations. Major scientific accomplishments in Risk Prediction and Risk Reduction include the identification of social, lifestyle, and genetic factors associated with lung cancer risk; gene-environment interactions in melanoma risk; and development and dissemination of a novel telehealth strategy for the prevention of hepatocellular cancer. In Screening, members have developed a statewide surveillance program of screening and diagnosis for cervical pre-cancer and cancer that informs real- world cervical cancer prevention through human papilloma virus (HPV) vaccination, screening practice and outcomes. Members have also identified barriers to use of early detection tests in colorectal cancer and have developed strategies to overcome these barriers to improve screening in underserved populations. In Post- Diagnosis Outcomes and Survivorship, members have identified factors that contribute to disparities in post- treatment outcomes and survivorship in endometrial and breast cancer and are developing interventions. Led by Linda Cook, Ph.D. and Anita Kinney, Ph.D., RN, the CaC Program is comprised of 28 members (19 full and 9 associate) from 7 UNM schools and departments, the Lovelace Respiratory Institute, and the Indian Health Service Unit of the Centers for Disease Control whose work is supported by $19,276,863 million in annual direct cost funding, of which $15,429,911 million is peer-reviewed and $3,137,820 million is from NCI as of 9/1/2014. The discoveries made in this Program have resulted 294 publications, of which 19% are intra-programmatic collaborations and 16% are inter-programmatic collaborations; with a total UNMCC and external collaborative publication level of 30% and 80%, respectively.             OVERALL COMPONENT: THE UNIVERSITY OF NEW MEXICO CANCER CENTER PROJECT NARRATIVE Designated as one of the nation's National Cancer Institute Cancer Centers since 2005, the University of New Mexico Cancer Center is a cancer treatment, research, and education and training center that applies the scientific expertise of its investigators to those cancers that have high incidence, mortality, or disparity in the multiethnic and underserved populations of New Mexico. The Center is a hub for promoting discovery through its research, education and training, clinical care, statewide outreach programs and networks for community participatory research. The Center connects scientists, healthcare professionals, and communities to translate its discoveries to cancer clinical trials, and cancer control and behavioral interventions that reduce the cancer burden of New Mexico and serve as a national model. The goal of the Center is to assure that all of the people in New Mexico, its catchment area, have access to high quality cancer care and collaborate in and benefit from advances in cancer

"University of New Mexico Cancer Center Support Grant ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Cancer Control (CaC) Research Program is a newly restructured transdisciplinary program that serves as the hub for cancer control and population science research within the University of New Mexico Cancer Center (UNMCC) and the State of New Mexico (NM), our catchment area. The Program's overall goal is to reduce cancer incidence, morbidity, and mortality, particularly in the unique multiethnic and underserved populations of NM. Disparities research is a cross-cutting theme that fosters scientific focus and synergy across the research areas. Through vigorous strategic program planning and evaluation, recruitment of 9 new investigators to enhance expertise in molecular epidemiology and behavioral/community intervention, and guidance of the UNMCC External Advisory Committee, the CaC Program is now focused on three areas of cancer research: 1) Risk Prediction and Risk Reduction; 2) Screening; and 3) Post-Diagnosis Outcomes and Survivorship. Unique scientific strengths include research addressing disparities (geographic, race/ethnic, socioeconomic, medically underserved), particularly in etiologic, outcome, and intervention studies in Hispanics. By drawing on established and new partnerships, the Program is also building research that addresses American Indian cancer disparities and priorities identified by NM Tribes, Pueblos, and Indian Nations. Major scientific accomplishments in Risk Prediction and Risk Reduction include the identification of social, lifestyle, and genetic factors associated with lung cancer risk; gene-environment interactions in melanoma risk; and development and dissemination of a novel telehealth strategy for the prevention of hepatocellular cancer. In Screening, members have developed a statewide surveillance program of screening and diagnosis for cervical pre-cancer and cancer that informs real- world cervical cancer prevention through human papilloma virus (HPV) vaccination, screening practice and outcomes. Members have also identified barriers to use of early detection tests in colorectal cancer and have developed strategies to overcome these barriers to improve screening in underserved populations. In Post- Diagnosis Outcomes and Survivorship, members have identified factors that contribute to disparities in post- treatment outcomes and survivorship in endometrial and breast cancer and are developing interventions. Led by Linda Cook, Ph.D. and Anita Kinney, Ph.D., RN, the CaC Program is comprised of 28 members (19 full and 9 associate) from 7 UNM schools and departments, the Lovelace Respiratory Institute, and the Indian Health Service Unit of the Centers for Disease Control whose work is supported by $19,276,863 million in annual direct cost funding, of which $15,429,911 million is peer-reviewed and $3,137,820 million is from NCI as of 9/1/2014. The discoveries made in this Program have resulted 294 publications, of which 19% are intra-programmatic collaborations and 16% are inter-programmatic collaborations; with a total UNMCC and external collaborative publication level of 30% and 80%, respectively.             OVERALL COMPONENT: THE UNIVERSITY OF NEW MEXICO CANCER CENTER PROJECT NARRATIVE Designated as one of the nation's National Cancer Institute Cancer Centers since 2005, the University of New Mexico Cancer Center is a cancer treatment, research, and education and training center that applies the scientific expertise of its investigators to those cancers that have high incidence, mortality, or disparity in the multiethnic and underserved populations of New Mexico.

"University of New Mexico Cancer Center Support Grant ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Cancer Control (CaC) Research Program is a newly restructured transdisciplinary program that serves as the hub for cancer control and population science research within the University of New Mexico Cancer Center (UNMCC) and the State of New Mexico (NM), our catchment area. The Program's overall goal is to reduce cancer incidence, morbidity, and mortality, particularly in the unique multiethnic and underserved populations of NM. Disparities research is a cross-cutting theme that fosters scientific focus and synergy across the research areas. Through vigorous strategic program planning and evaluation, recruitment of 9 new investigators to enhance expertise in molecular epidemiology and behavioral/community intervention, and guidance of the UNMCC External Advisory Committee, the CaC Program is now focused on three areas of cancer research: 1) Risk Prediction and Risk Reduction; 2) Screening; and 3) Post-Diagnosis Outcomes and Survivorship. Unique scientific strengths include research addressing disparities (geographic, race/ethnic, socioeconomic, medically underserved), particularly in etiologic, outcome, and intervention studies in Hispanics. By drawing on established and new partnerships, the Program is also building research that addresses American Indian cancer disparities and priorities identified by NM Tribes, Pueblos, and Indian Nations. Major scientific accomplishments in Risk Prediction and Risk Reduction include the identification of social, lifestyle, and genetic factors associated with lung cancer risk; gene-environment interactions in melanoma risk; and development and dissemination of a novel telehealth strategy for the prevention of hepatocellular cancer. In Screening, members have developed a statewide surveillance program of screening and diagnosis for cervical pre-cancer and cancer that informs real- world cervical cancer prevention through human papilloma virus (HPV) vaccination, screening practice and outcomes. Members have also identified barriers to use of early detection tests in colorectal cancer and have developed strategies to overcome these barriers to improve screening in underserved populations. In Post- Diagnosis Outcomes and Survivorship, members have identified factors that contribute to disparities in post- treatment outcomes and survivorship in endometrial and breast cancer and are developing interventions. Led by Linda Cook, Ph.D. and Anita Kinney, Ph.D., RN, the CaC Program is comprised of 28 members (19 full and 9 associate) from 7 UNM schools and departments, the Lovelace Respiratory Institute, and the Indian Health Service Unit of the Centers for Disease Control whose work is supported by $19,276,863 million in annual direct cost funding, of which $15,429,911 million is peer-reviewed and $3,137,820 million is from NCI as of 9/1/2014. The discoveries made in this Program have resulted 294 publications, of which 19% are intra-programmatic collaborations and 16% are inter-programmatic collaborations; with a total UNMCC and external collaborative publication level of 30% and 80%, respectively.             OVERALL COMPONENT: THE UNIVERSITY OF NEW MEXICO CANCER CENTER PROJECT NARRATIVE Designated as one of the nation's National Cancer Institute Cancer Centers since 2005, the University of New Mexico Cancer Center is a cancer treatment, research, and education and training center that applies the scientific expertise of its investigators to those cancers that have high incidence, mortality, or disparity in the multiethnic and underserved populations of New Mexico. The Center is a hub for promoting discovery through its research, education and training, clinical care, statewide outreach programs and networks for community participatory research. The Center connects scientists, healthcare professionals, and communities to translate its discoveries to cancer clinical trials, and cancer control and behavioral interventions that reduce the cancer burden of New Mexico and serve as a national model. The goal of the Center is to assure that all of the people in New Mexico, its catchment area, have access to high quality cancer care and collaborate in and benefit from advances in cancer

There are 248 full members (nearly all NIH funded cancer researchers in the state of Colorado) who participate in six research programs including: Cancer Cell Biology; Molecular Oncology; Developmental Therapeutics; Hormone-Related Malignancies; Lung, Head & Neck Cancer, and Cancer Prevention and Control. During the past five years, peer-reviewed cancer-related funding reached $102 million and 3,181 publications (35% collaborative) were produced. Our innovation in research is exemplified by our members' lead roles in a lung cancer SPORE, LIVESTRONG Center of Excellence, biomarker development (ALK rearrangement, EGFR) for individualized therapy by our Pathology Shared Resource and development of a top Animal Cancer Center. Annual accrual to therapeutic trials increased from 595 to 1,044 which represent 27% of newly diagnosed patients. Research is supported by 13 Shared Resources located across the consortium and accessible to all UCCC members. These resources leverage NIH investments in our Colorado Clinical and Translational Science Institute (CCTSI) to provide cost efficiencies by avoiding duplication and enhancing critical mass. Development activities focused on strategic recruitments and pilot and seed grant programs have led to a return on investment of $11 million in direct cancer research grant funding. During the next five years, our Strategic Plan includes development of programs in Metastasis and Tumor Microenvironment, Cancer Stem Cells, Survivorship and Health Disparities and a Human Research Imaging Shared Resource which will cross species and enhance our drug development pipeline and personalized therapy clinical trials. Additional clinical and research facilities in construction, will allow us to mainain our upward research and clinical growth trajectory. RELEVANCE: The NCl-designated Cancer Centers are the centerpiece of the national effort to reduce morbidity and mortality from cancer.

"COMPREHENSIVE CANCER CENTER CORE SUPPORT GRANT ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Decades of research on basic immunology and the interactions of tumors and the immune system have led over the past few years to an explosive increase in the successes of immunotherapeutic modalities in cancer. The objective of the Inflammation, Immunology, and Immunotherapeutics (III) Program is to build on and to accelerate those successes by developing novel therapeutic approaches for the treatment of leukemia/lymphoma and solid tumors, and to understand and exploit the basic biology of the immune system's responses to cancers. The emphasis is on antibody and T-cell mediated therapy in preclinical models and clinical translation studies. The Tumor Immunology Program has been a component of the Cancer Center since its inception and in 2012, it merged with the Virology Program to become the III Program. It is currently led by Casey T. Weaver, M.D. (Pathology), and Donald J. Buchsbaum, Ph.D. (Radiation Oncology), and has 40 primary faculty members from seven departments. The Program has $11,611,410 in annual direct grant support of cancer relevant research including $756,267 from NCI, $9,592,968 from other NIH Institutes, $289,001 from other peer-reviewed awards, and $973,174 in non-peer-reviewed support. The Program has two major areas of emphasis: (1) development of targeted immunotherapy utilizing antibody specificity to deliver apoptotic stimuli, drugs, or radioactive isotopes to tumors in animal models and human cancer; and (2) exploration of basic immunobiology research in the areas of inflammation and T- and B-cell immunology to translate into immunodiagnostic and immunotherapeutic modalities. The Program has major collaborations with the Experimental Therapeutics and Cancer Cell Biology Programs, and HudsonAlpha including individual projects in the Breast Cancer and Pancreatic Cancer SPOREs. During the previous funding period there were 310 total publications, of which 72 (23%) were intra-programmatic, 69 (22%) inter-programmatic, and 161 (52%) inter-institutional. OVERALL COMPONENT PROJECT NARRATIVE The UAB CCC has made a significant contribution to public health that is particularly relevant to the populations served by this Cancer Center who are located in the heart of the Deep South. Our research programs, in addition to their important contributions to translational science, have focused on the unique problems seen in African American populations that include higher incidences and mortality rates from certain cancers, lower age appropriate screening rates, greater obesity from poor diets and less physical activity, greater tobacco use, and lack of access to

The Program's overall goal is to reduce cancer incidence, morbidity, and mortality, particularly in the unique multiethnic and underserved populations of NM. Disparities research is a cross-cutting theme that fosters scientific focus and synergy across the research areas. Through vigorous strategic program planning and evaluation, recruitment of 9 new investigators to enhance expertise in molecular epidemiology and behavioral/community intervention, and guidance of the UNMCC External Advisory Committee, the CaC Program is now focused on three areas of cancer research: 1) Risk Prediction and Risk Reduction; 2) Screening; and 3) Post-Diagnosis Outcomes and Survivorship. Unique scientific strengths include research addressing disparities (geographic, race/ethnic, socioeconomic, medically underserved), particularly in etiologic, outcome, and intervention studies in Hispanics. By drawing on established and new partnerships, the Program is also building research that addresses American Indian cancer disparities and priorities identified by NM Tribes, Pueblos, and Indian Nations. Major scientific accomplishments in Risk Prediction and Risk Reduction include the identification of social, lifestyle, and genetic factors associated with lung cancer risk; gene-environment interactions in melanoma risk; and development and dissemination of a novel telehealth strategy for the prevention of hepatocellular cancer. In Screening, members have developed a statewide surveillance program of screening and diagnosis for cervical pre-cancer and cancer that informs real- world cervical cancer prevention through human papilloma virus (HPV) vaccination, screening practice and outcomes. Members have also identified barriers to use of early detection tests in colorectal cancer and have developed strategies to overcome these barriers to improve screening in underserved populations. In Post- Diagnosis Outcomes and Survivorship, members have identified factors that contribute to disparities in post- treatment outcomes and survivorship in endometrial and breast cancer and are developing interventions. Led by Linda Cook, Ph.D. and Anita Kinney, Ph.D., RN, the CaC Program is comprised of 28 members (19 full and 9 associate) from 7 UNM schools and departments, the Lovelace Respiratory Institute, and the Indian Health Service Unit of the Centers for Disease Control whose work is supported by $19,276,863 million in annual direct cost funding, of which $15,429,911 million is peer-reviewed and $3,137,820 million is from NCI as of 9/1/2014. The discoveries made in this Program have resulted 294 publications, of which 19% are intra-programmatic collaborations and 16% are inter-programmatic collaborations; with a total UNMCC and external collaborative publication level of 30% and 80%, respectively.             OVERALL COMPONENT: THE UNIVERSITY OF NEW MEXICO CANCER CENTER PROJECT NARRATIVE Designated as one of the nation's National Cancer Institute Cancer Centers since 2005, the University of New Mexico Cancer Center is a cancer treatment, research, and education and training center that applies the scientific expertise of its investigators to those cancers that have high incidence, mortality, or disparity in the multiethnic and underserved populations of New Mexico. The Center is a hub for promoting discovery through its research, education and training, clinical care, statewide outreach programs and networks for community participatory research. The Center connects scientists, healthcare professionals, and communities to translate its discoveries to cancer clinical trials, and cancer control and behavioral interventions that reduce the cancer burden of New Mexico and serve as a national model.

"COMPREHENSIVE CANCER CENTER CORE SUPPORT GRANT ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Decades of research on basic immunology and the interactions of tumors and the immune system have led over the past few years to an explosive increase in the successes of immunotherapeutic modalities in cancer. The objective of the Inflammation, Immunology, and Immunotherapeutics (III) Program is to build on and to accelerate those successes by developing novel therapeutic approaches for the treatment of leukemia/lymphoma and solid tumors, and to understand and exploit the basic biology of the immune system's responses to cancers. The emphasis is on antibody and T-cell mediated therapy in preclinical models and clinical translation studies. The Tumor Immunology Program has been a component of the Cancer Center since its inception and in 2012, it merged with the Virology Program to become the III Program. It is currently led by Casey T. Weaver, M.D. (Pathology), and Donald J. Buchsbaum, Ph.D. (Radiation Oncology), and has 40 primary faculty members from seven departments. The Program has $11,611,410 in annual direct grant support of cancer relevant research including $756,267 from NCI, $9,592,968 from other NIH Institutes, $289,001 from other peer-reviewed awards, and $973,174 in non-peer-reviewed support. The Program has two major areas of emphasis: (1) development of targeted immunotherapy utilizing antibody specificity to deliver apoptotic stimuli, drugs, or radioactive isotopes to tumors in animal models and human cancer; and (2) exploration of basic immunobiology research in the areas of inflammation and T- and B-cell immunology to translate into immunodiagnostic and immunotherapeutic modalities. The Program has major collaborations with the Experimental Therapeutics and Cancer Cell Biology Programs, and HudsonAlpha including individual projects in the Breast Cancer and Pancreatic Cancer SPOREs. During the previous funding period there were 310 total publications, of which 72 (23%) were intra-programmatic, 69 (22%) inter-programmatic, and 161 (52%) inter-institutional. OVERALL COMPONENT PROJECT NARRATIVE The UAB CCC has made a significant contribution to public health that is particularly relevant to the populations served by this Cancer Center who are located in the heart of the Deep South. Our research programs, in addition to their important contributions to translational science, have focused on the unique problems seen in African American populations that include higher incidences and mortality rates from certain cancers, lower age appropriate screening rates, greater obesity from poor diets and less physical activity, greater tobacco use, and lack of access to

"COMPREHENSIVE CANCER CENTER CORE SUPPORT GRANT ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Decades of research on basic immunology and the interactions of tumors and the immune system have led over the past few years to an explosive increase in the successes of immunotherapeutic modalities in cancer. The objective of the Inflammation, Immunology, and Immunotherapeutics (III) Program is to build on and to accelerate those successes by developing novel therapeutic approaches for the treatment of leukemia/lymphoma and solid tumors, and to understand and exploit the basic biology of the immune system's responses to cancers. The emphasis is on antibody and T-cell mediated therapy in preclinical models and clinical translation studies. The Tumor Immunology Program has been a component of the Cancer Center since its inception and in 2012, it merged with the Virology Program to become the III Program. It is currently led by Casey T. Weaver, M.D. (Pathology), and Donald J. Buchsbaum, Ph.D. (Radiation Oncology), and has 40 primary faculty members from seven departments. The Program has $11,611,410 in annual direct grant support of cancer relevant research including $756,267 from NCI, $9,592,968 from other NIH Institutes, $289,001 from other peer-reviewed awards, and $973,174 in non-peer-reviewed support. The Program has two major areas of emphasis: (1) development of targeted immunotherapy utilizing antibody specificity to deliver apoptotic stimuli, drugs, or radioactive isotopes to tumors in animal models and human cancer; and (2) exploration of basic immunobiology research in the areas of inflammation and T- and B-cell immunology to translate into immunodiagnostic and immunotherapeutic modalities. The Program has major collaborations with the Experimental Therapeutics and Cancer Cell Biology Programs, and HudsonAlpha including individual projects in the Breast Cancer and Pancreatic Cancer SPOREs.

"Winship Cancer Institute Cancer Center Support Grant PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The Winship Cancer Institute of Emory University (Winship) is the only NCI-designated cancer center in Georgia, which is now the eighth most populous state and has the largest land area among states east of the Mississippi River. As the main tertiary cancer care and cancer research institution in the state, Winship has committed its four research programs as supported by its six shared resources to address the specific challenges associated with the cancer burden in Georgia. These challenges include: high tobacco usage and incidence of tobacco- related cancers; high proportion of cancer patients who are African American or black and/or have significant cancer disparity issues in their care, prognosis, and/or outcome; and low health literacy levels. Winship's mission is to lessen the burden of cancer for the citizens of Georgia, its primary catchment area. This will be accomplished by: (1) seeking greater insights into the molecular, genetic, and epigenetic basis of cancer; (2) discovering new knowledge that drives improvements in cancer detection, prevention, and/or therapy; (3) developing or defining novel therapeutic targets and/or agents as a pathway to better cancer therapies; and (4) studying and implementing population-based strategies to lessen the cancer burden in the state. The 164 Winship core members are actively engaged in one of four Winship research programs, all of which have a strong emphasis on transdisciplinary research: Cancer Cell Biology, Cancer Genetics and Epigenetics, Cancer Prevention and Control, and Discovery and Developmental Therapeutics. Winship's members are supported by six shared resources: Biostatistics and Bioinformatics Shared Resource, Cancer Animal Models Shared Resource, Cancer Tissue and Pathology Shared Resource, Emory Integrated Genomics Shared Resource, Emory Integrated Proteomics Shared Resource, and the Integrated Imaging Shared Resource; and two developing shared resources: Winship Research Informatics and Intervention Development, Dissemination, and Implementation Developing Shared Resources. Winship members are currently supported by $84.8M in total research funding (as of 3/31/2016) awarded via Emory University. Winship members Curran and Bruner serve as PIs on two NCI awards to the NRG Oncology Foundation for a total of $25.6M in support of clinical research infrastructure. Patient enrollment in Winship's interventional and non-interventional trials continues to increase, especially among patients from under-represented minority groups, and these activities have contributed to the FDA- approval of several novel anti-cancer agents during the present funding period. Winship has outstanding institutional commitment, with more than $200 million in institutional support committed over the next five years, a level almost twice that committed in 2011. Winship enjoys the same reporting line and organizational position as Emory's schools of medicine, public health, and nursing. Winship is uniquely positioned to apply its scientific strengths, outstanding membership, robust infrastructure, strong institutional support, and comprehensive training programs to fulfill its mission of lessening the burden of cancer on the state of Georgia and beyond.

"University of New Mexico Cancer Center Support Grant ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Cancer Control (CaC) Research Program is a newly restructured transdisciplinary program that serves as the hub for cancer control and population science research within the University of New Mexico Cancer Center (UNMCC) and the State of New Mexico (NM), our catchment area. The Program's overall goal is to reduce cancer incidence, morbidity, and mortality, particularly in the unique multiethnic and underserved populations of NM. Disparities research is a cross-cutting theme that fosters scientific focus and synergy across the research areas. Through vigorous strategic program planning and evaluation, recruitment of 9 new investigators to enhance expertise in molecular epidemiology and behavioral/community intervention, and guidance of the UNMCC External Advisory Committee, the CaC Program is now focused on three areas of cancer research: 1) Risk Prediction and Risk Reduction; 2) Screening; and 3) Post-Diagnosis Outcomes and Survivorship. Unique scientific strengths include research addressing disparities (geographic, race/ethnic, socioeconomic, medically underserved), particularly in etiologic, outcome, and intervention studies in Hispanics. By drawing on established and new partnerships, the Program is also building research that addresses American Indian cancer disparities and priorities identified by NM Tribes, Pueblos, and Indian Nations. Major scientific accomplishments in Risk Prediction and Risk Reduction include the identification of social, lifestyle, and genetic factors associated with lung cancer risk; gene-environment interactions in melanoma risk; and development and dissemination of a novel telehealth strategy for the prevention of hepatocellular cancer. In Screening, members have developed a statewide surveillance program of screening and diagnosis for cervical pre-cancer and cancer that informs real- world cervical cancer prevention through human papilloma virus (HPV) vaccination, screening practice and outcomes. Members have also identified barriers to use of early detection tests in colorectal cancer and have developed strategies to overcome these barriers to improve screening in underserved populations. In Post- Diagnosis Outcomes and Survivorship, members have identified factors that contribute to disparities in post- treatment outcomes and survivorship in endometrial and breast cancer and are developing interventions. Led by Linda Cook, Ph.D. and Anita Kinney, Ph.D., RN, the CaC Program is comprised of 28 members (19 full and 9 associate) from 7 UNM schools and departments, the Lovelace Respiratory Institute, and the Indian Health Service Unit of the Centers for Disease Control whose work is supported by $19,276,863 million in annual direct cost funding, of which $15,429,911 million is peer-reviewed and $3,137,820 million is from NCI as of 9/1/2014. The discoveries made in this Program have resulted 294 publications, of which 19% are intra-programmatic collaborations and 16% are inter-programmatic collaborations; with a total UNMCC and external collaborative publication level of 30% and 80%, respectively. OVERALL COMPONENT: THE UNIVERSITY OF NEW MEXICO CANCER CENTER PROJECT NARRATIVE Designated as one of the nation's National Cancer Institute Cancer Centers since 2005, the University of New Mexico Cancer Center is a cancer treatment, research, and education and training center that applies the scientific expertise of its investigators to those cancers that have high incidence, mortality, or disparity in the multiethnic and underserved populations of New Mexico. The Center is a hub for promoting discovery through its research, education and training, clinical care, statewide outreach programs and networks for community participatory research. The Center connects scientists, healthcare professionals, and communities to translate its discoveries to cancer clinical trials, and cancer control and behavioral interventions that reduce the cancer burden of New Mexico and serve as a national model. The goal of the Center is to assure that all of the people in New Mexico, its catchment area, have access to high quality cancer care and collaborate in and benefit from advances in cancer

"Regional Oncology Research Center ABSTRACT The Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center (SKCCC) at Johns Hopkins is dedicated to cancer research, education and training, and care, with an overarching goal of expeditiously and strategically applying new knowledge to improve prevention, screening, detection, diagnosis and treatment of cancer in Maryland and throughout nation and the world. Through targeted outreach and research, cancer outcomes disparities are decreasing in SKCCC's catchment area, but they remain a challenge and a focus at SKCCC. This application requests continued Cancer Center Support Grant (CCSG) funding for SKCCC's Research Programs and Cores. The SKCCC comprises a multidisciplinary, interdepartmental center of The Johns Hopkins University (JHU), encompassing 34 departments in five schools. The scientific Programs of the SKCCC organize and orient the broad base of cancer research throughout JHU into teams focused on rapid translation to the clinic and to populations inside and outside its catchment area. Research conducted at SKCCC includes discovery research into the molecular genetics of human tumorigenesis, clinical trials of new cancer treatments and epidemiologic analyses of lifestyle influences on cancer mortality. The SKCCC is a leading cancer center that is providing insights into the fundamental nature of different cancers and elucidating the thousands of somatic genetic and epigenetic alterations that mark the differences from case to case. This body of work has fueled an emerging understanding that the ultimate control of cancer will require individualizing cancer care using approaches that can be deployed at a population scale. To accomplish this mission, SKCCC took critical input from its External Advisory Board and has strategically evolved since the last CCSG to: 1) augment the clinical and population impact of the discovery pipeline in cancer genetics, epigenetics and immunology generated by discipline-oriented Programs; 2) maximize the translational research output of disease-specific Programs, emphasizing the exploration of new concepts in scientifically driven clinical trials; and 3) position the population-oriented Program to identify, understand and overcome barriers responsible for disparities in cancer outcome in the catchment area. The nine SKCCC Research Programs include four discipline-oriented Programs: Cancer Biology (CB; Baylin, Velculescu), Cancer Immunology (CI; Pardoll, Drake), Cancer Molecular and Functional Imaging (CMFI; Bhujwalla, Pomper), and Cancer Chemical and Structural Biology (CCSB; Berger, Liu); four disease- specific Programs: Hematologic Malignancies and Bone Marrow Transplantation (HMBMT; Ambinder, Jones, Levis), Prostate Cancer (PC; Pienta, Denmeade, Lupold), Breast and Ovarian Cancer (BOC; Stearns, Shih), and Brain Cancer (BC; Grossman, Brem, Laterra); and one population-oriented Program: Cancer Prevention and Control (CPC; Platz, Roden). These Programs are supported by fifteen Cores, one developing Core (described in Developmental Funds) and a dedicated leadership team.

"University of New Mexico Cancer Center Support Grant ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Cancer Control (CaC) Research Program is a newly restructured transdisciplinary program that serves as the hub for cancer control and population science research within the University of New Mexico Cancer Center (UNMCC) and the State of New Mexico (NM), our catchment area. The Program's overall goal is to reduce cancer incidence, morbidity, and mortality, particularly in the unique multiethnic and underserved populations of NM. Disparities research is a cross-cutting theme that fosters scientific focus and synergy across the research areas. Through vigorous strategic program planning and evaluation, recruitment of 9 new investigators to enhance expertise in molecular epidemiology and behavioral/community intervention, and guidance of the UNMCC External Advisory Committee, the CaC Program is now focused on three areas of cancer research: 1) Risk Prediction and Risk Reduction; 2) Screening; and 3) Post-Diagnosis Outcomes and Survivorship. Unique scientific strengths include research addressing disparities (geographic, race/ethnic, socioeconomic, medically underserved), particularly in etiologic, outcome, and intervention studies in Hispanics. By drawing on established and new partnerships, the Program is also building research that addresses American Indian cancer disparities and priorities identified by NM Tribes, Pueblos, and Indian Nations. Major scientific accomplishments in Risk Prediction and Risk Reduction include the identification of social, lifestyle, and genetic factors associated with lung cancer risk; gene-environment interactions in melanoma risk; and development and dissemination of a novel telehealth strategy for the prevention of hepatocellular cancer. In Screening, members have developed a statewide surveillance program of screening and diagnosis for cervical pre-cancer and cancer that informs real- world cervical cancer prevention through human papilloma virus (HPV) vaccination, screening practice and outcomes. Members have also identified barriers to use of early detection tests in colorectal cancer and have developed strategies to overcome these barriers to improve screening in underserved populations. In Post- Diagnosis Outcomes and Survivorship, members have identified factors that contribute to disparities in post- treatment outcomes and survivorship in endometrial and breast cancer and are developing interventions. Led by Linda Cook, Ph.D. and Anita Kinney, Ph.D., RN, the CaC Program is comprised of 28 members (19 full and 9 associate) from 7 UNM schools and departments, the Lovelace Respiratory Institute, and the Indian Health Service Unit of the Centers for Disease Control whose work is supported by $19,276,863 million in annual direct cost funding, of which $15,429,911 million is peer-reviewed and $3,137,820 million is from NCI as of 9/1/2014. The discoveries made in this Program have resulted 294 publications, of which 19% are intra-programmatic collaborations and 16% are inter-programmatic collaborations; with a total UNMCC and external collaborative publication level of 30% and 80%, respectively.             OVERALL COMPONENT: THE UNIVERSITY OF NEW MEXICO CANCER CENTER PROJECT NARRATIVE Designated as one of the nation's National Cancer Institute Cancer Centers since 2005, the University of New Mexico Cancer Center is a cancer treatment, research, and education and training center that applies the scientific expertise of its investigators to those cancers that have high incidence, mortality, or disparity in the multiethnic and underserved populations of New Mexico.

"University of New Mexico Cancer Center Support Grant ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Cancer Control (CaC) Research Program is a newly restructured transdisciplinary program that serves as the hub for cancer control and population science research within the University of New Mexico Cancer Center (UNMCC) and the State of New Mexico (NM), our catchment area. The Program's overall goal is to reduce cancer incidence, morbidity, and mortality, particularly in the unique multiethnic and underserved populations of NM. Disparities research is a cross-cutting theme that fosters scientific focus and synergy across the research areas. Through vigorous strategic program planning and evaluation, recruitment of 9 new investigators to enhance expertise in molecular epidemiology and behavioral/community intervention, and guidance of the UNMCC External Advisory Committee, the CaC Program is now focused on three areas of cancer research: 1) Risk Prediction and Risk Reduction; 2) Screening; and 3) Post-Diagnosis Outcomes and Survivorship. Unique scientific strengths include research addressing disparities (geographic, race/ethnic, socioeconomic, medically underserved), particularly in etiologic, outcome, and intervention studies in Hispanics. By drawing on established and new partnerships, the Program is also building research that addresses American Indian cancer disparities and priorities identified by NM Tribes, Pueblos, and Indian Nations. Major scientific accomplishments in Risk Prediction and Risk Reduction include the identification of social, lifestyle, and genetic factors associated with lung cancer risk; gene-environment interactions in melanoma risk; and development and dissemination of a novel telehealth strategy for the prevention of hepatocellular cancer. In Screening, members have developed a statewide surveillance program of screening and diagnosis for cervical pre-cancer and cancer that informs real- world cervical cancer prevention through human papilloma virus (HPV) vaccination, screening practice and outcomes. Members have also identified barriers to use of early detection tests in colorectal cancer and have developed strategies to overcome these barriers to improve screening in underserved populations. In Post- Diagnosis Outcomes and Survivorship, members have identified factors that contribute to disparities in post- treatment outcomes and survivorship in endometrial and breast cancer and are developing interventions. Led by Linda Cook, Ph.D. and Anita Kinney, Ph.D., RN, the CaC Program is comprised of 28 members (19 full and 9 associate) from 7 UNM schools and departments, the Lovelace Respiratory Institute, and the Indian Health Service Unit of the Centers for Disease Control whose work is supported by $19,276,863 million in annual direct cost funding, of which $15,429,911 million is peer-reviewed and $3,137,820 million is from NCI as of 9/1/2014. The discoveries made in this Program have resulted 294 publications, of which 19% are intra-programmatic collaborations and 16% are inter-programmatic collaborations; with a total UNMCC and external collaborative publication level of 30% and 80%, respectively.             OVERALL COMPONENT: THE UNIVERSITY OF NEW MEXICO CANCER CENTER PROJECT NARRATIVE Designated as one of the nation's National Cancer Institute Cancer Centers since 2005, the University of New Mexico Cancer Center is a cancer treatment, research, and education and training center that applies the scientific expertise of its investigators to those cancers that have high incidence, mortality, or disparity in the multiethnic and underserved populations of New Mexico.

"Moffitt Cancer Center Support Grant PROJECT SUMMARY The H. Lee Moffitt Cancer Center & Research Institute (MCC) continues its ambitious trajectory of innovative cancer research and translation to benefit the gulf coast region of Florida and beyond. As a free-standing 501(c)3 not-for-profit institution with the sole purpose “to contribute to the prevention and cure of cancer,” all research funding ($71.8M), publications (2,430), and clinical research (>1,600 interventional accruals/ year) are cancer focused. Research and clinical space has expanded dramatically since the last renewal to more than 2 million square feet, and patient clinical volume places MCC among the largest Centers in the United States. MCC has benefitted from recent, ongoing annual state legislature funding of approximately $25 million, in addition to more than $39 million of annual institutional research support. The 142 MCC members span the basic, clinical, and population sciences. They are organized into five highly collaborative, multidisciplinary programs with exceptional levels of intra- (35%) and inter-programmatic (18%) publications. Under the leadership of Dr. Thomas Sellers, the third MCC Director, a Research Strategic Plan (RSP) was developed and implemented for “Moffitt 3.0.” Four of six Associate Center Directors are new; and new leaders have been appointed in every program, with bold goals and specific aims. Two of the 13 shared resources have been significantly restructured (Chemical Biology, Molecular Genomics), and one new resource created (Collaborative Data Services) to better meet the changing needs of MCC scientists. Implementation of the strategic plan has been bolstered by substantial institutional investment, especially in basic science, immunotherapy, and clinical research infrastructure, including the recruitment of 45 new faculty members, of whom 32 are CCSG members. MCC is a leader in immunotherapy, and more than 40% of overall clinical trial accrual is to investigator-initiated studies. MCC population scientists initiated significant new efforts in cancer prevention and outcomes that include vaccines, tobacco cessation, and health disparities. This is particularly true in the unique cancer problems in the catchment area – notably lung cancer, melanoma, and HPV- prevention. MCC's Total Cancer Care protocol, the ground-breaking research strategy to realize the promise of personalized medicine, has continued to thrive, resulting in dramatic utilization of the Tissue Core and the formation of the Oncology Research Information Exchange Network (ORIEN) that now includes eleven cancer centers across the nation, with several more poised to join the consortium this year. MCC requests funding for: five scientific programs, 13 shared resources, two clinical research components, planning and evaluation, administration, leadership, four staff investigators, and developmental funds. CCSG funds are leveraged more than 10-fold with institutional resources to maximize impact on cancer prevention, treatment, and cure in the catchment area, the state of Florida and beyond.

"University of New Mexico Cancer Center Support Grant ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Cancer Control (CaC) Research Program is a newly restructured transdisciplinary program that serves as the hub for cancer control and population science research within the University of New Mexico Cancer Center (UNMCC) and the State of New Mexico (NM), our catchment area. The Program's overall goal is to reduce cancer incidence, morbidity, and mortality, particularly in the unique multiethnic and underserved populations of NM. Disparities research is a cross-cutting theme that fosters scientific focus and synergy across the research areas. Through vigorous strategic program planning and evaluation, recruitment of 9 new investigators to enhance expertise in molecular epidemiology and behavioral/community intervention, and guidance of the UNMCC External Advisory Committee, the CaC Program is now focused on three areas of cancer research: 1) Risk Prediction and Risk Reduction; 2) Screening; and 3) Post-Diagnosis Outcomes and Survivorship. Unique scientific strengths include research addressing disparities (geographic, race/ethnic, socioeconomic, medically underserved), particularly in etiologic, outcome, and intervention studies in Hispanics. By drawing on established and new partnerships, the Program is also building research that addresses American Indian cancer disparities and priorities identified by NM Tribes, Pueblos, and Indian Nations. Major scientific accomplishments in Risk Prediction and Risk Reduction include the identification of social, lifestyle, and genetic factors associated with lung cancer risk; gene-environment interactions in melanoma risk; and development and dissemination of a novel telehealth strategy for the prevention of hepatocellular cancer. In Screening, members have developed a statewide surveillance program of screening and diagnosis for cervical pre-cancer and cancer that informs real- world cervical cancer prevention through human papilloma virus (HPV) vaccination, screening practice and outcomes. Members have also identified barriers to use of early detection tests in colorectal cancer and have developed strategies to overcome these barriers to improve screening in underserved populations. In Post- Diagnosis Outcomes and Survivorship, members have identified factors that contribute to disparities in post- treatment outcomes and survivorship in endometrial and breast cancer and are developing interventions. Led by Linda Cook, Ph.D. and Anita Kinney, Ph.D., RN, the CaC Program is comprised of 28 members (19 full and 9 associate) from 7 UNM schools and departments, the Lovelace Respiratory Institute, and the Indian Health Service Unit of the Centers for Disease Control whose work is supported by $19,276,863 million in annual direct cost funding, of which $15,429,911 million is peer-reviewed and $3,137,820 million is from NCI as of 9/1/2014. The discoveries made in this Program have resulted 294 publications, of which 19% are intra-programmatic collaborations and 16% are inter-programmatic collaborations; with a total UNMCC and external collaborative publication level of 30% and 80%, respectively.             OVERALL COMPONENT: THE UNIVERSITY OF NEW MEXICO CANCER CENTER PROJECT NARRATIVE Designated as one of the nation's National Cancer Institute Cancer Centers since 2005, the University of New Mexico Cancer Center is a cancer treatment, research, and education and training center that applies the scientific expertise of its investigators to those cancers that have high incidence, mortality, or disparity in the multiethnic and underserved populations of New Mexico. The Center is a hub for promoting discovery through its research, education and training, clinical care, statewide outreach programs and networks for community participatory research. The Center connects scientists, healthcare professionals, and communities to translate its discoveries to cancer clinical trials, and cancer control and behavioral interventions that reduce the cancer burden of New Mexico and serve as a national model.

"COMPREHENSIVE CANCER CENTER CORE SUPPORT GRANT ﻿PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTACT The UAB CCC is the only NCI designated comprehensive cancer center in the states of Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana and Arkansas, states with higher cancer mortality and significant minority, mostly African American populations. The Cancer Center is in its 44th year of NCI funding and continues its major contributions to translational therapeutics and cancer disparity research with a focus on training minority investigators. The UAB CCC has 242 members who come from 30 departments in 9 UAB schools, Southern Research, and HudsonAlpha Institute for Biotechnology. The members are supported by $92,055,777 in annual direct extramural funding. The UAB CCC is organized into six research programs, two each in basic, translational, and prevention and control – Inflammation, Immunology & Immunotherapeutics; Cancer Cell Biology; Experimental Therapeutics; Neuro-Oncology; Cancer Chemoprevention; and Cancer Control & Population Sciences. Members published 1,684 cancer focused, peer reviewed publications between 2011 and 2015 of which 24% were intra-programmatic, 16% inter-programmatic, and 53% inter-institutional. These members are supported by eleven shared facilities – Biostatistics & Bioinformatics, Comprehensive Genomics, High Resolution Imaging, Human Imaging, Mass Spectrometry/2D Proteomics, Microbiome/Gnotobiotic, Preclinical Imaging, Recruitment & Retention, Structural Biology, Tissue Procurement, and Transgenic Animals as well as the developing Pharmacometrics Shared Facility. We have established a Phase I Clinical Trials Program, opened an Advanced Imaging Facility, advanced targets through the Alabama Drug Discovery Alliance, created the UAB Health System Cancer Community Network, and are now a consortium with HudsonAlpha Institute for Biotechnology. In addition to these achievements, we have created an Institute for Cancer Outcomes and Survivorship, and established a critical mass of investigators in energy balance and cancer. We have also expanded our minority training programs that since 2005 have trained 59 scholars resulting in 306 publications, 67 grant submissions with 30 funded, and have had a major impact at Morehouse School of Medicine and Tuskegee University. We have recruited 47 investigators to multiple programs in the Cancer Center since 2010. Strategic plans developed in 2011 with crosscutting themes of Translational Therapeutics, Systems Biomedicine, and Energetics and Cancer continue to be highly relevant today. For the future, we will continue to emphasize translational and cancer disparity research with an emphasis on personalized/genomic medicine, energy balance and cancer, outcomes and survivorship, and early phase clinical trials. OVERALL COMPONENT PROJECT NARRATIVE The UAB CCC has made a significant contribution to public health that is particularly relevant to the populations served by this Cancer Center who are located in the heart of the Deep South. Our research programs, in addition to their important contributions to translational science, have focused on the unique problems seen in African American populations that include higher incidences

"Winship Cancer Institute Cancer Center Support Grant PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The Winship Cancer Institute of Emory University (Winship) is the only NCI-designated cancer center in Georgia, which is now the eighth most populous state and has the largest land area among states east of the Mississippi River. As the main tertiary cancer care and cancer research institution in the state, Winship has committed its four research programs as supported by its six shared resources to address the specific challenges associated with the cancer burden in Georgia. These challenges include: high tobacco usage and incidence of tobacco- related cancers; high proportion of cancer patients who are African American or black and/or have significant cancer disparity issues in their care, prognosis, and/or outcome; and low health literacy levels. Winship's mission is to lessen the burden of cancer for the citizens of Georgia, its primary catchment area. This will be accomplished by: (1) seeking greater insights into the molecular, genetic, and epigenetic basis of cancer; (2) discovering new knowledge that drives improvements in cancer detection, prevention, and/or therapy; (3) developing or defining novel therapeutic targets and/or agents as a pathway to better cancer therapies; and (4) studying and implementing population-based strategies to lessen the cancer burden in the state. The 164 Winship core members are actively engaged in one of four Winship research programs, all of which have a strong emphasis on transdisciplinary research: Cancer Cell Biology, Cancer Genetics and Epigenetics, Cancer Prevention and Control, and Discovery and Developmental Therapeutics. Winship's members are supported by six shared resources: Biostatistics and Bioinformatics Shared Resource, Cancer Animal Models Shared Resource, Cancer Tissue and Pathology Shared Resource, Emory Integrated Genomics Shared Resource, Emory Integrated Proteomics Shared Resource, and the Integrated Imaging Shared Resource; and two developing shared resources: Winship Research Informatics and Intervention Development, Dissemination, and Implementation Developing Shared Resources. Winship members are currently supported by $84.8M in total research funding (as of 3/31/2016) awarded via Emory University. Winship members Curran and Bruner serve as PIs on two NCI awards to the NRG Oncology Foundation for a total of $25.6M in support of clinical research infrastructure. Patient enrollment in Winship's interventional and non-interventional trials continues to increase, especially among patients from under-represented minority groups, and these activities have contributed to the FDA- approval of several novel anti-cancer agents during the present funding period. Winship has outstanding institutional commitment, with more than $200 million in institutional support committed over the next five years, a level almost twice that committed in 2011. Winship enjoys the same reporting line and organizational position as Emory's schools of medicine, public health, and nursing. Winship is uniquely positioned to apply its scientific strengths, outstanding membership, robust infrastructure, strong institutional support, and comprehensive training programs to fulfill its mission of lessening the burden of cancer on the state of Georgia and beyond. PROJECT NARRATIVE As the first and only NCI-designated cancer center in Georgia, the Winship Cancer Institute of Emory University (Winship) serves the state as its primary tertiary cancer care provider and its primary institution for cancer research, training, and education. Winship is an integral part of Emory University, coordinating the cancer specific research capabilities of the Emory University School of Medicine, Rollins School of Public Health, Nell Hodgson Woodruff School of Nursing, Emory College, and Emory Healthcare. Winship maintains direct responsibility to coordinate the clinical care provided to cancer patients and to oversee and coordinate the quality and multi- and trans-disciplinary nature of care with all relevant units to accomplish its mission to lessen the burden of cancer by aligning discovery and education with cancer prevention and cancer care.",Winship Cancer Institute Cancer Center Support Grant,9379010,P30CA138292,"['Award ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Foundations ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Patient Care ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Incidence ', ' Institutes ', ' Mentorship ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Mission ', ' Mississippi ', ' Pathology ', ' Patients ', ' outcome forecast ', ' Prognosis ', ' Public Health Nurses ', ' Public Health Nursing ', ' Research ', ' School Nursing ', ' School Health Nursing ', ' medical schools ', ' school of medicine ', ' medical college ', ' Public Health Schools ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Tobacco ', ' Training Programs ', ' Universities ', ' Care Givers ', ' Caregivers ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' Molecular Genetics ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' Area ', ' Training ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Policies ', ' Funding ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Oncology Cancer ', ' oncology ', ' cancer prevention ', ' Rivers ', ' Nature ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Cellular biology ', ' cell biology ', ' college ', ' collegiate ', ' Training and Education ', ' Education and Training ', ' experience ', ' Informatics ', ' member ', ' Basic Science ', ' Basic Research ', ' Prevention ', ' cancer genetics ', ' Reporting ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' Quality of Care ', ' QOC ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' cancer education ', ' cancer therapy ', ' anticancer therapy ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Treatment ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Therapy ', ' Cancer Treatment ', ' cancer care ', ' Provider ', ' Institution ', ' Tobacco-Related Carcinoma ', ' tobacco-related cancer ', ' tobacco-induced cancer ', ' Address ', ' Animal Cancer Model ', ' Bioinformatics Shared Resource ', ' Biostatistics Shared Resource ', ' NCI-Designated Cancer Center ', ' Population Sciences ', ' Proteomics Shared Resource ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Resource Sharing ', ' National Cancer Burden ', ' Cancer Burden ', ' Cancer Center ', ' CCSG ', ' Cancer Center Support Grant ', ' Cancer Control Science ', ' Cancer Control ', ' Cancer Detection ', ' Cancer Patient ', ' Catchment Area ', ' Clinical Sciences ', ' Comprehensive Cancer Center ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Epigenetic Mechanism ', ' Epigenetic Change ', ' Epigenetic ', ' Epigenetic Process ', ' Genomics Shared Resource ', ' translation research ', ' Translational Science ', ' Translational Research ', ' underrepresentation of minorities ', ' under-represented minority ', ' under-representation of minorities ', ' Underrepresented Ethnic Minority ', ' Underrepresented Minority ', ' Developmental Therapy ', ' Developmental Therapeutics ', ' Developmental Therapeutics Program ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' health literacy ', ' cancer research ', ' anticancer research ', ' underserved people ', ' under served population ', ' Underserved Population ', ' Outcome ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' disparity in cancer ', ' cancer disparity ', ' therapy development ', ' treatment development ', ' intervention development ', ' develop therapy ', ' new therapeutic target ', ' novel therapy target ', ' novel therapeutic target ', ' novel pharmacotherapy target ', ' novel druggable target ', ' novel drug target ', ' new therapy target ', ' new pharmacotherapy target ', ' new druggable target ', ' new drug target ', ' clinical care ', ' population based ', ' novel anticancer drug ', ' novel cancer drug ', ' novel antineoplastic ', ' novel anticancer agent ', ' novel anti-cancer drug ', ' novel anti-cancer agent ', ' new cancer drug ', ' new antineoplastic ', ' new anticancer drug ', ' new anticancer agent ', ' new anti-cancer agent ', ' ']",NCI,EMORY UNIVERSITY,P30,2017,59999,0.11317963317318364

"Moffitt Cancer Center Support Grant PROJECT SUMMARY The H. Lee Moffitt Cancer Center & Research Institute (MCC) continues its ambitious trajectory of innovative cancer research and translation to benefit the gulf coast region of Florida and beyond. As a free-standing 501(c)3 not-for-profit institution with the sole purpose “to contribute to the prevention and cure of cancer,” all research funding ($71.8M), publications (2,430), and clinical research (>1,600 interventional accruals/ year) are cancer focused. Research and clinical space has expanded dramatically since the last renewal to more than 2 million square feet, and patient clinical volume places MCC among the largest Centers in the United States. MCC has benefitted from recent, ongoing annual state legislature funding of approximately $25 million, in addition to more than $39 million of annual institutional research support. The 142 MCC members span the basic, clinical, and population sciences. They are organized into five highly collaborative, multidisciplinary programs with exceptional levels of intra- (35%) and inter-programmatic (18%) publications. Under the leadership of Dr. Thomas Sellers, the third MCC Director, a Research Strategic Plan (RSP) was developed and implemented for “Moffitt 3.0.” Four of six Associate Center Directors are new; and new leaders have been appointed in every program, with bold goals and specific aims. Two of the 13 shared resources have been significantly restructured (Chemical Biology, Molecular Genomics), and one new resource created (Collaborative Data Services) to better meet the changing needs of MCC scientists. Implementation of the strategic plan has been bolstered by substantial institutional investment, especially in basic science, immunotherapy, and clinical research infrastructure, including the recruitment of 45 new faculty members, of whom 32 are CCSG members. MCC is a leader in immunotherapy, and more than 40% of overall clinical trial accrual is to investigator-initiated studies. MCC population scientists initiated significant new efforts in cancer prevention and outcomes that include vaccines, tobacco cessation, and health disparities. This is particularly true in the unique cancer problems in the catchment area – notably lung cancer, melanoma, and HPV- prevention. MCC's Total Cancer Care protocol, the ground-breaking research strategy to realize the promise of personalized medicine, has continued to thrive, resulting in dramatic utilization of the Tissue Core and the formation of the Oncology Research Information Exchange Network (ORIEN) that now includes eleven cancer centers across the nation, with several more poised to join the consortium this year. MCC requests funding for: five scientific programs, 13 shared resources, two clinical research components, planning and evaluation, administration, leadership, four staff investigators, and developmental funds. CCSG funds are leveraged more than 10-fold with institutional resources to maximize impact on cancer prevention, treatment, and cure in the catchment area, the state of Florida and beyond. PROJECT NARRATIVE The H. Lee Moffitt Cancer Center & Research Institute (MCC) is a free-standing 501(c)3 not-for- profit institution with the sole purpose “to contribute to the prevention and cure of cancer.” By fostering transdisciplinary research, MCC translates unique capabilities in basic, clinical, and population science, as well as training and education, to benefit the patients, caregivers, and professionals through the catchment area, the state of Florida, and beyond.

"Regional Oncology Research Center ABSTRACT The Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center (SKCCC) at Johns Hopkins is dedicated to cancer research, education and training, and care, with an overarching goal of expeditiously and strategically applying new knowledge to improve prevention, screening, detection, diagnosis and treatment of cancer in Maryland and throughout nation and the world. Through targeted outreach and research, cancer outcomes disparities are decreasing in SKCCC's catchment area, but they remain a challenge and a focus at SKCCC. This application requests continued Cancer Center Support Grant (CCSG) funding for SKCCC's Research Programs and Cores. The SKCCC comprises a multidisciplinary, interdepartmental center of The Johns Hopkins University (JHU), encompassing 34 departments in five schools. The scientific Programs of the SKCCC organize and orient the broad base of cancer research throughout JHU into teams focused on rapid translation to the clinic and to populations inside and outside its catchment area. Research conducted at SKCCC includes discovery research into the molecular genetics of human tumorigenesis, clinical trials of new cancer treatments and epidemiologic analyses of lifestyle influences on cancer mortality. The SKCCC is a leading cancer center that is providing insights into the fundamental nature of different cancers and elucidating the thousands of somatic genetic and epigenetic alterations that mark the differences from case to case. This body of work has fueled an emerging understanding that the ultimate control of cancer will require individualizing cancer care using approaches that can be deployed at a population scale. To accomplish this mission, SKCCC took critical input from its External Advisory Board and has strategically evolved since the last CCSG to: 1) augment the clinical and population impact of the discovery pipeline in cancer genetics, epigenetics and immunology generated by discipline-oriented Programs; 2) maximize the translational research output of disease-specific Programs, emphasizing the exploration of new concepts in scientifically driven clinical trials; and 3) position the population-oriented Program to identify, understand and overcome barriers responsible for disparities in cancer outcome in the catchment area. The nine SKCCC Research Programs include four discipline-oriented Programs: Cancer Biology (CB; Baylin, Velculescu), Cancer Immunology (CI; Pardoll, Drake), Cancer Molecular and Functional Imaging (CMFI; Bhujwalla, Pomper), and Cancer Chemical and Structural Biology (CCSB; Berger, Liu); four disease- specific Programs: Hematologic Malignancies and Bone Marrow Transplantation (HMBMT; Ambinder, Jones, Levis), Prostate Cancer (PC; Pienta, Denmeade, Lupold), Breast and Ovarian Cancer (BOC; Stearns, Shih), and Brain Cancer (BC; Grossman, Brem, Laterra); and one population-oriented Program: Cancer Prevention and Control (CPC; Platz, Roden). These Programs are supported by fifteen Cores, one developing Core (described in Developmental Funds) and a dedicated leadership team. PROJECT NARRATIVE (Public Health Relevance Statement) Cancer is a leading cause of death in the U.S. and throughout the world. With the tremendous medical advances over the past 50 years, the U.S. population's life expectancy has dramatically increased, but because the incidence of most cancers increases with age, cancers have become a profound challenge to the U.S. health care system. Minorities suffer a disproportionate burden of the cancer threat with disparate outcomes for many cancer types. To meet these challenges, dedicated cancer research at the SKCCC and elsewhere over the past 35 years has generated fundamental insights into the molecular mechanisms that cause human cancers to arise, progress and threaten life. These discoveries create new opportunities to improve screening, detection, diagnosis, prevention and treatment.",Regional Oncology Research Center,9278329,P30CA006973,"['ages ', ' Age ', ' Aging ', ' Marrow Transplantation ', ' Bone Marrow Transplant ', ' Bone Marrow Grafting ', ' Bone Marrow Transplantation ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Communities ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' Genome ', ' Goals ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' heart disorder ', ' Cardiac Disorders ', ' Cardiac Diseases ', ' Heart Diseases ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Human Genetics ', ' Incidence ', ' Industry ', ' Equipment and supply inventories ', ' Inventory ', ' Leadership ', ' Life Expectancy ', ' Life Style ', ' Lifestyle ', ' Maryland ', ' Mission ', ' mortality ', ' Peer Review ', ' Productivity ', ' Publications ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Schools ', ' Testing ', ' Translating ', ' Translations ', ' Universities ', ' Molecular Genetics ', ' Caring ', ' Immunology ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Brain ', ' Brain Cancer ', ' Malignant neoplasm of brain ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' early cancer detection ', ' Cancer Screening for Patients ', ' Screening for cancer ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' Chemicals ', ' Training ', ' insight ', ' Discipline ', ' Funding ', ' vaccine-based immunotherapy ', ' anticancer immunotherapy ', ' anti-cancer immunotherapy ', ' Immunochemotherapy ', ' Immuno-Chemotherapy ', ' cancer immunotherapy ', ' Oncology Cancer ', ' oncology ', ' cancer prevention ', ' Collaborations ', ' Genetic ', ' cancer cell ', ' Malignant Cell ', ' tool ', ' Nature ', ' Specimen ', ' Research Specimen ', ' Malignant neoplasm of prostate ', ' Prostatic Cancer ', ' Prostate Cancer ', ' Prostate CA ', ' Malignant prostatic tumor ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Prostate ', ' Hematologic Neoplasms ', ' Malignant Hematologic Neoplasm ', ' Hematopoietic Cancer ', ' Hematological Tumor ', ' Hematological Neoplasms ', ' Hematological Malignancies ', ' Hematologic Malignancies ', ' Hematologic Cancer ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' Immune ', ' Immunes ', ' Clinic ', ' Services ', ' Training and Education ', ' Education and Training ', ' structural biology ', ' biomedical scientist ', ' Human Biology ', ' Funding Agency ', ' Funding Source ', ' new technology ', ' novel technologies ', ' Prevention ', ' cancer genetics ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' Intervention Trial ', ' Interventional trial ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' cancer therapy ', ' anticancer therapy ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Treatment ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Therapy ', ' Cancer Treatment ', ' cancer care ', ' Malignant neoplasm of ovary ', ' ovarian cancer ', ' Ovary Cancer ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Ovary ', ' Malignant Ovarian Tumor ', ' Malignant Ovarian Neoplasm ', ' Population Group ', ' tumorigenesis ', ' Oncogenesis ', ' Defect ', ' Detection ', ' Request for Applications ', ' NIH RFA ', ' Resource Sharing ', ' Cancer Biology ', ' National Cancer Burden ', ' Cancer Burden ', ' Cancer Center ', ' CCSG ', ' Cancer Center Support Grant ', ' Cancer Control Science ', ' Cancer Control ', ' Catchment Area ', ' Comprehensive Cancer Center ', ' Epigenetic Mechanism ', ' Epigenetic Change ', ' Epigenetic ', ' Epigenetic Process ', ' physiological imaging ', ' Physiologic Imaging ', ' Functional Imaging ', ' Outreach Research ', ' translation research ', ' Translational Science ', ' Translational Research ', ' trend ', ' cancer immunology ', ' Cancer Immunology Science ', ' Molecular ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' molecule imaging ', ' molecular imaging ', ' Healthcare professional ', ' Health Care Professional ', ' Health Professional ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' Output ', ' cost ', ' cancer research ', ' anticancer research ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' cancer type ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' disparity in cancer ', ' cancer disparity ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' public health relevance ', ' screening ', ' Therapeutic Trials ', ' ']",NCI,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,P30,2017,7060038,0.06487360236209873
"COMPREHENSIVE CANCER CENTER CORE SUPPORT GRANT ﻿PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTACT The UAB CCC is the only NCI designated comprehensive cancer center in the states of Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana and Arkansas, states with higher cancer mortality and significant minority, mostly African American populations. The Cancer Center is in its 44th year of NCI funding and continues its major contributions to translational therapeutics and cancer disparity research with a focus on training minority investigators. The UAB CCC has 242 members who come from 30 departments in 9 UAB schools, Southern Research, and HudsonAlpha Institute for Biotechnology.

Research and clinical space has expanded dramatically since the last renewal to more than 2 million square feet, and patient clinical volume places MCC among the largest Centers in the United States. MCC has benefitted from recent, ongoing annual state legislature funding of approximately $25 million, in addition to more than $39 million of annual institutional research support. The 142 MCC members span the basic, clinical, and population sciences. They are organized into five highly collaborative, multidisciplinary programs with exceptional levels of intra- (35%) and inter-programmatic (18%) publications. Under the leadership of Dr. Thomas Sellers, the third MCC Director, a Research Strategic Plan (RSP) was developed and implemented for “Moffitt 3.0.” Four of six Associate Center Directors are new; and new leaders have been appointed in every program, with bold goals and specific aims. Two of the 13 shared resources have been significantly restructured (Chemical Biology, Molecular Genomics), and one new resource created (Collaborative Data Services) to better meet the changing needs of MCC scientists. Implementation of the strategic plan has been bolstered by substantial institutional investment, especially in basic science, immunotherapy, and clinical research infrastructure, including the recruitment of 45 new faculty members, of whom 32 are CCSG members. MCC is a leader in immunotherapy, and more than 40% of overall clinical trial accrual is to investigator-initiated studies. MCC population scientists initiated significant new efforts in cancer prevention and outcomes that include vaccines, tobacco cessation, and health disparities. This is particularly true in the unique cancer problems in the catchment area – notably lung cancer, melanoma, and HPV- prevention. MCC's Total Cancer Care protocol, the ground-breaking research strategy to realize the promise of personalized medicine, has continued to thrive, resulting in dramatic utilization of the Tissue Core and the formation of the Oncology Research Information Exchange Network (ORIEN) that now includes eleven cancer centers across the nation, with several more poised to join the consortium this year. MCC requests funding for: five scientific programs, 13 shared resources, two clinical research components, planning and evaluation, administration, leadership, four staff investigators, and developmental funds. CCSG funds are leveraged more than 10-fold with institutional resources to maximize impact on cancer prevention, treatment, and cure in the catchment area, the state of Florida and beyond.

"Winship Cancer Institute Cancer Center Support Grant PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The Winship Cancer Institute of Emory University (Winship) is the only NCI-designated cancer center in Georgia, which is now the eighth most populous state and has the largest land area among states east of the Mississippi River. As the main tertiary cancer care and cancer research institution in the state, Winship has committed its four research programs as supported by its six shared resources to address the specific challenges associated with the cancer burden in Georgia. These challenges include: high tobacco usage and incidence of tobacco- related cancers; high proportion of cancer patients who are African American or black and/or have significant cancer disparity issues in their care, prognosis, and/or outcome; and low health literacy levels. Winship's mission is to lessen the burden of cancer for the citizens of Georgia, its primary catchment area. This will be accomplished by: (1) seeking greater insights into the molecular, genetic, and epigenetic basis of cancer; (2) discovering new knowledge that drives improvements in cancer detection, prevention, and/or therapy; (3) developing or defining novel therapeutic targets and/or agents as a pathway to better cancer therapies; and (4) studying and implementing population-based strategies to lessen the cancer burden in the state. The 164 Winship core members are actively engaged in one of four Winship research programs, all of which have a strong emphasis on transdisciplinary research: Cancer Cell Biology, Cancer Genetics and Epigenetics, Cancer Prevention and Control, and Discovery and Developmental Therapeutics. Winship's members are supported by six shared resources: Biostatistics and Bioinformatics Shared Resource, Cancer Animal Models Shared Resource, Cancer Tissue and Pathology Shared Resource, Emory Integrated Genomics Shared Resource, Emory Integrated Proteomics Shared Resource, and the Integrated Imaging Shared Resource; and two developing shared resources: Winship Research Informatics and Intervention Development, Dissemination, and Implementation Developing Shared Resources. Winship members are currently supported by $84.8M in total research funding (as of 3/31/2016) awarded via Emory University. Winship members Curran and Bruner serve as PIs on two NCI awards to the NRG Oncology Foundation for a total of $25.6M in support of clinical research infrastructure. Patient enrollment in Winship's interventional and non-interventional trials continues to increase, especially among patients from under-represented minority groups, and these activities have contributed to the FDA- approval of several novel anti-cancer agents during the present funding period. Winship has outstanding institutional commitment, with more than $200 million in institutional support committed over the next five years, a level almost twice that committed in 2011. Winship enjoys the same reporting line and organizational position as Emory's schools of medicine, public health, and nursing.

"Winship Cancer Institute Cancer Center Support Grant PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The Winship Cancer Institute of Emory University (Winship) is the only NCI-designated cancer center in Georgia, which is now the eighth most populous state and has the largest land area among states east of the Mississippi River. As the main tertiary cancer care and cancer research institution in the state, Winship has committed its four research programs as supported by its six shared resources to address the specific challenges associated with the cancer burden in Georgia. These challenges include: high tobacco usage and incidence of tobacco- related cancers; high proportion of cancer patients who are African American or black and/or have significant cancer disparity issues in their care, prognosis, and/or outcome; and low health literacy levels. Winship's mission is to lessen the burden of cancer for the citizens of Georgia, its primary catchment area. This will be accomplished by: (1) seeking greater insights into the molecular, genetic, and epigenetic basis of cancer; (2) discovering new knowledge that drives improvements in cancer detection, prevention, and/or therapy; (3) developing or defining novel therapeutic targets and/or agents as a pathway to better cancer therapies; and (4) studying and implementing population-based strategies to lessen the cancer burden in the state. The 164 Winship core members are actively engaged in one of four Winship research programs, all of which have a strong emphasis on transdisciplinary research: Cancer Cell Biology, Cancer Genetics and Epigenetics, Cancer Prevention and Control, and Discovery and Developmental Therapeutics. Winship's members are supported by six shared resources: Biostatistics and Bioinformatics Shared Resource, Cancer Animal Models Shared Resource, Cancer Tissue and Pathology Shared Resource, Emory Integrated Genomics Shared Resource, Emory Integrated Proteomics Shared Resource, and the Integrated Imaging Shared Resource; and two developing shared resources: Winship Research Informatics and Intervention Development, Dissemination, and Implementation Developing Shared Resources. Winship members are currently supported by $84.8M in total research funding (as of 3/31/2016) awarded via Emory University. Winship members Curran and Bruner serve as PIs on two NCI awards to the NRG Oncology Foundation for a total of $25.6M in support of clinical research infrastructure. Patient enrollment in Winship's interventional and non-interventional trials continues to increase, especially among patients from under-represented minority groups, and these activities have contributed to the FDA- approval of several novel anti-cancer agents during the present funding period. Winship has outstanding institutional commitment, with more than $200 million in institutional support committed over the next five years, a level almost twice that committed in 2011. Winship enjoys the same reporting line and organizational position as Emory's schools of medicine, public health, and nursing.

"University of New Mexico Cancer Center Support Grant ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Cancer Control (CaC) Research Program is a newly restructured transdisciplinary program that serves as the hub for cancer control and population science research within the University of New Mexico Cancer Center (UNMCC) and the State of New Mexico (NM), our catchment area. The Program's overall goal is to reduce cancer incidence, morbidity, and mortality, particularly in the unique multiethnic and underserved populations of NM. Disparities research is a cross-cutting theme that fosters scientific focus and synergy across the research areas. Through vigorous strategic program planning and evaluation, recruitment of 9 new investigators to enhance expertise in molecular epidemiology and behavioral/community intervention, and guidance of the UNMCC External Advisory Committee, the CaC Program is now focused on three areas of cancer research: 1) Risk Prediction and Risk Reduction; 2) Screening; and 3) Post-Diagnosis Outcomes and Survivorship. Unique scientific strengths include research addressing disparities (geographic, race/ethnic, socioeconomic, medically underserved), particularly in etiologic, outcome, and intervention studies in Hispanics. By drawing on established and new partnerships, the Program is also building research that addresses American Indian cancer disparities and priorities identified by NM Tribes, Pueblos, and Indian Nations. Major scientific accomplishments in Risk Prediction and Risk Reduction include the identification of social, lifestyle, and genetic factors associated with lung cancer risk; gene-environment interactions in melanoma risk; and development and dissemination of a novel telehealth strategy for the prevention of hepatocellular cancer. In Screening, members have developed a statewide surveillance program of screening and diagnosis for cervical pre-cancer and cancer that informs real- world cervical cancer prevention through human papilloma virus (HPV) vaccination, screening practice and outcomes. Members have also identified barriers to use of early detection tests in colorectal cancer and have developed strategies to overcome these barriers to improve screening in underserved populations. In Post- Diagnosis Outcomes and Survivorship, members have identified factors that contribute to disparities in post- treatment outcomes and survivorship in endometrial and breast cancer and are developing interventions. Led by Linda Cook, Ph.D. and Anita Kinney, Ph.D., RN, the CaC Program is comprised of 28 members (19 full and 9 associate) from 7 UNM schools and departments, the Lovelace Respiratory Institute, and the Indian Health Service Unit of the Centers for Disease Control whose work is supported by $19,276,863 million in annual direct cost funding, of which $15,429,911 million is peer-reviewed and $3,137,820 million is from NCI as of 9/1/2014.

"University of Kentucky Markey Cancer Center - Cancer Center Support Grant PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  The Markey Cancer Center (MCC) was established more than 35 years ago as a university-based matrix cancer center at the University of Kentucky (UK), Kentucky's flagship institution of higher education. MCC is the only National Cancer Institute (NCI)-designated Cancer Center in Kentucky, a state of 4.4 million that leads the nation for all-site cancer incidence and mortality and serves as the MCC's catchment area. Over $347M in state, institutional, and philanthropic investment since recruitment of MCC Director Dr. B. Mark Evers (CS) in 2009 have supported significant research and resource expansion, enabling substantial new faculty recruitment, program development, renovation of clinical and shared resource space, and new state-of-the art instrumentation, as well as statewide education and community outreach efforts. The 119 MCC members draw from 28 departments in 8 UK colleges, with 28 new faculty recruited since 2013. Cancer-relevant research funding to MCC investigators exceeds $38.7M in total annual costs, an increase of $10.3M since 2012. Over the last 4 years, 9,357 subjects have been accrued to interventional trials. Members have published 851 cancer-focused publications since 2013, reflecting 28% intra-programmatic, 16% inter-programmatic, and 58% inter-institutional collaborations. Research is conducted within 4 MCC Research Programs: Cancer Cell Biology and Signaling; Cancer Prevention and Control; Drug Discovery, Delivery and Translational Therapeutics; and Genomic Instability, Epigenetics and Metabolism. Five Shared Resource Facilities (SRFs) facilitate cutting-edge research by providing robust infrastructure for specialized expertise and advanced methods: Biospecimen Procurement and Translational Pathology; Biostatistics and Bioinformatics; Cancer Research Informatics; Flow Cytometry and Cell Sorting; and Redox Metabolism. Two new SRFs (Behavioral and Community-Based Research and Oncogenomics) are in development. Significant achievements include: development of an NCI-sponsored early therapeutics program, including an active Molecular Tumor Board and Precision Medicine Center; expansion of the MCC Network from 8 to 24 sites; establishment of a regional Metabolomics Center (U24); award of 2 new cancer-related centers – a Center of Biomedical Research Excellence (COBRE) in Cancer and Metabolism and a Center for Appalachian Research in Environmental Sciences; and expansion of community outreach/education initiatives across the state. MCC research focuses on Kentucky's most serious cancer burdens with emphasis on the “distressed” Appalachian Kentucky region, where cancer incidence and mortality rates surpass those for the entire state. The MCC brings unique basic, clinical, and population research strengths to this mission. These strengths are integral to all MCC programs and collectively provide robust capacity to deliver transformative interventional research to an important underserved priority population, thereby contributing to national efforts to conquer cancer through discovery and clinical translation, cancer prevention, and community outreach. PROJECT NARRATIVE  The Markey Cancer Center, the only NCI-designated Cancer Center serving 4.4 million Kentuckians in its statewide catchment area, has the institutional authority for all cancer-relevant activities at the University of Kentucky (UK) and within the UK HealthCare enterprise. The center's mission is to reduce cancer incidence and mortality through an integrated, comprehensive program of cancer research, treatment, education, prevention and community engagement. Thus, the Markey Cancer Center delivers in-depth and impactful research programs in basic, translational, and population science, including the development of clinical trials to address Kentucky's unique cancer burden and to accelerate “bench-to-bedside” translational outcomes that will reduce serious health disparities and significantly impact patients, the state and the nation.",University of

"COMPREHENSIVE CANCER CENTER CORE SUPPORT GRANT ﻿PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTACT The UAB CCC is the only NCI designated comprehensive cancer center in the states of Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana and Arkansas, states with higher cancer mortality and significant minority, mostly African American populations. The Cancer Center is in its 44th year of NCI funding and continues its major contributions to translational therapeutics and cancer disparity research with a focus on training minority investigators. The UAB CCC has 242 members who come from 30 departments in 9 UAB schools, Southern Research, and HudsonAlpha Institute for Biotechnology. The members are supported by $92,055,777 in annual direct extramural funding. The UAB CCC is organized into six research programs, two each in basic, translational, and prevention and control – Inflammation, Immunology & Immunotherapeutics; Cancer Cell Biology; Experimental Therapeutics; Neuro-Oncology; Cancer Chemoprevention; and Cancer Control & Population Sciences. Members published 1,684 cancer focused, peer reviewed publications between 2011 and 2015 of which 24% were intra-programmatic, 16% inter-programmatic, and 53% inter-institutional. These members are supported by eleven shared facilities – Biostatistics & Bioinformatics, Comprehensive Genomics, High Resolution Imaging, Human Imaging, Mass Spectrometry/2D Proteomics, Microbiome/Gnotobiotic, Preclinical Imaging, Recruitment & Retention, Structural Biology, Tissue Procurement, and Transgenic Animals as well as the developing Pharmacometrics Shared Facility. We have established a Phase I Clinical Trials Program, opened an Advanced Imaging Facility, advanced targets through the Alabama Drug Discovery Alliance, created the UAB Health System Cancer Community Network, and are now a consortium with HudsonAlpha Institute for Biotechnology. In addition to these achievements, we have created an Institute for Cancer Outcomes and Survivorship, and established a critical mass of investigators in energy balance and cancer. We have also expanded our minority training programs that since 2005 have trained 59 scholars resulting in 306 publications, 67 grant submissions with 30 funded, and have had a major impact at Morehouse School of Medicine and Tuskegee University. We have recruited 47 investigators to multiple programs in the Cancer Center since 2010. Strategic plans developed in 2011 with crosscutting themes of Translational Therapeutics, Systems Biomedicine, and Energetics and Cancer continue to be highly relevant today. For the future, we will continue to emphasize translational and cancer disparity research with an emphasis on personalized/genomic medicine, energy balance and cancer, outcomes and survivorship, and early phase clinical trials. OVERALL COMPONENT PROJECT NARRATIVE The UAB CCC has made a significant contribution to public health that is particularly relevant to the populations served by this Cancer Center who are located in the heart of the Deep South. Our research programs, in addition to their important contributions to translational science, have focused on the unique problems seen in African American populations that include higher incidences and mortality rates from certain cancers, lower age appropriate screening rates, greater obesity from poor diets and less physical activity, greater tobacco use, and lack of access to

"University of Arizona Cancer Center - Cancer Center Support Grant Project Summary / Abstract: Overall The University of Arizona Cancer Center (UACC) in Tucson, Arizona has been an NCI-designated Cancer Center since 1978 and a Comprehensive Cancer Center since 1990. It was founded as a matrix center within the University of Arizona (UA), and its members represent 43 Colleges and 11 Departments. In 2014, the UACC was elevated to a status equivalent to that of a College, reporting directly to the Senior Vice President of Health Sciences. At this time, Andrew S. Kraft, MD, was appointed Director of the UACC. With authority for all cancer-related activities at the UA, he is spearheading the utilization of the significant Institutional support to enhance the Program. This includes the recently completed $100M 220,000 square foot outpatient clinic in Phoenix, which will greatly enhance translational research, an expansion of basic research space with occupancy of 20,000 square feet within two years, and an Institutional Commitment of $232M dollars over the next five years. The functionality of the Center has been enhanced by optimization of the Administration and Senior Leadership infrastructure. The UACC Strategic Plan for 2015–2020 calls for the continuation of the highly innovative and impactful team science based on four robust cornerstone Programs: Cancer Biology, Cancer Imaging, Therapeutic Development, and Cancer Prevention and Control. Strategic recruitment and pilot funding is focused on team building, including development of inter-programmatic collaborations and movement of research into the clinic. The UACC will continue to invest in its eight integrated Shared Resources that enhance the capabilities of UACC investigators in basic, prevention, translational, and clinical research, and another in development. The Clinical Trials Office has been strengthened, and investments supporting precision medicine initiatives are ongoing. The UACC is the only major academic Cancer Center in a 400 square mile area of driving distance and is committed to serving the residents in this region and its direct catchment area of southern Arizona. Thus, it has a focus on skin cancer and arsenic exposure as well as the needs of Hispanics, Native Americans, the elderly, and the economically disadvantaged. It has established a robust infrastructure of international, national, and regional collaborations and outreach programs together with research spanning epidemiology, genetics, epigenetics, cell biology, and signaling mechanisms, as well as targeted interventions and understudied survivorship issues. To capture the emerging synergies, the positions of Associate Director of Cancer Disparities and Associate Director of Precision Medicine and Bioinformatics have been created and filled by nationally recognized experts. The UACC emphasis on inclusive training of the next generation of cancer researchers has had demonstrable success in graduation of Native American and Latinos. The research generated by UACC members is characterized by its impact, its relevance to the catchment area, and its innovation. The Strategic Plan builds on the work that has resulted in 1,756 cancer- related publications in the reporting period and its current portfolio of $44M in peer-reviewed support.

"Cancer Center Support Grant Project Summary Over the past 5 years, the Wake Forest Baptist Comprehensive Cancer Center (WFBCCC) has continued its upward trajectory in cancer research excellence and service to its catchment area. The WFBCCC catchment area includes the Piedmont and southern Appalachia, a region of 58 contiguous counties in North Carolina, Virginia, West Virginia and Tennessee. The majority of this region is rural and exhibits significant racial health disparities. Elevated age-adjusted smoking rates, obesity rates, cancer incidence, and cancer mortality are observed across the WFBCCC catchment area when compared with the rest of the U.S. To target these issues, the WFBCCC conducts cutting-edge basic, clinical, and population research on the prevention, detection and treatment of cancer, and translates this knowledge into strategies to improve patient outcomes and reduce the incidence of cancer. WFBCCC cancer research funding is $37.9 million, of which over $14.9 million comes from the NCI; this represents a 25.3% increase in total cancer funding since the last CCSG renewal. Center research space under the Director’s authority increased by approximately 65,000 square feet, and the WFBCCC clinical facilities have been dramatically enhanced with the completion of the new eleven- story Cancer Hospital in 2013. This building houses all oncology inpatients and outpatients. The Center’s 127 members span the basic, clinical and population sciences and are organized into 4 Programs with substantial inter-and intra-programmatic productivity. Faculty additions enhanced tobacco control, tobacco-related cancer research, and precision medicine. Substantial investment in faculty, technology, and informatics significantly expanded cancer genomics capabilities. Enrollment of patients into treatment trials reached an all-time high in 2015, with a large increase in the number of patients enrolled in investigator-initiated trials. WFBCCC population scientists initiated exciting new efforts in cancer prevention and survivorship. Clinical scientists completed practice-changing studies in patients with glioma and lung cancer. Groundbreaking observations in prostate cancer emerged from WFBCCC inter-programmatic collaborations. WFBCCC basic science Programs continued to make high impact observations that are being translated into human therapeutics. The WFBCCC requests continued CCSG funding for 4 scientific Programs; 7 Shared Resources; 2 clinical research components; administration and leadership; planning and evaluation; and developmental funds. With these funds, a talented faculty integrated throughout the Cancer Center will make advances in the prevention, early detection, and treatment of cancer in the WFBCCC catchment area and the nation. Project Narrative The Wake Forest Baptist Comprehensive Cancer Center (WFBCCC) is a matrix Cancer Center, which serves the people of the multistate Piedmont and southern Appalachian region. The WFBCCC is the hub for clinical, basic, and population researchers focused on the prevention and early detection of cancer, developing novel cancer therapy, and improving the health of cancer survivors. WFBCCC is integral to the research mission of the Wake Forest Baptist Medical Center (WFBMC) in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, and is one of its largest research components. The WFBCCC unites the cancer research capabilities of multiple institutional units including the WFBMC, Wake Forest University and the Virginia Tech-Wake Forest University School of Biomedical Engineering and Sciences.

"Regional Oncology Research Center ABSTRACT The Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center (SKCCC) at Johns Hopkins is dedicated to cancer research, education and training, and care, with an overarching goal of expeditiously and strategically applying new knowledge to improve prevention, screening, detection, diagnosis and treatment of cancer in Maryland and throughout nation and the world. Through targeted outreach and research, cancer outcomes disparities are decreasing in SKCCC's catchment area, but they remain a challenge and a focus at SKCCC. This application requests continued Cancer Center Support Grant (CCSG) funding for SKCCC's Research Programs and Cores. The SKCCC comprises a multidisciplinary, interdepartmental center of The Johns Hopkins University (JHU), encompassing 34 departments in five schools. The scientific Programs of the SKCCC organize and orient the broad base of cancer research throughout JHU into teams focused on rapid translation to the clinic and to populations inside and outside its catchment area. Research conducted at SKCCC includes discovery research into the molecular genetics of human tumorigenesis, clinical trials of new cancer treatments and epidemiologic analyses of lifestyle influences on cancer mortality. The SKCCC is a leading cancer center that is providing insights into the fundamental nature of different cancers and elucidating the thousands of somatic genetic and epigenetic alterations that mark the differences from case to case. This body of work has fueled an emerging understanding that the ultimate control of cancer will require individualizing cancer care using approaches that can be deployed at a population scale. To accomplish this mission, SKCCC took critical input from its External Advisory Board and has strategically evolved since the last CCSG to: 1) augment the clinical and population impact of the discovery pipeline in cancer genetics, epigenetics and immunology generated by discipline-oriented Programs; 2) maximize the translational research output of disease-specific Programs, emphasizing the exploration of new concepts in scientifically driven clinical trials; and 3) position the population-oriented Program to identify, understand and overcome barriers responsible for disparities in cancer outcome in the catchment area. The nine SKCCC Research Programs include four discipline-oriented Programs: Cancer Biology (CB; Baylin, Velculescu), Cancer Immunology (CI; Pardoll, Drake), Cancer Molecular and Functional Imaging (CMFI; Bhujwalla, Pomper), and Cancer Chemical and Structural Biology (CCSB; Berger, Liu); four disease- specific Programs: Hematologic Malignancies and Bone Marrow Transplantation (HMBMT; Ambinder, Jones, Levis), Prostate Cancer (PC; Pienta, Denmeade, Lupold), Breast and Ovarian Cancer (BOC; Stearns, Shih), and Brain Cancer (BC; Grossman, Brem, Laterra); and one population-oriented Program: Cancer Prevention and Control (CPC; Platz, Roden).

Under the leadership of Robert Mannel, MD, who was appointed Director in 2006, the SCC has secured institutional and other commitments totaling $383.7 million of state, university and philanthropic dollars over the past ten years, which have been used to recruit new cancer researchers and oncology physicians, add new physical space, and develop formal research programs and new shared resources. The level of support for the SCC constitutes the largest public – private biomedical initiative ever launched in the State and has resulted in an academic cancer center that has achieved the following benchmarks during the reporting period (CY2016):   $18,371,115 in overall funding base (peer-reviewed, cancer-relevant) (direct costs).   $8,981,794 in NCI research and training funding (direct costs).   $34,234,985 in total funding (direct costs).   96 full and associate members, representing 32 different academic departments.   278,609 sf. of total physical space (research, clinical, administrative).   $33.1 million in annual discretionary funds under the control of the SCC Director.   2,727 newly diagnosed and treated patients, with 612 enrollments on interventional treatment trials. The SCC has developed an organizational structure and environment designed to promote transdisciplinary, team-based science, move ideas along the translational continuum and stimulate research that impacts the SCC catchment area. This structure includes three formal research programs: Preclinical Translational Cancer Research (PTCR), Gynecologic Cancers (GC) and Cancer Prevention and Control (CPC). SCC member research is supported by four formal shared resource facilities: Biostatistics and Research Design, Molecular Biology and Cytometry Research, Tissue Pathology and Mobile Health Technology. Centralized Clinical Protocol and Data Management, Data and Safety Monitoring, and Protocol Review and Monitoring functions oversee and support the SCC's robust clinical trials program. OVERALL – PROJECT NARRATIVE Oklahoma currently ranks 7th highest among all states for cancer mortality rates, and 2nd in cancer incidence and mortality rates among the 15 states currently without an NCI-designated cancer center. To address this cancer burden, the Stephenson Cancer Center serves as a major source of discovery into the nature of cancer and of the development of more effective approaches to cancer prevention, diagnosis and therapy for the benefit of patients in Oklahoma and the nation.",Stephenson Cancer Center - Cancer Center Support Grant,9771650,P30CA225520,"['American Indians ', ' American Indian ', ' Biometry ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Biometrics ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Clinical Protocols ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Environment ', ' Environment Design ', ' Foundations ', ' Goals ', ' Incidence ', ' Leadership ', ' Statutes and Laws ', ' Legislation ', ' Mission ', ' Molecular Biology ', ' DNA Molecular Biology ', ' mortality ', ' Oklahoma ', ' Pathology ', ' Patients ', ' Peer Review ', ' Physicians ', ' Privatization ', ' Research ', ' Research Design ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Safety ', ' Science ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Universities ', ' Medical Research ', ' base ', ' career ', ' Clinical ', ' Training ', ' Rural ', ' Funding ', ' Oncology Cancer ', ' oncology ', ' cancer prevention ', ' Nature ', ' programs ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' Source ', ' Benchmarking ', ' Best Practice Analysis ', ' Services ', ' data management ', ' Structure ', ' member ', ' organizational structure ', ' Organization Charts ', ' Prevention ', ' Malignant Female Reproductive System Neoplasm ', ' gynecological malignancy ', ' gynecologic malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Female Reproductive System ', ' Malignant Gynecologic Tumor ', ' Malignant Gynecologic Neoplasm ', ' Gynecological Cancer ', ' Gynecologic Cancer ', ' Female Reproductive Cancer ', ' Reporting ', ' Health Technology ', ' Health Care Technology ', ' Cytometry ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' cancer education ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Direct Costs ', ' cancer research center director ', ' Cancer Center Director ', ' NCI-Designated Cancer Center ', ' Research Training ', ' Resource Sharing ', ' National Cancer Burden ', ' Cancer Burden ', ' Cancer Center ', ' CCSG ', ' Cancer Center Support Grant ', ' Cancer Control Science ', ' Cancer Control ', ' Catchment Area ', ' Clinical Data ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Newly Diagnosed ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Monitor ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Healthcare professional ', ' Health Care Professional ', ' Health Professional ', ' preclinical ', ' pre-clinical ', ' treatment trial ', ' next generation ', ' Population ', ' disparity in cancer ', ' cancer disparity ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' high standard ', ' standard of care ', ' Secure ', ' mobile health ', ' m-Health ', ' mHealth ', ' translational cancer research ', ' recruit ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF OKLAHOMA HLTH SCIENCES CTR,P30,2018,299724,0.17875760582560432

"Cancer Center Support Grant Project Summary Over the past 5 years, the Wake Forest Baptist Comprehensive Cancer Center (WFBCCC) has continued its upward trajectory in cancer research excellence and service to its catchment area. The WFBCCC catchment area includes the Piedmont and southern Appalachia, a region of 58 contiguous counties in North Carolina, Virginia, West Virginia and Tennessee. The majority of this region is rural and exhibits significant racial health disparities. Elevated age-adjusted smoking rates, obesity rates, cancer incidence, and cancer mortality are observed across the WFBCCC catchment area when compared with the rest of the U.S. To target these issues, the WFBCCC conducts cutting-edge basic, clinical, and population research on the prevention, detection and treatment of cancer, and translates this knowledge into strategies to improve patient outcomes and reduce the incidence of cancer. WFBCCC cancer research funding is $37.9 million, of which over $14.9 million comes from the NCI; this represents a 25.3% increase in total cancer funding since the last CCSG renewal. Center research space under the Director’s authority increased by approximately 65,000 square feet, and the WFBCCC clinical facilities have been dramatically enhanced with the completion of the new eleven- story Cancer Hospital in 2013. This building houses all oncology inpatients and outpatients. The Center’s 127 members span the basic, clinical and population sciences and are organized into 4 Programs with substantial inter-and intra-programmatic productivity. Faculty additions enhanced tobacco control, tobacco-related cancer research, and precision medicine. Substantial investment in faculty, technology, and informatics significantly expanded cancer genomics capabilities. Enrollment of patients into treatment trials reached an all-time high in 2015, with a large increase in the number of patients enrolled in investigator-initiated trials. WFBCCC population scientists initiated exciting new efforts in cancer prevention and survivorship. Clinical scientists completed practice-changing studies in patients with glioma and lung cancer. Groundbreaking observations in prostate cancer emerged from WFBCCC inter-programmatic collaborations. WFBCCC basic science Programs continued to make high impact observations that are being translated into human therapeutics. The WFBCCC requests continued CCSG funding for 4 scientific Programs; 7 Shared Resources; 2 clinical research components; administration and leadership; planning and evaluation; and developmental funds. With these funds, a talented faculty integrated throughout the Cancer Center will make advances in the prevention, early detection, and treatment of cancer in the WFBCCC catchment area and the nation. Project Narrative The Wake Forest Baptist Comprehensive Cancer Center (WFBCCC) is a matrix Cancer Center, which serves the people of the multistate Piedmont and southern Appalachian region.

"University of Kentucky Markey Cancer Center - Cancer Center Support Grant PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  The Markey Cancer Center (MCC) was established more than 35 years ago as a university-based matrix cancer center at the University of Kentucky (UK), Kentucky's flagship institution of higher education. MCC is the only National Cancer Institute (NCI)-designated Cancer Center in Kentucky, a state of 4.4 million that leads the nation for all-site cancer incidence and mortality and serves as the MCC's catchment area. Over $347M in state, institutional, and philanthropic investment since recruitment of MCC Director Dr. B. Mark Evers (CS) in 2009 have supported significant research and resource expansion, enabling substantial new faculty recruitment, program development, renovation of clinical and shared resource space, and new state-of-the art instrumentation, as well as statewide education and community outreach efforts. The 119 MCC members draw from 28 departments in 8 UK colleges, with 28 new faculty recruited since 2013. Cancer-relevant research funding to MCC investigators exceeds $38.7M in total annual costs, an increase of $10.3M since 2012. Over the last 4 years, 9,357 subjects have been accrued to interventional trials. Members have published 851 cancer-focused publications since 2013, reflecting 28% intra-programmatic, 16% inter-programmatic, and 58% inter-institutional collaborations. Research is conducted within 4 MCC Research Programs: Cancer Cell Biology and Signaling; Cancer Prevention and Control; Drug Discovery, Delivery and Translational Therapeutics; and Genomic Instability, Epigenetics and Metabolism. Five Shared Resource Facilities (SRFs) facilitate cutting-edge research by providing robust infrastructure for specialized expertise and advanced methods: Biospecimen Procurement and Translational Pathology; Biostatistics and Bioinformatics; Cancer Research Informatics; Flow Cytometry and Cell Sorting; and Redox Metabolism. Two new SRFs (Behavioral and Community-Based Research and Oncogenomics) are in development. Significant achievements include: development of an NCI-sponsored early therapeutics program, including an active Molecular Tumor Board and Precision Medicine Center; expansion of the MCC Network from 8 to 24 sites; establishment of a regional Metabolomics Center (U24); award of 2 new cancer-related centers – a Center of Biomedical Research Excellence (COBRE) in Cancer and Metabolism and a Center for Appalachian Research in Environmental Sciences; and expansion of community outreach/education initiatives across the state. MCC research focuses on Kentucky's most serious cancer burdens with emphasis on the “distressed” Appalachian Kentucky region, where cancer incidence and mortality rates surpass those for the entire state. The MCC brings unique basic, clinical, and population research strengths to this mission. These strengths are integral to all MCC programs and collectively provide robust capacity to deliver transformative interventional research to an important underserved priority population, thereby contributing to national efforts to conquer cancer through discovery and clinical translation, cancer prevention, and community outreach. PROJECT NARRATIVE  The Markey Cancer Center, the only NCI-designated Cancer Center serving 4.4 million Kentuckians in its statewide catchment area, has the institutional authority for all cancer-relevant activities at the University of Kentucky (UK) and within the UK HealthCare enterprise. The center's mission is to reduce cancer incidence and mortality through an integrated, comprehensive program of cancer research, treatment, education, prevention and community engagement. Thus, the Markey Cancer Center delivers in-depth and impactful research programs in basic, translational, and population science, including the development of clinical trials to address Kentucky's unique cancer burden and to accelerate “bench-to-bedside” translational outcomes that will reduce serious health disparities and significantly impact patients, the state and the nation.",University of

In addition to these achievements, we have created an Institute for Cancer Outcomes and Survivorship, and established a critical mass of investigators in energy balance and cancer. We have also expanded our minority training programs that since 2005 have trained 59 scholars resulting in 306 publications, 67 grant submissions with 30 funded, and have had a major impact at Morehouse School of Medicine and Tuskegee University. We have recruited 47 investigators to multiple programs in the Cancer Center since 2010. Strategic plans developed in 2011 with crosscutting themes of Translational Therapeutics, Systems Biomedicine, and Energetics and Cancer continue to be highly relevant today. For the future, we will continue to emphasize translational and cancer disparity research with an emphasis on personalized/genomic medicine, energy balance and cancer, outcomes and survivorship, and early phase clinical trials. OVERALL COMPONENT PROJECT NARRATIVE The UAB CCC has made a significant contribution to public health that is particularly relevant to the populations served by this Cancer Center who are located in the heart of the Deep South. Our research programs, in addition to their important contributions to translational science, have focused on the unique problems seen in African American populations that include higher incidences and mortality rates from certain cancers, lower age appropriate screening rates, greater obesity from poor diets and less physical activity, greater tobacco use, and lack of access to

"University of Kentucky Markey Cancer Center - Cancer Center Support Grant PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  The Markey Cancer Center (MCC) was established more than 35 years ago as a university-based matrix cancer center at the University of Kentucky (UK), Kentucky's flagship institution of higher education. MCC is the only National Cancer Institute (NCI)-designated Cancer Center in Kentucky, a state of 4.4 million that leads the nation for all-site cancer incidence and mortality and serves as the MCC's catchment area. Over $347M in state, institutional, and philanthropic investment since recruitment of MCC Director Dr. B. Mark Evers (CS) in 2009 have supported significant research and resource expansion, enabling substantial new faculty recruitment, program development, renovation of clinical and shared resource space, and new state-of-the art instrumentation, as well as statewide education and community outreach efforts. The 119 MCC members draw from 28 departments in 8 UK colleges, with 28 new faculty recruited since 2013. Cancer-relevant research funding to MCC investigators exceeds $38.7M in total annual costs, an increase of $10.3M since 2012. Over the last 4 years, 9,357 subjects have been accrued to interventional trials. Members have published 851 cancer-focused publications since 2013, reflecting 28% intra-programmatic, 16% inter-programmatic, and 58% inter-institutional collaborations. Research is conducted within 4 MCC Research Programs: Cancer Cell Biology and Signaling; Cancer Prevention and Control; Drug Discovery, Delivery and Translational Therapeutics; and Genomic Instability, Epigenetics and Metabolism. Five Shared Resource Facilities (SRFs) facilitate cutting-edge research by providing robust infrastructure for specialized expertise and advanced methods: Biospecimen Procurement and Translational Pathology; Biostatistics and Bioinformatics; Cancer Research Informatics; Flow Cytometry and Cell Sorting; and Redox Metabolism. Two new SRFs (Behavioral and Community-Based Research and Oncogenomics) are in development. Significant achievements include: development of an NCI-sponsored early therapeutics program, including an active Molecular Tumor Board and Precision Medicine Center; expansion of the MCC Network from 8 to 24 sites; establishment of a regional Metabolomics Center (U24); award of 2 new cancer-related centers – a Center of Biomedical Research Excellence (COBRE) in Cancer and Metabolism and a Center for Appalachian Research in Environmental Sciences; and expansion of community outreach/education initiatives across the state. MCC research focuses on Kentucky's most serious cancer burdens with emphasis on the “distressed” Appalachian Kentucky region, where cancer incidence and mortality rates surpass those for the entire state. The MCC brings unique basic, clinical, and population research strengths to this mission. These strengths are integral to all MCC programs and collectively provide robust capacity to deliver transformative interventional research to an important underserved priority population, thereby contributing to national efforts to conquer cancer through discovery and clinical translation, cancer prevention, and community outreach. PROJECT NARRATIVE  The Markey Cancer Center, the only NCI-designated Cancer Center serving 4.4 million Kentuckians in its statewide catchment area, has the institutional authority for all cancer-relevant activities at the University of Kentucky (UK) and within the UK HealthCare enterprise. The center's mission is to reduce cancer incidence and mortality through an integrated, comprehensive program of cancer research, treatment, education, prevention and community engagement. Thus, the Markey Cancer Center delivers in-depth and impactful research programs in basic, translational, and population science, including the development of clinical trials to address Kentucky's unique cancer burden and to accelerate “bench-to-bedside” translational outcomes that will reduce serious health disparities and significantly impact patients, the state and the nation.",University of

"University of New Mexico Cancer Center Support Grant ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Cancer Control (CaC) Research Program is a newly restructured transdisciplinary program that serves as the hub for cancer control and population science research within the University of New Mexico Cancer Center (UNMCC) and the State of New Mexico (NM), our catchment area. The Program's overall goal is to reduce cancer incidence, morbidity, and mortality, particularly in the unique multiethnic and underserved populations of NM. Disparities research is a cross-cutting theme that fosters scientific focus and synergy across the research areas. Through vigorous strategic program planning and evaluation, recruitment of 9 new investigators to enhance expertise in molecular epidemiology and behavioral/community intervention, and guidance of the UNMCC External Advisory Committee, the CaC Program is now focused on three areas of cancer research: 1) Risk Prediction and Risk Reduction; 2) Screening; and 3) Post-Diagnosis Outcomes and Survivorship. Unique scientific strengths include research addressing disparities (geographic, race/ethnic, socioeconomic, medically underserved), particularly in etiologic, outcome, and intervention studies in Hispanics. By drawing on established and new partnerships, the Program is also building research that addresses American Indian cancer disparities and priorities identified by NM Tribes, Pueblos, and Indian Nations. Major scientific accomplishments in Risk Prediction and Risk Reduction include the identification of social, lifestyle, and genetic factors associated with lung cancer risk; gene-environment interactions in melanoma risk; and development and dissemination of a novel telehealth strategy for the prevention of hepatocellular cancer. In Screening, members have developed a statewide surveillance program of screening and diagnosis for cervical pre-cancer and cancer that informs real- world cervical cancer prevention through human papilloma virus (HPV) vaccination, screening practice and outcomes. Members have also identified barriers to use of early detection tests in colorectal cancer and have developed strategies to overcome these barriers to improve screening in underserved populations. In Post- Diagnosis Outcomes and Survivorship, members have identified factors that contribute to disparities in post- treatment outcomes and survivorship in endometrial and breast cancer and are developing interventions. Led by Linda Cook, Ph.D. and Anita Kinney, Ph.D., RN, the CaC Program is comprised of 28 members (19 full and 9 associate) from 7 UNM schools and departments, the Lovelace Respiratory Institute, and the Indian Health Service Unit of the Centers for Disease Control whose work is supported by $19,276,863 million in annual direct cost funding, of which $15,429,911 million is peer-reviewed and $3,137,820 million is from NCI as of 9/1/2014. The discoveries made in this Program have resulted 294 publications, of which 19% are intra-programmatic collaborations and 16% are inter-programmatic collaborations; with a total UNMCC and external collaborative publication level of 30% and 80%, respectively. OVERALL COMPONENT: THE UNIVERSITY OF NEW MEXICO CANCER CENTER PROJECT NARRATIVE Designated as one of the nation's National Cancer Institute Cancer Centers since 2005, the University of New Mexico Cancer Center is a cancer treatment, research, and education and training center that applies the scientific expertise of its investigators to those cancers that have high incidence, mortality, or disparity in the multiethnic and underserved populations of New Mexico. The Center is a hub for promoting discovery through its research, education and training, clinical care, statewide outreach programs and networks for community participatory research. The Center connects scientists, healthcare professionals, and communities to translate its discoveries to cancer clinical trials, and cancer control and behavioral interventions that reduce the cancer burden of New Mexico and serve as a national model. The goal of the Center is to assure that all of the people in New Mexico, its catchment area, have access to high quality cancer care and collaborate in and benefit from advances in cancer

"University of Hawaii Cancer Center CCSG ABSTRACT  The mission of the University of Hawai‘i Cancer Center (UHCC) is to reduce the burden of cancer through research, education, patient care and community outreach with an emphasis on the unique ethnic, cultural and environmental characteristics of Hawai‘i and the Pacific. To accomplish this mission, UHCC is organized into two cancer research programs: Population Sciences in the Pacific (PSP) and Cancer Biology (CB). Programs are each organized with two components spanning the study of basic mechanism and etiologies of cancer to addressing targets and interventions in order to translate discovery to the population it serves. Within its programs, UHCC has a strong foundation of cancer research with over $15 million in peer-reviewed funding, 72.5% of which is from the NCI. PSP has 28 full members and CB has 20 full members who are highly collaborative as evidenced by a high percentage of intra- and inter-programmatic, and inter-institutional, research collaborations and publications. To facilitate successful attainment of research goals, UHCC supports five shared resources: Biostatistics, Genomics and Bioinformatics, Analytical Biochemistry, Nutrition Support, and Metabolomics. UHCC serves a unique ethnically diverse catchment area in Hawai‘i and the Pacific and a unique environment rich in natural resources. This drives UHCC’s focus on ethnic diversity and cancer and research and community engagement directed toward addressing significant cancer health disparities among specific populations, including Native Hawaiians. Research programs, community education, public health and clinical trial interventions are targeted toward cancers of importance in the catchment area and basic investigations include evaluation of compounds from the environment for drug discovery research. A unique, community-network based clinical research enterprise has been established through which UHCC provides access to cancer clinical trials for over 70% of the Hawai‘i population; this is supported in part by a UHCC-led affiliation of three competing health systems as a cooperative venture supporting UHCC. Cancer prevention activities across the Pacific, in collaboration with the University of Guam and others, have had major impact on cancer control and have led to the formation of the UHCC-led Trans-Pacific Partnership for Cancer Prevention. The importance of UHCC in the region is exemplified by its significant impact on cancer control legislation and State cancer policy. The University of Hawai‘i (UH) has made significant investments in UHCC. With the recruitment new Director, UH reaffirmed the Director’s direct authority over faculty appointments and affairs, Center budget and operations, and space allocation in the 187,000 sq. ft. Cancer Center building. The University, Governor and State have provided increased financial support for operations and authorized numerous faculty recruitments to strengthen existing programs and embark on new initiatives informed through the UHCC strategic planning process in support of its mission to reduce the burden of cancer.

"Stephenson Cancer Center - Cancer Center Support Grant OVERALL – ABSTRACT Oklahoma currently ranks 7th highest among all states for cancer mortality rates, and 2nd in cancer incidence and mortality rates among the 15 states currently without an NCI-designated cancer center. To address this cancer burden, the State passed bipartisan-supported legislation in 2001, directing the University of Oklahoma to create an academic cancer center that would provide statewide leadership in cancer education, prevention, treatment and research. Acting on this mandate, the University established the Stephenson Cancer Center (SCC), a matrix-based academic cancer center with a mission of reducing the burden of cancer in Oklahoma, a catchment area underserved by NCI-designated cancer centers. An essential partner in advancing this mission is the Oklahoma Medical Research Foundation (OMRF), the SCC's proposed consortium partner. Under the leadership of Robert Mannel, MD, who was appointed Director in 2006, the SCC has secured institutional and other commitments totaling $383.7 million of state, university and philanthropic dollars over the past ten years, which have been used to recruit new cancer researchers and oncology physicians, add new physical space, and develop formal research programs and new shared resources. The level of support for the SCC constitutes the largest public – private biomedical initiative ever launched in the State and has resulted in an academic cancer center that has achieved the following benchmarks during the reporting period (CY2016):   $18,371,115 in overall funding base (peer-reviewed, cancer-relevant) (direct costs).   $8,981,794 in NCI research and training funding (direct costs).   $34,234,985 in total funding (direct costs).   96 full and associate members, representing 32 different academic departments.   278,609 sf. of total physical space (research, clinical, administrative).   $33.1 million in annual discretionary funds under the control of the SCC Director.   2,727 newly diagnosed and treated patients, with 612 enrollments on interventional treatment trials. The SCC has developed an organizational structure and environment designed to promote transdisciplinary, team-based science, move ideas along the translational continuum and stimulate research that impacts the SCC catchment area. This structure includes three formal research programs: Preclinical Translational Cancer Research (PTCR), Gynecologic Cancers (GC) and Cancer Prevention and Control (CPC). SCC member research is supported by four formal shared resource facilities: Biostatistics and Research Design, Molecular Biology and Cytometry Research, Tissue Pathology and Mobile Health Technology.

"University of New Mexico Cancer Center Support Grant ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Cancer Control (CaC) Research Program is a newly restructured transdisciplinary program that serves as the hub for cancer control and population science research within the University of New Mexico Cancer Center (UNMCC) and the State of New Mexico (NM), our catchment area. The Program's overall goal is to reduce cancer incidence, morbidity, and mortality, particularly in the unique multiethnic and underserved populations of NM. Disparities research is a cross-cutting theme that fosters scientific focus and synergy across the research areas. Through vigorous strategic program planning and evaluation, recruitment of 9 new investigators to enhance expertise in molecular epidemiology and behavioral/community intervention, and guidance of the UNMCC External Advisory Committee, the CaC Program is now focused on three areas of cancer research: 1) Risk Prediction and Risk Reduction; 2) Screening; and 3) Post-Diagnosis Outcomes and Survivorship. Unique scientific strengths include research addressing disparities (geographic, race/ethnic, socioeconomic, medically underserved), particularly in etiologic, outcome, and intervention studies in Hispanics. By drawing on established and new partnerships, the Program is also building research that addresses American Indian cancer disparities and priorities identified by NM Tribes, Pueblos, and Indian Nations. Major scientific accomplishments in Risk Prediction and Risk Reduction include the identification of social, lifestyle, and genetic factors associated with lung cancer risk; gene-environment interactions in melanoma risk; and development and dissemination of a novel telehealth strategy for the prevention of hepatocellular cancer. In Screening, members have developed a statewide surveillance program of screening and diagnosis for cervical pre-cancer and cancer that informs real- world cervical cancer prevention through human papilloma virus (HPV) vaccination, screening practice and outcomes.

"Moffitt Cancer Center Support Grant PROJECT SUMMARY The H. Lee Moffitt Cancer Center & Research Institute (MCC) continues its ambitious trajectory of innovative cancer research and translation to benefit the gulf coast region of Florida and beyond. As a free-standing 501(c)3 not-for-profit institution with the sole purpose “to contribute to the prevention and cure of cancer,” all research funding ($71.8M), publications (2,430), and clinical research (>1,600 interventional accruals/ year) are cancer focused. Research and clinical space has expanded dramatically since the last renewal to more than 2 million square feet, and patient clinical volume places MCC among the largest Centers in the United States. MCC has benefitted from recent, ongoing annual state legislature funding of approximately $25 million, in addition to more than $39 million of annual institutional research support. The 142 MCC members span the basic, clinical, and population sciences. They are organized into five highly collaborative, multidisciplinary programs with exceptional levels of intra- (35%) and inter-programmatic (18%) publications. Under the leadership of Dr. Thomas Sellers, the third MCC Director, a Research Strategic Plan (RSP) was developed and implemented for “Moffitt 3.0.” Four of six Associate Center Directors are new; and new leaders have been appointed in every program, with bold goals and specific aims. Two of the 13 shared resources have been significantly restructured (Chemical Biology, Molecular Genomics), and one new resource created (Collaborative Data Services) to better meet the changing needs of MCC scientists. Implementation of the strategic plan has been bolstered by substantial institutional investment, especially in basic science, immunotherapy, and clinical research infrastructure, including the recruitment of 45 new faculty members, of whom 32 are CCSG members. MCC is a leader in immunotherapy, and more than 40% of overall clinical trial accrual is to investigator-initiated studies. MCC population scientists initiated significant new efforts in cancer prevention and outcomes that include vaccines, tobacco cessation, and health disparities. This is particularly true in the unique cancer problems in the catchment area – notably lung cancer, melanoma, and HPV- prevention. MCC's Total Cancer Care protocol, the ground-breaking research strategy to realize the promise of personalized medicine, has continued to thrive, resulting in dramatic utilization of the Tissue Core and the formation of the Oncology Research Information Exchange Network (ORIEN) that now includes eleven cancer centers across the nation, with several more poised to join the consortium this year. MCC requests funding for: five scientific programs, 13 shared resources, two clinical research components, planning and evaluation, administration, leadership, four staff investigators, and developmental funds. CCSG funds are leveraged more than 10-fold with institutional resources to maximize impact on cancer prevention, treatment, and cure in the catchment area, the state of Florida and beyond.

"University of New Mexico Cancer Center Support Grant ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Cancer Control (CaC) Research Program is a newly restructured transdisciplinary program that serves as the hub for cancer control and population science research within the University of New Mexico Cancer Center (UNMCC) and the State of New Mexico (NM), our catchment area. The Program's overall goal is to reduce cancer incidence, morbidity, and mortality, particularly in the unique multiethnic and underserved populations of NM. Disparities research is a cross-cutting theme that fosters scientific focus and synergy across the research areas. Through vigorous strategic program planning and evaluation, recruitment of 9 new investigators to enhance expertise in molecular epidemiology and behavioral/community intervention, and guidance of the UNMCC External Advisory Committee, the CaC Program is now focused on three areas of cancer research: 1) Risk Prediction and Risk Reduction; 2) Screening; and 3) Post-Diagnosis Outcomes and Survivorship. Unique scientific strengths include research addressing disparities (geographic, race/ethnic, socioeconomic, medically underserved), particularly in etiologic, outcome, and intervention studies in Hispanics. By drawing on established and new partnerships, the Program is also building research that addresses American Indian cancer disparities and priorities identified by NM Tribes, Pueblos, and Indian Nations. Major scientific accomplishments in Risk Prediction and Risk Reduction include the identification of social, lifestyle, and genetic factors associated with lung cancer risk; gene-environment interactions in melanoma risk; and development and dissemination of a novel telehealth strategy for the prevention of hepatocellular cancer. In Screening, members have developed a statewide surveillance program of screening and diagnosis for cervical pre-cancer and cancer that informs real- world cervical cancer prevention through human papilloma virus (HPV) vaccination, screening practice and outcomes. Members have also identified barriers to use of early detection tests in colorectal cancer and have developed strategies to overcome these barriers to improve screening in underserved populations. In Post- Diagnosis Outcomes and Survivorship, members have identified factors that contribute to disparities in post- treatment outcomes and survivorship in endometrial and breast cancer and are developing interventions.

"Winship Cancer Institute Cancer Center Support Grant PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The Winship Cancer Institute of Emory University (Winship) is the only NCI-designated cancer center in Georgia, which is now the eighth most populous state and has the largest land area among states east of the Mississippi River. As the main tertiary cancer care and cancer research institution in the state, Winship has committed its four research programs as supported by its six shared resources to address the specific challenges associated with the cancer burden in Georgia. These challenges include: high tobacco usage and incidence of tobacco- related cancers; high proportion of cancer patients who are African American or black and/or have significant cancer disparity issues in their care, prognosis, and/or outcome; and low health literacy levels. Winship's mission is to lessen the burden of cancer for the citizens of Georgia, its primary catchment area. This will be accomplished by: (1) seeking greater insights into the molecular, genetic, and epigenetic basis of cancer; (2) discovering new knowledge that drives improvements in cancer detection, prevention, and/or therapy; (3) developing or defining novel therapeutic targets and/or agents as a pathway to better cancer therapies; and (4) studying and implementing population-based strategies to lessen the cancer burden in the state. The 164 Winship core members are actively engaged in one of four Winship research programs, all of which have a strong emphasis on transdisciplinary research: Cancer Cell Biology, Cancer Genetics and Epigenetics, Cancer Prevention and Control, and Discovery and Developmental Therapeutics. Winship's members are supported by six shared resources: Biostatistics and Bioinformatics Shared Resource, Cancer Animal Models Shared Resource, Cancer Tissue and Pathology Shared Resource, Emory Integrated Genomics Shared Resource, Emory Integrated Proteomics Shared Resource, and the Integrated Imaging Shared Resource; and two developing shared resources: Winship Research Informatics and Intervention Development, Dissemination, and Implementation Developing Shared Resources. Winship members are currently supported by $84.8M in total research funding (as of 3/31/2016) awarded via Emory University. Winship members Curran and Bruner serve as PIs on two NCI awards to the NRG Oncology Foundation for a total of $25.6M in support of clinical research infrastructure. Patient enrollment in Winship's interventional and non-interventional trials continues to increase, especially among patients from under-represented minority groups, and these activities have contributed to the FDA- approval of several novel anti-cancer agents during the present funding period. Winship has outstanding institutional commitment, with more than $200 million in institutional support committed over the next five years, a level almost twice that committed in 2011. Winship enjoys the same reporting line and organizational position as Emory's schools of medicine, public health, and nursing. Winship is uniquely positioned to apply its scientific strengths, outstanding membership, robust infrastructure, strong institutional support, and comprehensive training programs to fulfill its mission of lessening the burden of cancer on the state of Georgia and beyond. PROJECT NARRATIVE As the first and only NCI-designated cancer center in Georgia, the Winship Cancer Institute of Emory University (Winship) serves the state as its primary tertiary cancer care provider and its primary institution for cancer research, training, and education. Winship is an integral part of Emory University, coordinating the cancer specific research capabilities of the Emory University School of Medicine, Rollins School of Public Health, Nell Hodgson Woodruff School of Nursing, Emory College, and Emory Healthcare.

"COMPREHENSIVE CANCER CENTER CORE SUPPORT GRANT ﻿PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTACT The UAB CCC is the only NCI designated comprehensive cancer center in the states of Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana and Arkansas, states with higher cancer mortality and significant minority, mostly African American populations. The Cancer Center is in its 44th year of NCI funding and continues its major contributions to translational therapeutics and cancer disparity research with a focus on training minority investigators. The UAB CCC has 242 members who come from 30 departments in 9 UAB schools, Southern Research, and HudsonAlpha Institute for Biotechnology. The members are supported by $92,055,777 in annual direct extramural funding. The UAB CCC is organized into six research programs, two each in basic, translational, and prevention and control – Inflammation, Immunology & Immunotherapeutics; Cancer Cell Biology; Experimental Therapeutics; Neuro-Oncology; Cancer Chemoprevention; and Cancer Control & Population Sciences. Members published 1,684 cancer focused, peer reviewed publications between 2011 and 2015 of which 24% were intra-programmatic, 16% inter-programmatic, and 53% inter-institutional. These members are supported by eleven shared facilities – Biostatistics & Bioinformatics, Comprehensive Genomics, High Resolution Imaging, Human Imaging, Mass Spectrometry/2D Proteomics, Microbiome/Gnotobiotic, Preclinical Imaging, Recruitment & Retention, Structural Biology, Tissue Procurement, and Transgenic Animals as well as the developing Pharmacometrics Shared Facility. We have established a Phase I Clinical Trials Program, opened an Advanced Imaging Facility, advanced targets through the Alabama Drug Discovery Alliance, created the UAB Health System Cancer Community Network, and are now a consortium with HudsonAlpha Institute for Biotechnology. In addition to these achievements, we have created an Institute for Cancer Outcomes and Survivorship, and established a critical mass of investigators in energy balance and cancer. We have also expanded our minority training programs that since 2005 have trained 59 scholars resulting in 306 publications, 67 grant submissions with 30 funded, and have had a major impact at Morehouse School of Medicine and Tuskegee University. We have recruited 47 investigators to multiple programs in the Cancer Center since 2010. Strategic plans developed in 2011 with crosscutting themes of Translational Therapeutics, Systems Biomedicine, and Energetics and Cancer continue to be highly relevant today. For the future, we will continue to emphasize translational and cancer disparity research with an emphasis on personalized/genomic medicine, energy balance and cancer, outcomes and survivorship, and early phase clinical trials. OVERALL COMPONENT PROJECT NARRATIVE The UAB CCC has made a significant contribution to public health that is particularly relevant to the populations served by this Cancer Center who are located in the heart of the Deep South. Our research programs, in addition to their important contributions to translational science, have focused on the unique problems seen in African American populations that include higher incidences and mortality rates from certain cancers, lower age appropriate screening rates, greater obesity from poor diets and less physical activity, greater tobacco use, and lack of access to

"University of New Mexico Cancer Center Support Grant ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Cancer Control (CaC) Research Program is a newly restructured transdisciplinary program that serves as the hub for cancer control and population science research within the University of New Mexico Cancer Center (UNMCC) and the State of New Mexico (NM), our catchment area. The Program's overall goal is to reduce cancer incidence, morbidity, and mortality, particularly in the unique multiethnic and underserved populations of NM. Disparities research is a cross-cutting theme that fosters scientific focus and synergy across the research areas. Through vigorous strategic program planning and evaluation, recruitment of 9 new investigators to enhance expertise in molecular epidemiology and behavioral/community intervention, and guidance of the UNMCC External Advisory Committee, the CaC Program is now focused on three areas of cancer research: 1) Risk Prediction and Risk Reduction; 2) Screening; and 3) Post-Diagnosis Outcomes and Survivorship. Unique scientific strengths include research addressing disparities (geographic, race/ethnic, socioeconomic, medically underserved), particularly in etiologic, outcome, and intervention studies in Hispanics. By drawing on established and new partnerships, the Program is also building research that addresses American Indian cancer disparities and priorities identified by NM Tribes, Pueblos, and Indian Nations. Major scientific accomplishments in Risk Prediction and Risk Reduction include the identification of social, lifestyle, and genetic factors associated with lung cancer risk; gene-environment interactions in melanoma risk; and development and dissemination of a novel telehealth strategy for the prevention of hepatocellular cancer. In Screening, members have developed a statewide surveillance program of screening and diagnosis for cervical pre-cancer and cancer that informs real- world cervical cancer prevention through human papilloma virus (HPV) vaccination, screening practice and outcomes. Members have also identified barriers to use of early detection tests in colorectal cancer and have developed strategies to overcome these barriers to improve screening in underserved populations. In Post- Diagnosis Outcomes and Survivorship, members have identified factors that contribute to disparities in post- treatment outcomes and survivorship in endometrial and breast cancer and are developing interventions. Led by Linda Cook, Ph.D. and Anita Kinney, Ph.D., RN, the CaC Program is comprised of 28 members (19 full and 9 associate) from 7 UNM schools and departments, the Lovelace Respiratory Institute, and the Indian Health Service Unit of the Centers for Disease Control whose work is supported by $19,276,863 million in annual direct cost funding, of which $15,429,911 million is peer-reviewed and $3,137,820 million is from NCI as of 9/1/2014. The discoveries made in this Program have resulted 294 publications, of which 19% are intra-programmatic collaborations and 16% are inter-programmatic collaborations; with a total UNMCC and external collaborative publication level of 30% and 80%, respectively.             OVERALL COMPONENT: THE UNIVERSITY OF NEW MEXICO CANCER CENTER PROJECT NARRATIVE Designated as one of the nation's National Cancer Institute Cancer Centers since 2005, the University of New Mexico Cancer Center is a cancer treatment, research, and education and training center that applies the scientific expertise of its investigators to those cancers that have high incidence, mortality, or disparity in the multiethnic and underserved populations of New Mexico.

"Moffitt Cancer Center Support Grant PROJECT SUMMARY The H. Lee Moffitt Cancer Center & Research Institute (MCC) continues its ambitious trajectory of innovative cancer research and translation to benefit the gulf coast region of Florida and beyond. As a free-standing 501(c)3 not-for-profit institution with the sole purpose “to contribute to the prevention and cure of cancer,” all research funding ($71.8M), publications (2,430), and clinical research (>1,600 interventional accruals/ year) are cancer focused. Research and clinical space has expanded dramatically since the last renewal to more than 2 million square feet, and patient clinical volume places MCC among the largest Centers in the United States. MCC has benefitted from recent, ongoing annual state legislature funding of approximately $25 million, in addition to more than $39 million of annual institutional research support. The 142 MCC members span the basic, clinical, and population sciences. They are organized into five highly collaborative, multidisciplinary programs with exceptional levels of intra- (35%) and inter-programmatic (18%) publications. Under the leadership of Dr. Thomas Sellers, the third MCC Director, a Research Strategic Plan (RSP) was developed and implemented for “Moffitt 3.0.” Four of six Associate Center Directors are new; and new leaders have been appointed in every program, with bold goals and specific aims. Two of the 13 shared resources have been significantly restructured (Chemical Biology, Molecular Genomics), and one new resource created (Collaborative Data Services) to better meet the changing needs of MCC scientists. Implementation of the strategic plan has been bolstered by substantial institutional investment, especially in basic science, immunotherapy, and clinical research infrastructure, including the recruitment of 45 new faculty members, of whom 32 are CCSG members. MCC is a leader in immunotherapy, and more than 40% of overall clinical trial accrual is to investigator-initiated studies. MCC population scientists initiated significant new efforts in cancer prevention and outcomes that include vaccines, tobacco cessation, and health disparities. This is particularly true in the unique cancer problems in the catchment area – notably lung cancer, melanoma, and HPV- prevention. MCC's Total Cancer Care protocol, the ground-breaking research strategy to realize the promise of personalized medicine, has continued to thrive, resulting in dramatic utilization of the Tissue Core and the formation of the Oncology Research Information Exchange Network (ORIEN) that now includes eleven cancer centers across the nation, with several more poised to join the consortium this year. MCC requests funding for: five scientific programs, 13 shared resources, two clinical research components, planning and evaluation, administration, leadership, four staff investigators, and developmental funds. CCSG funds are leveraged more than 10-fold with institutional resources to maximize impact on cancer prevention, treatment, and cure in the catchment area, the state of Florida and beyond.

Lee Moffitt Cancer Center & Research Institute (MCC) continues its ambitious trajectory of innovative cancer research and translation to benefit the gulf coast region of Florida and beyond. As a free-standing 501(c)3 not-for-profit institution with the sole purpose “to contribute to the prevention and cure of cancer,” all research funding ($71.8M), publications (2,430), and clinical research (>1,600 interventional accruals/ year) are cancer focused. Research and clinical space has expanded dramatically since the last renewal to more than 2 million square feet, and patient clinical volume places MCC among the largest Centers in the United States. MCC has benefitted from recent, ongoing annual state legislature funding of approximately $25 million, in addition to more than $39 million of annual institutional research support. The 142 MCC members span the basic, clinical, and population sciences. They are organized into five highly collaborative, multidisciplinary programs with exceptional levels of intra- (35%) and inter-programmatic (18%) publications. Under the leadership of Dr. Thomas Sellers, the third MCC Director, a Research Strategic Plan (RSP) was developed and implemented for “Moffitt 3.0.” Four of six Associate Center Directors are new; and new leaders have been appointed in every program, with bold goals and specific aims. Two of the 13 shared resources have been significantly restructured (Chemical Biology, Molecular Genomics), and one new resource created (Collaborative Data Services) to better meet the changing needs of MCC scientists. Implementation of the strategic plan has been bolstered by substantial institutional investment, especially in basic science, immunotherapy, and clinical research infrastructure, including the recruitment of 45 new faculty members, of whom 32 are CCSG members. MCC is a leader in immunotherapy, and more than 40% of overall clinical trial accrual is to investigator-initiated studies. MCC population scientists initiated significant new efforts in cancer prevention and outcomes that include vaccines, tobacco cessation, and health disparities. This is particularly true in the unique cancer problems in the catchment area – notably lung cancer, melanoma, and HPV- prevention. MCC's Total Cancer Care protocol, the ground-breaking research strategy to realize the promise of personalized medicine, has continued to thrive, resulting in dramatic utilization of the Tissue Core and the formation of the Oncology Research Information Exchange Network (ORIEN) that now includes eleven cancer centers across the nation, with several more poised to join the consortium this year. MCC requests funding for: five scientific programs, 13 shared resources, two clinical research components, planning and evaluation, administration, leadership, four staff investigators, and developmental funds. CCSG funds are leveraged more than 10-fold with institutional resources to maximize impact on cancer prevention, treatment, and cure in the catchment area, the state of Florida and beyond.

"University of Kentucky Markey Cancer Center - Cancer Center Support Grant PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  The Markey Cancer Center (MCC) was established more than 35 years ago as a university-based matrix cancer center at the University of Kentucky (UK), Kentucky's flagship institution of higher education. MCC is the only National Cancer Institute (NCI)-designated Cancer Center in Kentucky, a state of 4.4 million that leads the nation for all-site cancer incidence and mortality and serves as the MCC's catchment area. Over $347M in state, institutional, and philanthropic investment since recruitment of MCC Director Dr. B. Mark Evers (CS) in 2009 have supported significant research and resource expansion, enabling substantial new faculty recruitment, program development, renovation of clinical and shared resource space, and new state-of-the art instrumentation, as well as statewide education and community outreach efforts. The 119 MCC members draw from 28 departments in 8 UK colleges, with 28 new faculty recruited since 2013. Cancer-relevant research funding to MCC investigators exceeds $38.7M in total annual costs, an increase of $10.3M since 2012. Over the last 4 years, 9,357 subjects have been accrued to interventional trials. Members have published 851 cancer-focused publications since 2013, reflecting 28% intra-programmatic, 16% inter-programmatic, and 58% inter-institutional collaborations. Research is conducted within 4 MCC Research Programs: Cancer Cell Biology and Signaling; Cancer Prevention and Control; Drug Discovery, Delivery and Translational Therapeutics; and Genomic Instability, Epigenetics and Metabolism. Five Shared Resource Facilities (SRFs) facilitate cutting-edge research by providing robust infrastructure for specialized expertise and advanced methods: Biospecimen Procurement and Translational Pathology; Biostatistics and Bioinformatics; Cancer Research Informatics; Flow Cytometry and Cell Sorting; and Redox Metabolism. Two new SRFs (Behavioral and Community-Based Research and Oncogenomics) are in development. Significant achievements include: development of an NCI-sponsored early therapeutics program, including an active Molecular Tumor Board and Precision Medicine Center; expansion of the MCC Network from 8 to 24 sites; establishment of a regional Metabolomics Center (U24); award of 2 new cancer-related centers – a Center of Biomedical Research Excellence (COBRE) in Cancer and Metabolism and a Center for Appalachian Research in Environmental Sciences; and expansion of community outreach/education initiatives across the state. MCC research focuses on Kentucky's most serious cancer burdens with emphasis on the “distressed” Appalachian Kentucky region, where cancer incidence and mortality rates surpass those for the entire state. The MCC brings unique basic, clinical, and population research strengths to this mission. These strengths are integral to all MCC programs and collectively provide robust capacity to deliver transformative interventional research to an important underserved priority population, thereby contributing to national efforts to conquer cancer through discovery and clinical translation, cancer prevention, and community outreach. PROJECT NARRATIVE  The Markey Cancer Center, the only NCI-designated Cancer Center serving 4.4 million Kentuckians in its statewide catchment area, has the institutional authority for all cancer-relevant activities at the University of Kentucky (UK) and within the UK HealthCare enterprise. The center's mission is to reduce cancer incidence and mortality through an integrated, comprehensive program of cancer research, treatment, education, prevention and community engagement. Thus, the Markey Cancer Center delivers in-depth and impactful research programs in basic, translational, and population science, including the development of clinical trials to address Kentucky's unique cancer burden and to accelerate “bench-to-bedside” translational outcomes that will reduce serious health disparities and significantly impact patients, the state and the nation.",University of

"University of New Mexico Cancer Center Support Grant ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Cancer Control (CaC) Research Program is a newly restructured transdisciplinary program that serves as the hub for cancer control and population science research within the University of New Mexico Cancer Center (UNMCC) and the State of New Mexico (NM), our catchment area. The Program's overall goal is to reduce cancer incidence, morbidity, and mortality, particularly in the unique multiethnic and underserved populations of NM. Disparities research is a cross-cutting theme that fosters scientific focus and synergy across the research areas. Through vigorous strategic program planning and evaluation, recruitment of 9 new investigators to enhance expertise in molecular epidemiology and behavioral/community intervention, and guidance of the UNMCC External Advisory Committee, the CaC Program is now focused on three areas of cancer research: 1) Risk Prediction and Risk Reduction; 2) Screening; and 3) Post-Diagnosis Outcomes and Survivorship. Unique scientific strengths include research addressing disparities (geographic, race/ethnic, socioeconomic, medically underserved), particularly in etiologic, outcome, and intervention studies in Hispanics. By drawing on established and new partnerships, the Program is also building research that addresses American Indian cancer disparities and priorities identified by NM Tribes, Pueblos, and Indian Nations. Major scientific accomplishments in Risk Prediction and Risk Reduction include the identification of social, lifestyle, and genetic factors associated with lung cancer risk; gene-environment interactions in melanoma risk; and development and dissemination of a novel telehealth strategy for the prevention of hepatocellular cancer. In Screening, members have developed a statewide surveillance program of screening and diagnosis for cervical pre-cancer and cancer that informs real- world cervical cancer prevention through human papilloma virus (HPV) vaccination, screening practice and outcomes. Members have also identified barriers to use of early detection tests in colorectal cancer and have developed strategies to overcome these barriers to improve screening in underserved populations. In Post- Diagnosis Outcomes and Survivorship, members have identified factors that contribute to disparities in post- treatment outcomes and survivorship in endometrial and breast cancer and are developing interventions. Led by Linda Cook, Ph.D. and Anita Kinney, Ph.D., RN, the CaC Program is comprised of 28 members (19 full and 9 associate) from 7 UNM schools and departments, the Lovelace Respiratory Institute, and the Indian Health Service Unit of the Centers for Disease Control whose work is supported by $19,276,863 million in annual direct cost funding, of which $15,429,911 million is peer-reviewed and $3,137,820 million is from NCI as of 9/1/2014. The discoveries made in this Program have resulted 294 publications, of which 19% are intra-programmatic collaborations and 16% are inter-programmatic collaborations; with a total UNMCC and external collaborative publication level of 30% and 80%, respectively.             OVERALL COMPONENT: THE UNIVERSITY OF NEW MEXICO CANCER CENTER PROJECT NARRATIVE Designated as one of the nation's National Cancer Institute Cancer Centers since 2005, the University of New Mexico Cancer Center is a cancer treatment, research, and education and training center that applies the scientific expertise of its investigators to those cancers that have high incidence, mortality, or disparity in the multiethnic and underserved populations of New Mexico. The Center is a hub for promoting discovery through its research, education and training, clinical care, statewide outreach programs and networks for community participatory research. The Center connects scientists, healthcare professionals, and communities to translate its discoveries to cancer clinical trials, and cancer control and behavioral interventions that reduce the cancer burden of New Mexico and serve as a national model. The goal of the Center is to assure that all of the people in New Mexico, its catchment area, have access to high quality cancer care and collaborate in and benefit from advances in cancer

"Regional Oncology Research Center ABSTRACT The Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center (SKCCC) at Johns Hopkins is dedicated to cancer research, education and training, and care, with an overarching goal of expeditiously and strategically applying new knowledge to improve prevention, screening, detection, diagnosis and treatment of cancer in Maryland and throughout nation and the world. Through targeted outreach and research, cancer outcomes disparities are decreasing in SKCCC's catchment area, but they remain a challenge and a focus at SKCCC. This application requests continued Cancer Center Support Grant (CCSG) funding for SKCCC's Research Programs and Cores. The SKCCC comprises a multidisciplinary, interdepartmental center of The Johns Hopkins University (JHU), encompassing 34 departments in five schools. The scientific Programs of the SKCCC organize and orient the broad base of cancer research throughout JHU into teams focused on rapid translation to the clinic and to populations inside and outside its catchment area. Research conducted at SKCCC includes discovery research into the molecular genetics of human tumorigenesis, clinical trials of new cancer treatments and epidemiologic analyses of lifestyle influences on cancer mortality. The SKCCC is a leading cancer center that is providing insights into the fundamental nature of different cancers and elucidating the thousands of somatic genetic and epigenetic alterations that mark the differences from case to case. This body of work has fueled an emerging understanding that the ultimate control of cancer will require individualizing cancer care using approaches that can be deployed at a population scale. To accomplish this mission, SKCCC took critical input from its External Advisory Board and has strategically evolved since the last CCSG to: 1) augment the clinical and population impact of the discovery pipeline in cancer genetics, epigenetics and immunology generated by discipline-oriented Programs; 2) maximize the translational research output of disease-specific Programs, emphasizing the exploration of new concepts in scientifically driven clinical trials; and 3) position the population-oriented Program to identify, understand and overcome barriers responsible for disparities in cancer outcome in the catchment area. The nine SKCCC Research Programs include four discipline-oriented Programs: Cancer Biology (CB; Baylin, Velculescu), Cancer Immunology (CI; Pardoll, Drake), Cancer Molecular and Functional Imaging (CMFI; Bhujwalla, Pomper), and Cancer Chemical and Structural Biology (CCSB; Berger, Liu); four disease- specific Programs: Hematologic Malignancies and Bone Marrow Transplantation (HMBMT; Ambinder, Jones, Levis), Prostate Cancer (PC; Pienta, Denmeade, Lupold), Breast and Ovarian Cancer (BOC; Stearns, Shih), and Brain Cancer (BC; Grossman, Brem, Laterra); and one population-oriented Program: Cancer Prevention and Control (CPC; Platz, Roden). These Programs are supported by fifteen Cores, one developing Core (described in Developmental Funds) and a dedicated leadership team. PROJECT NARRATIVE (Public Health Relevance Statement) Cancer is a leading cause of death in the U.S. and throughout the world. With the tremendous medical advances over the past 50 years, the U.S. population's life expectancy has dramatically increased, but because the incidence of most cancers increases with age, cancers have become a profound challenge to the U.S. health care system. Minorities suffer a disproportionate burden of the cancer threat with disparate outcomes for many cancer types. To meet these challenges, dedicated cancer research at the SKCCC and elsewhere over the past 35 years has generated fundamental insights into the molecular mechanisms that cause human cancers to arise, progress and threaten life.

"Specialized Cancer Center Support Grant OVERALL ABSTRACT Founded in 1977 by John Mendelsohn, the Cancer Center at University of California San Diego (UCSD) has been continuously funded by the NCI Cancer Center Support Grant (CCSG) since 1978 and has held Comprehensive status since 2001. As the only NCI-designated Comprehensive Cancer Center in San Diego County, the mission of Moores Cancer Center (MCC) is to reduce the impact of cancer in the region and beyond by fostering scientific discovery, research training, and interdisciplinary care. Our goal is to create, translate, and deliver high-impact discoveries and innovations in cancer prevention and care through a deep understanding of the needs of the catchment area, and prepare the next generation of cancer researchers. Accordingly, MCC’s aims are to: 1) Elucidate the biology of cancer and catalyze trans-disciplinary team science across the science spectrum; 2) Develop and test innovative preventive, diagnostic, and therapeutic approaches; 3) Conduct cancer prevention and control research to reduce cancer disparities in vulnerable populations; 4) Provide underrepresented minorities with access to cutting edge multi-disciplinary care; 5) Provide training and education across the trainee continuum; and 6) Develop and implement community-based cancer education and outreach programs. To this end, MCC brings together 232 members from 5 UCSD Schools (Medicine, Engineering, Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Physical Sciences and Biological Sciences) and 2 consortium partners (one existing: San Diego State University, and one new: La Jolla Institute). Furthermore, MCC integrates the resources of UCSD Health Sciences and its affiliated hospitals in the UCSD Health System for a unified approach to cancer research and clinical care. MCC fulfills its mission through the activities of its 5 Research Programs (Cancer Biology and Signaling, Structural and Functional Genomics, Solid Tumor Therapeutics, Hematological Malignancies, and Cancer Control) that are supported by 7 Shared Resources (Flow Cytometry, Microscopy, Transgenic Mouse, Biostatistics, Genomics and Computational Biology, Biorepository and Tissue Technology, and Biobehavioral), and infrastructure provided by Community Outreach, Training and Education, Clinical Protocol and Data Management, and Protocol Review and Monitoring. Under the leadership of Dr. Scott Lippman, Center Director and Associate Vice- Chancellor for Cancer Research and Care, MCC has seen tremendous growth. During the project period, MCC members authored 3931 cancer-relevant research articles, and in 2017 were supported by $128.2 million (DC) in annual cancer-relevant peer-reviewed funding (8% increase); and the total annualized cancer-relevant research base was $148.5M, an increase of 11% from the previous project period by lateral comparison. Collaborative peer-reviewed grant funding also increased from annual total costs of $65.9M in 2013 to $69.9M in 2017 (6% increase). Importantly, 33 of MCC’s scientific discoveries were translated to the clinic through 41 investigator-initiated clinical trials, a 14-fold increase from the previous project period. OVERALL NARRATIVE MCC’s mission is to reduce the impact of cancer to the catchment area and beyond by discovering, translating, and delivering high-impact innovations in interdisciplinary cancer prevention and care, and prepare the next generation of cancer researchers.

Significant achievements include: development of an NCI-sponsored early therapeutics program, including an active Molecular Tumor Board and Precision Medicine Center; expansion of the MCC Network from 8 to 24 sites; establishment of a regional Metabolomics Center (U24); award of 2 new cancer-related centers – a Center of Biomedical Research Excellence (COBRE) in Cancer and Metabolism and a Center for Appalachian Research in Environmental Sciences; and expansion of community outreach/education initiatives across the state. MCC research focuses on Kentucky's most serious cancer burdens with emphasis on the “distressed” Appalachian Kentucky region, where cancer incidence and mortality rates surpass those for the entire state. The MCC brings unique basic, clinical, and population research strengths to this mission. These strengths are integral to all MCC programs and collectively provide robust capacity to deliver transformative interventional research to an important underserved priority population, thereby contributing to national efforts to conquer cancer through discovery and clinical translation, cancer prevention, and community outreach. PROJECT NARRATIVE  The Markey Cancer Center, the only NCI-designated Cancer Center serving 4.4 million Kentuckians in its statewide catchment area, has the institutional authority for all cancer-relevant activities at the University of Kentucky (UK) and within the UK HealthCare enterprise. The center's mission is to reduce cancer incidence and mortality through an integrated, comprehensive program of cancer research, treatment, education, prevention and community engagement.

"Stephenson Cancer Center - Cancer Center Support Grant OVERALL – ABSTRACT Oklahoma currently ranks 7th highest among all states for cancer mortality rates, and 2nd in cancer incidence and mortality rates among the 15 states currently without an NCI-designated cancer center. To address this cancer burden, the State passed bipartisan-supported legislation in 2001, directing the University of Oklahoma to create an academic cancer center that would provide statewide leadership in cancer education, prevention, treatment and research. Acting on this mandate, the University established the Stephenson Cancer Center (SCC), a matrix-based academic cancer center with a mission of reducing the burden of cancer in Oklahoma, a catchment area underserved by NCI-designated cancer centers. An essential partner in advancing this mission is the Oklahoma Medical Research Foundation (OMRF), the SCC's proposed consortium partner. Under the leadership of Robert Mannel, MD, who was appointed Director in 2006, the SCC has secured institutional and other commitments totaling $383.7 million of state, university and philanthropic dollars over the past ten years, which have been used to recruit new cancer researchers and oncology physicians, add new physical space, and develop formal research programs and new shared resources. The level of support for the SCC constitutes the largest public – private biomedical initiative ever launched in the State and has resulted in an academic cancer center that has achieved the following benchmarks during the reporting period (CY2016):   $18,371,115 in overall funding base (peer-reviewed, cancer-relevant) (direct costs).   $8,981,794 in NCI research and training funding (direct costs).   $34,234,985 in total funding (direct costs).   96 full and associate members, representing 32 different academic departments.   278,609 sf. of total physical space (research, clinical, administrative).   $33.1 million in annual discretionary funds under the control of the SCC Director.   2,727 newly diagnosed and treated patients, with 612 enrollments on interventional treatment trials. The SCC has developed an organizational structure and environment designed to promote transdisciplinary, team-based science, move ideas along the translational continuum and stimulate research that impacts the SCC catchment area. This structure includes three formal research programs: Preclinical Translational Cancer Research (PTCR), Gynecologic Cancers (GC) and Cancer Prevention and Control (CPC). SCC member research is supported by four formal shared resource facilities: Biostatistics and Research Design, Molecular Biology and Cytometry Research, Tissue Pathology and Mobile Health Technology. Centralized Clinical Protocol and Data Management, Data and Safety Monitoring, and Protocol Review and Monitoring functions oversee and support the SCC's robust clinical trials program. OVERALL – PROJECT NARRATIVE Oklahoma currently ranks 7th highest among all states for cancer mortality rates, and 2nd in cancer incidence and mortality rates among the 15 states currently without an NCI-designated cancer center.

"Stephenson Cancer Center - Cancer Center Support Grant OVERALL – ABSTRACT Oklahoma currently ranks 7th highest among all states for cancer mortality rates, and 2nd in cancer incidence and mortality rates among the 15 states currently without an NCI-designated cancer center. To address this cancer burden, the State passed bipartisan-supported legislation in 2001, directing the University of Oklahoma to create an academic cancer center that would provide statewide leadership in cancer education, prevention, treatment and research. Acting on this mandate, the University established the Stephenson Cancer Center (SCC), a matrix-based academic cancer center with a mission of reducing the burden of cancer in Oklahoma, a catchment area underserved by NCI-designated cancer centers. An essential partner in advancing this mission is the Oklahoma Medical Research Foundation (OMRF), the SCC's proposed consortium partner. Under the leadership of Robert Mannel, MD, who was appointed Director in 2006, the SCC has secured institutional and other commitments totaling $383.7 million of state, university and philanthropic dollars over the past ten years, which have been used to recruit new cancer researchers and oncology physicians, add new physical space, and develop formal research programs and new shared resources. The level of support for the SCC constitutes the largest public – private biomedical initiative ever launched in the State and has resulted in an academic cancer center that has achieved the following benchmarks during the reporting period (CY2016):   $18,371,115 in overall funding base (peer-reviewed, cancer-relevant) (direct costs).   $8,981,794 in NCI research and training funding (direct costs).   $34,234,985 in total funding (direct costs).   96 full and associate members, representing 32 different academic departments.   278,609 sf. of total physical space (research, clinical, administrative).   $33.1 million in annual discretionary funds under the control of the SCC Director.   2,727 newly diagnosed and treated patients, with 612 enrollments on interventional treatment trials. The SCC has developed an organizational structure and environment designed to promote transdisciplinary, team-based science, move ideas along the translational continuum and stimulate research that impacts the SCC catchment area. This structure includes three formal research programs: Preclinical Translational Cancer Research (PTCR), Gynecologic Cancers (GC) and Cancer Prevention and Control (CPC). SCC member research is supported by four formal shared resource facilities: Biostatistics and Research Design, Molecular Biology and Cytometry Research, Tissue Pathology and Mobile Health Technology. Centralized Clinical Protocol and Data Management, Data and Safety Monitoring, and Protocol Review and Monitoring functions oversee and support the SCC's robust clinical trials program. OVERALL – PROJECT NARRATIVE Oklahoma currently ranks 7th highest among all states for cancer mortality rates, and 2nd in cancer incidence and mortality rates among the 15 states currently without an NCI-designated cancer center. To address this cancer burden, the Stephenson Cancer Center serves as a major source of discovery into the nature of cancer and of the development of more effective approaches to cancer prevention, diagnosis and therapy for the benefit of patients in Oklahoma and the nation.",Stephenson Cancer Center - Cancer Center Support Grant,9879788,P30CA225520,"['American Indians ', ' American Indian ', ' Biometry ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Biometrics ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Clinical Protocols ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Environment ', ' Environment Design ', ' Foundations ', ' Goals ', ' Incidence ', ' Leadership ', ' Legislation ', ' Statutes and Laws ', ' Mission ', ' DNA Molecular Biology ', ' Molecular Biology ', ' mortality ', ' Oklahoma ', ' Pathology ', ' Patients ', ' Peer Review ', ' Physicians ', ' Privatization ', ' Research ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Research Design ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Safety ', ' Science ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Tissues ', ' Universities ', ' Medical Research ', ' base ', ' career ', ' Clinical ', ' Training ', ' Rural ', ' Funding ', ' oncology ', ' Oncology Cancer ', ' cancer prevention ', ' Nature ', ' programs ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' Source ', ' Benchmarking ', ' Best Practice Analysis ', ' Services ', ' data management ', ' Structure ', ' member ', ' organizational structure ', ' Organization Charts ', ' Prevention ', ' Malignant Female Reproductive System Neoplasm ', ' gynecological malignancy ', ' gynecologic malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Female Reproductive System ', ' Malignant Gynecologic Tumor ', ' Malignant Gynecologic Neoplasm ', ' Gynecological Cancer ', ' Gynecologic Cancer ', ' Female Reproductive Cancer ', ' Reporting ', ' Health Technology ', ' Healthcare Technology ', ' Health Care Technology ', ' Cytometry ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' cancer education ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Direct Costs ', ' cancer research center director ', ' Cancer Center Director ', ' NCI-Designated Cancer Center ', ' Research Training ', ' Resource Sharing ', ' Cancer Burden ', ' National Cancer Burden ', ' Cancer Center ', ' Cancer Center Support Grant ', ' CCSG ', ' Cancer Control ', ' Cancer Control Science ', ' Catchment Area ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Newly Diagnosed ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Monitor ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Health Professional ', ' Healthcare professional ', ' Health Care Professional ', ' pre-clinical ', ' preclinical ', ' treatment trial ', ' next generation ', ' Population ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' disparity in cancer ', ' cancer disparity ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' high standard ', ' standard of care ', ' Secure ', ' mHealth ', ' mobile health ', ' m-Health ', ' translational cancer research ', ' recruit ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF OKLAHOMA HLTH SCIENCES CTR,P30,2019,63653,0.17875760582560432
"Regional Oncology Research Center ABSTRACT The Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center (SKCCC) at Johns Hopkins is dedicated to cancer research, education and training, and care, with an overarching goal of expeditiously and strategically applying new knowledge to improve prevention, screening, detection, diagnosis and treatment of cancer in Maryland and throughout nation and the world. Through targeted outreach and research, cancer outcomes disparities are decreasing in SKCCC's catchment area, but they remain a challenge and a focus at SKCCC. This application requests continued Cancer Center Support Grant (CCSG) funding for SKCCC's Research Programs and Cores. The SKCCC comprises a multidisciplinary, interdepartmental center of The Johns Hopkins University (JHU), encompassing 34 departments in five schools. The scientific Programs of the SKCCC organize and orient the broad base of cancer research throughout JHU into teams focused on rapid translation to the clinic and to populations inside and outside its catchment area. Research conducted at SKCCC includes discovery research into the molecular genetics of human tumorigenesis, clinical trials of new cancer treatments and epidemiologic analyses of lifestyle influences on cancer mortality. The SKCCC is a leading cancer center that is providing insights into the fundamental nature of different cancers and elucidating the thousands of somatic genetic and epigenetic alterations that mark the differences from case to case. This body of work has fueled an emerging understanding that the ultimate control of cancer will require individualizing cancer care using approaches that can be deployed at a population scale. To accomplish this mission, SKCCC took critical input from its External Advisory Board and has strategically evolved since the last CCSG to: 1) augment the clinical and population impact of the discovery pipeline in cancer genetics, epigenetics and immunology generated by discipline-oriented Programs; 2) maximize the translational research output of disease-specific Programs, emphasizing the exploration of new concepts in scientifically driven clinical trials; and 3) position the population-oriented Program to identify, understand and overcome barriers responsible for disparities in cancer outcome in the catchment area. The nine SKCCC Research Programs include four discipline-oriented Programs: Cancer Biology (CB; Baylin, Velculescu), Cancer Immunology (CI; Pardoll, Drake), Cancer Molecular and Functional Imaging (CMFI; Bhujwalla, Pomper), and Cancer Chemical and Structural Biology (CCSB; Berger, Liu); four disease- specific Programs: Hematologic Malignancies and Bone Marrow Transplantation (HMBMT; Ambinder, Jones, Levis), Prostate Cancer (PC; Pienta, Denmeade, Lupold), Breast and Ovarian Cancer (BOC; Stearns, Shih), and Brain Cancer (BC; Grossman, Brem, Laterra); and one population-oriented Program: Cancer Prevention and Control (CPC; Platz, Roden).

"The Sylvester Cancer Center Support Grant PROJECT SUMMARY: OVERALL The Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center (Sylvester) at the University of Miami seeks National Cancer Institute (NCI) designation to support its mission to reduce the human burden from cancer through research, education, prevention, and the delivery of quality patient care. Sylvester, the only academic Cancer Center located in South Florida, serves one of the most diverse catchment areas in the US. This four-county region (Broward, Miami-Dade, Monroe, and Palm Beach Counties), commonly known as South Florida, is home to more than six million residents and is characterized by substantial ethnic, cultural, racial, and socioeconomic diversity, reflected in the individuals treated by Sylvester and those affected by its outreach efforts. Led by Stephen D. Nimer, MD since 2012, Sylvester leadership has assembled a highly collaborative group of investigators that now includes 114 cancer scientists from three University Schools and Colleges. Sylvester’s research is organized into three Research Programs—Cancer Control, Cancer Epigenetics, and Tumor Biology. These programs are unified by crosscutting scientific themes and by Sylvester’s broader mission to address the cancer burden and disparities prevalent in its catchment area. Sylvester has invested heavily in these Research Programs and in four state-of-the-art shared resources that support Sylvester’s cancer researchers: the Biostatistics and Bioinformatics, Onco-Genomics, Flow Cytometry, and Behavioral and Community-Based Research Shared Resources. Sylvester has also invested heavily in its clinical research infrastructure, which has led to a dramatic increase in interventional treatment accruals (from 75 in 2011 to 509 in 2017), with more than 50% of the 4,568 patient accruals in 2017 representing racial/ethnic minorities. The University has made a substantial commitment to advancing Sylvester’s research capabilities since 2012, supporting the recruitment of 41 cancer researchers and doubling Cancer Center space. Sylvester has also expanded its pre- and post-doctoral training efforts across the clinical, basic, translational, and population sciences, which have been rewarded with five recently awarded NIH or NCI-funded T32 training grants, a U54 grant with a significant training component, and a Paul Calabresi K12 grant. Finally, Sylvester has invested roughly $5.7M in its Intramural Funding Program from 2014 to 2018, which has yielded $25.2M in peer-reviewed funding. Today, Sylvester has $38M in extramural research funding (including training grants), which includes $11M from the NCI; this represents a 12% and 64% increase, respectively, over the past year. These impressive achievements have created a culture and environment that enable Sylvester scientists to make valuable contributions to the understanding of cancer biology and the development of novel approaches to cancer prevention, diagnosis, and treatment. PROJECT NARRATIVE: OVERALL Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center (Sylvester), the only academic Cancer Center in South Florida, plays a unique role, serving as a source of discovery and innovation in cancer research, outreach, engagement, prevention, diagnosis, treatment—and hope—for those living in its incredibly diverse catchment area.

"University of Hawaii Cancer Center CCSG ABSTRACT  The mission of the University of Hawai‘i Cancer Center (UHCC) is to reduce the burden of cancer through research, education, patient care and community outreach with an emphasis on the unique ethnic, cultural and environmental characteristics of Hawai‘i and the Pacific. To accomplish this mission, UHCC is organized into two cancer research programs: Population Sciences in the Pacific (PSP) and Cancer Biology (CB). Programs are each organized with two components spanning the study of basic mechanism and etiologies of cancer to addressing targets and interventions in order to translate discovery to the population it serves. Within its programs, UHCC has a strong foundation of cancer research with over $15 million in peer-reviewed funding, 72.5% of which is from the NCI. PSP has 28 full members and CB has 20 full members who are highly collaborative as evidenced by a high percentage of intra- and inter-programmatic, and inter-institutional, research collaborations and publications. To facilitate successful attainment of research goals, UHCC supports five shared resources: Biostatistics, Genomics and Bioinformatics, Analytical Biochemistry, Nutrition Support, and Metabolomics. UHCC serves a unique ethnically diverse catchment area in Hawai‘i and the Pacific and a unique environment rich in natural resources. This drives UHCC’s focus on ethnic diversity and cancer and research and community engagement directed toward addressing significant cancer health disparities among specific populations, including Native Hawaiians. Research programs, community education, public health and clinical trial interventions are targeted toward cancers of importance in the catchment area and basic investigations include evaluation of compounds from the environment for drug discovery research. A unique, community-network based clinical research enterprise has been established through which UHCC provides access to cancer clinical trials for over 70% of the Hawai‘i population; this is supported in part by a UHCC-led affiliation of three competing health systems as a cooperative venture supporting UHCC. Cancer prevention activities across the Pacific, in collaboration with the University of Guam and others, have had major impact on cancer control and have led to the formation of the UHCC-led Trans-Pacific Partnership for Cancer Prevention. The importance of UHCC in the region is exemplified by its significant impact on cancer control legislation and State cancer policy. The University of Hawai‘i (UH) has made significant investments in UHCC. With the recruitment new Director, UH reaffirmed the Director’s direct authority over faculty appointments and affairs, Center budget and operations, and space allocation in the 187,000 sq. ft. Cancer Center building. The University, Governor and State have provided increased financial support for operations and authorized numerous faculty recruitments to strengthen existing programs and embark on new initiatives informed through the UHCC strategic planning process in support of its mission to reduce the burden of cancer.

"Core Support for Cancer Center PROJECT SUMMARY - OVERALL This is an application for years 46-50 funding of the Albert Einstein Cancer Center (AECC) CCSG to support basic, translational, clinical, and population based research that addresses the causes, prevention and treatment of cancer. In September 2015, ownership of the Albert Einstein College of Medicine transferred from Yeshiva University to Montefiore Medicine. The AECC and its clinical partner, the Montefiore Health System, now both under the Montefiore Medicine umbrella, are the major providers of cancer care and prevention programs to the largely minority, and socioeconomically challenged, 1.4M residents of the Bronx. There are five established AECC programs: The Tumor Microenvironment and Metastasis Program which brings together advanced in in vivo imaging technologies and innovative mouse models focused on breast cancer, with recent extension to other neoplasms, and translation into diagnostic, correlative and therapeutic studies in humans. The Stem Cells, Differentiation and Cancer Program encompasses three interrelated themes - stem cell biology, hematological malignancies, and a component focused on basic investigations on epigenetics/ transcription mechanisms and chromatin biology. The Experimental Therapeutics Program is the home for the conduct of all clinical therapeutic trials, and the translation of basic discoveries into investigator-initiated clinical initiatives, at AECC. The program is also the focal point for the development of small molecule inhibitors, and novel immuno-therapeutics, for the treatment of cancer. The Cancer Epidemiology, Prevention and Control Program, evolved from the prior Cancer Epidemiology Program, reflecting the expanded scope of population- based research that encompasses infectious, metabolic, endocrine, obesity-related and genetic/epigenetic causes of cancer and their prevention and control. The Biology of Colon Cancer Program focuses on the convergence of dietary and genetic factors, along with the role of aging, in the pathogenesis of colorectal cancer using mouse models of human cancer now encompassing studies on intestinal stem cells, the microbiome and the villus niche with the objective of translating preclinical findings into prevention strategies. There is research directed to the Bronx catchment area in all five AECC research programs, now brought together with the inauguration of the Community Outreach and Engagement component and units within the Montefiore organization, that provide well-established, effective surveillance, education and outreach capabilities. This, along with the strong clinical electronic informatics at Montefiore and AECC, provide the tools and support that expand the Center's research and implementation capabilities directed to the Bronx population. There are twelve shared resources, including the recent addition of a Chemical Synthesis Shared Resource, that support the spectrum of AECC research activities. There are currently 144 AECC members representing 23 departments with a cancer relevant direct cost funding base of $21M NCI, $18M other NIH, $4M in our peer-review grants, totaling $41M in total peer-reviewed grants.

"Indiana University Melvin and Bren Simon Cancer Center Support Grant ABSTRACT, Overview and Essential Characteristics The IU Simon Cancer Center is an NCI-designated Cancer Center that is dedicated to cancer research, education, and patient care for the citizens of Indiana and beyond. Since our last review, the IUSCC has substantially increased the depth and breadth of our science and cancer relevant research as evidenced by over a 38% increase in NCI funding (Direct Costs), a 176% increase in our multi-PI grants while attracting over 30 new investigators in cancer research to our institution. We are the home to the country's first pathway-driven SPORE that focuses on pediatric tumors and the birthplace to three active cancer consortia, including one that links researchers from North America and sub-Saharan Africa. The IUSCC is composed of two basic programs, Hematopoiesis and Hematologic Malignancies (HHM) and Tumor Microenvironment and Metastasis (TMM), and two translational programs, Experimental and Developmental Therapeutics (EDT) and Cancer Prevention and Control (CPC). We define our catchment area as the entire state of Indiana as patients come from each of the 92 counties and 89% of the counties have at least one patient entered on clinical trials. Our community outreach and engagement activities have focused on the urban and rural populations of Indiana with the diseases with the highest mortality in the state, (i.e. lung, breast and gastrointestinal cancers) as well as behavioral risk factors, which adversely impact screening and prevention (e.g. tobacco and HPV vaccinations). We focus on developing novel approaches for screening, treatment and symptom science using ""precision medicine"" and expanding work in bioinformatics and medical informatics to address the increasing complexity of understanding the genomic and clinical data. We embrace the vision of increasing the research workforce in Indiana and globally through education from ""Teens-to-Tenure"" and the integration of clinical and translational research in our strategic plan. This strategic plan, which has its underpinnings with education and impact to our catchment area, is composed of four pillars that are foundational to the IUSCC. These pillars include: 1) Biology to Bedside Research; 2); Precision Medicine; 3) Prevention, Early Detection and Population Health: Local-Global Approaches; and 4) Health Care Disparities, Survivorship, and Symptom Science.

As a free-standing 501(c)3 not-for-profit institution with the sole purpose “to contribute to the prevention and cure of cancer,” all research funding ($71.8M), publications (2,430), and clinical research (>1,600 interventional accruals/ year) are cancer focused. Research and clinical space has expanded dramatically since the last renewal to more than 2 million square feet, and patient clinical volume places MCC among the largest Centers in the United States. MCC has benefitted from recent, ongoing annual state legislature funding of approximately $25 million, in addition to more than $39 million of annual institutional research support. The 142 MCC members span the basic, clinical, and population sciences. They are organized into five highly collaborative, multidisciplinary programs with exceptional levels of intra- (35%) and inter-programmatic (18%) publications. Under the leadership of Dr. Thomas Sellers, the third MCC Director, a Research Strategic Plan (RSP) was developed and implemented for “Moffitt 3.0.” Four of six Associate Center Directors are new; and new leaders have been appointed in every program, with bold goals and specific aims. Two of the 13 shared resources have been significantly restructured (Chemical Biology, Molecular Genomics), and one new resource created (Collaborative Data Services) to better meet the changing needs of MCC scientists. Implementation of the strategic plan has been bolstered by substantial institutional investment, especially in basic science, immunotherapy, and clinical research infrastructure, including the recruitment of 45 new faculty members, of whom 32 are CCSG members. MCC is a leader in immunotherapy, and more than 40% of overall clinical trial accrual is to investigator-initiated studies. MCC population scientists initiated significant new efforts in cancer prevention and outcomes that include vaccines, tobacco cessation, and health disparities. This is particularly true in the unique cancer problems in the catchment area – notably lung cancer, melanoma, and HPV- prevention. MCC's Total Cancer Care protocol, the ground-breaking research strategy to realize the promise of personalized medicine, has continued to thrive, resulting in dramatic utilization of the Tissue Core and the formation of the Oncology Research Information Exchange Network (ORIEN) that now includes eleven cancer centers across the nation, with several more poised to join the consortium this year. MCC requests funding for: five scientific programs, 13 shared resources, two clinical research components, planning and evaluation, administration, leadership, four staff investigators, and developmental funds.

"Winship Cancer Institute Cancer Center Support Grant PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The Winship Cancer Institute of Emory University (Winship) is the only NCI-designated cancer center in Georgia, which is now the eighth most populous state and has the largest land area among states east of the Mississippi River. As the main tertiary cancer care and cancer research institution in the state, Winship has committed its four research programs as supported by its six shared resources to address the specific challenges associated with the cancer burden in Georgia. These challenges include: high tobacco usage and incidence of tobacco- related cancers; high proportion of cancer patients who are African American or black and/or have significant cancer disparity issues in their care, prognosis, and/or outcome; and low health literacy levels. Winship's mission is to lessen the burden of cancer for the citizens of Georgia, its primary catchment area. This will be accomplished by: (1) seeking greater insights into the molecular, genetic, and epigenetic basis of cancer; (2) discovering new knowledge that drives improvements in cancer detection, prevention, and/or therapy; (3) developing or defining novel therapeutic targets and/or agents as a pathway to better cancer therapies; and (4) studying and implementing population-based strategies to lessen the cancer burden in the state. The 164 Winship core members are actively engaged in one of four Winship research programs, all of which have a strong emphasis on transdisciplinary research: Cancer Cell Biology, Cancer Genetics and Epigenetics, Cancer Prevention and Control, and Discovery and Developmental Therapeutics. Winship's members are supported by six shared resources: Biostatistics and Bioinformatics Shared Resource, Cancer Animal Models Shared Resource, Cancer Tissue and Pathology Shared Resource, Emory Integrated Genomics Shared Resource, Emory Integrated Proteomics Shared Resource, and the Integrated Imaging Shared Resource; and two developing shared resources: Winship Research Informatics and Intervention Development, Dissemination, and Implementation Developing Shared Resources. Winship members are currently supported by $84.8M in total research funding (as of 3/31/2016) awarded via Emory University. Winship members Curran and Bruner serve as PIs on two NCI awards to the NRG Oncology Foundation for a total of $25.6M in support of clinical research infrastructure. Patient enrollment in Winship's interventional and non-interventional trials continues to increase, especially among patients from under-represented minority groups, and these activities have contributed to the FDA- approval of several novel anti-cancer agents during the present funding period. Winship has outstanding institutional commitment, with more than $200 million in institutional support committed over the next five years, a level almost twice that committed in 2011. Winship enjoys the same reporting line and organizational position as Emory's schools of medicine, public health, and nursing. Winship is uniquely positioned to apply its scientific strengths, outstanding membership, robust infrastructure, strong institutional support, and comprehensive training programs to fulfill its mission of lessening the burden of cancer on the state of Georgia and beyond.

"University of Hawaii Cancer Center CCSG ABSTRACT  The mission of the University of Hawai‘i Cancer Center (UHCC) is to reduce the burden of cancer through research, education, patient care and community outreach with an emphasis on the unique ethnic, cultural and environmental characteristics of Hawai‘i and the Pacific. To accomplish this mission, UHCC is organized into two cancer research programs: Population Sciences in the Pacific (PSP) and Cancer Biology (CB). Programs are each organized with two components spanning the study of basic mechanism and etiologies of cancer to addressing targets and interventions in order to translate discovery to the population it serves. Within its programs, UHCC has a strong foundation of cancer research with over $15 million in peer-reviewed funding, 72.5% of which is from the NCI. PSP has 28 full members and CB has 20 full members who are highly collaborative as evidenced by a high percentage of intra- and inter-programmatic, and inter-institutional, research collaborations and publications. To facilitate successful attainment of research goals, UHCC supports five shared resources: Biostatistics, Genomics and Bioinformatics, Analytical Biochemistry, Nutrition Support, and Metabolomics. UHCC serves a unique ethnically diverse catchment area in Hawai‘i and the Pacific and a unique environment rich in natural resources. This drives UHCC’s focus on ethnic diversity and cancer and research and community engagement directed toward addressing significant cancer health disparities among specific populations, including Native Hawaiians. Research programs, community education, public health and clinical trial interventions are targeted toward cancers of importance in the catchment area and basic investigations include evaluation of compounds from the environment for drug discovery research. A unique, community-network based clinical research enterprise has been established through which UHCC provides access to cancer clinical trials for over 70% of the Hawai‘i population; this is supported in part by a UHCC-led affiliation of three competing health systems as a cooperative venture supporting UHCC. Cancer prevention activities across the Pacific, in collaboration with the University of Guam and others, have had major impact on cancer control and have led to the formation of the UHCC-led Trans-Pacific Partnership for Cancer Prevention. The importance of UHCC in the region is exemplified by its significant impact on cancer control legislation and State cancer policy. The University of Hawai‘i (UH) has made significant investments in UHCC. With the recruitment new Director, UH reaffirmed the Director’s direct authority over faculty appointments and affairs, Center budget and operations, and space allocation in the 187,000 sq. ft.

"Specialized Cancer Center Support Grant OVERALL ABSTRACT Founded in 1977 by John Mendelsohn, the Cancer Center at University of California San Diego (UCSD) has been continuously funded by the NCI Cancer Center Support Grant (CCSG) since 1978 and has held Comprehensive status since 2001. As the only NCI-designated Comprehensive Cancer Center in San Diego County, the mission of Moores Cancer Center (MCC) is to reduce the impact of cancer in the region and beyond by fostering scientific discovery, research training, and interdisciplinary care. Our goal is to create, translate, and deliver high-impact discoveries and innovations in cancer prevention and care through a deep understanding of the needs of the catchment area, and prepare the next generation of cancer researchers. Accordingly, MCC’s aims are to: 1) Elucidate the biology of cancer and catalyze trans-disciplinary team science across the science spectrum; 2) Develop and test innovative preventive, diagnostic, and therapeutic approaches; 3) Conduct cancer prevention and control research to reduce cancer disparities in vulnerable populations; 4) Provide underrepresented minorities with access to cutting edge multi-disciplinary care; 5) Provide training and education across the trainee continuum; and 6) Develop and implement community-based cancer education and outreach programs. To this end, MCC brings together 232 members from 5 UCSD Schools (Medicine, Engineering, Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Physical Sciences and Biological Sciences) and 2 consortium partners (one existing: San Diego State University, and one new: La Jolla Institute). Furthermore, MCC integrates the resources of UCSD Health Sciences and its affiliated hospitals in the UCSD Health System for a unified approach to cancer research and clinical care. MCC fulfills its mission through the activities of its 5 Research Programs (Cancer Biology and Signaling, Structural and Functional Genomics, Solid Tumor Therapeutics, Hematological Malignancies, and Cancer Control) that are supported by 7 Shared Resources (Flow Cytometry, Microscopy, Transgenic Mouse, Biostatistics, Genomics and Computational Biology, Biorepository and Tissue Technology, and Biobehavioral), and infrastructure provided by Community Outreach, Training and Education, Clinical Protocol and Data Management, and Protocol Review and Monitoring. Under the leadership of Dr. Scott Lippman, Center Director and Associate Vice- Chancellor for Cancer Research and Care, MCC has seen tremendous growth. During the project period, MCC members authored 3931 cancer-relevant research articles, and in 2017 were supported by $128.2 million (DC) in annual cancer-relevant peer-reviewed funding (8% increase); and the total annualized cancer-relevant research base was $148.5M, an increase of 11% from the previous project period by lateral comparison. Collaborative peer-reviewed grant funding also increased from annual total costs of $65.9M in 2013 to $69.9M in 2017 (6% increase). Importantly, 33 of MCC’s scientific discoveries were translated to the clinic through 41 investigator-initiated clinical trials, a 14-fold increase from the previous project period. OVERALL NARRATIVE MCC’s mission is to reduce the impact of cancer to the catchment area and beyond by discovering, translating, and delivering high-impact innovations in interdisciplinary cancer prevention and care, and prepare the next generation of cancer researchers.

"University of Kentucky Markey Cancer Center - Cancer Center Support Grant PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  The Markey Cancer Center (MCC) was established more than 35 years ago as a university-based matrix cancer center at the University of Kentucky (UK), Kentucky's flagship institution of higher education. MCC is the only National Cancer Institute (NCI)-designated Cancer Center in Kentucky, a state of 4.4 million that leads the nation for all-site cancer incidence and mortality and serves as the MCC's catchment area. Over $347M in state, institutional, and philanthropic investment since recruitment of MCC Director Dr. B. Mark Evers (CS) in 2009 have supported significant research and resource expansion, enabling substantial new faculty recruitment, program development, renovation of clinical and shared resource space, and new state-of-the art instrumentation, as well as statewide education and community outreach efforts. The 119 MCC members draw from 28 departments in 8 UK colleges, with 28 new faculty recruited since 2013. Cancer-relevant research funding to MCC investigators exceeds $38.7M in total annual costs, an increase of $10.3M since 2012. Over the last 4 years, 9,357 subjects have been accrued to interventional trials. Members have published 851 cancer-focused publications since 2013, reflecting 28% intra-programmatic, 16% inter-programmatic, and 58% inter-institutional collaborations. Research is conducted within 4 MCC Research Programs: Cancer Cell Biology and Signaling; Cancer Prevention and Control; Drug Discovery, Delivery and Translational Therapeutics; and Genomic Instability, Epigenetics and Metabolism. Five Shared Resource Facilities (SRFs) facilitate cutting-edge research by providing robust infrastructure for specialized expertise and advanced methods: Biospecimen Procurement and Translational Pathology; Biostatistics and Bioinformatics; Cancer Research Informatics; Flow Cytometry and Cell Sorting; and Redox Metabolism. Two new SRFs (Behavioral and Community-Based Research and Oncogenomics) are in development. Significant achievements include: development of an NCI-sponsored early therapeutics program, including an active Molecular Tumor Board and Precision Medicine Center; expansion of the MCC Network from 8 to 24 sites; establishment of a regional Metabolomics Center (U24); award of 2 new cancer-related centers – a Center of Biomedical Research Excellence (COBRE) in Cancer and Metabolism and a Center for Appalachian Research in Environmental Sciences; and expansion of community outreach/education initiatives across the state. MCC research focuses on Kentucky's most serious cancer burdens with emphasis on the “distressed” Appalachian Kentucky region, where cancer incidence and mortality rates surpass those for the entire state. The MCC brings unique basic, clinical, and population research strengths to this mission. These strengths are integral to all MCC programs and collectively provide robust capacity to deliver transformative interventional research to an important underserved priority population, thereby contributing to national efforts to conquer cancer through discovery and clinical translation, cancer prevention, and community outreach. PROJECT NARRATIVE  The Markey Cancer Center, the only NCI-designated Cancer Center serving 4.4 million Kentuckians in its statewide catchment area, has the institutional authority for all cancer-relevant activities at the University of Kentucky (UK) and within the UK HealthCare enterprise. The center's mission is to reduce cancer incidence and mortality through an integrated, comprehensive program of cancer research, treatment, education, prevention and community engagement.

Unique scientific strengths include research addressing disparities (geographic, race/ethnic, socioeconomic, medically underserved), particularly in etiologic, outcome, and intervention studies in Hispanics. By drawing on established and new partnerships, the Program is also building research that addresses American Indian cancer disparities and priorities identified by NM Tribes, Pueblos, and Indian Nations. Major scientific accomplishments in Risk Prediction and Risk Reduction include the identification of social, lifestyle, and genetic factors associated with lung cancer risk; gene-environment interactions in melanoma risk; and development and dissemination of a novel telehealth strategy for the prevention of hepatocellular cancer. In Screening, members have developed a statewide surveillance program of screening and diagnosis for cervical pre-cancer and cancer that informs real- world cervical cancer prevention through human papilloma virus (HPV) vaccination, screening practice and outcomes. Members have also identified barriers to use of early detection tests in colorectal cancer and have developed strategies to overcome these barriers to improve screening in underserved populations. In Post- Diagnosis Outcomes and Survivorship, members have identified factors that contribute to disparities in post- treatment outcomes and survivorship in endometrial and breast cancer and are developing interventions. Led by Linda Cook, Ph.D. and Anita Kinney, Ph.D., RN, the CaC Program is comprised of 28 members (19 full and 9 associate) from 7 UNM schools and departments, the Lovelace Respiratory Institute, and the Indian Health Service Unit of the Centers for Disease Control whose work is supported by $19,276,863 million in annual direct cost funding, of which $15,429,911 million is peer-reviewed and $3,137,820 million is from NCI as of 9/1/2014. The discoveries made in this Program have resulted 294 publications, of which 19% are intra-programmatic collaborations and 16% are inter-programmatic collaborations; with a total UNMCC and external collaborative publication level of 30% and 80%, respectively.             OVERALL COMPONENT: THE UNIVERSITY OF NEW MEXICO CANCER CENTER PROJECT NARRATIVE Designated as one of the nation's National Cancer Institute Cancer Centers since 2005, the University of New Mexico Cancer Center is a cancer treatment, research, and education and training center that applies the scientific expertise of its investigators to those cancers that have high incidence, mortality, or disparity in the multiethnic and underserved populations of New Mexico.

"University of Arizona Cancer Center - Cancer Center Support Grant Project Summary / Abstract: Overall The University of Arizona Cancer Center (UACC) in Tucson, Arizona has been an NCI-designated Cancer Center since 1978 and a Comprehensive Cancer Center since 1990. It was founded as a matrix center within the University of Arizona (UA), and its members represent 43 Colleges and 11 Departments. In 2014, the UACC was elevated to a status equivalent to that of a College, reporting directly to the Senior Vice President of Health Sciences. At this time, Andrew S. Kraft, MD, was appointed Director of the UACC. With authority for all cancer-related activities at the UA, he is spearheading the utilization of the significant Institutional support to enhance the Program. This includes the recently completed $100M 220,000 square foot outpatient clinic in Phoenix, which will greatly enhance translational research, an expansion of basic research space with occupancy of 20,000 square feet within two years, and an Institutional Commitment of $232M dollars over the next five years. The functionality of the Center has been enhanced by optimization of the Administration and Senior Leadership infrastructure. The UACC Strategic Plan for 2015–2020 calls for the continuation of the highly innovative and impactful team science based on four robust cornerstone Programs: Cancer Biology, Cancer Imaging, Therapeutic Development, and Cancer Prevention and Control. Strategic recruitment and pilot funding is focused on team building, including development of inter-programmatic collaborations and movement of research into the clinic. The UACC will continue to invest in its eight integrated Shared Resources that enhance the capabilities of UACC investigators in basic, prevention, translational, and clinical research, and another in development. The Clinical Trials Office has been strengthened, and investments supporting precision medicine initiatives are ongoing. The UACC is the only major academic Cancer Center in a 400 square mile area of driving distance and is committed to serving the residents in this region and its direct catchment area of southern Arizona. Thus, it has a focus on skin cancer and arsenic exposure as well as the needs of Hispanics, Native Americans, the elderly, and the economically disadvantaged. It has established a robust infrastructure of international, national, and regional collaborations and outreach programs together with research spanning epidemiology, genetics, epigenetics, cell biology, and signaling mechanisms, as well as targeted interventions and understudied survivorship issues. To capture the emerging synergies, the positions of Associate Director of Cancer Disparities and Associate Director of Precision Medicine and Bioinformatics have been created and filled by nationally recognized experts. The UACC emphasis on inclusive training of the next generation of cancer researchers has had demonstrable success in graduation of Native American and Latinos. The research generated by UACC members is characterized by its impact, its relevance to the catchment area, and its innovation. The Strategic Plan builds on the work that has resulted in 1,756 cancer- related publications in the reporting period and its current portfolio of $44M in peer-reviewed support. Project Narrative The University of Arizona Cancer Center (UACC) in Tucson, Arizona has been an NCI-designated Cancer Center since 1978 and a Comprehensive Cancer Center since 1990.

"University of New Mexico Cancer Center Support Grant ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Cancer Control (CaC) Research Program is a newly restructured transdisciplinary program that serves as the hub for cancer control and population science research within the University of New Mexico Cancer Center (UNMCC) and the State of New Mexico (NM), our catchment area. The Program's overall goal is to reduce cancer incidence, morbidity, and mortality, particularly in the unique multiethnic and underserved populations of NM. Disparities research is a cross-cutting theme that fosters scientific focus and synergy across the research areas. Through vigorous strategic program planning and evaluation, recruitment of 9 new investigators to enhance expertise in molecular epidemiology and behavioral/community intervention, and guidance of the UNMCC External Advisory Committee, the CaC Program is now focused on three areas of cancer research: 1) Risk Prediction and Risk Reduction; 2) Screening; and 3) Post-Diagnosis Outcomes and Survivorship. Unique scientific strengths include research addressing disparities (geographic, race/ethnic, socioeconomic, medically underserved), particularly in etiologic, outcome, and intervention studies in Hispanics. By drawing on established and new partnerships, the Program is also building research that addresses American Indian cancer disparities and priorities identified by NM Tribes, Pueblos, and Indian Nations. Major scientific accomplishments in Risk Prediction and Risk Reduction include the identification of social, lifestyle, and genetic factors associated with lung cancer risk; gene-environment interactions in melanoma risk; and development and dissemination of a novel telehealth strategy for the prevention of hepatocellular cancer. In Screening, members have developed a statewide surveillance program of screening and diagnosis for cervical pre-cancer and cancer that informs real- world cervical cancer prevention through human papilloma virus (HPV) vaccination, screening practice and outcomes. Members have also identified barriers to use of early detection tests in colorectal cancer and have developed strategies to overcome these barriers to improve screening in underserved populations. In Post- Diagnosis Outcomes and Survivorship, members have identified factors that contribute to disparities in post- treatment outcomes and survivorship in endometrial and breast cancer and are developing interventions. Led by Linda Cook, Ph.D. and Anita Kinney, Ph.D., RN, the CaC Program is comprised of 28 members (19 full and 9 associate) from 7 UNM schools and departments, the Lovelace Respiratory Institute, and the Indian Health Service Unit of the Centers for Disease Control whose work is supported by $19,276,863 million in annual direct cost funding, of which $15,429,911 million is peer-reviewed and $3,137,820 million is from NCI as of 9/1/2014. The discoveries made in this Program have resulted 294 publications, of which 19% are intra-programmatic collaborations and 16% are inter-programmatic collaborations; with a total UNMCC and external collaborative publication level of 30% and 80%, respectively. OVERALL COMPONENT: THE UNIVERSITY OF NEW MEXICO CANCER CENTER PROJECT NARRATIVE Designated as one of the nation's National Cancer Institute Cancer Centers since 2005, the University of New Mexico Cancer Center is a cancer treatment, research, and education and training center that applies the scientific expertise of its investigators to those cancers that have high incidence, mortality, or disparity in the multiethnic and underserved populations of New Mexico. The Center is a hub for promoting discovery through its research, education and training, clinical care, statewide outreach programs and networks for community participatory research. The Center connects scientists, healthcare professionals, and communities to translate its discoveries to cancer clinical trials, and cancer control and behavioral interventions that reduce the cancer burden of New Mexico and serve as a national model. The goal of the Center is to assure that all of the people in New Mexico, its catchment area, have access to high quality cancer care and collaborate in and benefit from advances in cancer

"Cancer Center Support Grant Project Summary Over the past 5 years, the Wake Forest Baptist Comprehensive Cancer Center (WFBCCC) has continued its upward trajectory in cancer research excellence and service to its catchment area. The WFBCCC catchment area includes the Piedmont and southern Appalachia, a region of 58 contiguous counties in North Carolina, Virginia, West Virginia and Tennessee. The majority of this region is rural and exhibits significant racial health disparities. Elevated age-adjusted smoking rates, obesity rates, cancer incidence, and cancer mortality are observed across the WFBCCC catchment area when compared with the rest of the U.S. To target these issues, the WFBCCC conducts cutting-edge basic, clinical, and population research on the prevention, detection and treatment of cancer, and translates this knowledge into strategies to improve patient outcomes and reduce the incidence of cancer. WFBCCC cancer research funding is $37.9 million, of which over $14.9 million comes from the NCI; this represents a 25.3% increase in total cancer funding since the last CCSG renewal. Center research space under the Director’s authority increased by approximately 65,000 square feet, and the WFBCCC clinical facilities have been dramatically enhanced with the completion of the new eleven- story Cancer Hospital in 2013. This building houses all oncology inpatients and outpatients. The Center’s 127 members span the basic, clinical and population sciences and are organized into 4 Programs with substantial inter-and intra-programmatic productivity. Faculty additions enhanced tobacco control, tobacco-related cancer research, and precision medicine. Substantial investment in faculty, technology, and informatics significantly expanded cancer genomics capabilities. Enrollment of patients into treatment trials reached an all-time high in 2015, with a large increase in the number of patients enrolled in investigator-initiated trials. WFBCCC population scientists initiated exciting new efforts in cancer prevention and survivorship. Clinical scientists completed practice-changing studies in patients with glioma and lung cancer.

"Moffitt Cancer Center Support Grant PROJECT SUMMARY The H. Lee Moffitt Cancer Center & Research Institute (MCC) continues its ambitious trajectory of innovative cancer research and translation to benefit the gulf coast region of Florida and beyond. As a free-standing 501(c)3 not-for-profit institution with the sole purpose “to contribute to the prevention and cure of cancer,” all research funding ($71.8M), publications (2,430), and clinical research (>1,600 interventional accruals/ year) are cancer focused. Research and clinical space has expanded dramatically since the last renewal to more than 2 million square feet, and patient clinical volume places MCC among the largest Centers in the United States. MCC has benefitted from recent, ongoing annual state legislature funding of approximately $25 million, in addition to more than $39 million of annual institutional research support. The 142 MCC members span the basic, clinical, and population sciences. They are organized into five highly collaborative, multidisciplinary programs with exceptional levels of intra- (35%) and inter-programmatic (18%) publications. Under the leadership of Dr. Thomas Sellers, the third MCC Director, a Research Strategic Plan (RSP) was developed and implemented for “Moffitt 3.0.” Four of six Associate Center Directors are new; and new leaders have been appointed in every program, with bold goals and specific aims. Two of the 13 shared resources have been significantly restructured (Chemical Biology, Molecular Genomics), and one new resource created (Collaborative Data Services) to better meet the changing needs of MCC scientists. Implementation of the strategic plan has been bolstered by substantial institutional investment, especially in basic science, immunotherapy, and clinical research infrastructure, including the recruitment of 45 new faculty members, of whom 32 are CCSG members. MCC is a leader in immunotherapy, and more than 40% of overall clinical trial accrual is to investigator-initiated studies. MCC population scientists initiated significant new efforts in cancer prevention and outcomes that include vaccines, tobacco cessation, and health disparities. This is particularly true in the unique cancer problems in the catchment area – notably lung cancer, melanoma, and HPV- prevention. MCC's Total Cancer Care protocol, the ground-breaking research strategy to realize the promise of personalized medicine, has continued to thrive, resulting in dramatic utilization of the Tissue Core and the formation of the Oncology Research Information Exchange Network (ORIEN) that now includes eleven cancer centers across the nation, with several more poised to join the consortium this year. MCC requests funding for: five scientific programs, 13 shared resources, two clinical research components, planning and evaluation, administration, leadership, four staff investigators, and developmental funds. CCSG funds are leveraged more than 10-fold with institutional resources to maximize impact on cancer prevention, treatment, and cure in the catchment area, the state of Florida and beyond.

"Georgetown University Lombardi Comprehensive Cancer Center Support Grant ABSTRACT The Georgetown Lombardi Comprehensive Cancer Center (LCCC) is the only NCI-designated comprehensive cancer center based in the nation’s capital. Led by Louis M. Weiner MD since 2008, LCCC’s vision is to prevent and cure cancer with a local focus and global impact. Our mission is to prevent, treat, and cure cancers by linking scientific discovery, expert and compassionate patient care, quality education, and partnership with the community, guided by the principle of cura personalis, “care for the whole person.” LCCC’s strategic objectives are to 1) advance transformative cancer research, 2) reduce the impact of cancer and diminish disparities in our catchment area, 3) lead high-impact clinical research, 4) ensure long-term growth, vibrancy and stability of the research enterprise, and 5) develop the next generation of cancer scientists, clinicians and educators. These objectives were furthered by LCCC’s deepening relationship with the John Theurer Cancer Center (JTCC) of Hackensack Meridian Health (HMH), a clinical and clinical research powerhouse that brings a substantial research base and extends LCCC’s impact. With this P30 competitive renewal application LCCC is applying as a CCSG consortium with JTCC, which meets CCSG FOA external funding requirements. The LCCC Consortium is comprised of Georgetown Lombardi Comprehensive Cancer Center, based in Washington, DC (LCCC-DC) and the John Theurer Cancer Center of Hackensack Meridian Health, based in Hackensack, NJ (LCCC-NJ). Accordingly, the LCCC catchment area is defined by the LCCC-DC and LCCC-NJ catchment areas. LCCC research is based in four research programs: Breast Cancer (BC), Cancer Prevention and Control (CPC), Experimental Therapeutics (ET) and Molecular Oncology (MO). Crosscutting initiatives in data science, minority health and health disparities, cancer precision medicine, immunotherapy and cancer survivorship focus and support the work of these programs. During the current CCSG funding cycle, LCCC employed a robust strategic planning process to develop and refine its research. LCCC conducts research that is practice changing, paradigm shifting and policy informing, with 114 members publishing 1,390 papers (18% with IF>8) during the current CCSG funding period. Current cancer-focused annual direct cost funding for LCCC members is $36,696,492 (of which $3,282,510 is from members based at LCCC-NJ). LCCC had 2,165 interventional clinical trial accruals from 2014-2017 in its DC catchment area, which consists of more than four million people in DC and each surrounding county in Maryland and Virginia. LCCC’s Bergen County NJ catchment area contains nearly 1 million residents. LCCC has increased opportunities for clinical research and care by serving these large, racially and ethnically diverse catchment areas, which suffer from excess mortality from breast, prostate, pancreas and liver cancers. Future plans include expansion of research addressing catchment areas’ needs, with a particular emphasis on hematologic malignancies and cellular therapy translational and clinical research. The Georgetown Lombardi Comprehensive Cancer Center (LCCC) is applying for this renewal of its CCSG as a consortium cancer center with the John Theurer Cancer Center of Hackensack Meridian Health. Our shared vision is to prevent and cure cancer with a local focus and global impact. This is achieved through basic, translational, clinical and population-directed research that addresses important causes and consequences of cancer.

"University of Kentucky Markey Cancer Center - Cancer Center Support Grant PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  The Markey Cancer Center (MCC) was established more than 35 years ago as a university-based matrix cancer center at the University of Kentucky (UK), Kentucky's flagship institution of higher education. MCC is the only National Cancer Institute (NCI)-designated Cancer Center in Kentucky, a state of 4.4 million that leads the nation for all-site cancer incidence and mortality and serves as the MCC's catchment area. Over $347M in state, institutional, and philanthropic investment since recruitment of MCC Director Dr. B. Mark Evers (CS) in 2009 have supported significant research and resource expansion, enabling substantial new faculty recruitment, program development, renovation of clinical and shared resource space, and new state-of-the art instrumentation, as well as statewide education and community outreach efforts. The 119 MCC members draw from 28 departments in 8 UK colleges, with 28 new faculty recruited since 2013. Cancer-relevant research funding to MCC investigators exceeds $38.7M in total annual costs, an increase of $10.3M since 2012. Over the last 4 years, 9,357 subjects have been accrued to interventional trials. Members have published 851 cancer-focused publications since 2013, reflecting 28% intra-programmatic, 16% inter-programmatic, and 58% inter-institutional collaborations. Research is conducted within 4 MCC Research Programs: Cancer Cell Biology and Signaling; Cancer Prevention and Control; Drug Discovery, Delivery and Translational Therapeutics; and Genomic Instability, Epigenetics and Metabolism. Five Shared Resource Facilities (SRFs) facilitate cutting-edge research by providing robust infrastructure for specialized expertise and advanced methods: Biospecimen Procurement and Translational Pathology; Biostatistics and Bioinformatics; Cancer Research Informatics; Flow Cytometry and Cell Sorting; and Redox Metabolism. Two new SRFs (Behavioral and Community-Based Research and Oncogenomics) are in development. Significant achievements include: development of an NCI-sponsored early therapeutics program, including an active Molecular Tumor Board and Precision Medicine Center; expansion of the MCC Network from 8 to 24 sites; establishment of a regional Metabolomics Center (U24); award of 2 new cancer-related centers – a Center of Biomedical Research Excellence (COBRE) in Cancer and Metabolism and a Center for Appalachian Research in Environmental Sciences; and expansion of community outreach/education initiatives across the state. MCC research focuses on Kentucky's most serious cancer burdens with emphasis on the “distressed” Appalachian Kentucky region, where cancer incidence and mortality rates surpass those for the entire state. The MCC brings unique basic, clinical, and population research strengths to this mission. These strengths are integral to all MCC programs and collectively provide robust capacity to deliver transformative interventional research to an important underserved priority population, thereby contributing to national efforts to conquer cancer through discovery and clinical translation, cancer prevention, and community outreach. PROJECT NARRATIVE  The Markey Cancer Center, the only NCI-designated Cancer Center serving 4.4 million Kentuckians in its statewide catchment area, has the institutional authority for all cancer-relevant activities at the University of Kentucky (UK) and within the UK HealthCare enterprise. The center's mission is to reduce cancer incidence and mortality through an integrated, comprehensive program of cancer research, treatment, education, prevention and community engagement. Thus, the Markey Cancer Center delivers in-depth and impactful research programs in basic, translational, and population science, including the development of clinical trials to address Kentucky's unique cancer burden and to accelerate “bench-to-bedside” translational outcomes that will reduce serious health disparities and significantly impact patients, the state and the nation.",University of

"Specialized Cancer Center Support Grant OVERALL ABSTRACT Founded in 1977 by John Mendelsohn, the Cancer Center at University of California San Diego (UCSD) has been continuously funded by the NCI Cancer Center Support Grant (CCSG) since 1978 and has held Comprehensive status since 2001. As the only NCI-designated Comprehensive Cancer Center in San Diego County, the mission of Moores Cancer Center (MCC) is to reduce the impact of cancer in the region and beyond by fostering scientific discovery, research training, and interdisciplinary care. Our goal is to create, translate, and deliver high-impact discoveries and innovations in cancer prevention and care through a deep understanding of the needs of the catchment area, and prepare the next generation of cancer researchers. Accordingly, MCC’s aims are to: 1) Elucidate the biology of cancer and catalyze trans-disciplinary team science across the science spectrum; 2) Develop and test innovative preventive, diagnostic, and therapeutic approaches; 3) Conduct cancer prevention and control research to reduce cancer disparities in vulnerable populations; 4) Provide underrepresented minorities with access to cutting edge multi-disciplinary care; 5) Provide training and education across the trainee continuum; and 6) Develop and implement community-based cancer education and outreach programs. To this end, MCC brings together 232 members from 5 UCSD Schools (Medicine, Engineering, Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Physical Sciences and Biological Sciences) and 2 consortium partners (one existing: San Diego State University, and one new: La Jolla Institute). Furthermore, MCC integrates the resources of UCSD Health Sciences and its affiliated hospitals in the UCSD Health System for a unified approach to cancer research and clinical care. MCC fulfills its mission through the activities of its 5 Research Programs (Cancer Biology and Signaling, Structural and Functional Genomics, Solid Tumor Therapeutics, Hematological Malignancies, and Cancer Control) that are supported by 7 Shared Resources (Flow Cytometry, Microscopy, Transgenic Mouse, Biostatistics, Genomics and Computational Biology, Biorepository and Tissue Technology, and Biobehavioral), and infrastructure provided by Community Outreach, Training and Education, Clinical Protocol and Data Management, and Protocol Review and Monitoring. Under the leadership of Dr. Scott Lippman, Center Director and Associate Vice- Chancellor for Cancer Research and Care, MCC has seen tremendous growth. During the project period, MCC members authored 3931 cancer-relevant research articles, and in 2017 were supported by $128.2 million (DC) in annual cancer-relevant peer-reviewed funding (8% increase); and the total annualized cancer-relevant research base was $148.5M, an increase of 11% from the previous project period by lateral comparison. Collaborative peer-reviewed grant funding also increased from annual total costs of $65.9M in 2013 to $69.9M in 2017 (6% increase). Importantly, 33 of MCC’s scientific discoveries were translated to the clinic through 41 investigator-initiated clinical trials, a 14-fold increase from the previous project period. OVERALL NARRATIVE MCC’s mission is to reduce the impact of cancer to the catchment area and beyond by discovering, translating, and delivering high-impact innovations in interdisciplinary cancer prevention and care, and prepare the next generation of cancer researchers. The CCSG provides critical infrastructure to support the research necessary to achieve our mission.",Specialized Cancer Center Support Grant,9952744,P30CA023100,"['American Indians ', ' American

"Winship Cancer Institute Cancer Center Support Grant PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The Winship Cancer Institute of Emory University (Winship) is the only NCI-designated cancer center in Georgia, which is now the eighth most populous state and has the largest land area among states east of the Mississippi River. As the main tertiary cancer care and cancer research institution in the state, Winship has committed its four research programs as supported by its six shared resources to address the specific challenges associated with the cancer burden in Georgia. These challenges include: high tobacco usage and incidence of tobacco- related cancers; high proportion of cancer patients who are African American or black and/or have significant cancer disparity issues in their care, prognosis, and/or outcome; and low health literacy levels. Winship's mission is to lessen the burden of cancer for the citizens of Georgia, its primary catchment area. This will be accomplished by: (1) seeking greater insights into the molecular, genetic, and epigenetic basis of cancer; (2) discovering new knowledge that drives improvements in cancer detection, prevention, and/or therapy; (3) developing or defining novel therapeutic targets and/or agents as a pathway to better cancer therapies; and (4) studying and implementing population-based strategies to lessen the cancer burden in the state. The 164 Winship core members are actively engaged in one of four Winship research programs, all of which have a strong emphasis on transdisciplinary research: Cancer Cell Biology, Cancer Genetics and Epigenetics, Cancer Prevention and Control, and Discovery and Developmental Therapeutics. Winship's members are supported by six shared resources: Biostatistics and Bioinformatics Shared Resource, Cancer Animal Models Shared Resource, Cancer Tissue and Pathology Shared Resource, Emory Integrated Genomics Shared Resource, Emory Integrated Proteomics Shared Resource, and the Integrated Imaging Shared Resource; and two developing shared resources: Winship Research Informatics and Intervention Development, Dissemination, and Implementation Developing Shared Resources. Winship members are currently supported by $84.8M in total research funding (as of 3/31/2016) awarded via Emory University. Winship members Curran and Bruner serve as PIs on two NCI awards to the NRG Oncology Foundation for a total of $25.6M in support of clinical research infrastructure. Patient enrollment in Winship's interventional and non-interventional trials continues to increase, especially among patients from under-represented minority groups, and these activities have contributed to the FDA- approval of several novel anti-cancer agents during the present funding period. Winship has outstanding institutional commitment, with more than $200 million in institutional support committed over the next five years, a level almost twice that committed in 2011. Winship enjoys the same reporting line and organizational position as Emory's schools of medicine, public health, and nursing. Winship is uniquely positioned to apply its scientific strengths, outstanding membership, robust infrastructure, strong institutional support, and comprehensive training programs to fulfill its mission of lessening the burden of cancer on the state of Georgia and beyond.

"Cancer Center Support Grant PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT MD Anderson Cancer Center is a comprehensive cancer center established within the University of Texas System in 1941. In 2017, the institution welcomed Peter Pisters, MD, as its fifth full-time president and PI of the CCSG. The mission of MD Anderson is to eliminate cancer in Texas, the nation and the world through outstanding programs that integrate patient care, research and prevention, and through education for undergraduate and graduate students, trainees, professionals, employees and the public. MD Anderson is dedicated wholly to the study of cancer involving a continuum of basic, clinical and population-based investigation, with an emphasis on multidisciplinary translational research. MD Anderson employed more than 19,530 people in FY17, including 1,743 faculty members, of whom 705 (40%) are CCSG program members. More than 137,000 people sought care at MD Anderson in FY17 of whom 20,839 were newly diagnosed cancer patients. Annual citations in Web of Science have increased 23% from 3,260 in 2013, to 4,009 in 2017, including 686 (17%) articles in journals with an impact factor >10, and 244 (6%) articles in journals with an impact factor >20. The total research budget increased 26% from $671M in 2013 to $844M in 2017. Direct cost NCI research grant support, excluding training grants and the CCSG, has increased 34%, from $67M in 2013 to $90M in 2018, with the largest number of NCI grants for any institution (>200), including 6 SPOREs, 4 P01s and 35 U awards. Research Programs have been reduced to 16 and support is requested for 14 shared resources. Since the last CCSG renewal, research has been strengthened with recruitment of 97 tenured and tenure track faculty, of whom 18 are supported by recruitment awards from CPRIT totaling $63M. Team science has been enhanced through institutional support of the MD Anderson's Moon Shots ($383M), focused on reducing mortality from 13 major cancers through multi-disciplinary efforts that build on research emerging from the CCSG programs. In FY17, 10,283 participants were enrolled in 1,108 interventional clinical research protocols, of which 936 were treatment (therapeutic) studies that accrued 6,271 subjects. Over the past decade MD Anderson investigators have contributed to the clinical evaluation of 72 of 130 FDA oncology drug approvals, either as a new entity or for a new indication, with 41 of these approvals since the last CCSG renewal. In addition to the main hospital, Houston Area Locations provide prospective, multidisciplinary care and supportive services, with an increasing emphasis on access to clinical trials including national studies. Cancer prevention and survivorship is a priority for MD Anderson with an emphasis on molecular epidemiology, behavioral science, clinical cancer prevention and early detection research to reduce the burden of cancer within Texas and worldwide. PROJECT NARRATIVE: OVERVIEW Cancer affects 1 in every 3 people in the US and as our population ages this fraction is expected to increase. Outcomes for cancer patients have improved over the last several decades, but there is still a great burden of cancer-related mortality and morbidity that is borne disproportionately by minorities and the economically disadvantaged. MD Anderson Cancer Center's mission is to eliminate cancer in Texas, the nation and the world through outstanding programs that integrate patient care, research and prevention, and through education for undergraduate and graduate students, trainees, professionals, employees and the public.

"Mayo Comprehensive Cancer Center Grant OVERALL PROJECT SUMMARY The Mayo Clinic Cancer Center (MCCC) is a comprehensive cancer center that has been a designated NCI Center in Rochester, MN (MCR) since 1974. Today, MCCC includes not only MCR, but also sites in Jacksonville, Florida (MCF), and Scottsdale/Phoenix, Arizona (MCA). Each site has a thriving clinical cancer practice with clinical investigators at each of the sites, and a critical mass of basic science and population sciences faculty as well. In 2013, NCI recognized MCCC as an integrated comprehensive cancer based at all 3 sites, based on shared leadership, shared research including multi-investigator grant activity, co-author publications, and enterprise-wide clinical protocol activity. Robert B. Diasio, MD, has been director of MCCC since 2006, leading the center through successful competitive renewals of the CCSG application in 2008 and later in 2013. Since 2013, the center has continued to flourish with strong cancer-focused research, many examples of team science (e.g., SPOREs), an increase in high impact publications and many examples of translational research, and, most importantly, many examples of practice-changing approaches to cancer care. Following strategic planning in 2014, MCCC now has the following aims: 1. To advance the cancer-focused research of each of our MCCC members within our existing 10 Programs and within potential future Programs in order to promote high impact science. 2. To advance interactions of our MCCC members within Programs (intraprogrammatic); across Programs (interprogrammatic); and with individuals at other Cancer Centers and institutions (interinstitutional). 3. To advance new approaches for the treatment of cancer by facilitating translation of basic science concepts from the laboratory to the clinic within MCCC. 4. To continue to build and to further integrate cancer research activities at MCA, MCF, and MCR and to extend these activities to the Mayo Clinic Health System (MCHS). 5. To further develop cancer education for patients, high school, college, and graduate students, postgraduates, as well as faculty. 6. To extend our cancer research, practice, and education within our catchment areas at each of our 3 major sites in MCA, MCF, and MCR and the MCHS with the ultimate goal of lessening cancer burden. We will use these 6 specific aims to further the mission of MCCC: (1) to promote and facilitate research on the incidence, etiology, and molecular basis of cancer, and (2) through education and direct application of the results of such research, to translate the discoveries into improved methods for cancer prevention, detection, diagnosis, prognosis, and therapy.

"Regional Oncology Research Center ABSTRACT The Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center (SKCCC) at Johns Hopkins is dedicated to cancer research, education and training, and care, with an overarching goal of expeditiously and strategically applying new knowledge to improve prevention, screening, detection, diagnosis and treatment of cancer in Maryland and throughout nation and the world. Through targeted outreach and research, cancer outcomes disparities are decreasing in SKCCC's catchment area, but they remain a challenge and a focus at SKCCC. This application requests continued Cancer Center Support Grant (CCSG) funding for SKCCC's Research Programs and Cores. The SKCCC comprises a multidisciplinary, interdepartmental center of The Johns Hopkins University (JHU), encompassing 34 departments in five schools. The scientific Programs of the SKCCC organize and orient the broad base of cancer research throughout JHU into teams focused on rapid translation to the clinic and to populations inside and outside its catchment area. Research conducted at SKCCC includes discovery research into the molecular genetics of human tumorigenesis, clinical trials of new cancer treatments and epidemiologic analyses of lifestyle influences on cancer mortality. The SKCCC is a leading cancer center that is providing insights into the fundamental nature of different cancers and elucidating the thousands of somatic genetic and epigenetic alterations that mark the differences from case to case. This body of work has fueled an emerging understanding that the ultimate control of cancer will require individualizing cancer care using approaches that can be deployed at a population scale. To accomplish this mission, SKCCC took critical input from its External Advisory Board and has strategically evolved since the last CCSG to: 1) augment the clinical and population impact of the discovery pipeline in cancer genetics, epigenetics and immunology generated by discipline-oriented Programs; 2) maximize the translational research output of disease-specific Programs, emphasizing the exploration of new concepts in scientifically driven clinical trials; and 3) position the population-oriented Program to identify, understand and overcome barriers responsible for disparities in cancer outcome in the catchment area. The nine SKCCC Research Programs include four discipline-oriented Programs: Cancer Biology (CB; Baylin, Velculescu), Cancer Immunology (CI; Pardoll, Drake), Cancer Molecular and Functional Imaging (CMFI; Bhujwalla, Pomper), and Cancer Chemical and Structural Biology (CCSB; Berger, Liu); four disease- specific Programs: Hematologic Malignancies and Bone Marrow Transplantation (HMBMT; Ambinder, Jones, Levis), Prostate Cancer (PC; Pienta, Denmeade, Lupold), Breast and Ovarian Cancer (BOC; Stearns, Shih), and Brain Cancer (BC; Grossman, Brem, Laterra); and one population-oriented Program: Cancer Prevention and Control (CPC; Platz, Roden). These Programs are supported by fifteen Cores, one developing Core (described in Developmental Funds) and a dedicated leadership team. PROJECT NARRATIVE (Public Health Relevance Statement) Cancer is a leading cause of death in the U.S. and throughout the world. With the tremendous medical advances over the past 50 years, the U.S. population's life expectancy has dramatically increased, but because the incidence of most cancers increases with age, cancers have become a profound challenge to the U.S. health care system. Minorities suffer a disproportionate burden of the cancer threat with disparate outcomes for many cancer types. To meet these challenges, dedicated cancer research at the SKCCC and elsewhere over the past 35 years has generated fundamental insights into the molecular mechanisms that cause human cancers to arise, progress and threaten life.

"Medical University of South Carolina - Cancer Center Support Grant OVERALL: SUMMARY The Hollings Cancer Center (HCC) at the Medical University of South Carolina (MUSC) seeks renewal of its National Cancer Institute (NCI) designation via the P30 Cancer Center Support Grant (CCSG) mechanism. As South Carolina's (SC) leading academic medical center, MUSC is charged with building basic, translational, clinical, and population-based research programs that address the state's significant healthcare needs. The mission of the HCC is to reduce the cancer burden in SC through transformative research, patient care, prevention, and public policy. To accomplish this mission, HCC leadership built a robust, multidisciplinary center that includes 107 cancer scientists. Innovative, high-impact research is driven by HCC’s four research programs: Cancer Biology, Cancer Immunology, Developmental Cancer Therapeutics, and Cancer Control. The rapid pace of discovery and movement toward effective translational research is supported by five shared research resources: Lipidomics, Flow Cytometry & Cell Sorting, Cell & Molecular Imaging, Biorepository & Tissue Analysis, and Biostatistics. During the current project period, the HCC successfully leveraged CCSG funding and its NCI-designated cancer center status to harness, expand and improve the center’s research capabilities to decrease the state’s cancer burden. HCC supported recruitment of 26 new cancer scientists. The annual direct peer-reviewed extramural research funding (excluding training and career development awards) increased to $21.6M, with $10.5M from NCI. HCC boasts the state’s largest clinical trials operation that provides centralized support for conducting the most contemporary cancer trials. During the past year, the HCC recruited 1,266 patients to interventional studies and 254 patients to non-interventional studies. HCC made significant progress in overcoming the challenges inherent in recruiting racial and ethnic minorities to participate in research. In 2017, 33% of research participants were racial or ethnic minorities, with more than half residing in rural communities federally designated as medically underserved. This progress has been maintained for over two decades by progressive, HCC-led outreach, community engagement, and cancer education services. With the charge of training the next generation of diverse and exceptional cancer physicians and scientists, the center developed the state’s only comprehensive cancer education pipeline for learners across the entire education continuum, from high school through early professional career development. The HCC is committed to providing access to the latest research, educational, and clinical advances to all of South Carolina, and has never been better equipped to fulfill its mission. Led by a new center director appointed in 2017, the HCC will implement its 2023 strategic plan to advance scientific discovery, make impactful contributions to the understanding of cancer biology in a diverse population, and translate discoveries into transformative approaches to cancer control, diagnosis, treatment, and public policy.

"University of New Mexico Cancer Center Support Grant ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Cancer Control (CaC) Research Program is a newly restructured transdisciplinary program that serves as the hub for cancer control and population science research within the University of New Mexico Cancer Center (UNMCC) and the State of New Mexico (NM), our catchment area. The Program's overall goal is to reduce cancer incidence, morbidity, and mortality, particularly in the unique multiethnic and underserved populations of NM. Disparities research is a cross-cutting theme that fosters scientific focus and synergy across the research areas. Through vigorous strategic program planning and evaluation, recruitment of 9 new investigators to enhance expertise in molecular epidemiology and behavioral/community intervention, and guidance of the UNMCC External Advisory Committee, the CaC Program is now focused on three areas of cancer research: 1) Risk Prediction and Risk Reduction; 2) Screening; and 3) Post-Diagnosis Outcomes and Survivorship. Unique scientific strengths include research addressing disparities (geographic, race/ethnic, socioeconomic, medically underserved), particularly in etiologic, outcome, and intervention studies in Hispanics. By drawing on established and new partnerships, the Program is also building research that addresses American Indian cancer disparities and priorities identified by NM Tribes, Pueblos, and Indian Nations. Major scientific accomplishments in Risk Prediction and Risk Reduction include the identification of social, lifestyle, and genetic factors associated with lung cancer risk; gene-environment interactions in melanoma risk; and development and dissemination of a novel telehealth strategy for the prevention of hepatocellular cancer. In Screening, members have developed a statewide surveillance program of screening and diagnosis for cervical pre-cancer and cancer that informs real- world cervical cancer prevention through human papilloma virus (HPV) vaccination, screening practice and outcomes. Members have also identified barriers to use of early detection tests in colorectal cancer and have developed strategies to overcome these barriers to improve screening in underserved populations. In Post- Diagnosis Outcomes and Survivorship, members have identified factors that contribute to disparities in post- treatment outcomes and survivorship in endometrial and breast cancer and are developing interventions. Led by Linda Cook, Ph.D. and Anita Kinney, Ph.D., RN, the CaC Program is comprised of 28 members (19 full and 9 associate) from 7 UNM schools and departments, the Lovelace Respiratory Institute, and the Indian Health Service Unit of the Centers for Disease Control whose work is supported by $19,276,863 million in annual direct cost funding, of which $15,429,911 million is peer-reviewed and $3,137,820 million is from NCI as of 9/1/2014. The discoveries made in this Program have resulted 294 publications, of which 19% are intra-programmatic collaborations and 16% are inter-programmatic collaborations; with a total UNMCC and external collaborative publication level of 30% and 80%, respectively. OVERALL COMPONENT: THE UNIVERSITY OF NEW MEXICO CANCER CENTER PROJECT NARRATIVE Designated as one of the nation's National Cancer Institute Cancer Centers since 2005, the University of New Mexico Cancer Center is a cancer treatment, research, and education and training center that applies the scientific expertise of its investigators to those cancers that have high incidence, mortality, or disparity in the multiethnic and underserved populations of New Mexico. The Center is a hub for promoting discovery through its research, education and training, clinical care, statewide outreach programs and networks for community participatory research. The Center connects scientists, healthcare professionals, and communities to translate its discoveries to cancer clinical trials, and cancer control and behavioral interventions that reduce the cancer burden of New Mexico and serve as a national model. The goal of the Center is to assure that all of the people in New Mexico, its catchment area, have access to high quality cancer care and collaborate in and benefit from advances in cancer

"Stephenson Cancer Center - Cancer Center Support Grant OVERALL – ABSTRACT Oklahoma currently ranks 7th highest among all states for cancer mortality rates, and 2nd in cancer incidence and mortality rates among the 15 states currently without an NCI-designated cancer center. To address this cancer burden, the State passed bipartisan-supported legislation in 2001, directing the University of Oklahoma to create an academic cancer center that would provide statewide leadership in cancer education, prevention, treatment and research. Acting on this mandate, the University established the Stephenson Cancer Center (SCC), a matrix-based academic cancer center with a mission of reducing the burden of cancer in Oklahoma, a catchment area underserved by NCI-designated cancer centers. An essential partner in advancing this mission is the Oklahoma Medical Research Foundation (OMRF), the SCC's proposed consortium partner. Under the leadership of Robert Mannel, MD, who was appointed Director in 2006, the SCC has secured institutional and other commitments totaling $383.7 million of state, university and philanthropic dollars over the past ten years, which have been used to recruit new cancer researchers and oncology physicians, add new physical space, and develop formal research programs and new shared resources. The level of support for the SCC constitutes the largest public – private biomedical initiative ever launched in the State and has resulted in an academic cancer center that has achieved the following benchmarks during the reporting period (CY2016):   $18,371,115 in overall funding base (peer-reviewed, cancer-relevant) (direct costs).   $8,981,794 in NCI research and training funding (direct costs).   $34,234,985 in total funding (direct costs).   96 full and associate members, representing 32 different academic departments.   278,609 sf. of total physical space (research, clinical, administrative).   $33.1 million in annual discretionary funds under the control of the SCC Director.   2,727 newly diagnosed and treated patients, with 612 enrollments on interventional treatment trials. The SCC has developed an organizational structure and environment designed to promote transdisciplinary, team-based science, move ideas along the translational continuum and stimulate research that impacts the SCC catchment area. This structure includes three formal research programs: Preclinical Translational Cancer Research (PTCR), Gynecologic Cancers (GC) and Cancer Prevention and Control (CPC). SCC member research is supported by four formal shared resource facilities: Biostatistics and Research Design, Molecular Biology and Cytometry Research, Tissue Pathology and Mobile Health Technology.

"Cancer Center Support Grant PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT MD Anderson Cancer Center is a comprehensive cancer center established within the University of Texas System in 1941. In 2017, the institution welcomed Peter Pisters, MD, as its fifth full-time president and PI of the CCSG. The mission of MD Anderson is to eliminate cancer in Texas, the nation and the world through outstanding programs that integrate patient care, research and prevention, and through education for undergraduate and graduate students, trainees, professionals, employees and the public. MD Anderson is dedicated wholly to the study of cancer involving a continuum of basic, clinical and population-based investigation, with an emphasis on multidisciplinary translational research. MD Anderson employed more than 19,530 people in FY17, including 1,743 faculty members, of whom 705 (40%) are CCSG program members. More than 137,000 people sought care at MD Anderson in FY17 of whom 20,839 were newly diagnosed cancer patients. Annual citations in Web of Science have increased 23% from 3,260 in 2013, to 4,009 in 2017, including 686 (17%) articles in journals with an impact factor >10, and 244 (6%) articles in journals with an impact factor >20. The total research budget increased 26% from $671M in 2013 to $844M in 2017. Direct cost NCI research grant support, excluding training grants and the CCSG, has increased 34%, from $67M in 2013 to $90M in 2018, with the largest number of NCI grants for any institution (>200), including 6 SPOREs, 4 P01s and 35 U awards. Research Programs have been reduced to 16 and support is requested for 14 shared resources. Since the last CCSG renewal, research has been strengthened with recruitment of 97 tenured and tenure track faculty, of whom 18 are supported by recruitment awards from CPRIT totaling $63M. Team science has been enhanced through institutional support of the MD Anderson's Moon Shots ($383M), focused on reducing mortality from 13 major cancers through multi-disciplinary efforts that build on research emerging from the CCSG programs. In FY17, 10,283 participants were enrolled in 1,108 interventional clinical research protocols, of which 936 were treatment (therapeutic) studies that accrued 6,271 subjects. Over the past decade MD Anderson investigators have contributed to the clinical evaluation of 72 of 130 FDA oncology drug approvals, either as a new entity or for a new indication, with 41 of these approvals since the last CCSG renewal. In addition to the main hospital, Houston Area Locations provide prospective, multidisciplinary care and supportive services, with an increasing emphasis on access to clinical trials including national studies. Cancer prevention and survivorship is a priority for MD Anderson with an emphasis on molecular epidemiology, behavioral science, clinical cancer prevention and early detection research to reduce the burden of cancer within Texas and worldwide. PROJECT NARRATIVE: OVERVIEW Cancer affects 1 in every 3 people in the US and as our population ages this fraction is expected to increase.

"Stephenson Cancer Center - Cancer Center Support Grant OVERALL – ABSTRACT Oklahoma currently ranks 7th highest among all states for cancer mortality rates, and 2nd in cancer incidence and mortality rates among the 15 states currently without an NCI-designated cancer center. To address this cancer burden, the State passed bipartisan-supported legislation in 2001, directing the University of Oklahoma to create an academic cancer center that would provide statewide leadership in cancer education, prevention, treatment and research. Acting on this mandate, the University established the Stephenson Cancer Center (SCC), a matrix-based academic cancer center with a mission of reducing the burden of cancer in Oklahoma, a catchment area underserved by NCI-designated cancer centers. An essential partner in advancing this mission is the Oklahoma Medical Research Foundation (OMRF), the SCC's proposed consortium partner. Under the leadership of Robert Mannel, MD, who was appointed Director in 2006, the SCC has secured institutional and other commitments totaling $383.7 million of state, university and philanthropic dollars over the past ten years, which have been used to recruit new cancer researchers and oncology physicians, add new physical space, and develop formal research programs and new shared resources. The level of support for the SCC constitutes the largest public – private biomedical initiative ever launched in the State and has resulted in an academic cancer center that has achieved the following benchmarks during the reporting period (CY2016):   $18,371,115 in overall funding base (peer-reviewed, cancer-relevant) (direct costs).   $8,981,794 in NCI research and training funding (direct costs).   $34,234,985 in total funding (direct costs).   96 full and associate members, representing 32 different academic departments.   278,609 sf. of total physical space (research, clinical, administrative).   $33.1 million in annual discretionary funds under the control of the SCC Director.   2,727 newly diagnosed and treated patients, with 612 enrollments on interventional treatment trials. The SCC has developed an organizational structure and environment designed to promote transdisciplinary, team-based science, move ideas along the translational continuum and stimulate research that impacts the SCC catchment area. This structure includes three formal research programs: Preclinical Translational Cancer Research (PTCR), Gynecologic Cancers (GC) and Cancer Prevention and Control (CPC). SCC member research is supported by four formal shared resource facilities: Biostatistics and Research Design, Molecular Biology and Cytometry Research, Tissue Pathology and Mobile Health Technology. Centralized Clinical Protocol and Data Management, Data and Safety Monitoring, and Protocol Review and Monitoring functions oversee and support the SCC's robust clinical trials program. OVERALL – PROJECT NARRATIVE Oklahoma currently ranks 7th highest among all states for cancer mortality rates, and 2nd in cancer incidence and mortality rates among the 15 states currently without an NCI-designated cancer center.

As a free-standing 501(c)3 not-for-profit institution with the sole purpose “to contribute to the prevention and cure of cancer,” all research funding ($71.8M), publications (2,430), and clinical research (>1,600 interventional accruals/ year) are cancer focused. Research and clinical space has expanded dramatically since the last renewal to more than 2 million square feet, and patient clinical volume places MCC among the largest Centers in the United States. MCC has benefitted from recent, ongoing annual state legislature funding of approximately $25 million, in addition to more than $39 million of annual institutional research support. The 142 MCC members span the basic, clinical, and population sciences. They are organized into five highly collaborative, multidisciplinary programs with exceptional levels of intra- (35%) and inter-programmatic (18%) publications. Under the leadership of Dr. Thomas Sellers, the third MCC Director, a Research Strategic Plan (RSP) was developed and implemented for “Moffitt 3.0.” Four of six Associate Center Directors are new; and new leaders have been appointed in every program, with bold goals and specific aims. Two of the 13 shared resources have been significantly restructured (Chemical Biology, Molecular Genomics), and one new resource created (Collaborative Data Services) to better meet the changing needs of MCC scientists. Implementation of the strategic plan has been bolstered by substantial institutional investment, especially in basic science, immunotherapy, and clinical research infrastructure, including the recruitment of 45 new faculty members, of whom 32 are CCSG members. MCC is a leader in immunotherapy, and more than 40% of overall clinical trial accrual is to investigator-initiated studies.

"COMPREHENSIVE CANCER CENTER CORE SUPPORT GRANT ﻿PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTACT The UAB CCC is the only NCI designated comprehensive cancer center in the states of Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana and Arkansas, states with higher cancer mortality and significant minority, mostly African American populations. The Cancer Center is in its 44th year of NCI funding and continues its major contributions to translational therapeutics and cancer disparity research with a focus on training minority investigators. The UAB CCC has 242 members who come from 30 departments in 9 UAB schools, Southern Research, and HudsonAlpha Institute for Biotechnology. The members are supported by $92,055,777 in annual direct extramural funding. The UAB CCC is organized into six research programs, two each in basic, translational, and prevention and control – Inflammation, Immunology & Immunotherapeutics; Cancer Cell Biology; Experimental Therapeutics; Neuro-Oncology; Cancer Chemoprevention; and Cancer Control & Population Sciences. Members published 1,684 cancer focused, peer reviewed publications between 2011 and 2015 of which 24% were intra-programmatic, 16% inter-programmatic, and 53% inter-institutional. These members are supported by eleven shared facilities – Biostatistics & Bioinformatics, Comprehensive Genomics, High Resolution Imaging, Human Imaging, Mass Spectrometry/2D Proteomics, Microbiome/Gnotobiotic, Preclinical Imaging, Recruitment & Retention, Structural Biology, Tissue Procurement, and Transgenic Animals as well as the developing Pharmacometrics Shared Facility. We have established a Phase I Clinical Trials Program, opened an Advanced Imaging Facility, advanced targets through the Alabama Drug Discovery Alliance, created the UAB Health System Cancer Community Network, and are now a consortium with HudsonAlpha Institute for Biotechnology. In addition to these achievements, we have created an Institute for Cancer Outcomes and Survivorship, and established a critical mass of investigators in energy balance and cancer. We have also expanded our minority training programs that since 2005 have trained 59 scholars resulting in 306 publications, 67 grant submissions with 30 funded, and have had a major impact at Morehouse School of Medicine and Tuskegee University. We have recruited 47 investigators to multiple programs in the Cancer Center since 2010. Strategic plans developed in 2011 with crosscutting themes of Translational Therapeutics, Systems Biomedicine, and Energetics and Cancer continue to be highly relevant today. For the future, we will continue to emphasize translational and cancer disparity research with an emphasis on personalized/genomic medicine, energy balance and cancer, outcomes and survivorship, and early phase clinical trials. OVERALL COMPONENT PROJECT NARRATIVE The UAB CCC has made a significant contribution to public health that is particularly relevant to the populations served by this Cancer Center who are located in the heart of the Deep South. Our research programs, in addition to their important contributions to translational science, have focused on the unique problems seen in African American populations that include higher incidences and mortality rates from certain cancers, lower age appropriate screening rates, greater obesity from poor diets and less physical activity, greater tobacco use, and lack of access to

"Stephenson Cancer Center - Cancer Center Support Grant OVERALL – ABSTRACT Oklahoma currently ranks 7th highest among all states for cancer mortality rates, and 2nd in cancer incidence and mortality rates among the 15 states currently without an NCI-designated cancer center. To address this cancer burden, the State passed bipartisan-supported legislation in 2001, directing the University of Oklahoma to create an academic cancer center that would provide statewide leadership in cancer education, prevention, treatment and research. Acting on this mandate, the University established the Stephenson Cancer Center (SCC), a matrix-based academic cancer center with a mission of reducing the burden of cancer in Oklahoma, a catchment area underserved by NCI-designated cancer centers. An essential partner in advancing this mission is the Oklahoma Medical Research Foundation (OMRF), the SCC's proposed consortium partner. Under the leadership of Robert Mannel, MD, who was appointed Director in 2006, the SCC has secured institutional and other commitments totaling $383.7 million of state, university and philanthropic dollars over the past ten years, which have been used to recruit new cancer researchers and oncology physicians, add new physical space, and develop formal research programs and new shared resources. The level of support for the SCC constitutes the largest public – private biomedical initiative ever launched in the State and has resulted in an academic cancer center that has achieved the following benchmarks during the reporting period (CY2016):   $18,371,115 in overall funding base (peer-reviewed, cancer-relevant) (direct costs).   $8,981,794 in NCI research and training funding (direct costs).   $34,234,985 in total funding (direct costs).   96 full and associate members, representing 32 different academic departments.   278,609 sf. of total physical space (research, clinical, administrative).   $33.1 million in annual discretionary funds under the control of the SCC Director.   2,727 newly diagnosed and treated patients, with 612 enrollments on interventional treatment trials. The SCC has developed an organizational structure and environment designed to promote transdisciplinary, team-based science, move ideas along the translational continuum and stimulate research that impacts the SCC catchment area. This structure includes three formal research programs: Preclinical Translational Cancer Research (PTCR), Gynecologic Cancers (GC) and Cancer Prevention and Control (CPC). SCC member research is supported by four formal shared resource facilities: Biostatistics and Research Design, Molecular Biology and Cytometry Research, Tissue Pathology and Mobile Health Technology. Centralized Clinical Protocol and Data Management, Data and Safety Monitoring, and Protocol Review and Monitoring functions oversee and support the SCC's robust clinical trials program. OVERALL – PROJECT NARRATIVE Oklahoma currently ranks 7th highest among all states for cancer mortality rates, and 2nd in cancer incidence and mortality rates among the 15 states currently without an NCI-designated cancer center.

"University of New Mexico Cancer Center Support Grant ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Cancer Control (CaC) Research Program is a newly restructured transdisciplinary program that serves as the hub for cancer control and population science research within the University of New Mexico Cancer Center (UNMCC) and the State of New Mexico (NM), our catchment area. The Program's overall goal is to reduce cancer incidence, morbidity, and mortality, particularly in the unique multiethnic and underserved populations of NM. Disparities research is a cross-cutting theme that fosters scientific focus and synergy across the research areas. Through vigorous strategic program planning and evaluation, recruitment of 9 new investigators to enhance expertise in molecular epidemiology and behavioral/community intervention, and guidance of the UNMCC External Advisory Committee, the CaC Program is now focused on three areas of cancer research: 1) Risk Prediction and Risk Reduction; 2) Screening; and 3) Post-Diagnosis Outcomes and Survivorship. Unique scientific strengths include research addressing disparities (geographic, race/ethnic, socioeconomic, medically underserved), particularly in etiologic, outcome, and intervention studies in Hispanics. By drawing on established and new partnerships, the Program is also building research that addresses American Indian cancer disparities and priorities identified by NM Tribes, Pueblos, and Indian Nations. Major scientific accomplishments in Risk Prediction and Risk Reduction include the identification of social, lifestyle, and genetic factors associated with lung cancer risk; gene-environment interactions in melanoma risk; and development and dissemination of a novel telehealth strategy for the prevention of hepatocellular cancer. In Screening, members have developed a statewide surveillance program of screening and diagnosis for cervical pre-cancer and cancer that informs real- world cervical cancer prevention through human papilloma virus (HPV) vaccination, screening practice and outcomes. Members have also identified barriers to use of early detection tests in colorectal cancer and have developed strategies to overcome these barriers to improve screening in underserved populations. In Post- Diagnosis Outcomes and Survivorship, members have identified factors that contribute to disparities in post- treatment outcomes and survivorship in endometrial and breast cancer and are developing interventions. Led by Linda Cook, Ph.D. and Anita Kinney, Ph.D., RN, the CaC Program is comprised of 28 members (19 full and 9 associate) from 7 UNM schools and departments, the Lovelace Respiratory Institute, and the Indian Health Service Unit of the Centers for Disease Control whose work is supported by $19,276,863 million in annual direct cost funding, of which $15,429,911 million is peer-reviewed and $3,137,820 million is from NCI as of 9/1/2014. The discoveries made in this Program have resulted 294 publications, of which 19% are intra-programmatic collaborations and 16% are inter-programmatic collaborations; with a total UNMCC and external collaborative publication level of 30% and 80%, respectively. OVERALL COMPONENT: THE UNIVERSITY OF NEW MEXICO CANCER CENTER PROJECT NARRATIVE Designated as one of the nation's National Cancer Institute Cancer Centers since 2005, the University of New Mexico Cancer Center is a cancer treatment, research, and education and training center that applies the scientific expertise of its investigators to those cancers that have high incidence, mortality, or disparity in the multiethnic and underserved populations of New Mexico. The Center is a hub for promoting discovery through its research, education and training, clinical care, statewide outreach programs and networks for community participatory research. The Center connects scientists, healthcare professionals, and communities to translate its discoveries to cancer clinical trials, and cancer control and behavioral interventions that reduce the cancer burden of New Mexico and serve as a national model. The goal of the Center is to assure that all of the people in New Mexico, its catchment area, have access to high quality cancer care and collaborate in and benefit from advances in cancer research.",University of New Mexico Cancer Center Support Grant,9990095,P30CA118100,"['Scientific Advances and Accomplishments ', ' scientific advances ', ' scientific accomplishments ', ' Underrepresented Minority ', ' underrepresentation of minorities ', ' under-representation of minorities ', ' Underrepresented Ethnic Minority ', ' Characteristics ', ' socioeconomics ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socio-economically ', ' socio-economic ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Colorectal Cancer ', ' Colo-rectal Cancer ', ' Behavioral ', ' Pueblo Race ', ' Pueblo ', ' Health Professional ', ' Healthcare professional ', ' Health Care Professional ', ' working group ', ' work group ', ' community intervention ', ' anticancer research ', ' cancer research ', ' anti-cancer research ', ' Underserved Population ', ' underserved people ', ' under served population ', ' Clinical Trials Network ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' targeted delivery ', ' site targeted delivery ', ' Population ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' disparity in cancer ', ' cancer disparity ', ' medically underserved ', ' tumor ', ' neuro-oncology ', ' neurooncology ', ' clinical care ', ' undergraduate student ', ' undergraduate ', ' risk variant ', ' risk locus ', ' risk loci ', ' risk genotype ', ' risk gene ', ' risk allele ', ' Risk-associated variant ', ' screening ', ' Human Papilloma Virus Vaccination ', ' Human Papillomavirus Vaccination ', ' HPV Vaccination ', ' Adolescent and Young Adult ', ' cancer clinical trial ', ' mortality disparity ', ' disparities in mortality ', ' clinical translation ', ' recruit ', ' screening program ', ' Aftercare ', ' post treatment ', ' After-Treatment ', ' After Care ', ' American Indians ', ' American Indian ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' behavior intervention ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' CDC ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Communities ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Faculty ', ' Geography ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' liver carcinoma ', ' Liver Cells Carcinoma ', ' Hepatoma ', ' Hepatocellular cancer ', ' Hepatocellular Carcinoma ', ' Hepatocarcinoma ', ' Primary carcinoma of the liver cells ', ' Incidence ', ' Institutes ', ' interventions research ', ' interventional study ', ' interventional research ', ' intervention research ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' Laboratories ', ' Lifestyle ', ' Life Style ', ' Malignant Melanoma ', ' melanoma ', ' Mentors ', ' Mission ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity -

"Moffitt Cancer Center Support Grant PROJECT SUMMARY The H. Lee Moffitt Cancer Center & Research Institute (MCC) continues its ambitious trajectory of innovative cancer research and translation to benefit the gulf coast region of Florida and beyond. As a free-standing 501(c)3 not-for-profit institution with the sole purpose “to contribute to the prevention and cure of cancer,” all research funding ($71.8M), publications (2,430), and clinical research (>1,600 interventional accruals/ year) are cancer focused. Research and clinical space has expanded dramatically since the last renewal to more than 2 million square feet, and patient clinical volume places MCC among the largest Centers in the United States. MCC has benefitted from recent, ongoing annual state legislature funding of approximately $25 million, in addition to more than $39 million of annual institutional research support. The 142 MCC members span the basic, clinical, and population sciences. They are organized into five highly collaborative, multidisciplinary programs with exceptional levels of intra- (35%) and inter-programmatic (18%) publications. Under the leadership of Dr. Thomas Sellers, the third MCC Director, a Research Strategic Plan (RSP) was developed and implemented for “Moffitt 3.0.” Four of six Associate Center Directors are new; and new leaders have been appointed in every program, with bold goals and specific aims. Two of the 13 shared resources have been significantly restructured (Chemical Biology, Molecular Genomics), and one new resource created (Collaborative Data Services) to better meet the changing needs of MCC scientists. Implementation of the strategic plan has been bolstered by substantial institutional investment, especially in basic science, immunotherapy, and clinical research infrastructure, including the recruitment of 45 new faculty members, of whom 32 are CCSG members. MCC is a leader in immunotherapy, and more than 40% of overall clinical trial accrual is to investigator-initiated studies. MCC population scientists initiated significant new efforts in cancer prevention and outcomes that include vaccines, tobacco cessation, and health disparities. This is particularly true in the unique cancer problems in the catchment area – notably lung cancer, melanoma, and HPV- prevention. MCC's Total Cancer Care protocol, the ground-breaking research strategy to realize the promise of personalized medicine, has continued to thrive, resulting in dramatic utilization of the Tissue Core and the formation of the Oncology Research Information Exchange Network (ORIEN) that now includes eleven cancer centers across the nation, with several more poised to join the consortium this year. MCC requests funding for: five scientific programs, 13 shared resources, two clinical research components, planning and evaluation, administration, leadership, four staff investigators, and developmental funds. CCSG funds are leveraged more than 10-fold with institutional resources to maximize impact on cancer prevention, treatment, and cure in the catchment area, the state of Florida and beyond.

"University of New Mexico Cancer Center Support Grant ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Cancer Control (CaC) Research Program is a newly restructured transdisciplinary program that serves as the hub for cancer control and population science research within the University of New Mexico Cancer Center (UNMCC) and the State of New Mexico (NM), our catchment area. The Program's overall goal is to reduce cancer incidence, morbidity, and mortality, particularly in the unique multiethnic and underserved populations of NM. Disparities research is a cross-cutting theme that fosters scientific focus and synergy across the research areas. Through vigorous strategic program planning and evaluation, recruitment of 9 new investigators to enhance expertise in molecular epidemiology and behavioral/community intervention, and guidance of the UNMCC External Advisory Committee, the CaC Program is now focused on three areas of cancer research: 1) Risk Prediction and Risk Reduction; 2) Screening; and 3) Post-Diagnosis Outcomes and Survivorship. Unique scientific strengths include research addressing disparities (geographic, race/ethnic, socioeconomic, medically underserved), particularly in etiologic, outcome, and intervention studies in Hispanics. By drawing on established and new partnerships, the Program is also building research that addresses American Indian cancer disparities and priorities identified by NM Tribes, Pueblos, and Indian Nations. Major scientific accomplishments in Risk Prediction and Risk Reduction include the identification of social, lifestyle, and genetic factors associated with lung cancer risk; gene-environment interactions in melanoma risk; and development and dissemination of a novel telehealth strategy for the prevention of hepatocellular cancer. In Screening, members have developed a statewide surveillance program of screening and diagnosis for cervical pre-cancer and cancer that informs real- world cervical cancer prevention through human papilloma virus (HPV) vaccination, screening practice and outcomes. Members have also identified barriers to use of early detection tests in colorectal cancer and have developed strategies to overcome these barriers to improve screening in underserved populations. In Post- Diagnosis Outcomes and Survivorship, members have identified factors that contribute to disparities in post- treatment outcomes and survivorship in endometrial and breast cancer and are developing interventions. Led by Linda Cook, Ph.D. and Anita Kinney, Ph.D., RN, the CaC Program is comprised of 28 members (19 full and 9 associate) from 7 UNM schools and departments, the Lovelace Respiratory Institute, and the Indian Health Service Unit of the Centers for Disease Control whose work is supported by $19,276,863 million in annual direct cost funding, of which $15,429,911 million is peer-reviewed and $3,137,820 million is from NCI as of 9/1/2014. The discoveries made in this Program have resulted 294 publications, of which 19% are intra-programmatic collaborations and 16% are inter-programmatic collaborations; with a total UNMCC and external collaborative publication level of 30% and 80%, respectively. OVERALL COMPONENT: THE UNIVERSITY OF NEW MEXICO CANCER CENTER PROJECT NARRATIVE Designated as one of the nation's National Cancer Institute Cancer Centers since 2005, the University of New Mexico Cancer Center is a cancer treatment, research, and education and training center that applies the scientific expertise of its investigators to those cancers that have high incidence, mortality, or disparity in the multiethnic and underserved populations of New Mexico. The Center is a hub for promoting discovery through its research, education and training, clinical care, statewide outreach programs and networks for community participatory research. The Center connects scientists, healthcare professionals, and communities to translate its discoveries to cancer clinical trials, and cancer control and behavioral interventions that reduce the cancer burden of New Mexico and serve as a national model. The goal of the Center is to assure that all of the people in New Mexico, its catchment area, have access to high quality cancer care and collaborate in and benefit from advances in cancer

"Cancer Center Support Grant Project Summary Over the past 5 years, the Wake Forest Baptist Comprehensive Cancer Center (WFBCCC) has continued its upward trajectory in cancer research excellence and service to its catchment area. The WFBCCC catchment area includes the Piedmont and southern Appalachia, a region of 58 contiguous counties in North Carolina, Virginia, West Virginia and Tennessee. The majority of this region is rural and exhibits significant racial health disparities. Elevated age-adjusted smoking rates, obesity rates, cancer incidence, and cancer mortality are observed across the WFBCCC catchment area when compared with the rest of the U.S. To target these issues, the WFBCCC conducts cutting-edge basic, clinical, and population research on the prevention, detection and treatment of cancer, and translates this knowledge into strategies to improve patient outcomes and reduce the incidence of cancer. WFBCCC cancer research funding is $37.9 million, of which over $14.9 million comes from the NCI; this represents a 25.3% increase in total cancer funding since the last CCSG renewal. Center research space under the Director’s authority increased by approximately 65,000 square feet, and the WFBCCC clinical facilities have been dramatically enhanced with the completion of the new eleven- story Cancer Hospital in 2013. This building houses all oncology inpatients and outpatients. The Center’s 127 members span the basic, clinical and population sciences and are organized into 4 Programs with substantial inter-and intra-programmatic productivity. Faculty additions enhanced tobacco control, tobacco-related cancer research, and precision medicine. Substantial investment in faculty, technology, and informatics significantly expanded cancer genomics capabilities. Enrollment of patients into treatment trials reached an all-time high in 2015, with a large increase in the number of patients enrolled in investigator-initiated trials. WFBCCC population scientists initiated exciting new efforts in cancer prevention and survivorship. Clinical scientists completed practice-changing studies in patients with glioma and lung cancer. Groundbreaking observations in prostate cancer emerged from WFBCCC inter-programmatic collaborations. WFBCCC basic science Programs continued to make high impact observations that are being translated into human therapeutics. The WFBCCC requests continued CCSG funding for 4 scientific Programs; 7 Shared Resources; 2 clinical research components; administration and leadership; planning and evaluation; and developmental funds. With these funds, a talented faculty integrated throughout the Cancer Center will make advances in the prevention, early detection, and treatment of cancer in the WFBCCC catchment area and the nation. Project Narrative The Wake Forest Baptist Comprehensive Cancer Center (WFBCCC) is a matrix Cancer Center, which serves the people of the multistate Piedmont and southern Appalachian region.

"Stephenson Cancer Center - Cancer Center Support Grant OVERALL – ABSTRACT Oklahoma currently ranks 7th highest among all states for cancer mortality rates, and 2nd in cancer incidence and mortality rates among the 15 states currently without an NCI-designated cancer center. To address this cancer burden, the State passed bipartisan-supported legislation in 2001, directing the University of Oklahoma to create an academic cancer center that would provide statewide leadership in cancer education, prevention, treatment and research. Acting on this mandate, the University established the Stephenson Cancer Center (SCC), a matrix-based academic cancer center with a mission of reducing the burden of cancer in Oklahoma, a catchment area underserved by NCI-designated cancer centers. An essential partner in advancing this mission is the Oklahoma Medical Research Foundation (OMRF), the SCC's proposed consortium partner. Under the leadership of Robert Mannel, MD, who was appointed Director in 2006, the SCC has secured institutional and other commitments totaling $383.7 million of state, university and philanthropic dollars over the past ten years, which have been used to recruit new cancer researchers and oncology physicians, add new physical space, and develop formal research programs and new shared resources. The level of support for the SCC constitutes the largest public – private biomedical initiative ever launched in the State and has resulted in an academic cancer center that has achieved the following benchmarks during the reporting period (CY2016):   $18,371,115 in overall funding base (peer-reviewed, cancer-relevant) (direct costs).   $8,981,794 in NCI research and training funding (direct costs).   $34,234,985 in total funding (direct costs).   96 full and associate members, representing 32 different academic departments.   278,609 sf. of total physical space (research, clinical, administrative).   $33.1 million in annual discretionary funds under the control of the SCC Director.   2,727 newly diagnosed and treated patients, with 612 enrollments on interventional treatment trials. The SCC has developed an organizational structure and environment designed to promote transdisciplinary, team-based science, move ideas along the translational continuum and stimulate research that impacts the SCC catchment area. This structure includes three formal research programs: Preclinical Translational Cancer Research (PTCR), Gynecologic Cancers (GC) and Cancer Prevention and Control (CPC). SCC member research is supported by four formal shared resource facilities: Biostatistics and Research Design, Molecular Biology and Cytometry Research, Tissue Pathology and Mobile Health Technology. Centralized Clinical Protocol and Data Management, Data and Safety Monitoring, and Protocol Review and Monitoring functions oversee and support the SCC's robust clinical trials program.

"Georgetown University Lombardi Comprehensive Cancer Center Support Grant ABSTRACT The Georgetown Lombardi Comprehensive Cancer Center (LCCC) is the only NCI-designated comprehensive cancer center based in the nation’s capital. Led by Louis M. Weiner MD since 2008, LCCC’s vision is to prevent and cure cancer with a local focus and global impact. Our mission is to prevent, treat, and cure cancers by linking scientific discovery, expert and compassionate patient care, quality education, and partnership with the community, guided by the principle of cura personalis, “care for the whole person.” LCCC’s strategic objectives are to 1) advance transformative cancer research, 2) reduce the impact of cancer and diminish disparities in our catchment area, 3) lead high-impact clinical research, 4) ensure long-term growth, vibrancy and stability of the research enterprise, and 5) develop the next generation of cancer scientists, clinicians and educators. These objectives were furthered by LCCC’s deepening relationship with the John Theurer Cancer Center (JTCC) of Hackensack Meridian Health (HMH), a clinical and clinical research powerhouse that brings a substantial research base and extends LCCC’s impact. With this P30 competitive renewal application LCCC is applying as a CCSG consortium with JTCC, which meets CCSG FOA external funding requirements. The LCCC Consortium is comprised of Georgetown Lombardi Comprehensive Cancer Center, based in Washington, DC (LCCC-DC) and the John Theurer Cancer Center of Hackensack Meridian Health, based in Hackensack, NJ (LCCC-NJ). Accordingly, the LCCC catchment area is defined by the LCCC-DC and LCCC-NJ catchment areas. LCCC research is based in four research programs: Breast Cancer (BC), Cancer Prevention and Control (CPC), Experimental Therapeutics (ET) and Molecular Oncology (MO). Crosscutting initiatives in data science, minority health and health disparities, cancer precision medicine, immunotherapy and cancer survivorship focus and support the work of these programs. During the current CCSG funding cycle, LCCC employed a robust strategic planning process to develop and refine its research. LCCC conducts research that is practice changing, paradigm shifting and policy informing, with 114 members publishing 1,390 papers (18% with IF>8) during the current CCSG funding period. Current cancer-focused annual direct cost funding for LCCC members is $36,696,492 (of which $3,282,510 is from members based at LCCC-NJ). LCCC had 2,165 interventional clinical trial accruals from 2014-2017 in its DC catchment area, which consists of more than four million people in DC and each surrounding county in Maryland and Virginia. LCCC’s Bergen County NJ catchment area contains nearly 1 million residents. LCCC has increased opportunities for clinical research and care by serving these large, racially and ethnically diverse catchment areas, which suffer from excess mortality from breast, prostate, pancreas and liver cancers. Future plans include expansion of research addressing catchment areas’ needs, with a particular emphasis on hematologic malignancies and cellular therapy translational and clinical research. The Georgetown Lombardi Comprehensive Cancer Center (LCCC) is applying for this renewal of its CCSG as a consortium cancer center with the John Theurer Cancer Center of Hackensack Meridian Health.

"Medical University of South Carolina - Cancer Center Support Grant OVERALL: SUMMARY The Hollings Cancer Center (HCC) at the Medical University of South Carolina (MUSC) seeks renewal of its National Cancer Institute (NCI) designation via the P30 Cancer Center Support Grant (CCSG) mechanism. As South Carolina's (SC) leading academic medical center, MUSC is charged with building basic, translational, clinical, and population-based research programs that address the state's significant healthcare needs. The mission of the HCC is to reduce the cancer burden in SC through transformative research, patient care, prevention, and public policy. To accomplish this mission, HCC leadership built a robust, multidisciplinary center that includes 107 cancer scientists. Innovative, high-impact research is driven by HCC’s four research programs: Cancer Biology, Cancer Immunology, Developmental Cancer Therapeutics, and Cancer Control. The rapid pace of discovery and movement toward effective translational research is supported by five shared research resources: Lipidomics, Flow Cytometry & Cell Sorting, Cell & Molecular Imaging, Biorepository & Tissue Analysis, and Biostatistics. During the current project period, the HCC successfully leveraged CCSG funding and its NCI-designated cancer center status to harness, expand and improve the center’s research capabilities to decrease the state’s cancer burden. HCC supported recruitment of 26 new cancer scientists. The annual direct peer-reviewed extramural research funding (excluding training and career development awards) increased to $21.6M, with $10.5M from NCI. HCC boasts the state’s largest clinical trials operation that provides centralized support for conducting the most contemporary cancer trials. During the past year, the HCC recruited 1,266 patients to interventional studies and 254 patients to non-interventional studies. HCC made significant progress in overcoming the challenges inherent in recruiting racial and ethnic minorities to participate in research. In 2017, 33% of research participants were racial or ethnic minorities, with more than half residing in rural communities federally designated as medically underserved. This progress has been maintained for over two decades by progressive, HCC-led outreach, community engagement, and cancer education services. With the charge of training the next generation of diverse and exceptional cancer physicians and scientists, the center developed the state’s only comprehensive cancer education pipeline for learners across the entire education continuum, from high school through early professional career development. The HCC is committed to providing access to the latest research, educational, and clinical advances to all of South Carolina, and has never been better equipped to fulfill its mission. Led by a new center director appointed in 2017, the HCC will implement its 2023 strategic plan to advance scientific discovery, make impactful contributions to the understanding of cancer biology in a diverse population, and translate discoveries into transformative approaches to cancer control, diagnosis, treatment, and public policy.

"Cancer Center Support Grant Project Summary Over the past 5 years, the Wake Forest Baptist Comprehensive Cancer Center (WFBCCC) has continued its upward trajectory in cancer research excellence and service to its catchment area. The WFBCCC catchment area includes the Piedmont and southern Appalachia, a region of 58 contiguous counties in North Carolina, Virginia, West Virginia and Tennessee. The majority of this region is rural and exhibits significant racial health disparities. Elevated age-adjusted smoking rates, obesity rates, cancer incidence, and cancer mortality are observed across the WFBCCC catchment area when compared with the rest of the U.S. To target these issues, the WFBCCC conducts cutting-edge basic, clinical, and population research on the prevention, detection and treatment of cancer, and translates this knowledge into strategies to improve patient outcomes and reduce the incidence of cancer. WFBCCC cancer research funding is $37.9 million, of which over $14.9 million comes from the NCI; this represents a 25.3% increase in total cancer funding since the last CCSG renewal. Center research space under the Director’s authority increased by approximately 65,000 square feet, and the WFBCCC clinical facilities have been dramatically enhanced with the completion of the new eleven- story Cancer Hospital in 2013. This building houses all oncology inpatients and outpatients. The Center’s 127 members span the basic, clinical and population sciences and are organized into 4 Programs with substantial inter-and intra-programmatic productivity. Faculty additions enhanced tobacco control, tobacco-related cancer research, and precision medicine. Substantial investment in faculty, technology, and informatics significantly expanded cancer genomics capabilities. Enrollment of patients into treatment trials reached an all-time high in 2015, with a large increase in the number of patients enrolled in investigator-initiated trials. WFBCCC population scientists initiated exciting new efforts in cancer prevention and survivorship. Clinical scientists completed practice-changing studies in patients with glioma and lung cancer. Groundbreaking observations in prostate cancer emerged from WFBCCC inter-programmatic collaborations.

"Regional Oncology Research Center ABSTRACT The Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center (SKCCC) at Johns Hopkins is dedicated to cancer research, education and training, and care, with an overarching goal of expeditiously and strategically applying new knowledge to improve prevention, screening, detection, diagnosis and treatment of cancer in Maryland and throughout nation and the world. Through targeted outreach and research, cancer outcomes disparities are decreasing in SKCCC's catchment area, but they remain a challenge and a focus at SKCCC. This application requests continued Cancer Center Support Grant (CCSG) funding for SKCCC's Research Programs and Cores. The SKCCC comprises a multidisciplinary, interdepartmental center of The Johns Hopkins University (JHU), encompassing 34 departments in five schools. The scientific Programs of the SKCCC organize and orient the broad base of cancer research throughout JHU into teams focused on rapid translation to the clinic and to populations inside and outside its catchment area. Research conducted at SKCCC includes discovery research into the molecular genetics of human tumorigenesis, clinical trials of new cancer treatments and epidemiologic analyses of lifestyle influences on cancer mortality. The SKCCC is a leading cancer center that is providing insights into the fundamental nature of different cancers and elucidating the thousands of somatic genetic and epigenetic alterations that mark the differences from case to case. This body of work has fueled an emerging understanding that the ultimate control of cancer will require individualizing cancer care using approaches that can be deployed at a population scale. To accomplish this mission, SKCCC took critical input from its External Advisory Board and has strategically evolved since the last CCSG to: 1) augment the clinical and population impact of the discovery pipeline in cancer genetics, epigenetics and immunology generated by discipline-oriented Programs; 2) maximize the translational research output of disease-specific Programs, emphasizing the exploration of new concepts in scientifically driven clinical trials; and 3) position the population-oriented Program to identify, understand and overcome barriers responsible for disparities in cancer outcome in the catchment area. The nine SKCCC Research Programs include four discipline-oriented Programs: Cancer Biology (CB; Baylin, Velculescu), Cancer Immunology (CI; Pardoll, Drake), Cancer Molecular and Functional Imaging (CMFI; Bhujwalla, Pomper), and Cancer Chemical and Structural Biology (CCSB; Berger, Liu); four disease- specific Programs: Hematologic Malignancies and Bone Marrow Transplantation (HMBMT; Ambinder, Jones, Levis), Prostate Cancer (PC; Pienta, Denmeade, Lupold), Breast and Ovarian Cancer (BOC; Stearns, Shih), and Brain Cancer (BC; Grossman, Brem, Laterra); and one population-oriented Program: Cancer Prevention and Control (CPC; Platz, Roden). These Programs are supported by fifteen Cores, one developing Core (described in Developmental Funds) and a dedicated leadership team. PROJECT NARRATIVE (Public Health Relevance Statement) Cancer is a leading cause of death in the U.S. and throughout the world. With the tremendous medical advances over the past 50 years, the U.S. population's life expectancy has dramatically increased, but because the incidence of most cancers increases with age, cancers have become a profound challenge to the U.S. health care system. Minorities suffer a disproportionate burden of the cancer threat with disparate outcomes for many cancer types. To meet these challenges, dedicated cancer research at the SKCCC and elsewhere over the past 35 years has generated fundamental insights into the molecular mechanisms that cause human cancers to arise, progress and threaten life. These discoveries create new opportunities to improve screening, detection, diagnosis, prevention and treatment.",Regional Oncology Research Center,9944458,P30CA006973,"['Age ', ' ages ', ' Aging ', ' Bone Marrow Transplantation ', ' Bone Marrow Grafting ', ' Bone Marrow Transplant ', ' Marrow Transplantation ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Communities ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiologic ', ' epidemiological ', ' Genome ', ' Goals ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Heart Diseases ', ' Cardiac Diseases ', ' Cardiac Disorders ', ' heart disorder ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human Genetics ', ' Incidence ', ' Industry ', ' Equipment and supply inventories ', ' Inventory ', ' Leadership ', ' Life Expectancy ', ' Life Style ', ' Lifestyle ', ' Maryland ', ' Mission ', ' mortality ', ' Peer Review ', ' Productivity ', ' Publications ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Schools ', ' Testing ', ' Translating ', ' Translations ', ' Universities ', ' Molecular Genetics ', ' Caring ', ' Immunology ', ' Brain Cancer ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Brain ', ' Malignant neoplasm of brain ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Cancer Screening for Patients ', ' early cancer detection ', ' Screening for cancer ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' Chemical Structure ', ' Training ', ' insight ', ' Discipline ', ' Funding ', ' anti-cancer immunotherapy ', ' anticancer immunotherapy ', ' immune-based cancer therapies ', ' immunotherapy for cancer ', ' immunotherapy of cancer ', ' cancer immunotherapy ', ' Oncology Cancer ', ' Oncology ', ' cancer prevention ', ' Collaborations ', ' Genetic ', ' Malignant Cell ', ' cancer cell ', ' tool ', ' Nature ', ' Research Specimen ', ' Specimen ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Prostate ', ' Malignant prostatic tumor ', ' Prostate CA ', ' Prostate Cancer ', ' Prostatic Cancer ', ' Malignant neoplasm of prostate ', ' Hematologic Cancer ', ' Hematologic Malignancies ', ' Hematological Malignancies ', ' Hematological Neoplasms ', ' Hematological Tumor ', ' Hematopoietic Cancer ', ' Malignant Hematologic Neoplasm ', ' Hematologic Neoplasms ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' Immunes ', ' Immune ', ' Clinic ', ' Services ', ' Education and Training ', ' Training and Education ', ' structural biology ', ' biomedical scientist ', ' Human Biology ', ' Funding Source ', ' Funding Agency ', ' novel technologies ', ' new technology ', ' Prevention ', ' cancer genetics ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Interventional trial ', ' Intervention Trial ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Cancer Treatment ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Therapy ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Treatment ', ' anti-cancer therapy ', ' anticancer therapy ', ' cancer therapy ', ' cancer immunology ', ' neoplasm immunology ', ' tumor immunology ', ' cancer care ', ' Malignant Ovarian Neoplasm ', ' Malignant Ovarian Tumor ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Ovary ', ' Ovary Cancer ', ' ovarian cancer ', ' Malignant neoplasm of ovary ', ' Population Group ', ' Oncogenesis ', ' tumorigenesis ', ' Defect ', ' Detection ', ' Center for Cancer Research ', ' NCI Center for Cancer Research ', ' NIH RFA ', ' Request for Applications ', ' Resource Sharing ', ' Cancer Biology ', ' National Cancer Burden ', ' Cancer Burden ', ' Cancer Center ', ' CCSG ', ' Cancer Center Support Grant ', ' Cancer Control Science ', ' Cancer Control ', ' Catchment Area ', ' Comprehensive Cancer Center ', ' Epigenetic ', ' Epigenetic Change ', ' Epigenetic Mechanism ', ' Epigenetic Process ', ' Physiologic Imaging ', ' physiological imaging ', ' Functional Imaging ', ' Outreach Research ', ' Translational Science ', ' translation research ', ' Translational Research ', ' trend ', ' Molecular ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' molecule imaging ', ' molecular imaging ', ' Health Care Professional ', ' Healthcare professional ', ' Health Professional ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' Output ', ' cost ', ' anti-cancer research ', ' cancer research ', ' anticancer research ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' cancer type ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' cancer disparity ', ' disparity in cancer ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' public health relevance ', ' screening ', ' individualized cancer care ', ' personalized oncology ', ' precision cancer care ', ' precision cancer medicine ', ' precision oncology ', ' Therapeutic Trials ', ' ']",NCI,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,P30,2020,7070833,0.06487360236209873

Mark Evers (CS) in 2009 have supported significant research and resource expansion, enabling substantial new faculty recruitment, program development, renovation of clinical and shared resource space, and new state-of-the art instrumentation, as well as statewide education and community outreach efforts. The 119 MCC members draw from 28 departments in 8 UK colleges, with 28 new faculty recruited since 2013. Cancer-relevant research funding to MCC investigators exceeds $38.7M in total annual costs, an increase of $10.3M since 2012. Over the last 4 years, 9,357 subjects have been accrued to interventional trials. Members have published 851 cancer-focused publications since 2013, reflecting 28% intra-programmatic, 16% inter-programmatic, and 58% inter-institutional collaborations. Research is conducted within 4 MCC Research Programs: Cancer Cell Biology and Signaling; Cancer Prevention and Control; Drug Discovery, Delivery and Translational Therapeutics; and Genomic Instability, Epigenetics and Metabolism. Five Shared Resource Facilities (SRFs) facilitate cutting-edge research by providing robust infrastructure for specialized expertise and advanced methods: Biospecimen Procurement and Translational Pathology; Biostatistics and Bioinformatics; Cancer Research Informatics; Flow Cytometry and Cell Sorting; and Redox Metabolism. Two new SRFs (Behavioral and Community-Based Research and Oncogenomics) are in development. Significant achievements include: development of an NCI-sponsored early therapeutics program, including an active Molecular Tumor Board and Precision Medicine Center; expansion of the MCC Network from 8 to 24 sites; establishment of a regional Metabolomics Center (U24); award of 2 new cancer-related centers – a Center of Biomedical Research Excellence (COBRE) in Cancer and Metabolism and a Center for Appalachian Research in Environmental Sciences; and expansion of community outreach/education initiatives across the state. MCC research focuses on Kentucky's most serious cancer burdens with emphasis on the “distressed” Appalachian Kentucky region, where cancer incidence and mortality rates surpass those for the entire state. The MCC brings unique basic, clinical, and population research strengths to this mission. These strengths are integral to all MCC programs and collectively provide robust capacity to deliver transformative interventional research to an important underserved priority population, thereby contributing to national efforts to conquer cancer through discovery and clinical translation, cancer prevention, and community outreach. PROJECT NARRATIVE  The Markey Cancer Center, the only NCI-designated Cancer Center serving 4.4 million Kentuckians in its statewide catchment area, has the institutional authority for all cancer-relevant activities at the University of Kentucky (UK) and within the UK HealthCare enterprise. The center's mission is to reduce cancer incidence and mortality through an integrated, comprehensive program of cancer research, treatment, education, prevention and community engagement. Thus, the Markey Cancer Center delivers in-depth and impactful research programs in basic, translational, and population science, including the development of clinical trials to address Kentucky's unique cancer burden and to accelerate “bench-to-bedside” translational outcomes that will reduce serious health disparities and significantly impact patients, the state and the nation.",University of

Research and clinical space has expanded dramatically since the last renewal to more than 2 million square feet, and patient clinical volume places MCC among the largest Centers in the United States. MCC has benefitted from recent, ongoing annual state legislature funding of approximately $25 million, in addition to more than $39 million of annual institutional research support. The 142 MCC members span the basic, clinical, and population sciences. They are organized into five highly collaborative, multidisciplinary programs with exceptional levels of intra- (35%) and inter-programmatic (18%) publications. Under the leadership of Dr. Thomas Sellers, the third MCC Director, a Research Strategic Plan (RSP) was developed and implemented for “Moffitt 3.0.” Four of six Associate Center Directors are new; and new leaders have been appointed in every program, with bold goals and specific aims. Two of the 13 shared resources have been significantly restructured (Chemical Biology, Molecular Genomics), and one new resource created (Collaborative Data Services) to better meet the changing needs of MCC scientists. Implementation of the strategic plan has been bolstered by substantial institutional investment, especially in basic science, immunotherapy, and clinical research infrastructure, including the recruitment of 45 new faculty members, of whom 32 are CCSG members.

"Cancer Center Support Grant Abstract: Overall The UPMC Hillman Cancer Center (HCC) at University of Pittsburgh is a matrix cancer center, currently led by Robert L. Ferris, MD, PhD, who has served as Director of HCC since 2017. With funding from the National Cancer Institute and other peer- and non-peer-reviewed sources, HCC conducts impactful basic, clinical/translational, and population science research that is changing the way we detect, diagnose, and treat cancer. Through our research and community outreach efforts, we address the needs and disparities of cancer patients and those who are at risk of developing cancer in our 29-county western Pennsylvania catchment area, and through our strong efforts in educating and training new cancer researchers and clinicians, we are ensuring that those needs will continue to be met in the years to come. HCC integrates the expertise and resources of the University of Pittsburgh, a top-5 institution in NIH funding, and UPMC, one of our nation’s largest health care systems, to provide our 280 members with state-of-the-art facilities and equipment, and numerous opportunities for interaction and collaboration. Organized into 7 research programs focused on Cancer Biology, Genome Stability, Cancer Virology, Cancer Immunology and Immunotherapy, Cancer Therapeutics, Cancer Epidemiology and Prevention, and Biobehavioral Cancer Control, our members published over 4,000 articles and enrolled more than 12,700 adult and pediatric patients onto interventional clinical trials from 2014-2018. These efforts were enabled by our 10 shared resources and extensive infrastructure for supporting clinical research at central academic and community network sites. HCC is guided by an experienced Senior Leadership Team of Deputy and Associate Directors who join Dr. Ferris in overseeing our science and operations.

"Stephenson Cancer Center - Cancer Center Support Grant OVERALL – ABSTRACT Oklahoma currently ranks 7th highest among all states for cancer mortality rates, and 2nd in cancer incidence and mortality rates among the 15 states currently without an NCI-designated cancer center. To address this cancer burden, the State passed bipartisan-supported legislation in 2001, directing the University of Oklahoma to create an academic cancer center that would provide statewide leadership in cancer education, prevention, treatment and research. Acting on this mandate, the University established the Stephenson Cancer Center (SCC), a matrix-based academic cancer center with a mission of reducing the burden of cancer in Oklahoma, a catchment area underserved by NCI-designated cancer centers. An essential partner in advancing this mission is the Oklahoma Medical Research Foundation (OMRF), the SCC's proposed consortium partner. Under the leadership of Robert Mannel, MD, who was appointed Director in 2006, the SCC has secured institutional and other commitments totaling $383.7 million of state, university and philanthropic dollars over the past ten years, which have been used to recruit new cancer researchers and oncology physicians, add new physical space, and develop formal research programs and new shared resources. The level of support for the SCC constitutes the largest public – private biomedical initiative ever launched in the State and has resulted in an academic cancer center that has achieved the following benchmarks during the reporting period (CY2016):   $18,371,115 in overall funding base (peer-reviewed, cancer-relevant) (direct costs).   $8,981,794 in NCI research and training funding (direct costs).   $34,234,985 in total funding (direct costs).   96 full and associate members, representing 32 different academic departments.   278,609 sf. of total physical space (research, clinical, administrative).   $33.1 million in annual discretionary funds under the control of the SCC Director.   2,727 newly diagnosed and treated patients, with 612 enrollments on interventional treatment trials. The SCC has developed an organizational structure and environment designed to promote transdisciplinary, team-based science, move ideas along the translational continuum and stimulate research that impacts the SCC catchment area. This structure includes three formal research programs: Preclinical Translational Cancer Research (PTCR), Gynecologic Cancers (GC) and Cancer Prevention and Control (CPC). SCC member research is supported by four formal shared resource facilities: Biostatistics and Research Design, Molecular Biology and Cytometry Research, Tissue Pathology and Mobile Health Technology. Centralized Clinical Protocol and Data Management, Data and Safety Monitoring, and Protocol Review and Monitoring functions oversee and support the SCC's robust clinical trials program.

"University of Arizona Cancer Center - Cancer Center Support Grant Project Summary / Abstract: Overall The University of Arizona Cancer Center (UACC) in Tucson, Arizona has been an NCI-designated Cancer Center since 1978 and a Comprehensive Cancer Center since 1990. It was founded as a matrix center within the University of Arizona (UA), and its members represent 43 Colleges and 11 Departments. In 2014, the UACC was elevated to a status equivalent to that of a College, reporting directly to the Senior Vice President of Health Sciences. At this time, Andrew S. Kraft, MD, was appointed Director of the UACC. With authority for all cancer-related activities at the UA, he is spearheading the utilization of the significant Institutional support to enhance the Program. This includes the recently completed $100M 220,000 square foot outpatient clinic in Phoenix, which will greatly enhance translational research, an expansion of basic research space with occupancy of 20,000 square feet within two years, and an Institutional Commitment of $232M dollars over the next five years. The functionality of the Center has been enhanced by optimization of the Administration and Senior Leadership infrastructure. The UACC Strategic Plan for 2015–2020 calls for the continuation of the highly innovative and impactful team science based on four robust cornerstone Programs: Cancer Biology, Cancer Imaging, Therapeutic Development, and Cancer Prevention and Control. Strategic recruitment and pilot funding is focused on team building, including development of inter-programmatic collaborations and movement of research into the clinic. The UACC will continue to invest in its eight integrated Shared Resources that enhance the capabilities of UACC investigators in basic, prevention, translational, and clinical research, and another in development. The Clinical Trials Office has been strengthened, and investments supporting precision medicine initiatives are ongoing. The UACC is the only major academic Cancer Center in a 400 square mile area of driving distance and is committed to serving the residents in this region and its direct catchment area of southern Arizona. Thus, it has a focus on skin cancer and arsenic exposure as well as the needs of Hispanics, Native Americans, the elderly, and the economically disadvantaged. It has established a robust infrastructure of international, national, and regional collaborations and outreach programs together with research spanning epidemiology, genetics, epigenetics, cell biology, and signaling mechanisms, as well as targeted interventions and understudied survivorship issues. To capture the emerging synergies, the positions of Associate Director of Cancer Disparities and Associate Director of Precision Medicine and Bioinformatics have been created and filled by nationally recognized experts. The UACC emphasis on inclusive training of the next generation of cancer researchers has had demonstrable success in graduation of Native American and Latinos. The research generated by UACC members is characterized by its impact, its relevance to the catchment area, and its innovation. The Strategic Plan builds on the work that has resulted in 1,756 cancer- related publications in the reporting period and its current portfolio of $44M in peer-reviewed support. Project Narrative The University of Arizona Cancer Center (UACC) in Tucson, Arizona has been an NCI-designated Cancer Center since 1978 and a Comprehensive Cancer Center since 1990.

"The Sylvester Cancer Center Support Grant PROJECT SUMMARY: OVERALL The Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center (Sylvester) at the University of Miami seeks National Cancer Institute (NCI) designation to support its mission to reduce the human burden from cancer through research, education, prevention, and the delivery of quality patient care. Sylvester, the only academic Cancer Center located in South Florida, serves one of the most diverse catchment areas in the US. This four-county region (Broward, Miami-Dade, Monroe, and Palm Beach Counties), commonly known as South Florida, is home to more than six million residents and is characterized by substantial ethnic, cultural, racial, and socioeconomic diversity, reflected in the individuals treated by Sylvester and those affected by its outreach efforts. Led by Stephen D. Nimer, MD since 2012, Sylvester leadership has assembled a highly collaborative group of investigators that now includes 114 cancer scientists from three University Schools and Colleges. Sylvester’s research is organized into three Research Programs—Cancer Control, Cancer Epigenetics, and Tumor Biology. These programs are unified by crosscutting scientific themes and by Sylvester’s broader mission to address the cancer burden and disparities prevalent in its catchment area. Sylvester has invested heavily in these Research Programs and in four state-of-the-art shared resources that support Sylvester’s cancer researchers: the Biostatistics and Bioinformatics, Onco-Genomics, Flow Cytometry, and Behavioral and Community-Based Research Shared Resources. Sylvester has also invested heavily in its clinical research infrastructure, which has led to a dramatic increase in interventional treatment accruals (from 75 in 2011 to 509 in 2017), with more than 50% of the 4,568 patient accruals in 2017 representing racial/ethnic minorities. The University has made a substantial commitment to advancing Sylvester’s research capabilities since 2012, supporting the recruitment of 41 cancer researchers and doubling Cancer Center space. Sylvester has also expanded its pre- and post-doctoral training efforts across the clinical, basic, translational, and population sciences, which have been rewarded with five recently awarded NIH or NCI-funded T32 training grants, a U54 grant with a significant training component, and a Paul Calabresi K12 grant. Finally, Sylvester has invested roughly $5.7M in its Intramural Funding Program from 2014 to 2018, which has yielded $25.2M in peer-reviewed funding. Today, Sylvester has $38M in extramural research funding (including training grants), which includes $11M from the NCI; this represents a 12% and 64% increase, respectively, over the past year. These impressive achievements have created a culture and environment that enable Sylvester scientists to make valuable contributions to the understanding of cancer biology and the development of novel approaches to cancer prevention, diagnosis, and treatment. PROJECT NARRATIVE: OVERALL Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center (Sylvester), the only academic Cancer Center in South Florida, plays a unique role, serving as a source of discovery and innovation in cancer research, outreach, engagement, prevention, diagnosis, treatment—and hope—for those living in its incredibly diverse catchment area.

"University of New Mexico Cancer Center Support Grant ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Cancer Control (CaC) Research Program is a newly restructured transdisciplinary program that serves as the hub for cancer control and population science research within the University of New Mexico Cancer Center (UNMCC) and the State of New Mexico (NM), our catchment area. The Program's overall goal is to reduce cancer incidence, morbidity, and mortality, particularly in the unique multiethnic and underserved populations of NM. Disparities research is a cross-cutting theme that fosters scientific focus and synergy across the research areas. Through vigorous strategic program planning and evaluation, recruitment of 9 new investigators to enhance expertise in molecular epidemiology and behavioral/community intervention, and guidance of the UNMCC External Advisory Committee, the CaC Program is now focused on three areas of cancer research: 1) Risk Prediction and Risk Reduction; 2) Screening; and 3) Post-Diagnosis Outcomes and Survivorship. Unique scientific strengths include research addressing disparities (geographic, race/ethnic, socioeconomic, medically underserved), particularly in etiologic, outcome, and intervention studies in Hispanics. By drawing on established and new partnerships, the Program is also building research that addresses American Indian cancer disparities and priorities identified by NM Tribes, Pueblos, and Indian Nations. Major scientific accomplishments in Risk Prediction and Risk Reduction include the identification of social, lifestyle, and genetic factors associated with lung cancer risk; gene-environment interactions in melanoma risk; and development and dissemination of a novel telehealth strategy for the prevention of hepatocellular cancer. In Screening, members have developed a statewide surveillance program of screening and diagnosis for cervical pre-cancer and cancer that informs real- world cervical cancer prevention through human papilloma virus (HPV) vaccination, screening practice and outcomes. Members have also identified barriers to use of early detection tests in colorectal cancer and have developed strategies to overcome these barriers to improve screening in underserved populations. In Post- Diagnosis Outcomes and Survivorship, members have identified factors that contribute to disparities in post- treatment outcomes and survivorship in endometrial and breast cancer and are developing interventions. Led by Linda Cook, Ph.D. and Anita Kinney, Ph.D., RN, the CaC Program is comprised of 28 members (19 full and 9 associate) from 7 UNM schools and departments, the Lovelace Respiratory Institute, and the Indian Health Service Unit of the Centers for Disease Control whose work is supported by $19,276,863 million in annual direct cost funding, of which $15,429,911 million is peer-reviewed and $3,137,820 million is from NCI as of 9/1/2014. The discoveries made in this Program have resulted 294 publications, of which 19% are intra-programmatic collaborations and 16% are inter-programmatic collaborations; with a total UNMCC and external collaborative publication level of 30% and 80%, respectively. OVERALL COMPONENT: THE UNIVERSITY OF NEW MEXICO CANCER CENTER PROJECT NARRATIVE Designated as one of the nation's National Cancer Institute Cancer Centers since 2005, the University of New Mexico Cancer Center is a cancer treatment, research, and education and training center that applies the scientific expertise of its investigators to those cancers that have high incidence, mortality, or disparity in the multiethnic and underserved populations of New Mexico. The Center is a hub for promoting discovery through its research, education and training, clinical care, statewide outreach programs and networks for community participatory research. The Center connects scientists, healthcare professionals, and communities to translate its discoveries to cancer clinical trials, and cancer control and behavioral interventions that reduce the cancer burden of New Mexico and serve as a national model. The goal of the Center is to assure that all of the people in New Mexico, its catchment area, have access to high quality cancer care and collaborate in and benefit from advances in cancer

"Cancer Center Support Grant PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT MD Anderson Cancer Center is a comprehensive cancer center established within the University of Texas System in 1941. In 2017, the institution welcomed Peter Pisters, MD, as its fifth full-time president and PI of the CCSG. The mission of MD Anderson is to eliminate cancer in Texas, the nation and the world through outstanding programs that integrate patient care, research and prevention, and through education for undergraduate and graduate students, trainees, professionals, employees and the public. MD Anderson is dedicated wholly to the study of cancer involving a continuum of basic, clinical and population-based investigation, with an emphasis on multidisciplinary translational research. MD Anderson employed more than 19,530 people in FY17, including 1,743 faculty members, of whom 705 (40%) are CCSG program members. More than 137,000 people sought care at MD Anderson in FY17 of whom 20,839 were newly diagnosed cancer patients. Annual citations in Web of Science have increased 23% from 3,260 in 2013, to 4,009 in 2017, including 686 (17%) articles in journals with an impact factor >10, and 244 (6%) articles in journals with an impact factor >20. The total research budget increased 26% from $671M in 2013 to $844M in 2017. Direct cost NCI research grant support, excluding training grants and the CCSG, has increased 34%, from $67M in 2013 to $90M in 2018, with the largest number of NCI grants for any institution (>200), including 6 SPOREs, 4 P01s and 35 U awards. Research Programs have been reduced to 16 and support is requested for 14 shared resources. Since the last CCSG renewal, research has been strengthened with recruitment of 97 tenured and tenure track faculty, of whom 18 are supported by recruitment awards from CPRIT totaling $63M. Team science has been enhanced through institutional support of the MD Anderson's Moon Shots ($383M), focused on reducing mortality from 13 major cancers through multi-disciplinary efforts that build on research emerging from the CCSG programs. In FY17, 10,283 participants were enrolled in 1,108 interventional clinical research protocols, of which 936 were treatment (therapeutic) studies that accrued 6,271 subjects. Over the past decade MD Anderson investigators have contributed to the clinical evaluation of 72 of 130 FDA oncology drug approvals, either as a new entity or for a new indication, with 41 of these approvals since the last CCSG renewal. In addition to the main hospital, Houston Area Locations provide prospective, multidisciplinary care and supportive services, with an increasing emphasis on access to clinical trials including national studies. Cancer prevention and survivorship is a priority for MD Anderson with an emphasis on molecular epidemiology, behavioral science, clinical cancer prevention and early detection research to reduce the burden of cancer within Texas and worldwide. PROJECT NARRATIVE: OVERVIEW Cancer affects 1 in every 3 people in the US and as our population ages this fraction is expected to increase. Outcomes for cancer patients have improved over the last several decades, but there is still a great burden of cancer-related mortality and morbidity that is borne disproportionately by minorities and the economically disadvantaged. MD Anderson Cancer Center's mission is to eliminate cancer in Texas, the nation and the world through outstanding programs that integrate patient care, research and prevention, and through education for undergraduate and graduate students, trainees, professionals, employees and the public. Our vision is to be the premier cancer center in the world based on the excellence of our people, our research-driven patient care and our science.",Cancer Center Support Grant,9997787,P30CA016672,"['Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Award ', ' Behavioral Sciences ', ' Biology ', ' Budgets ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Communities ', ' E-learning ', ' computer-assisted instruction ', ' computer-based education ', ' computer-based instruction ', ' computer-based learning ', ' computer-based training ', ' digital education ', ' digital learning ', ' eLearning ', ' electronic learning ', ' internet-assisted education ', ' internet-based training ', ' multimedia learning ', ' on-line education ', ' on-line learning ', ' online education ', ' online learning ', ' technology-enhanced learning ', ' virtual learning ', ' web-based instruction ', ' web-based training ', ' Educational Curriculum ', ' Curriculum ', ' lesson plans ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Faculty ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Grant ', ' Hospitals ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Investments ', ' Laboratories ', ' Learning ', ' Mentorship ', ' Mission ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Patients ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Science ', ' survivorship ', ' Technology ', ' Texas ', ' Time ', ' Training Programs ', ' Translations ', ' Universities ', ' Vision ', ' Sight ', ' visual function ', ' Generations ', ' Moon ', ' Caring ', ' Immunology ', ' Magazine ', ' Journals ', ' Drug Approval ', ' base ', ' human subject ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Clinical Research Protocols ', ' Molecular Epidemiology ', ' Training ', ' insight ', ' Interdisciplinary Research ', ' Multidisciplinary Collaboration ', ' Multidisciplinary Research ', ' Interdisciplinary Study ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R01 Program ', ' Research Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Oncology Cancer ', ' Oncology ', ' cancer prevention ', ' WWW ', ' web ', ' world wide web ', ' Internet ', ' Collaborations ', ' Research Specimen ', ' Specimen ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Investigation ', ' Clinic ', ' System ', ' Location ', ' Services ', ' Education and Training ', ' Training and Education ', ' cancer risk ', ' early detection ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' Employee ', ' Participant ', ' member ', ' Basic Research ', ' Basic Science ', ' graduate student ', ' Economically Deprived ', ' economic disadvantage ', ' economically disadvantaged ', ' underclass ', ' Economically Deprived Population ', ' Prevention ', ' cancer genetics ', ' Modeling ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Institution ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Direct Costs ', ' NCI-Designated Cancer Center ', ' Population-based research ', ' Population-level research ', ' Population Research ', ' Population Sciences ', ' Research Training ', ' Resource Sharing ', ' Therapy Research ', ' Therapeutic Studies ', ' Cancer Biology ', ' National Cancer Burden ', ' Cancer Burden ', ' Cancer Center ', ' CCSG ', ' Cancer Center Support Grant ', ' Cancer Control Science ', ' Cancer Control ', ' Cancer Patient ', ' Cancer Survivorship ', ' Catchment Area ', ' Clinical Evaluation ', ' Clinical Testing ', ' clinical test ', ' research clinical testing ', ' Comprehensive Cancer Center ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Epigenetic ', ' Epigenetic Change ', ' Epigenetic Mechanism ', ' Epigenetic Process ', ' Newly Diagnosed ', ' Translational Science ', ' translation research ', ' Translational Research ', ' MDACC ', ' University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center ', ' University of Texas M D Anderson Cancer Center ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' anti-cancer research ', ' cancer research ', ' anticancer research ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' prospective ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' cancer disparity ', ' disparity in cancer ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' resistant ', ' Resistance ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' intervention design ', ' treatment design ', ' therapy design ', ' effective intervention ', ' evidence base ', ' population based ', ' standard of care ', ' treatment strategy ', ' clinical practice ', ' operation ', ' undergraduate education ', ' undergraduate ', ' undergraduate student ', ' tenure process ', ' tenure track ', ' targeted agent ', ' recruit ', ' cancers that are rare ', ' rare malignancy ', ' rare tumor ', ' rare cancer ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF TX MD ANDERSON CAN CTR,P30,2020,11029670,0.062411161569846677

"Specialized Cancer Center Support Grant OVERALL ABSTRACT Founded in 1977 by John Mendelsohn, the Cancer Center at University of California San Diego (UCSD) has been continuously funded by the NCI Cancer Center Support Grant (CCSG) since 1978 and has held Comprehensive status since 2001. As the only NCI-designated Comprehensive Cancer Center in San Diego County, the mission of Moores Cancer Center (MCC) is to reduce the impact of cancer in the region and beyond by fostering scientific discovery, research training, and interdisciplinary care. Our goal is to create, translate, and deliver high-impact discoveries and innovations in cancer prevention and care through a deep understanding of the needs of the catchment area, and prepare the next generation of cancer researchers. Accordingly, MCC’s aims are to: 1) Elucidate the biology of cancer and catalyze trans-disciplinary team science across the science spectrum; 2) Develop and test innovative preventive, diagnostic, and therapeutic approaches; 3) Conduct cancer prevention and control research to reduce cancer disparities in vulnerable populations; 4) Provide underrepresented minorities with access to cutting edge multi-disciplinary care; 5) Provide training and education across the trainee continuum; and 6) Develop and implement community-based cancer education and outreach programs. To this end, MCC brings together 232 members from 5 UCSD Schools (Medicine, Engineering, Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Physical Sciences and Biological Sciences) and 2 consortium partners (one existing: San Diego State University, and one new: La Jolla Institute). Furthermore, MCC integrates the resources of UCSD Health Sciences and its affiliated hospitals in the UCSD Health System for a unified approach to cancer research and clinical care. MCC fulfills its mission through the activities of its 5 Research Programs (Cancer Biology and Signaling, Structural and Functional Genomics, Solid Tumor Therapeutics, Hematological Malignancies, and Cancer Control) that are supported by 7 Shared Resources (Flow Cytometry, Microscopy, Transgenic Mouse, Biostatistics, Genomics and Computational Biology, Biorepository and Tissue Technology, and Biobehavioral), and infrastructure provided by Community Outreach, Training and Education, Clinical Protocol and Data Management, and Protocol Review and Monitoring. Under the leadership of Dr. Scott Lippman, Center Director and Associate Vice- Chancellor for Cancer Research and Care, MCC has seen tremendous growth. During the project period, MCC members authored 3931 cancer-relevant research articles, and in 2017 were supported by $128.2 million (DC) in annual cancer-relevant peer-reviewed funding (8% increase); and the total annualized cancer-relevant research base was $148.5M, an increase of 11% from the previous project period by lateral comparison. Collaborative peer-reviewed grant funding also increased from annual total costs of $65.9M in 2013 to $69.9M in 2017 (6% increase). Importantly, 33 of MCC’s scientific discoveries were translated to the clinic through 41 investigator-initiated clinical trials, a 14-fold increase from the previous project period. OVERALL NARRATIVE MCC’s mission is to reduce the impact of cancer to the catchment area and beyond by discovering, translating, and delivering high-impact innovations in interdisciplinary cancer prevention and care, and prepare the next generation of cancer researchers.

"Indiana University Melvin and Bren Simon Cancer Center Support Grant ABSTRACT, Overview and Essential Characteristics The IU Simon Cancer Center is an NCI-designated Cancer Center that is dedicated to cancer research, education, and patient care for the citizens of Indiana and beyond. Since our last review, the IUSCC has substantially increased the depth and breadth of our science and cancer relevant research as evidenced by over a 38% increase in NCI funding (Direct Costs), a 176% increase in our multi-PI grants while attracting over 30 new investigators in cancer research to our institution. We are the home to the country's first pathway-driven SPORE that focuses on pediatric tumors and the birthplace to three active cancer consortia, including one that links researchers from North America and sub-Saharan Africa. The IUSCC is composed of two basic programs, Hematopoiesis and Hematologic Malignancies (HHM) and Tumor Microenvironment and Metastasis (TMM), and two translational programs, Experimental and Developmental Therapeutics (EDT) and Cancer Prevention and Control (CPC). We define our catchment area as the entire state of Indiana as patients come from each of the 92 counties and 89% of the counties have at least one patient entered on clinical trials. Our community outreach and engagement activities have focused on the urban and rural populations of Indiana with the diseases with the highest mortality in the state, (i.e. lung, breast and gastrointestinal cancers) as well as behavioral risk factors, which adversely impact screening and prevention (e.g. tobacco and HPV vaccinations). We focus on developing novel approaches for screening, treatment and symptom science using ""precision medicine"" and expanding work in bioinformatics and medical informatics to address the increasing complexity of understanding the genomic and clinical data. We embrace the vision of increasing the research workforce in Indiana and globally through education from ""Teens-to-Tenure"" and the integration of clinical and translational research in our strategic plan. This strategic plan, which has its underpinnings with education and impact to our catchment area, is composed of four pillars that are foundational to the IUSCC. These pillars include: 1) Biology to Bedside Research; 2); Precision Medicine; 3) Prevention, Early Detection and Population Health: Local-Global Approaches; and 4) Health Care Disparities, Survivorship, and Symptom Science.

"University of Hawaii Cancer Center CCSG ABSTRACT  The mission of the University of Hawai‘i Cancer Center (UHCC) is to reduce the burden of cancer through research, education, patient care and community outreach with an emphasis on the unique ethnic, cultural and environmental characteristics of Hawai‘i and the Pacific. To accomplish this mission, UHCC is organized into two cancer research programs: Population Sciences in the Pacific (PSP) and Cancer Biology (CB). Programs are each organized with two components spanning the study of basic mechanism and etiologies of cancer to addressing targets and interventions in order to translate discovery to the population it serves. Within its programs, UHCC has a strong foundation of cancer research with over $15 million in peer-reviewed funding, 72.5% of which is from the NCI. PSP has 28 full members and CB has 20 full members who are highly collaborative as evidenced by a high percentage of intra- and inter-programmatic, and inter-institutional, research collaborations and publications. To facilitate successful attainment of research goals, UHCC supports five shared resources: Biostatistics, Genomics and Bioinformatics, Analytical Biochemistry, Nutrition Support, and Metabolomics. UHCC serves a unique ethnically diverse catchment area in Hawai‘i and the Pacific and a unique environment rich in natural resources. This drives UHCC’s focus on ethnic diversity and cancer and research and community engagement directed toward addressing significant cancer health disparities among specific populations, including Native Hawaiians. Research programs, community education, public health and clinical trial interventions are targeted toward cancers of importance in the catchment area and basic investigations include evaluation of compounds from the environment for drug discovery research. A unique, community-network based clinical research enterprise has been established through which UHCC provides access to cancer clinical trials for over 70% of the Hawai‘i population; this is supported in part by a UHCC-led affiliation of three competing health systems as a cooperative venture supporting UHCC. Cancer prevention activities across the Pacific, in collaboration with the University of Guam and others, have had major impact on cancer control and have led to the formation of the UHCC-led Trans-Pacific Partnership for Cancer Prevention. The importance of UHCC in the region is exemplified by its significant impact on cancer control legislation and State cancer policy. The University of Hawai‘i (UH) has made significant investments in UHCC. With the recruitment new Director, UH reaffirmed the Director’s direct authority over faculty appointments and affairs, Center budget and operations, and space allocation in the 187,000 sq. ft.

"The Sylvester Cancer Center Support Grant PROJECT SUMMARY: OVERALL The Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center (Sylvester) at the University of Miami seeks National Cancer Institute (NCI) designation to support its mission to reduce the human burden from cancer through research, education, prevention, and the delivery of quality patient care. Sylvester, the only academic Cancer Center located in South Florida, serves one of the most diverse catchment areas in the US. This four-county region (Broward, Miami-Dade, Monroe, and Palm Beach Counties), commonly known as South Florida, is home to more than six million residents and is characterized by substantial ethnic, cultural, racial, and socioeconomic diversity, reflected in the individuals treated by Sylvester and those affected by its outreach efforts. Led by Stephen D. Nimer, MD since 2012, Sylvester leadership has assembled a highly collaborative group of investigators that now includes 114 cancer scientists from three University Schools and Colleges. Sylvester’s research is organized into three Research Programs—Cancer Control, Cancer Epigenetics, and Tumor Biology. These programs are unified by crosscutting scientific themes and by Sylvester’s broader mission to address the cancer burden and disparities prevalent in its catchment area. Sylvester has invested heavily in these Research Programs and in four state-of-the-art shared resources that support Sylvester’s cancer researchers: the Biostatistics and Bioinformatics, Onco-Genomics, Flow Cytometry, and Behavioral and Community-Based Research Shared Resources. Sylvester has also invested heavily in its clinical research infrastructure, which has led to a dramatic increase in interventional treatment accruals (from 75 in 2011 to 509 in 2017), with more than 50% of the 4,568 patient accruals in 2017 representing racial/ethnic minorities. The University has made a substantial commitment to advancing Sylvester’s research capabilities since 2012, supporting the recruitment of 41 cancer researchers and doubling Cancer Center space. Sylvester has also expanded its pre- and post-doctoral training efforts across the clinical, basic, translational, and population sciences, which have been rewarded with five recently awarded NIH or NCI-funded T32 training grants, a U54 grant with a significant training component, and a Paul Calabresi K12 grant. Finally, Sylvester has invested roughly $5.7M in its Intramural Funding Program from 2014 to 2018, which has yielded $25.2M in peer-reviewed funding. Today, Sylvester has $38M in extramural research funding (including training grants), which includes $11M from the NCI; this represents a 12% and 64% increase, respectively, over the past year. These impressive achievements have created a culture and environment that enable Sylvester scientists to make valuable contributions to the understanding of cancer biology and the development of novel approaches to cancer prevention, diagnosis, and treatment. PROJECT NARRATIVE: OVERALL Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center (Sylvester), the only academic Cancer Center in South Florida, plays a unique role, serving as a source of discovery and innovation in cancer research, outreach, engagement, prevention, diagnosis, treatment—and hope—for those living in its incredibly diverse catchment area.

"Stephenson Cancer Center - Cancer Center Support Grant OVERALL – ABSTRACT Oklahoma currently ranks 7th highest among all states for cancer mortality rates, and 2nd in cancer incidence and mortality rates among the 15 states currently without an NCI-designated cancer center. To address this cancer burden, the State passed bipartisan-supported legislation in 2001, directing the University of Oklahoma to create an academic cancer center that would provide statewide leadership in cancer education, prevention, treatment and research. Acting on this mandate, the University established the Stephenson Cancer Center (SCC), a matrix-based academic cancer center with a mission of reducing the burden of cancer in Oklahoma, a catchment area underserved by NCI-designated cancer centers. An essential partner in advancing this mission is the Oklahoma Medical Research Foundation (OMRF), the SCC's proposed consortium partner. Under the leadership of Robert Mannel, MD, who was appointed Director in 2006, the SCC has secured institutional and other commitments totaling $383.7 million of state, university and philanthropic dollars over the past ten years, which have been used to recruit new cancer researchers and oncology physicians, add new physical space, and develop formal research programs and new shared resources. The level of support for the SCC constitutes the largest public – private biomedical initiative ever launched in the State and has resulted in an academic cancer center that has achieved the following benchmarks during the reporting period (CY2016):   $18,371,115 in overall funding base (peer-reviewed, cancer-relevant) (direct costs).   $8,981,794 in NCI research and training funding (direct costs).   $34,234,985 in total funding (direct costs).   96 full and associate members, representing 32 different academic departments.   278,609 sf. of total physical space (research, clinical, administrative).   $33.1 million in annual discretionary funds under the control of the SCC Director.   2,727 newly diagnosed and treated patients, with 612 enrollments on interventional treatment trials. The SCC has developed an organizational structure and environment designed to promote transdisciplinary, team-based science, move ideas along the translational continuum and stimulate research that impacts the SCC catchment area. This structure includes three formal research programs: Preclinical Translational Cancer Research (PTCR), Gynecologic Cancers (GC) and Cancer Prevention and Control (CPC).

"Cancer Center Support Grant Cancer is the second leading cause of death in the state of Michigan. However, expected cancer mortality in 2020 may be underestimated due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The pandemic is a public health crisis that has dramatically altered almost every dimension of daily life in the U.S. Michigan ranks fifth among states in COVID-19 incidence and mortality, largely driven by the predominantly African American city of Detroit, which accounts for one-third of Michigan’s COVID-19 cases. COVID-19-related disruptions in daily life and routines may have a broad range of adverse consequences including limited access to care, resources, and information, as well as psychological distress that undermine prevention and control efforts at the population and individual level and across the cancer care continuum. Therefore, we propose to participate in a consortium of NCI-designated cancer centers who will rapidly deploy surveys containing a standard set of core questions to populations across the U.S. The broad goal of the proposed research is to assess how differences in demographics (rural/urban, age, gender, race, educational attainment) will impact engagement in cancer preventive behaviors (e.g., tobacco cessation) and cancer management/survivorship behaviors (e.g., adherence to treatment and surveillance) in the context of COVID19-related environmental constraints (e.g., social distancing, employment, mental health, etc.). This research will be conducted among the general adult population, cancer patients, and cancer survivors within Karmanos Cancer Institute’s 46-county catchment area in Michigan. Further, this work will be aligned with the efforts of a COVID-19 Population Science (CPS) Consortium that includes University of Iowa Holden Comprehensive Cancer Center, the James Comprehensive Cancer Center at the Ohio State University, University of Colorado Cancer Center, and the O’Neal Comprehensive Cancer Center at University of Alabama – Birmingham as the coordinating site. There are three specific aims. Aim 1: Develop a core set of questions to assess community and individual responses to the COVID-19 pandemic across populations, along with modules that will apply to specific sub-populations in any given catchment area. Aim 2: Administer the core set of questions and locally relevant modules to 2000 adults to determine the association between COVID-19 responses and cancer prevention and control behaviors among the general adult population, cancer patients, and cancer survivors in the KCI catchment area in Michigan, with a focus on racial and rural-urban differences. Aim 3: Develop and implement strategies to increase access to appropriate cancer resources based on survey results, in partnership with stakeholder organizations throughout the catchment area and evaluate their reach in the population. The proposed work represents an extraordinary opportunity to capture the impact of this public health crisis on cancer care and outcomes. This research will also shed new light on the social determinants that drive racial disparities in cancer specifically, and health more broadly. Data will also inform practical strategies to support vulnerable populations that disproportionately carry COVID-19 burden. OVERALL: PROJECT NARRATIVE In 2014, there were an estimated 1,665,540 new cancer cases diagnosed and 585,720 cancer deaths in the United States. Cancer remains the second most common cause of death in the US, accounting for nearly 1 of every 4 deaths (source: American Cancer Society). The Karmanos Cancer Institute is a unique, urban-based integrated center of research, patient care and education, dedicated to the prevention, early detection, treatment and eventual eradication of cancer. Key to achieving this mission is KCI's research effort which is conducted among four interdisciplinary Programs, organized to integrate basic, translational, and clinical research with population research-based cancer control activities.",Cancer Center Support Grant,10160060,P30CA022453,"['Accounting ', ' Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' American Cancer Society ', ' Attention ', ' Behavior ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Cities ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Colorado ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' Continuity of Patient Care ', ' Continuity of Care ', ' Continuum of Care ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Employment ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiologic ', ' epidemiological ', ' Face ', ' faces ', ' facial ', ' Family ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' Access to Care ', ' access to health services ', ' access to services ', ' access to treatment ', ' accessibility to health services ', ' availability of services ', ' care access ', ' health service access ', ' health services availability ', ' service availability ', ' treatment access ', ' Incidence ', ' Institutes ', ' Iowa ', ' Laboratory Research ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Michigan ', ' Mission ', ' Morbidity -

"Winship Cancer Institute Cancer Center Support Grant PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The Winship Cancer Institute of Emory University (Winship) is the only NCI-designated cancer center in Georgia, which is now the eighth most populous state and has the largest land area among states east of the Mississippi River. As the main tertiary cancer care and cancer research institution in the state, Winship has committed its four research programs as supported by its six shared resources to address the specific challenges associated with the cancer burden in Georgia. These challenges include: high tobacco usage and incidence of tobacco- related cancers; high proportion of cancer patients who are African American or black and/or have significant cancer disparity issues in their care, prognosis, and/or outcome; and low health literacy levels. Winship's mission is to lessen the burden of cancer for the citizens of Georgia, its primary catchment area. This will be accomplished by: (1) seeking greater insights into the molecular, genetic, and epigenetic basis of cancer; (2) discovering new knowledge that drives improvements in cancer detection, prevention, and/or therapy; (3) developing or defining novel therapeutic targets and/or agents as a pathway to better cancer therapies; and (4) studying and implementing population-based strategies to lessen the cancer burden in the state. The 164 Winship core members are actively engaged in one of four Winship research programs, all of which have a strong emphasis on transdisciplinary research: Cancer Cell Biology, Cancer Genetics and Epigenetics, Cancer Prevention and Control, and Discovery and Developmental Therapeutics. Winship's members are supported by six shared resources: Biostatistics and Bioinformatics Shared Resource, Cancer Animal Models Shared Resource, Cancer Tissue and Pathology Shared Resource, Emory Integrated Genomics Shared Resource, Emory Integrated Proteomics Shared Resource, and the Integrated Imaging Shared Resource; and two developing shared resources: Winship Research Informatics and Intervention Development, Dissemination, and Implementation Developing Shared Resources. Winship members are currently supported by $84.8M in total research funding (as of 3/31/2016) awarded via Emory University. Winship members Curran and Bruner serve as PIs on two NCI awards to the NRG Oncology Foundation for a total of $25.6M in support of clinical research infrastructure. Patient enrollment in Winship's interventional and non-interventional trials continues to increase, especially among patients from under-represented minority groups, and these activities have contributed to the FDA- approval of several novel anti-cancer agents during the present funding period. Winship has outstanding institutional commitment, with more than $200 million in institutional support committed over the next five years, a level almost twice that committed in 2011. Winship enjoys the same reporting line and organizational position as Emory's schools of medicine, public health, and nursing. Winship is uniquely positioned to apply its scientific strengths, outstanding membership, robust infrastructure, strong institutional support, and comprehensive training programs to fulfill its mission of lessening the burden of cancer on the state of Georgia and beyond. PROJECT NARRATIVE As the first and only NCI-designated cancer center in Georgia, the Winship Cancer Institute of Emory University (Winship) serves the state as its primary tertiary cancer care provider and its primary institution for cancer research, training, and education. Winship is an integral part of Emory University, coordinating the cancer specific research capabilities of the Emory University School of Medicine, Rollins School of Public Health, Nell Hodgson Woodruff School of Nursing, Emory College, and Emory Healthcare.

"Moffitt Cancer Center Support Grant PROJECT SUMMARY The H. Lee Moffitt Cancer Center & Research Institute (MCC) continues its ambitious trajectory of innovative cancer research and translation to benefit the gulf coast region of Florida and beyond. As a free-standing 501(c)3 not-for-profit institution with the sole purpose “to contribute to the prevention and cure of cancer,” all research funding ($71.8M), publications (2,430), and clinical research (>1,600 interventional accruals/ year) are cancer focused. Research and clinical space has expanded dramatically since the last renewal to more than 2 million square feet, and patient clinical volume places MCC among the largest Centers in the United States. MCC has benefitted from recent, ongoing annual state legislature funding of approximately $25 million, in addition to more than $39 million of annual institutional research support. The 142 MCC members span the basic, clinical, and population sciences. They are organized into five highly collaborative, multidisciplinary programs with exceptional levels of intra- (35%) and inter-programmatic (18%) publications. Under the leadership of Dr. Thomas Sellers, the third MCC Director, a Research Strategic Plan (RSP) was developed and implemented for “Moffitt 3.0.” Four of six Associate Center Directors are new; and new leaders have been appointed in every program, with bold goals and specific aims. Two of the 13 shared resources have been significantly restructured (Chemical Biology, Molecular Genomics), and one new resource created (Collaborative Data Services) to better meet the changing needs of MCC scientists. Implementation of the strategic plan has been bolstered by substantial institutional investment, especially in basic science, immunotherapy, and clinical research infrastructure, including the recruitment of 45 new faculty members, of whom 32 are CCSG members. MCC is a leader in immunotherapy, and more than 40% of overall clinical trial accrual is to investigator-initiated studies. MCC population scientists initiated significant new efforts in cancer prevention and outcomes that include vaccines, tobacco cessation, and health disparities. This is particularly true in the unique cancer problems in the catchment area – notably lung cancer, melanoma, and HPV- prevention. MCC's Total Cancer Care protocol, the ground-breaking research strategy to realize the promise of personalized medicine, has continued to thrive, resulting in dramatic utilization of the Tissue Core and the formation of the Oncology Research Information Exchange Network (ORIEN) that now includes eleven cancer centers across the nation, with several more poised to join the consortium this year. MCC requests funding for: five scientific programs, 13 shared resources, two clinical research components, planning and evaluation, administration, leadership, four staff investigators, and developmental funds.

"Medical University of South Carolina - Cancer Center Support Grant OVERALL: SUMMARY The Hollings Cancer Center (HCC) at the Medical University of South Carolina (MUSC) seeks renewal of its National Cancer Institute (NCI) designation via the P30 Cancer Center Support Grant (CCSG) mechanism. As South Carolina's (SC) leading academic medical center, MUSC is charged with building basic, translational, clinical, and population-based research programs that address the state's significant healthcare needs. The mission of the HCC is to reduce the cancer burden in SC through transformative research, patient care, prevention, and public policy. To accomplish this mission, HCC leadership built a robust, multidisciplinary center that includes 107 cancer scientists. Innovative, high-impact research is driven by HCC’s four research programs: Cancer Biology, Cancer Immunology, Developmental Cancer Therapeutics, and Cancer Control. The rapid pace of discovery and movement toward effective translational research is supported by five shared research resources: Lipidomics, Flow Cytometry & Cell Sorting, Cell & Molecular Imaging, Biorepository & Tissue Analysis, and Biostatistics. During the current project period, the HCC successfully leveraged CCSG funding and its NCI-designated cancer center status to harness, expand and improve the center’s research capabilities to decrease the state’s cancer burden. HCC supported recruitment of 26 new cancer scientists. The annual direct peer-reviewed extramural research funding (excluding training and career development awards) increased to $21.6M, with $10.5M from NCI. HCC boasts the state’s largest clinical trials operation that provides centralized support for conducting the most contemporary cancer trials. During the past year, the HCC recruited 1,266 patients to interventional studies and 254 patients to non-interventional studies. HCC made significant progress in overcoming the challenges inherent in recruiting racial and ethnic minorities to participate in research. In 2017, 33% of research participants were racial or ethnic minorities, with more than half residing in rural communities federally designated as medically underserved. This progress has been maintained for over two decades by progressive, HCC-led outreach, community engagement, and cancer education services.

"Cancer Center Support Grant PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT MD Anderson Cancer Center is a comprehensive cancer center established within the University of Texas System in 1941. In 2017, the institution welcomed Peter Pisters, MD, as its fifth full-time president and PI of the CCSG. The mission of MD Anderson is to eliminate cancer in Texas, the nation and the world through outstanding programs that integrate patient care, research and prevention, and through education for undergraduate and graduate students, trainees, professionals, employees and the public. MD Anderson is dedicated wholly to the study of cancer involving a continuum of basic, clinical and population-based investigation, with an emphasis on multidisciplinary translational research. MD Anderson employed more than 19,530 people in FY17, including 1,743 faculty members, of whom 705 (40%) are CCSG program members. More than 137,000 people sought care at MD Anderson in FY17 of whom 20,839 were newly diagnosed cancer patients. Annual citations in Web of Science have increased 23% from 3,260 in 2013, to 4,009 in 2017, including 686 (17%) articles in journals with an impact factor >10, and 244 (6%) articles in journals with an impact factor >20. The total research budget increased 26% from $671M in 2013 to $844M in 2017. Direct cost NCI research grant support, excluding training grants and the CCSG, has increased 34%, from $67M in 2013 to $90M in 2018, with the largest number of NCI grants for any institution (>200), including 6 SPOREs, 4 P01s and 35 U awards. Research Programs have been reduced to 16 and support is requested for 14 shared resources. Since the last CCSG renewal, research has been strengthened with recruitment of 97 tenured and tenure track faculty, of whom 18 are supported by recruitment awards from CPRIT totaling $63M. Team science has been enhanced through institutional support of the MD Anderson's Moon Shots ($383M), focused on reducing mortality from 13 major cancers through multi-disciplinary efforts that build on research emerging from the CCSG programs. In FY17, 10,283 participants were enrolled in 1,108 interventional clinical research protocols, of which 936 were treatment (therapeutic) studies that accrued 6,271 subjects. Over the past decade MD Anderson investigators have contributed to the clinical evaluation of 72 of 130 FDA oncology drug approvals, either as a new entity or for a new indication, with 41 of these approvals since the last CCSG renewal. In addition to the main hospital, Houston Area Locations provide prospective, multidisciplinary care and supportive services, with an increasing emphasis on access to clinical trials including national studies. Cancer prevention and survivorship is a priority for MD Anderson with an emphasis on molecular epidemiology, behavioral science, clinical cancer prevention and early detection research to reduce the burden of cancer within Texas and worldwide. PROJECT NARRATIVE: OVERVIEW Cancer affects 1 in every 3 people in the US and as our population ages this fraction is expected to increase. Outcomes for cancer patients have improved over the last several decades, but there is still a great burden of cancer-related mortality and morbidity that is borne disproportionately by minorities and the economically disadvantaged. MD Anderson Cancer Center's mission is to eliminate cancer in Texas, the nation and the world through outstanding programs that integrate patient care, research and prevention, and through education for undergraduate and graduate students, trainees, professionals, employees and the public.

Since 2013, the center has continued to flourish with strong cancer-focused research, many examples of team science (e.g., SPOREs), an increase in high impact publications and many examples of translational research, and, most importantly, many examples of practice-changing approaches to cancer care. Following strategic planning in 2014, MCCC now has the following aims: 1. To advance the cancer-focused research of each of our MCCC members within our existing 10 Programs and within potential future Programs in order to promote high impact science. 2. To advance interactions of our MCCC members within Programs (intraprogrammatic); across Programs (interprogrammatic); and with individuals at other Cancer Centers and institutions (interinstitutional). 3. To advance new approaches for the treatment of cancer by facilitating translation of basic science concepts from the laboratory to the clinic within MCCC. 4. To continue to build and to further integrate cancer research activities at MCA, MCF, and MCR and to extend these activities to the Mayo Clinic Health System (MCHS). 5. To further develop cancer education for patients, high school, college, and graduate students, postgraduates, as well as faculty. 6. To extend our cancer research, practice, and education within our catchment areas at each of our 3 major sites in MCA, MCF, and MCR and the MCHS with the ultimate goal of lessening cancer burden. We will use these 6 specific aims to further the mission of MCCC: (1) to promote and facilitate research on the incidence, etiology, and molecular basis of cancer, and (2) through education and direct application of the results of such research, to translate the discoveries into improved methods for cancer prevention, detection, diagnosis, prognosis, and therapy.

"Core Support for Cancer Center PROJECT SUMMARY - OVERALL This is an application for years 46-50 funding of the Albert Einstein Cancer Center (AECC) CCSG to support basic, translational, clinical, and population based research that addresses the causes, prevention and treatment of cancer. In September 2015, ownership of the Albert Einstein College of Medicine transferred from Yeshiva University to Montefiore Medicine. The AECC and its clinical partner, the Montefiore Health System, now both under the Montefiore Medicine umbrella, are the major providers of cancer care and prevention programs to the largely minority, and socioeconomically challenged, 1.4M residents of the Bronx. There are five established AECC programs: The Tumor Microenvironment and Metastasis Program which brings together advanced in in vivo imaging technologies and innovative mouse models focused on breast cancer, with recent extension to other neoplasms, and translation into diagnostic, correlative and therapeutic studies in humans. The Stem Cells, Differentiation and Cancer Program encompasses three interrelated themes - stem cell biology, hematological malignancies, and a component focused on basic investigations on epigenetics/ transcription mechanisms and chromatin biology. The Experimental Therapeutics Program is the home for the conduct of all clinical therapeutic trials, and the translation of basic discoveries into investigator-initiated clinical initiatives, at AECC. The program is also the focal point for the development of small molecule inhibitors, and novel immuno-therapeutics, for the treatment of cancer. The Cancer Epidemiology, Prevention and Control Program, evolved from the prior Cancer Epidemiology Program, reflecting the expanded scope of population- based research that encompasses infectious, metabolic, endocrine, obesity-related and genetic/epigenetic causes of cancer and their prevention and control. The Biology of Colon Cancer Program focuses on the convergence of dietary and genetic factors, along with the role of aging, in the pathogenesis of colorectal cancer using mouse models of human cancer now encompassing studies on intestinal stem cells, the microbiome and the villus niche with the objective of translating preclinical findings into prevention strategies. There is research directed to the Bronx catchment area in all five AECC research programs, now brought together with the inauguration of the Community Outreach and Engagement component and units within the Montefiore organization, that provide well-established, effective surveillance, education and outreach capabilities. This, along with the strong clinical electronic informatics at Montefiore and AECC, provide the tools and support that expand the Center's research and implementation capabilities directed to the Bronx population. There are twelve shared resources, including the recent addition of a Chemical Synthesis Shared Resource, that support the spectrum of AECC research activities. There are currently 144 AECC members representing 23 departments with a cancer relevant direct cost funding base of $21M NCI, $18M other NIH, $4M in our peer-review grants, totaling $41M in total peer-reviewed grants.

"The Sylvester Cancer Center Support Grant PROJECT SUMMARY: OVERALL The Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center (Sylvester) at the University of Miami seeks National Cancer Institute (NCI) designation to support its mission to reduce the human burden from cancer through research, education, prevention, and the delivery of quality patient care. Sylvester, the only academic Cancer Center located in South Florida, serves one of the most diverse catchment areas in the US. This four-county region (Broward, Miami-Dade, Monroe, and Palm Beach Counties), commonly known as South Florida, is home to more than six million residents and is characterized by substantial ethnic, cultural, racial, and socioeconomic diversity, reflected in the individuals treated by Sylvester and those affected by its outreach efforts. Led by Stephen D. Nimer, MD since 2012, Sylvester leadership has assembled a highly collaborative group of investigators that now includes 114 cancer scientists from three University Schools and Colleges. Sylvester’s research is organized into three Research Programs—Cancer Control, Cancer Epigenetics, and Tumor Biology. These programs are unified by crosscutting scientific themes and by Sylvester’s broader mission to address the cancer burden and disparities prevalent in its catchment area. Sylvester has invested heavily in these Research Programs and in four state-of-the-art shared resources that support Sylvester’s cancer researchers: the Biostatistics and Bioinformatics, Onco-Genomics, Flow Cytometry, and Behavioral and Community-Based Research Shared Resources. Sylvester has also invested heavily in its clinical research infrastructure, which has led to a dramatic increase in interventional treatment accruals (from 75 in 2011 to 509 in 2017), with more than 50% of the 4,568 patient accruals in 2017 representing racial/ethnic minorities. The University has made a substantial commitment to advancing Sylvester’s research capabilities since 2012, supporting the recruitment of 41 cancer researchers and doubling Cancer Center space. Sylvester has also expanded its pre- and post-doctoral training efforts across the clinical, basic, translational, and population sciences, which have been rewarded with five recently awarded NIH or NCI-funded T32 training grants, a U54 grant with a significant training component, and a Paul Calabresi K12 grant. Finally, Sylvester has invested roughly $5.7M in its Intramural Funding Program from 2014 to 2018, which has yielded $25.2M in peer-reviewed funding. Today, Sylvester has $38M in extramural research funding (including training grants), which includes $11M from the NCI; this represents a 12% and 64% increase, respectively, over the past year. These impressive achievements have created a culture and environment that enable Sylvester scientists to make valuable contributions to the understanding of cancer biology and the development of novel approaches to cancer prevention, diagnosis, and treatment.

"Cancer Center Support Grant PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT MD Anderson Cancer Center is a comprehensive cancer center established within the University of Texas System in 1941. In 2017, the institution welcomed Peter Pisters, MD, as its fifth full-time president and PI of the CCSG. The mission of MD Anderson is to eliminate cancer in Texas, the nation and the world through outstanding programs that integrate patient care, research and prevention, and through education for undergraduate and graduate students, trainees, professionals, employees and the public. MD Anderson is dedicated wholly to the study of cancer involving a continuum of basic, clinical and population-based investigation, with an emphasis on multidisciplinary translational research. MD Anderson employed more than 19,530 people in FY17, including 1,743 faculty members, of whom 705 (40%) are CCSG program members. More than 137,000 people sought care at MD Anderson in FY17 of whom 20,839 were newly diagnosed cancer patients. Annual citations in Web of Science have increased 23% from 3,260 in 2013, to 4,009 in 2017, including 686 (17%) articles in journals with an impact factor >10, and 244 (6%) articles in journals with an impact factor >20. The total research budget increased 26% from $671M in 2013 to $844M in 2017. Direct cost NCI research grant support, excluding training grants and the CCSG, has increased 34%, from $67M in 2013 to $90M in 2018, with the largest number of NCI grants for any institution (>200), including 6 SPOREs, 4 P01s and 35 U awards. Research Programs have been reduced to 16 and support is requested for 14 shared resources. Since the last CCSG renewal, research has been strengthened with recruitment of 97 tenured and tenure track faculty, of whom 18 are supported by recruitment awards from CPRIT totaling $63M. Team science has been enhanced through institutional support of the MD Anderson's Moon Shots ($383M), focused on reducing mortality from 13 major cancers through multi-disciplinary efforts that build on research emerging from the CCSG programs. In FY17, 10,283 participants were enrolled in 1,108 interventional clinical research protocols, of which 936 were treatment (therapeutic) studies that accrued 6,271 subjects. Over the past decade MD Anderson investigators have contributed to the clinical evaluation of 72 of 130 FDA oncology drug approvals, either as a new entity or for a new indication, with 41 of these approvals since the last CCSG renewal. In addition to the main hospital, Houston Area Locations provide prospective, multidisciplinary care and supportive services, with an increasing emphasis on access to clinical trials including national studies. Cancer prevention and survivorship is a priority for MD Anderson with an emphasis on molecular epidemiology, behavioral science, clinical cancer prevention and early detection research to reduce the burden of cancer within Texas and worldwide. PROJECT NARRATIVE: OVERVIEW Cancer affects 1 in every 3 people in the US and as our population ages this fraction is expected to increase.

"Medical University of South Carolina - Cancer Center Support Grant OVERALL: SUMMARY The Hollings Cancer Center (HCC) at the Medical University of South Carolina (MUSC) seeks renewal of its National Cancer Institute (NCI) designation via the P30 Cancer Center Support Grant (CCSG) mechanism. As South Carolina's (SC) leading academic medical center, MUSC is charged with building basic, translational, clinical, and population-based research programs that address the state's significant healthcare needs. The mission of the HCC is to reduce the cancer burden in SC through transformative research, patient care, prevention, and public policy. To accomplish this mission, HCC leadership built a robust, multidisciplinary center that includes 107 cancer scientists. Innovative, high-impact research is driven by HCC’s four research programs: Cancer Biology, Cancer Immunology, Developmental Cancer Therapeutics, and Cancer Control. The rapid pace of discovery and movement toward effective translational research is supported by five shared research resources: Lipidomics, Flow Cytometry & Cell Sorting, Cell & Molecular Imaging, Biorepository & Tissue Analysis, and Biostatistics. During the current project period, the HCC successfully leveraged CCSG funding and its NCI-designated cancer center status to harness, expand and improve the center’s research capabilities to decrease the state’s cancer burden. HCC supported recruitment of 26 new cancer scientists. The annual direct peer-reviewed extramural research funding (excluding training and career development awards) increased to $21.6M, with $10.5M from NCI. HCC boasts the state’s largest clinical trials operation that provides centralized support for conducting the most contemporary cancer trials. During the past year, the HCC recruited 1,266 patients to interventional studies and 254 patients to non-interventional studies. HCC made significant progress in overcoming the challenges inherent in recruiting racial and ethnic minorities to participate in research. In 2017, 33% of research participants were racial or ethnic minorities, with more than half residing in rural communities federally designated as medically underserved. This progress has been maintained for over two decades by progressive, HCC-led outreach, community engagement, and cancer education services. With the charge of training the next generation of diverse and exceptional cancer physicians and scientists, the center developed the state’s only comprehensive cancer education pipeline for learners across the entire education continuum, from high school through early professional career development. The HCC is committed to providing access to the latest research, educational, and clinical advances to all of South Carolina, and has never been better equipped to fulfill its mission. Led by a new center director appointed in 2017, the HCC will implement its 2023 strategic plan to advance scientific discovery, make impactful contributions to the understanding of cancer biology in a diverse population, and translate discoveries into transformative approaches to cancer control, diagnosis, treatment, and public policy.

"Specialized Cancer Center Support Grant OVERALL ABSTRACT Founded in 1977 by John Mendelsohn, the Cancer Center at University of California San Diego (UCSD) has been continuously funded by the NCI Cancer Center Support Grant (CCSG) since 1978 and has held Comprehensive status since 2001. As the only NCI-designated Comprehensive Cancer Center in San Diego County, the mission of Moores Cancer Center (MCC) is to reduce the impact of cancer in the region and beyond by fostering scientific discovery, research training, and interdisciplinary care. Our goal is to create, translate, and deliver high-impact discoveries and innovations in cancer prevention and care through a deep understanding of the needs of the catchment area, and prepare the next generation of cancer researchers. Accordingly, MCC’s aims are to: 1) Elucidate the biology of cancer and catalyze trans-disciplinary team science across the science spectrum; 2) Develop and test innovative preventive, diagnostic, and therapeutic approaches; 3) Conduct cancer prevention and control research to reduce cancer disparities in vulnerable populations; 4) Provide underrepresented minorities with access to cutting edge multi-disciplinary care; 5) Provide training and education across the trainee continuum; and 6) Develop and implement community-based cancer education and outreach programs. To this end, MCC brings together 232 members from 5 UCSD Schools (Medicine, Engineering, Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Physical Sciences and Biological Sciences) and 2 consortium partners (one existing: San Diego State University, and one new: La Jolla Institute). Furthermore, MCC integrates the resources of UCSD Health Sciences and its affiliated hospitals in the UCSD Health System for a unified approach to cancer research and clinical care. MCC fulfills its mission through the activities of its 5 Research Programs (Cancer Biology and Signaling, Structural and Functional Genomics, Solid Tumor Therapeutics, Hematological Malignancies, and Cancer Control) that are supported by 7 Shared Resources (Flow Cytometry, Microscopy, Transgenic Mouse, Biostatistics, Genomics and Computational Biology, Biorepository and Tissue Technology, and Biobehavioral), and infrastructure provided by Community Outreach, Training and Education, Clinical Protocol and Data Management, and Protocol Review and Monitoring. Under the leadership of Dr. Scott Lippman, Center Director and Associate Vice- Chancellor for Cancer Research and Care, MCC has seen tremendous growth. During the project period, MCC members authored 3931 cancer-relevant research articles, and in 2017 were supported by $128.2 million (DC) in annual cancer-relevant peer-reviewed funding (8% increase); and the total annualized cancer-relevant research base was $148.5M, an increase of 11% from the previous project period by lateral comparison. Collaborative peer-reviewed grant funding also increased from annual total costs of $65.9M in 2013 to $69.9M in 2017 (6% increase). Importantly, 33 of MCC’s scientific discoveries were translated to the clinic through 41 investigator-initiated clinical trials, a 14-fold increase from the previous project period. OVERALL NARRATIVE MCC’s mission is to reduce the impact of cancer to the catchment area and beyond by discovering, translating, and delivering high-impact innovations in interdisciplinary cancer prevention and care, and prepare the next generation of cancer researchers.

"COVID-19 and Its Implications for Cancer Prevention and Control: A Collaborative Effort Across Cancer Centers The unexpected COVID-19 pandemic has the potential to trigger major behavior changes worldwide, which, consequently, may have significant implications for cancer prevention, management, and survivorship efforts, particularly among sub-populations experiencing cancer disparities. Thus, it is imperative to be prepared and adapt our ongoing and future strategies across the cancer care continuum within this new context through participatory evidence-based approaches. Given the urgency, and how rapidly these changes are occurring, we must take advantage of ongoing collaborative efforts to maximize resources and accelerate implementation of these new strategies based on the needs and wants of different sub-populations in the U.S. The overall goal of this collaborative with four other cancer centers (Iowa, Detroit, Colorado, and Ohio) is to work together to rapidly develop a standard set of core questions to incorporate into surveys that can be administered to populations across the U.S. using protocols that can be delivered by cancer center/university staff working remotely (e.g., online and telephone). Although five cancer centers are moving forward with the supplement, other cancer centers are willing to join our efforts so we have begun a coordinated effort to engage them in the process in the event additional resources become available. The specific aims are: 1. To assess how differences in demographics (rural/urban, age, gender, race, educational attainment) will impact engagement in cancer preventive behaviors (e.g., tobacco cessation) and cancer management/survivorship behaviors (e.g., adherence to treatment, adherence to surveillance) in the context of COVID-19 environmental constraints (e.g., social distancing, employment, mental health, etc.) among adult healthy volunteers, cancer patients, and cancer survivors in Alabama (field center); 2. To provide coordination of efforts and technical assistance regarding data management and analysis to all participating cancer centers (coordinating center); 3. To strengthen the collaboration with the participating cancer centers toward the development and implementation of cancer prevention & control strategies in the context of COVID-19 (coordinating center) OVERALL COMPONENT PROJECT NARRATIVE The UAB CCC has made a significant contribution to public health that is particularly relevant to the populations served by this Cancer Center who are located in the heart of the Deep South. Our research programs, in addition to their important contributions to translational science, have focused on the unique problems seen in African American populations that include higher incidences and mortality rates from certain cancers, lower age appropriate screening rates, greater obesity from poor diets and less physical activity, greater tobacco use, and lack of access to care.",COVID-19

"Stephenson Cancer Center - Cancer Center Support Grant OVERALL – ABSTRACT Oklahoma currently ranks 7th highest among all states for cancer mortality rates, and 2nd in cancer incidence and mortality rates among the 15 states currently without an NCI-designated cancer center. To address this cancer burden, the State passed bipartisan-supported legislation in 2001, directing the University of Oklahoma to create an academic cancer center that would provide statewide leadership in cancer education, prevention, treatment and research. Acting on this mandate, the University established the Stephenson Cancer Center (SCC), a matrix-based academic cancer center with a mission of reducing the burden of cancer in Oklahoma, a catchment area underserved by NCI-designated cancer centers. An essential partner in advancing this mission is the Oklahoma Medical Research Foundation (OMRF), the SCC's proposed consortium partner. Under the leadership of Robert Mannel, MD, who was appointed Director in 2006, the SCC has secured institutional and other commitments totaling $383.7 million of state, university and philanthropic dollars over the past ten years, which have been used to recruit new cancer researchers and oncology physicians, add new physical space, and develop formal research programs and new shared resources. The level of support for the SCC constitutes the largest public – private biomedical initiative ever launched in the State and has resulted in an academic cancer center that has achieved the following benchmarks during the reporting period (CY2016):   $18,371,115 in overall funding base (peer-reviewed, cancer-relevant) (direct costs).   $8,981,794 in NCI research and training funding (direct costs).   $34,234,985 in total funding (direct costs).   96 full and associate members, representing 32 different academic departments.   278,609 sf. of total physical space (research, clinical, administrative).   $33.1 million in annual discretionary funds under the control of the SCC Director.   2,727 newly diagnosed and treated patients, with 612 enrollments on interventional treatment trials. The SCC has developed an organizational structure and environment designed to promote transdisciplinary, team-based science, move ideas along the translational continuum and stimulate research that impacts the SCC catchment area. This structure includes three formal research programs: Preclinical Translational Cancer Research (PTCR), Gynecologic Cancers (GC) and Cancer Prevention and Control (CPC). SCC member research is supported by four formal shared resource facilities: Biostatistics and Research Design, Molecular Biology and Cytometry Research, Tissue Pathology and Mobile Health Technology. Centralized Clinical Protocol and Data Management, Data and Safety Monitoring, and Protocol Review and Monitoring functions oversee and support the SCC's robust clinical trials program.

"Core Support for Cancer Center PROJECT SUMMARY - OVERALL This is an application for years 46-50 funding of the Albert Einstein Cancer Center (AECC) CCSG to support basic, translational, clinical, and population based research that addresses the causes, prevention and treatment of cancer. In September 2015, ownership of the Albert Einstein College of Medicine transferred from Yeshiva University to Montefiore Medicine. The AECC and its clinical partner, the Montefiore Health System, now both under the Montefiore Medicine umbrella, are the major providers of cancer care and prevention programs to the largely minority, and socioeconomically challenged, 1.4M residents of the Bronx. There are five established AECC programs: The Tumor Microenvironment and Metastasis Program which brings together advanced in in vivo imaging technologies and innovative mouse models focused on breast cancer, with recent extension to other neoplasms, and translation into diagnostic, correlative and therapeutic studies in humans. The Stem Cells, Differentiation and Cancer Program encompasses three interrelated themes - stem cell biology, hematological malignancies, and a component focused on basic investigations on epigenetics/ transcription mechanisms and chromatin biology. The Experimental Therapeutics Program is the home for the conduct of all clinical therapeutic trials, and the translation of basic discoveries into investigator-initiated clinical initiatives, at AECC. The program is also the focal point for the development of small molecule inhibitors, and novel immuno-therapeutics, for the treatment of cancer. The Cancer Epidemiology, Prevention and Control Program, evolved from the prior Cancer Epidemiology Program, reflecting the expanded scope of population- based research that encompasses infectious, metabolic, endocrine, obesity-related and genetic/epigenetic causes of cancer and their prevention and control. The Biology of Colon Cancer Program focuses on the convergence of dietary and genetic factors, along with the role of aging, in the pathogenesis of colorectal cancer using mouse models of human cancer now encompassing studies on intestinal stem cells, the microbiome and the villus niche with the objective of translating preclinical findings into prevention strategies. There is research directed to the Bronx catchment area in all five AECC research programs, now brought together with the inauguration of the Community Outreach and Engagement component and units within the Montefiore organization, that provide well-established, effective surveillance, education and outreach capabilities. This, along with the strong clinical electronic informatics at Montefiore and AECC, provide the tools and support that expand the Center's research and implementation capabilities directed to the Bronx population. There are twelve shared resources, including the recent addition of a Chemical Synthesis Shared Resource, that support the spectrum of AECC research activities. There are currently 144 AECC members representing 23 departments with a cancer relevant direct cost funding base of $21M NCI, $18M other NIH, $4M in our peer-review grants, totaling $41M in total peer-reviewed grants.

"Cancer Center Support Grant Project Summary Over the past 5 years, the Wake Forest Baptist Comprehensive Cancer Center (WFBCCC) has continued its upward trajectory in cancer research excellence and service to its catchment area. The WFBCCC catchment area includes the Piedmont and southern Appalachia, a region of 58 contiguous counties in North Carolina, Virginia, West Virginia and Tennessee. The majority of this region is rural and exhibits significant racial health disparities. Elevated age-adjusted smoking rates, obesity rates, cancer incidence, and cancer mortality are observed across the WFBCCC catchment area when compared with the rest of the U.S. To target these issues, the WFBCCC conducts cutting-edge basic, clinical, and population research on the prevention, detection and treatment of cancer, and translates this knowledge into strategies to improve patient outcomes and reduce the incidence of cancer. WFBCCC cancer research funding is $37.9 million, of which over $14.9 million comes from the NCI; this represents a 25.3% increase in total cancer funding since the last CCSG renewal. Center research space under the Director’s authority increased by approximately 65,000 square feet, and the WFBCCC clinical facilities have been dramatically enhanced with the completion of the new eleven- story Cancer Hospital in 2013. This building houses all oncology inpatients and outpatients. The Center’s 127 members span the basic, clinical and population sciences and are organized into 4 Programs with substantial inter-and intra-programmatic productivity. Faculty additions enhanced tobacco control, tobacco-related cancer research, and precision medicine. Substantial investment in faculty, technology, and informatics significantly expanded cancer genomics capabilities. Enrollment of patients into treatment trials reached an all-time high in 2015, with a large increase in the number of patients enrolled in investigator-initiated trials. WFBCCC population scientists initiated exciting new efforts in cancer prevention and survivorship. Clinical scientists completed practice-changing studies in patients with glioma and lung cancer. Groundbreaking observations in prostate cancer emerged from WFBCCC inter-programmatic collaborations. WFBCCC basic science Programs continued to make high impact observations that are being translated into human therapeutics. The WFBCCC requests continued CCSG funding for 4 scientific Programs; 7 Shared Resources; 2 clinical research components; administration and leadership; planning and evaluation; and developmental funds. With these funds, a talented faculty integrated throughout the Cancer Center will make advances in the prevention, early detection, and treatment of cancer in the WFBCCC catchment area and the nation.

"University of New Mexico Cancer Center Support Grant ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Cancer Control (CaC) Research Program is a newly restructured transdisciplinary program that serves as the hub for cancer control and population science research within the University of New Mexico Cancer Center (UNMCC) and the State of New Mexico (NM), our catchment area. The Program's overall goal is to reduce cancer incidence, morbidity, and mortality, particularly in the unique multiethnic and underserved populations of NM. Disparities research is a cross-cutting theme that fosters scientific focus and synergy across the research areas. Through vigorous strategic program planning and evaluation, recruitment of 9 new investigators to enhance expertise in molecular epidemiology and behavioral/community intervention, and guidance of the UNMCC External Advisory Committee, the CaC Program is now focused on three areas of cancer research: 1) Risk Prediction and Risk Reduction; 2) Screening; and 3) Post-Diagnosis Outcomes and Survivorship. Unique scientific strengths include research addressing disparities (geographic, race/ethnic, socioeconomic, medically underserved), particularly in etiologic, outcome, and intervention studies in Hispanics. By drawing on established and new partnerships, the Program is also building research that addresses American Indian cancer disparities and priorities identified by NM Tribes, Pueblos, and Indian Nations. Major scientific accomplishments in Risk Prediction and Risk Reduction include the identification of social, lifestyle, and genetic factors associated with lung cancer risk; gene-environment interactions in melanoma risk; and development and dissemination of a novel telehealth strategy for the prevention of hepatocellular cancer. In Screening, members have developed a statewide surveillance program of screening and diagnosis for cervical pre-cancer and cancer that informs real- world cervical cancer prevention through human papilloma virus (HPV) vaccination, screening practice and outcomes. Members have also identified barriers to use of early detection tests in colorectal cancer and have developed strategies to overcome these barriers to improve screening in underserved populations. In Post- Diagnosis Outcomes and Survivorship, members have identified factors that contribute to disparities in post- treatment outcomes and survivorship in endometrial and breast cancer and are developing interventions. Led by Linda Cook, Ph.D. and Anita Kinney, Ph.D., RN, the CaC Program is comprised of 28 members (19 full and 9 associate) from 7 UNM schools and departments, the Lovelace Respiratory Institute, and the Indian Health Service Unit of the Centers for Disease Control whose work is supported by $19,276,863 million in annual direct cost funding, of which $15,429,911 million is peer-reviewed and $3,137,820 million is from NCI as of 9/1/2014. The discoveries made in this Program have resulted 294 publications, of which 19% are intra-programmatic collaborations and 16% are inter-programmatic collaborations; with a total UNMCC and external collaborative publication level of 30% and 80%, respectively. OVERALL COMPONENT: THE UNIVERSITY OF NEW MEXICO CANCER CENTER PROJECT NARRATIVE Designated as one of the nation's National Cancer Institute Cancer Centers since 2005, the University of New Mexico Cancer Center is a cancer treatment, research, and education and training center that applies the scientific expertise of its investigators to those cancers that have high incidence, mortality, or disparity in the multiethnic and underserved populations of New Mexico. The Center is a hub for promoting discovery through its research, education and training, clinical care, statewide outreach programs and networks for community participatory research. The Center connects scientists, healthcare professionals, and communities to translate its discoveries to cancer clinical trials, and cancer control and behavioral interventions that reduce the cancer burden of New Mexico and serve as a national model. The goal of the Center is to assure that all of the people in New Mexico, its catchment area, have access to high quality cancer care and collaborate in and benefit from advances in cancer

"COMPREHENSIVE CANCER CENTER CORE SUPPORT GRANT ﻿PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTACT The UAB CCC is the only NCI designated comprehensive cancer center in the states of Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana and Arkansas, states with higher cancer mortality and significant minority, mostly African American populations. The Cancer Center is in its 44th year of NCI funding and continues its major contributions to translational therapeutics and cancer disparity research with a focus on training minority investigators. The UAB CCC has 242 members who come from 30 departments in 9 UAB schools, Southern Research, and HudsonAlpha Institute for Biotechnology. The members are supported by $92,055,777 in annual direct extramural funding. The UAB CCC is organized into six research programs, two each in basic, translational, and prevention and control – Inflammation, Immunology & Immunotherapeutics; Cancer Cell Biology; Experimental Therapeutics; Neuro-Oncology; Cancer Chemoprevention; and Cancer Control & Population Sciences. Members published 1,684 cancer focused, peer reviewed publications between 2011 and 2015 of which 24% were intra-programmatic, 16% inter-programmatic, and 53% inter-institutional. These members are supported by eleven shared facilities – Biostatistics & Bioinformatics, Comprehensive Genomics, High Resolution Imaging, Human Imaging, Mass Spectrometry/2D Proteomics, Microbiome/Gnotobiotic, Preclinical Imaging, Recruitment & Retention, Structural Biology, Tissue Procurement, and Transgenic Animals as well as the developing Pharmacometrics Shared Facility. We have established a Phase I Clinical Trials Program, opened an Advanced Imaging Facility, advanced targets through the Alabama Drug Discovery Alliance, created the UAB Health System Cancer Community Network, and are now a consortium with HudsonAlpha Institute for Biotechnology. In addition to these achievements, we have created an Institute for Cancer Outcomes and Survivorship, and established a critical mass of investigators in energy balance and cancer. We have also expanded our minority training programs that since 2005 have trained 59 scholars resulting in 306 publications, 67 grant submissions with 30 funded, and have had a major impact at Morehouse School of Medicine and Tuskegee University. We have recruited 47 investigators to multiple programs in the Cancer Center since 2010. Strategic plans developed in 2011 with crosscutting themes of Translational Therapeutics, Systems Biomedicine, and Energetics and Cancer continue to be highly relevant today. For the future, we will continue to emphasize translational and cancer disparity research with an emphasis on personalized/genomic medicine, energy balance and cancer, outcomes and survivorship, and early phase clinical trials. OVERALL COMPONENT PROJECT NARRATIVE The UAB CCC has made a significant contribution to public health that is particularly relevant to the populations served by this Cancer Center who are located in the heart of the Deep South. Our research programs, in addition to their important contributions to translational science, have focused on the unique problems seen in African American populations that include higher incidences and mortality rates from certain cancers, lower age appropriate screening rates, greater obesity from poor diets and less physical activity, greater tobacco use, and lack of access to

"University of Kentucky Markey Cancer Center - Cancer Center Support Grant PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  The Markey Cancer Center (MCC) was established more than 35 years ago as a university-based matrix cancer center at the University of Kentucky (UK), Kentucky's flagship institution of higher education. MCC is the only National Cancer Institute (NCI)-designated Cancer Center in Kentucky, a state of 4.4 million that leads the nation for all-site cancer incidence and mortality and serves as the MCC's catchment area. Over $347M in state, institutional, and philanthropic investment since recruitment of MCC Director Dr. B. Mark Evers (CS) in 2009 have supported significant research and resource expansion, enabling substantial new faculty recruitment, program development, renovation of clinical and shared resource space, and new state-of-the art instrumentation, as well as statewide education and community outreach efforts. The 119 MCC members draw from 28 departments in 8 UK colleges, with 28 new faculty recruited since 2013. Cancer-relevant research funding to MCC investigators exceeds $38.7M in total annual costs, an increase of $10.3M since 2012. Over the last 4 years, 9,357 subjects have been accrued to interventional trials. Members have published 851 cancer-focused publications since 2013, reflecting 28% intra-programmatic, 16% inter-programmatic, and 58% inter-institutional collaborations. Research is conducted within 4 MCC Research Programs: Cancer Cell Biology and Signaling; Cancer Prevention and Control; Drug Discovery, Delivery and Translational Therapeutics; and Genomic Instability, Epigenetics and Metabolism. Five Shared Resource Facilities (SRFs) facilitate cutting-edge research by providing robust infrastructure for specialized expertise and advanced methods: Biospecimen Procurement and Translational Pathology; Biostatistics and Bioinformatics; Cancer Research Informatics; Flow Cytometry and Cell Sorting; and Redox Metabolism. Two new SRFs (Behavioral and Community-Based Research and Oncogenomics) are in development. Significant achievements include: development of an NCI-sponsored early therapeutics program, including an active Molecular Tumor Board and Precision Medicine Center; expansion of the MCC Network from 8 to 24 sites; establishment of a regional Metabolomics Center (U24); award of 2 new cancer-related centers – a Center of Biomedical Research Excellence (COBRE) in Cancer and Metabolism and a Center for Appalachian Research in Environmental Sciences; and expansion of community outreach/education initiatives across the state. MCC research focuses on Kentucky's most serious cancer burdens with emphasis on the “distressed” Appalachian Kentucky region, where cancer incidence and mortality rates surpass those for the entire state. The MCC brings unique basic, clinical, and population research strengths to this mission. These strengths are integral to all MCC programs and collectively provide robust capacity to deliver transformative interventional research to an important underserved priority population, thereby contributing to national efforts to conquer cancer through discovery and clinical translation, cancer prevention, and community outreach. PROJECT NARRATIVE  The Markey Cancer Center, the only NCI-designated Cancer Center serving 4.4 million Kentuckians in its statewide catchment area, has the institutional authority for all cancer-relevant activities at the University of Kentucky (UK) and within the UK HealthCare enterprise. The center's mission is to reduce cancer incidence and mortality through an integrated, comprehensive program of cancer research, treatment, education, prevention and community engagement. Thus, the Markey Cancer Center delivers in-depth and impactful research programs in basic, translational, and population science, including the development of clinical trials to address Kentucky's unique cancer burden and to accelerate “bench-to-bedside” translational outcomes that will reduce serious health disparities and significantly impact patients, the state and the nation.",University of

"Indiana University Melvin and Bren Simon Cancer Center Support Grant ABSTRACT, Overview and Essential Characteristics The IU Simon Cancer Center is an NCI-designated Cancer Center that is dedicated to cancer research, education, and patient care for the citizens of Indiana and beyond. Since our last review, the IUSCC has substantially increased the depth and breadth of our science and cancer relevant research as evidenced by over a 38% increase in NCI funding (Direct Costs), a 176% increase in our multi-PI grants while attracting over 30 new investigators in cancer research to our institution. We are the home to the country's first pathway-driven SPORE that focuses on pediatric tumors and the birthplace to three active cancer consortia, including one that links researchers from North America and sub-Saharan Africa. The IUSCC is composed of two basic programs, Hematopoiesis and Hematologic Malignancies (HHM) and Tumor Microenvironment and Metastasis (TMM), and two translational programs, Experimental and Developmental Therapeutics (EDT) and Cancer Prevention and Control (CPC). We define our catchment area as the entire state of Indiana as patients come from each of the 92 counties and 89% of the counties have at least one patient entered on clinical trials. Our community outreach and engagement activities have focused on the urban and rural populations of Indiana with the diseases with the highest mortality in the state, (i.e. lung, breast and gastrointestinal cancers) as well as behavioral risk factors, which adversely impact screening and prevention (e.g. tobacco and HPV vaccinations). We focus on developing novel approaches for screening, treatment and symptom science using ""precision medicine"" and expanding work in bioinformatics and medical informatics to address the increasing complexity of understanding the genomic and clinical data. We embrace the vision of increasing the research workforce in Indiana and globally through education from ""Teens-to-Tenure"" and the integration of clinical and translational research in our strategic plan. This strategic plan, which has its underpinnings with education and impact to our catchment area, is composed of four pillars that are foundational to the IUSCC. These pillars include: 1) Biology to Bedside Research; 2); Precision Medicine; 3) Prevention, Early Detection and Population Health: Local-Global Approaches; and 4) Health Care Disparities, Survivorship, and Symptom Science.

"University of Hawaii Cancer Center CCSG ABSTRACT  The mission of the University of Hawai‘i Cancer Center (UHCC) is to reduce the burden of cancer through research, education, patient care and community outreach with an emphasis on the unique ethnic, cultural and environmental characteristics of Hawai‘i and the Pacific. To accomplish this mission, UHCC is organized into two cancer research programs: Population Sciences in the Pacific (PSP) and Cancer Biology (CB). Programs are each organized with two components spanning the study of basic mechanism and etiologies of cancer to addressing targets and interventions in order to translate discovery to the population it serves. Within its programs, UHCC has a strong foundation of cancer research with over $15 million in peer-reviewed funding, 72.5% of which is from the NCI. PSP has 28 full members and CB has 20 full members who are highly collaborative as evidenced by a high percentage of intra- and inter-programmatic, and inter-institutional, research collaborations and publications. To facilitate successful attainment of research goals, UHCC supports five shared resources: Biostatistics, Genomics and Bioinformatics, Analytical Biochemistry, Nutrition Support, and Metabolomics. UHCC serves a unique ethnically diverse catchment area in Hawai‘i and the Pacific and a unique environment rich in natural resources. This drives UHCC’s focus on ethnic diversity and cancer and research and community engagement directed toward addressing significant cancer health disparities among specific populations, including Native Hawaiians. Research programs, community education, public health and clinical trial interventions are targeted toward cancers of importance in the catchment area and basic investigations include evaluation of compounds from the environment for drug discovery research. A unique, community-network based clinical research enterprise has been established through which UHCC provides access to cancer clinical trials for over 70% of the Hawai‘i population; this is supported in part by a UHCC-led affiliation of three competing health systems as a cooperative venture supporting UHCC. Cancer prevention activities across the Pacific, in collaboration with the University of Guam and others, have had major impact on cancer control and have led to the formation of the UHCC-led Trans-Pacific Partnership for Cancer Prevention. The importance of UHCC in the region is exemplified by its significant impact on cancer control legislation and State cancer policy. The University of Hawai‘i (UH) has made significant investments in UHCC. With the recruitment new Director, UH reaffirmed the Director’s direct authority over faculty appointments and affairs, Center budget and operations, and space allocation in the 187,000 sq. ft. Cancer Center building.

"COMPREHENSIVE CANCER CENTER CORE SUPPORT GRANT ﻿PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTACT The UAB CCC is the only NCI designated comprehensive cancer center in the states of Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana and Arkansas, states with higher cancer mortality and significant minority, mostly African American populations. The Cancer Center is in its 44th year of NCI funding and continues its major contributions to translational therapeutics and cancer disparity research with a focus on training minority investigators. The UAB CCC has 242 members who come from 30 departments in 9 UAB schools, Southern Research, and HudsonAlpha Institute for Biotechnology. The members are supported by $92,055,777 in annual direct extramural funding. The UAB CCC is organized into six research programs, two each in basic, translational, and prevention and control – Inflammation, Immunology & Immunotherapeutics; Cancer Cell Biology; Experimental Therapeutics; Neuro-Oncology; Cancer Chemoprevention; and Cancer Control & Population Sciences. Members published 1,684 cancer focused, peer reviewed publications between 2011 and 2015 of which 24% were intra-programmatic, 16% inter-programmatic, and 53% inter-institutional. These members are supported by eleven shared facilities – Biostatistics & Bioinformatics, Comprehensive Genomics, High Resolution Imaging, Human Imaging, Mass Spectrometry/2D Proteomics, Microbiome/Gnotobiotic, Preclinical Imaging, Recruitment & Retention, Structural Biology, Tissue Procurement, and Transgenic Animals as well as the developing Pharmacometrics Shared Facility. We have established a Phase I Clinical Trials Program, opened an Advanced Imaging Facility, advanced targets through the Alabama Drug Discovery Alliance, created the UAB Health System Cancer Community Network, and are now a consortium with HudsonAlpha Institute for Biotechnology. In addition to these achievements, we have created an Institute for Cancer Outcomes and Survivorship, and established a critical mass of investigators in energy balance and cancer. We have also expanded our minority training programs that since 2005 have trained 59 scholars resulting in 306 publications, 67 grant submissions with 30 funded, and have had a major impact at Morehouse School of Medicine and Tuskegee University. We have recruited 47 investigators to multiple programs in the Cancer Center since 2010. Strategic plans developed in 2011 with crosscutting themes of Translational Therapeutics, Systems Biomedicine, and Energetics and Cancer continue to be highly relevant today. For the future, we will continue to emphasize translational and cancer disparity research with an emphasis on personalized/genomic medicine, energy balance and cancer, outcomes and survivorship, and early phase clinical trials. OVERALL COMPONENT PROJECT NARRATIVE The UAB CCC has made a significant contribution to public health that is particularly relevant to the populations served by this Cancer Center who are located in the heart of the Deep South. Our research programs, in addition to their important contributions to translational science, have focused on the unique problems seen in African American populations that include higher incidences

"University of Kentucky Markey Cancer Center - Cancer Center Support Grant PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  The Markey Cancer Center (MCC) was established more than 35 years ago as a university-based matrix cancer center at the University of Kentucky (UK), Kentucky's flagship institution of higher education. MCC is the only National Cancer Institute (NCI)-designated Cancer Center in Kentucky, a state of 4.4 million that leads the nation for all-site cancer incidence and mortality and serves as the MCC's catchment area. Over $347M in state, institutional, and philanthropic investment since recruitment of MCC Director Dr. B. Mark Evers (CS) in 2009 have supported significant research and resource expansion, enabling substantial new faculty recruitment, program development, renovation of clinical and shared resource space, and new state-of-the art instrumentation, as well as statewide education and community outreach efforts. The 119 MCC members draw from 28 departments in 8 UK colleges, with 28 new faculty recruited since 2013. Cancer-relevant research funding to MCC investigators exceeds $38.7M in total annual costs, an increase of $10.3M since 2012. Over the last 4 years, 9,357 subjects have been accrued to interventional trials. Members have published 851 cancer-focused publications since 2013, reflecting 28% intra-programmatic, 16% inter-programmatic, and 58% inter-institutional collaborations. Research is conducted within 4 MCC Research Programs: Cancer Cell Biology and Signaling; Cancer Prevention and Control; Drug Discovery, Delivery and Translational Therapeutics; and Genomic Instability, Epigenetics and Metabolism. Five Shared Resource Facilities (SRFs) facilitate cutting-edge research by providing robust infrastructure for specialized expertise and advanced methods: Biospecimen Procurement and Translational Pathology; Biostatistics and Bioinformatics; Cancer Research Informatics; Flow Cytometry and Cell Sorting; and Redox Metabolism. Two new SRFs (Behavioral and Community-Based Research and Oncogenomics) are in development. Significant achievements include: development of an NCI-sponsored early therapeutics program, including an active Molecular Tumor Board and Precision Medicine Center; expansion of the MCC Network from 8 to 24 sites; establishment of a regional Metabolomics Center (U24); award of 2 new cancer-related centers – a Center of Biomedical Research Excellence (COBRE) in Cancer and Metabolism and a Center for Appalachian Research in Environmental Sciences; and expansion of community outreach/education initiatives across the state.

"Specialized Cancer Center Support Grant OVERALL ABSTRACT Founded in 1977 by John Mendelsohn, the Cancer Center at University of California San Diego (UCSD) has been continuously funded by the NCI Cancer Center Support Grant (CCSG) since 1978 and has held Comprehensive status since 2001. As the only NCI-designated Comprehensive Cancer Center in San Diego County, the mission of Moores Cancer Center (MCC) is to reduce the impact of cancer in the region and beyond by fostering scientific discovery, research training, and interdisciplinary care. Our goal is to create, translate, and deliver high-impact discoveries and innovations in cancer prevention and care through a deep understanding of the needs of the catchment area, and prepare the next generation of cancer researchers. Accordingly, MCC’s aims are to: 1) Elucidate the biology of cancer and catalyze trans-disciplinary team science across the science spectrum; 2) Develop and test innovative preventive, diagnostic, and therapeutic approaches; 3) Conduct cancer prevention and control research to reduce cancer disparities in vulnerable populations; 4) Provide underrepresented minorities with access to cutting edge multi-disciplinary care; 5) Provide training and education across the trainee continuum; and 6) Develop and implement community-based cancer education and outreach programs. To this end, MCC brings together 232 members from 5 UCSD Schools (Medicine, Engineering, Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Physical Sciences and Biological Sciences) and 2 consortium partners (one existing: San Diego State University, and one new: La Jolla Institute). Furthermore, MCC integrates the resources of UCSD Health Sciences and its affiliated hospitals in the UCSD Health System for a unified approach to cancer research and clinical care. MCC fulfills its mission through the activities of its 5 Research Programs (Cancer Biology and Signaling, Structural and Functional Genomics, Solid Tumor Therapeutics, Hematological Malignancies, and Cancer Control) that are supported by 7 Shared Resources (Flow Cytometry, Microscopy, Transgenic Mouse, Biostatistics, Genomics and Computational Biology, Biorepository and Tissue Technology, and Biobehavioral), and infrastructure provided by Community Outreach, Training and Education, Clinical Protocol and Data Management, and Protocol Review and Monitoring. Under the leadership of Dr. Scott Lippman, Center Director and Associate Vice- Chancellor for Cancer Research and Care, MCC has seen tremendous growth. During the project period, MCC members authored 3931 cancer-relevant research articles, and in 2017 were supported by $128.2 million (DC) in annual cancer-relevant peer-reviewed funding (8% increase); and the total annualized cancer-relevant research base was $148.5M, an increase of 11% from the previous project period by lateral comparison. Collaborative peer-reviewed grant funding also increased from annual total costs of $65.9M in 2013 to $69.9M in 2017 (6% increase). Importantly, 33 of MCC’s scientific discoveries were translated to the clinic through 41 investigator-initiated clinical trials, a 14-fold increase from the previous project period. OVERALL NARRATIVE MCC’s mission is to reduce the impact of cancer to the catchment area and beyond by discovering, translating, and delivering high-impact innovations in interdisciplinary cancer prevention and care, and prepare the next generation of cancer researchers.

"Regional Oncology Research Center ABSTRACT The Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center (SKCCC) at Johns Hopkins is dedicated to cancer research, education and training, and care, with an overarching goal of expeditiously and strategically applying new knowledge to improve prevention, screening, detection, diagnosis and treatment of cancer in Maryland and throughout nation and the world. Through targeted outreach and research, cancer outcomes disparities are decreasing in SKCCC's catchment area, but they remain a challenge and a focus at SKCCC. This application requests continued Cancer Center Support Grant (CCSG) funding for SKCCC's Research Programs and Cores. The SKCCC comprises a multidisciplinary, interdepartmental center of The Johns Hopkins University (JHU), encompassing 34 departments in five schools. The scientific Programs of the SKCCC organize and orient the broad base of cancer research throughout JHU into teams focused on rapid translation to the clinic and to populations inside and outside its catchment area. Research conducted at SKCCC includes discovery research into the molecular genetics of human tumorigenesis, clinical trials of new cancer treatments and epidemiologic analyses of lifestyle influences on cancer mortality. The SKCCC is a leading cancer center that is providing insights into the fundamental nature of different cancers and elucidating the thousands of somatic genetic and epigenetic alterations that mark the differences from case to case. This body of work has fueled an emerging understanding that the ultimate control of cancer will require individualizing cancer care using approaches that can be deployed at a population scale. To accomplish this mission, SKCCC took critical input from its External Advisory Board and has strategically evolved since the last CCSG to: 1) augment the clinical and population impact of the discovery pipeline in cancer genetics, epigenetics and immunology generated by discipline-oriented Programs; 2) maximize the translational research output of disease-specific Programs, emphasizing the exploration of new concepts in scientifically driven clinical trials; and 3) position the population-oriented Program to identify, understand and overcome barriers responsible for disparities in cancer outcome in the catchment area. The nine SKCCC Research Programs include four discipline-oriented Programs: Cancer Biology (CB; Baylin, Velculescu), Cancer Immunology (CI; Pardoll, Drake), Cancer Molecular and Functional Imaging (CMFI; Bhujwalla, Pomper), and Cancer Chemical and Structural Biology (CCSB; Berger, Liu); four disease- specific Programs: Hematologic Malignancies and Bone Marrow Transplantation (HMBMT; Ambinder, Jones, Levis), Prostate Cancer (PC; Pienta, Denmeade, Lupold), Breast and Ovarian Cancer (BOC; Stearns, Shih), and Brain Cancer (BC; Grossman, Brem, Laterra); and one population-oriented Program: Cancer Prevention and Control (CPC; Platz, Roden). These Programs are supported by fifteen Cores, one developing Core (described in Developmental Funds) and a dedicated leadership team. PROJECT NARRATIVE (Public Health Relevance Statement) Cancer is a leading cause of death in the U.S. and throughout the world. With the tremendous medical advances over the past 50 years, the U.S. population's life expectancy has dramatically increased, but because the incidence of most cancers increases with age, cancers have become a profound challenge to the U.S. health care system. Minorities suffer a disproportionate burden of the cancer threat with disparate outcomes for many cancer types. To meet these challenges, dedicated cancer research at the SKCCC and elsewhere over the past 35 years has generated fundamental insights into the molecular mechanisms that cause human cancers to arise, progress and threaten life.

"University of Kentucky Markey Cancer Center - Cancer Center Support Grant PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  The Markey Cancer Center (MCC) was established more than 35 years ago as a university-based matrix cancer center at the University of Kentucky (UK), Kentucky's flagship institution of higher education. MCC is the only National Cancer Institute (NCI)-designated Cancer Center in Kentucky, a state of 4.4 million that leads the nation for all-site cancer incidence and mortality and serves as the MCC's catchment area. Over $347M in state, institutional, and philanthropic investment since recruitment of MCC Director Dr. B. Mark Evers (CS) in 2009 have supported significant research and resource expansion, enabling substantial new faculty recruitment, program development, renovation of clinical and shared resource space, and new state-of-the art instrumentation, as well as statewide education and community outreach efforts. The 119 MCC members draw from 28 departments in 8 UK colleges, with 28 new faculty recruited since 2013. Cancer-relevant research funding to MCC investigators exceeds $38.7M in total annual costs, an increase of $10.3M since 2012. Over the last 4 years, 9,357 subjects have been accrued to interventional trials. Members have published 851 cancer-focused publications since 2013, reflecting 28% intra-programmatic, 16% inter-programmatic, and 58% inter-institutional collaborations. Research is conducted within 4 MCC Research Programs: Cancer Cell Biology and Signaling; Cancer Prevention and Control; Drug Discovery, Delivery and Translational Therapeutics; and Genomic Instability, Epigenetics and Metabolism. Five Shared Resource Facilities (SRFs) facilitate cutting-edge research by providing robust infrastructure for specialized expertise and advanced methods: Biospecimen Procurement and Translational Pathology; Biostatistics and Bioinformatics; Cancer Research Informatics; Flow Cytometry and Cell Sorting; and Redox Metabolism. Two new SRFs (Behavioral and Community-Based Research and Oncogenomics) are in development. Significant achievements include: development of an NCI-sponsored early therapeutics program, including an active Molecular Tumor Board and Precision Medicine Center; expansion of the MCC Network from 8 to 24 sites; establishment of a regional Metabolomics Center (U24); award of 2 new cancer-related centers – a Center of Biomedical Research Excellence (COBRE) in Cancer and Metabolism and a Center for Appalachian Research in Environmental Sciences; and expansion of community outreach/education initiatives across the state. MCC research focuses on Kentucky's most serious cancer burdens with emphasis on the “distressed” Appalachian Kentucky region, where cancer incidence and mortality rates surpass those for the entire state. The MCC brings unique basic, clinical, and population research strengths to this mission. These strengths are integral to all MCC programs and collectively provide robust capacity to deliver transformative interventional research to an important underserved priority population, thereby contributing to national efforts to conquer cancer through discovery and clinical translation, cancer prevention, and community outreach. PROJECT NARRATIVE  The Markey Cancer Center, the only NCI-designated Cancer Center serving 4.4 million Kentuckians in its statewide catchment area, has the institutional authority for all cancer-relevant activities at the University of Kentucky (UK) and within the UK HealthCare enterprise. The center's mission is to reduce cancer incidence and mortality through an integrated, comprehensive program of cancer research, treatment, education, prevention and community engagement. Thus, the Markey Cancer Center delivers in-depth and impactful research programs in basic, translational, and population science, including the development of clinical trials to address Kentucky's unique cancer burden and to accelerate “bench-to-bedside” translational outcomes that will reduce serious health disparities and significantly impact patients, the state and the nation.",University of

"Mayo Comprehensive Cancer Center Grant OVERALL PROJECT SUMMARY The Mayo Clinic Cancer Center (MCCC) is a comprehensive cancer center that has been a designated NCI Center in Rochester, MN (MCR) since 1974. Today, MCCC includes not only MCR, but also sites in Jacksonville, Florida (MCF), and Scottsdale/Phoenix, Arizona (MCA). Each site has a thriving clinical cancer practice with clinical investigators at each of the sites, and a critical mass of basic science and population sciences faculty as well. In 2013, NCI recognized MCCC as an integrated comprehensive cancer based at all 3 sites, based on shared leadership, shared research including multi-investigator grant activity, co-author publications, and enterprise-wide clinical protocol activity. Robert B. Diasio, MD, has been director of MCCC since 2006, leading the center through successful competitive renewals of the CCSG application in 2008 and later in 2013. Since 2013, the center has continued to flourish with strong cancer-focused research, many examples of team science (e.g., SPOREs), an increase in high impact publications and many examples of translational research, and, most importantly, many examples of practice-changing approaches to cancer care. Following strategic planning in 2014, MCCC now has the following aims: 1. To advance the cancer-focused research of each of our MCCC members within our existing 10 Programs and within potential future Programs in order to promote high impact science. 2. To advance interactions of our MCCC members within Programs (intraprogrammatic); across Programs (interprogrammatic); and with individuals at other Cancer Centers and institutions (interinstitutional). 3. To advance new approaches for the treatment of cancer by facilitating translation of basic science concepts from the laboratory to the clinic within MCCC. 4. To continue to build and to further integrate cancer research activities at MCA, MCF, and MCR and to extend these activities to the Mayo Clinic Health System (MCHS). 5. To further develop cancer education for patients, high school, college, and graduate students, postgraduates, as well as faculty. 6. To extend our cancer research, practice, and education within our catchment areas at each of our 3 major sites in MCA, MCF, and MCR and the MCHS with the ultimate goal of lessening cancer burden. We will use these 6 specific aims to further the mission of MCCC: (1) to promote and facilitate research on the incidence, etiology, and molecular basis of cancer, and (2) through education and direct application of the results of such research, to translate the discoveries into improved methods for cancer prevention, detection, diagnosis, prognosis, and therapy.

"Winship Cancer Institute Cancer Center Support Grant PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The Winship Cancer Institute of Emory University (Winship) is the only NCI-designated cancer center in Georgia, which is now the eighth most populous state and has the largest land area among states east of the Mississippi River. As the main tertiary cancer care and cancer research institution in the state, Winship has committed its four research programs as supported by its six shared resources to address the specific challenges associated with the cancer burden in Georgia. These challenges include: high tobacco usage and incidence of tobacco- related cancers; high proportion of cancer patients who are African American or black and/or have significant cancer disparity issues in their care, prognosis, and/or outcome; and low health literacy levels. Winship's mission is to lessen the burden of cancer for the citizens of Georgia, its primary catchment area. This will be accomplished by: (1) seeking greater insights into the molecular, genetic, and epigenetic basis of cancer; (2) discovering new knowledge that drives improvements in cancer detection, prevention, and/or therapy; (3) developing or defining novel therapeutic targets and/or agents as a pathway to better cancer therapies; and (4) studying and implementing population-based strategies to lessen the cancer burden in the state. The 164 Winship core members are actively engaged in one of four Winship research programs, all of which have a strong emphasis on transdisciplinary research: Cancer Cell Biology, Cancer Genetics and Epigenetics, Cancer Prevention and Control, and Discovery and Developmental Therapeutics. Winship's members are supported by six shared resources: Biostatistics and Bioinformatics Shared Resource, Cancer Animal Models Shared Resource, Cancer Tissue and Pathology Shared Resource, Emory Integrated Genomics Shared Resource, Emory Integrated Proteomics Shared Resource, and the Integrated Imaging Shared Resource; and two developing shared resources: Winship Research Informatics and Intervention Development, Dissemination, and Implementation Developing Shared Resources. Winship members are currently supported by $84.8M in total research funding (as of 3/31/2016) awarded via Emory University. Winship members Curran and Bruner serve as PIs on two NCI awards to the NRG Oncology Foundation for a total of $25.6M in support of clinical research infrastructure. Patient enrollment in Winship's interventional and non-interventional trials continues to increase, especially among patients from under-represented minority groups, and these activities have contributed to the FDA- approval of several novel anti-cancer agents during the present funding period. Winship has outstanding institutional commitment, with more than $200 million in institutional support committed over the next five years, a level almost twice that committed in 2011. Winship enjoys the same reporting line and organizational position as Emory's schools of medicine, public health, and nursing. Winship is uniquely positioned to apply its scientific strengths, outstanding membership, robust infrastructure, strong institutional support, and comprehensive training programs to fulfill its mission of lessening the burden of cancer on the state of Georgia and beyond.

"Winship Cancer Institute Cancer Center Support Grant PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The Winship Cancer Institute of Emory University (Winship) is the only NCI-designated cancer center in Georgia, which is now the eighth most populous state and has the largest land area among states east of the Mississippi River. As the main tertiary cancer care and cancer research institution in the state, Winship has committed its four research programs as supported by its six shared resources to address the specific challenges associated with the cancer burden in Georgia. These challenges include: high tobacco usage and incidence of tobacco- related cancers; high proportion of cancer patients who are African American or black and/or have significant cancer disparity issues in their care, prognosis, and/or outcome; and low health literacy levels. Winship's mission is to lessen the burden of cancer for the citizens of Georgia, its primary catchment area. This will be accomplished by: (1) seeking greater insights into the molecular, genetic, and epigenetic basis of cancer; (2) discovering new knowledge that drives improvements in cancer detection, prevention, and/or therapy; (3) developing or defining novel therapeutic targets and/or agents as a pathway to better cancer therapies; and (4) studying and implementing population-based strategies to lessen the cancer burden in the state. The 164 Winship core members are actively engaged in one of four Winship research programs, all of which have a strong emphasis on transdisciplinary research: Cancer Cell Biology, Cancer Genetics and Epigenetics, Cancer Prevention and Control, and Discovery and Developmental Therapeutics. Winship's members are supported by six shared resources: Biostatistics and Bioinformatics Shared Resource, Cancer Animal Models Shared Resource, Cancer Tissue and Pathology Shared Resource, Emory Integrated Genomics Shared Resource, Emory Integrated Proteomics Shared Resource, and the Integrated Imaging Shared Resource; and two developing shared resources: Winship Research Informatics and Intervention Development, Dissemination, and Implementation Developing Shared Resources. Winship members are currently supported by $84.8M in total research funding (as of 3/31/2016) awarded via Emory University. Winship members Curran and Bruner serve as PIs on two NCI awards to the NRG Oncology Foundation for a total of $25.6M in support of clinical research infrastructure. Patient enrollment in Winship's interventional and non-interventional trials continues to increase, especially among patients from under-represented minority groups, and these activities have contributed to the FDA- approval of several novel anti-cancer agents during the present funding period. Winship has outstanding institutional commitment, with more than $200 million in institutional support committed over the next five years, a level almost twice that committed in 2011. Winship enjoys the same reporting line and organizational position as Emory's schools of medicine, public health, and nursing. Winship is uniquely positioned to apply its scientific strengths, outstanding membership, robust infrastructure, strong institutional support, and comprehensive training programs to fulfill its mission of lessening the burden of cancer on the state of Georgia and beyond.

"University of Kentucky Markey Cancer Center - Cancer Center Support Grant PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  The Markey Cancer Center (MCC) was established more than 35 years ago as a university-based matrix cancer center at the University of Kentucky (UK), Kentucky's flagship institution of higher education. MCC is the only National Cancer Institute (NCI)-designated Cancer Center in Kentucky, a state of 4.4 million that leads the nation for all-site cancer incidence and mortality and serves as the MCC's catchment area. Over $347M in state, institutional, and philanthropic investment since recruitment of MCC Director Dr. B. Mark Evers (CS) in 2009 have supported significant research and resource expansion, enabling substantial new faculty recruitment, program development, renovation of clinical and shared resource space, and new state-of-the art instrumentation, as well as statewide education and community outreach efforts. The 119 MCC members draw from 28 departments in 8 UK colleges, with 28 new faculty recruited since 2013. Cancer-relevant research funding to MCC investigators exceeds $38.7M in total annual costs, an increase of $10.3M since 2012. Over the last 4 years, 9,357 subjects have been accrued to interventional trials. Members have published 851 cancer-focused publications since 2013, reflecting 28% intra-programmatic, 16% inter-programmatic, and 58% inter-institutional collaborations. Research is conducted within 4 MCC Research Programs: Cancer Cell Biology and Signaling; Cancer Prevention and Control; Drug Discovery, Delivery and Translational Therapeutics; and Genomic Instability, Epigenetics and Metabolism. Five Shared Resource Facilities (SRFs) facilitate cutting-edge research by providing robust infrastructure for specialized expertise and advanced methods: Biospecimen Procurement and Translational Pathology; Biostatistics and Bioinformatics; Cancer Research Informatics; Flow Cytometry and Cell Sorting; and Redox Metabolism. Two new SRFs (Behavioral and Community-Based Research and Oncogenomics) are in development. Significant achievements include: development of an NCI-sponsored early therapeutics program, including an active Molecular Tumor Board and Precision Medicine Center; expansion of the MCC Network from 8 to 24 sites; establishment of a regional Metabolomics Center (U24); award of 2 new cancer-related centers – a Center of Biomedical Research Excellence (COBRE) in Cancer and Metabolism and a Center for Appalachian Research in Environmental Sciences; and expansion of community outreach/education initiatives across the state. MCC research focuses on Kentucky's most serious cancer burdens with emphasis on the “distressed” Appalachian Kentucky region, where cancer incidence and mortality rates surpass those for the entire state. The MCC brings unique basic, clinical, and population research strengths to this mission. These strengths are integral to all MCC programs and collectively provide robust capacity to deliver transformative interventional research to an important underserved priority population, thereby contributing to national efforts to conquer cancer through discovery and clinical translation, cancer prevention, and community outreach. PROJECT NARRATIVE  The Markey Cancer Center, the only NCI-designated Cancer Center serving 4.4 million Kentuckians in its statewide catchment area, has the institutional authority for all cancer-relevant activities at the University of Kentucky (UK) and within the UK HealthCare enterprise. The center's mission is to reduce cancer incidence and mortality through an integrated, comprehensive program of cancer research, treatment, education, prevention and community engagement. Thus, the Markey Cancer Center delivers in-depth and impactful research programs in basic, translational, and population science, including the development of clinical trials to address Kentucky's unique cancer burden and to accelerate “bench-to-bedside” translational outcomes that will reduce serious health disparities and significantly impact patients, the state and the nation.",University of

"Cancer Center Support Grant PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT MD Anderson Cancer Center is a comprehensive cancer center established within the University of Texas System in 1941. In 2017, the institution welcomed Peter Pisters, MD, as its fifth full-time president and PI of the CCSG. The mission of MD Anderson is to eliminate cancer in Texas, the nation and the world through outstanding programs that integrate patient care, research and prevention, and through education for undergraduate and graduate students, trainees, professionals, employees and the public. MD Anderson is dedicated wholly to the study of cancer involving a continuum of basic, clinical and population-based investigation, with an emphasis on multidisciplinary translational research. MD Anderson employed more than 19,530 people in FY17, including 1,743 faculty members, of whom 705 (40%) are CCSG program members. More than 137,000 people sought care at MD Anderson in FY17 of whom 20,839 were newly diagnosed cancer patients. Annual citations in Web of Science have increased 23% from 3,260 in 2013, to 4,009 in 2017, including 686 (17%) articles in journals with an impact factor >10, and 244 (6%) articles in journals with an impact factor >20. The total research budget increased 26% from $671M in 2013 to $844M in 2017. Direct cost NCI research grant support, excluding training grants and the CCSG, has increased 34%, from $67M in 2013 to $90M in 2018, with the largest number of NCI grants for any institution (>200), including 6 SPOREs, 4 P01s and 35 U awards. Research Programs have been reduced to 16 and support is requested for 14 shared resources. Since the last CCSG renewal, research has been strengthened with recruitment of 97 tenured and tenure track faculty, of whom 18 are supported by recruitment awards from CPRIT totaling $63M. Team science has been enhanced through institutional support of the MD Anderson's Moon Shots ($383M), focused on reducing mortality from 13 major cancers through multi-disciplinary efforts that build on research emerging from the CCSG programs. In FY17, 10,283 participants were enrolled in 1,108 interventional clinical research protocols, of which 936 were treatment (therapeutic) studies that accrued 6,271 subjects. Over the past decade MD Anderson investigators have contributed to the clinical evaluation of 72 of 130 FDA oncology drug approvals, either as a new entity or for a new indication, with 41 of these approvals since the last CCSG renewal. In addition to the main hospital, Houston Area Locations provide prospective, multidisciplinary care and supportive services, with an increasing emphasis on access to clinical trials including national studies. Cancer prevention and survivorship is a priority for MD Anderson with an emphasis on molecular epidemiology, behavioral science, clinical cancer prevention and early detection research to reduce the burden of cancer within Texas and worldwide. PROJECT NARRATIVE: OVERVIEW Cancer affects 1 in every 3 people in the US and as our population ages this fraction is expected to increase. Outcomes for cancer patients have improved over the last several decades, but there is still a great burden of cancer-related mortality and morbidity that is borne disproportionately by minorities and the economically disadvantaged. MD Anderson Cancer Center's mission is to eliminate cancer in Texas, the nation and the world through outstanding programs that integrate patient care, research and prevention, and through education for undergraduate and graduate students, trainees, professionals, employees and the public.

"The Sylvester Cancer Center Support Grant PROJECT SUMMARY: OVERALL The Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center (Sylvester) at the University of Miami seeks National Cancer Institute (NCI) designation to support its mission to reduce the human burden from cancer through research, education, prevention, and the delivery of quality patient care. Sylvester, the only academic Cancer Center located in South Florida, serves one of the most diverse catchment areas in the US. This four-county region (Broward, Miami-Dade, Monroe, and Palm Beach Counties), commonly known as South Florida, is home to more than six million residents and is characterized by substantial ethnic, cultural, racial, and socioeconomic diversity, reflected in the individuals treated by Sylvester and those affected by its outreach efforts. Led by Stephen D. Nimer, MD since 2012, Sylvester leadership has assembled a highly collaborative group of investigators that now includes 114 cancer scientists from three University Schools and Colleges. Sylvester’s research is organized into three Research Programs—Cancer Control, Cancer Epigenetics, and Tumor Biology. These programs are unified by crosscutting scientific themes and by Sylvester’s broader mission to address the cancer burden and disparities prevalent in its catchment area. Sylvester has invested heavily in these Research Programs and in four state-of-the-art shared resources that support Sylvester’s cancer researchers: the Biostatistics and Bioinformatics, Onco-Genomics, Flow Cytometry, and Behavioral and Community-Based Research Shared Resources. Sylvester has also invested heavily in its clinical research infrastructure, which has led to a dramatic increase in interventional treatment accruals (from 75 in 2011 to 509 in 2017), with more than 50% of the 4,568 patient accruals in 2017 representing racial/ethnic minorities. The University has made a substantial commitment to advancing Sylvester’s research capabilities since 2012, supporting the recruitment of 41 cancer researchers and doubling Cancer Center space. Sylvester has also expanded its pre- and post-doctoral training efforts across the clinical, basic, translational, and population sciences, which have been rewarded with five recently awarded NIH or NCI-funded T32 training grants, a U54 grant with a significant training component, and a Paul Calabresi K12 grant. Finally, Sylvester has invested roughly $5.7M in its Intramural Funding Program from 2014 to 2018, which has yielded $25.2M in peer-reviewed funding. Today, Sylvester has $38M in extramural research funding (including training grants), which includes $11M from the NCI; this represents a 12% and 64% increase, respectively, over the past year.

"Regional Oncology Research Center ABSTRACT The Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center (SKCCC) at Johns Hopkins is dedicated to cancer research, education and training, and care, with an overarching goal of expeditiously and strategically applying new knowledge to improve prevention, screening, detection, diagnosis and treatment of cancer in Maryland and throughout nation and the world. Through targeted outreach and research, cancer outcomes disparities are decreasing in SKCCC's catchment area, but they remain a challenge and a focus at SKCCC. This application requests continued Cancer Center Support Grant (CCSG) funding for SKCCC's Research Programs and Cores. The SKCCC comprises a multidisciplinary, interdepartmental center of The Johns Hopkins University (JHU), encompassing 34 departments in five schools. The scientific Programs of the SKCCC organize and orient the broad base of cancer research throughout JHU into teams focused on rapid translation to the clinic and to populations inside and outside its catchment area. Research conducted at SKCCC includes discovery research into the molecular genetics of human tumorigenesis, clinical trials of new cancer treatments and epidemiologic analyses of lifestyle influences on cancer mortality. The SKCCC is a leading cancer center that is providing insights into the fundamental nature of different cancers and elucidating the thousands of somatic genetic and epigenetic alterations that mark the differences from case to case. This body of work has fueled an emerging understanding that the ultimate control of cancer will require individualizing cancer care using approaches that can be deployed at a population scale. To accomplish this mission, SKCCC took critical input from its External Advisory Board and has strategically evolved since the last CCSG to: 1) augment the clinical and population impact of the discovery pipeline in cancer genetics, epigenetics and immunology generated by discipline-oriented Programs; 2) maximize the translational research output of disease-specific Programs, emphasizing the exploration of new concepts in scientifically driven clinical trials; and 3) position the population-oriented Program to identify, understand and overcome barriers responsible for disparities in cancer outcome in the catchment area. The nine SKCCC Research Programs include four discipline-oriented Programs: Cancer Biology (CB; Baylin, Velculescu), Cancer Immunology (CI; Pardoll, Drake), Cancer Molecular and Functional Imaging (CMFI; Bhujwalla, Pomper), and Cancer Chemical and Structural Biology (CCSB; Berger, Liu); four disease- specific Programs: Hematologic Malignancies and Bone Marrow Transplantation (HMBMT; Ambinder, Jones, Levis), Prostate Cancer (PC; Pienta, Denmeade, Lupold), Breast and Ovarian Cancer (BOC; Stearns, Shih), and Brain Cancer (BC; Grossman, Brem, Laterra); and one population-oriented Program: Cancer Prevention and Control (CPC; Platz, Roden). These Programs are supported by fifteen Cores, one developing Core (described in Developmental Funds) and a dedicated leadership team. PROJECT NARRATIVE (Public Health Relevance Statement) Cancer is a leading cause of death in the U.S. and throughout the world. With the tremendous medical advances over the past 50 years, the U.S. population's life expectancy has dramatically increased, but because the incidence of most cancers increases with age, cancers have become a profound challenge to the U.S. health care system. Minorities suffer a disproportionate burden of the cancer threat with disparate outcomes for many cancer types. To meet these challenges, dedicated cancer research at the SKCCC and elsewhere over the past 35 years has generated fundamental insights into the molecular mechanisms that cause human cancers to arise, progress and threaten life.

"Core Support for Cancer Center PROJECT SUMMARY - OVERALL This is an application for years 46-50 funding of the Albert Einstein Cancer Center (AECC) CCSG to support basic, translational, clinical, and population based research that addresses the causes, prevention and treatment of cancer. In September 2015, ownership of the Albert Einstein College of Medicine transferred from Yeshiva University to Montefiore Medicine. The AECC and its clinical partner, the Montefiore Health System, now both under the Montefiore Medicine umbrella, are the major providers of cancer care and prevention programs to the largely minority, and socioeconomically challenged, 1.4M residents of the Bronx. There are five established AECC programs: The Tumor Microenvironment and Metastasis Program which brings together advanced in in vivo imaging technologies and innovative mouse models focused on breast cancer, with recent extension to other neoplasms, and translation into diagnostic, correlative and therapeutic studies in humans. The Stem Cells, Differentiation and Cancer Program encompasses three interrelated themes - stem cell biology, hematological malignancies, and a component focused on basic investigations on epigenetics/ transcription mechanisms and chromatin biology. The Experimental Therapeutics Program is the home for the conduct of all clinical therapeutic trials, and the translation of basic discoveries into investigator-initiated clinical initiatives, at AECC. The program is also the focal point for the development of small molecule inhibitors, and novel immuno-therapeutics, for the treatment of cancer. The Cancer Epidemiology, Prevention and Control Program, evolved from the prior Cancer Epidemiology Program, reflecting the expanded scope of population- based research that encompasses infectious, metabolic, endocrine, obesity-related and genetic/epigenetic causes of cancer and their prevention and control. The Biology of Colon Cancer Program focuses on the convergence of dietary and genetic factors, along with the role of aging, in the pathogenesis of colorectal cancer using mouse models of human cancer now encompassing studies on intestinal stem cells, the microbiome and the villus niche with the objective of translating preclinical findings into prevention strategies. There is research directed to the Bronx catchment area in all five AECC research programs, now brought together with the inauguration of the Community Outreach and Engagement component and units within the Montefiore organization, that provide well-established, effective surveillance, education and outreach capabilities. This, along with the strong clinical electronic informatics at Montefiore and AECC, provide the tools and support that expand the Center's research and implementation capabilities directed to the Bronx population. There are twelve shared resources, including the recent addition of a Chemical Synthesis Shared Resource, that support the spectrum of AECC research activities. There are currently 144 AECC members representing 23 departments with a cancer relevant direct cost funding base of $21M NCI, $18M other NIH, $4M in our peer-review grants, totaling $41M in total peer-reviewed grants.

"Cancer Center Support Grant Project Summary Over the past 5 years, the Wake Forest Baptist Comprehensive Cancer Center (WFBCCC) has continued its upward trajectory in cancer research excellence and service to its catchment area. The WFBCCC catchment area includes the Piedmont and southern Appalachia, a region of 58 contiguous counties in North Carolina, Virginia, West Virginia and Tennessee. The majority of this region is rural and exhibits significant racial health disparities. Elevated age-adjusted smoking rates, obesity rates, cancer incidence, and cancer mortality are observed across the WFBCCC catchment area when compared with the rest of the U.S. To target these issues, the WFBCCC conducts cutting-edge basic, clinical, and population research on the prevention, detection and treatment of cancer, and translates this knowledge into strategies to improve patient outcomes and reduce the incidence of cancer. WFBCCC cancer research funding is $37.9 million, of which over $14.9 million comes from the NCI; this represents a 25.3% increase in total cancer funding since the last CCSG renewal. Center research space under the Director’s authority increased by approximately 65,000 square feet, and the WFBCCC clinical facilities have been dramatically enhanced with the completion of the new eleven- story Cancer Hospital in 2013. This building houses all oncology inpatients and outpatients. The Center’s 127 members span the basic, clinical and population sciences and are organized into 4 Programs with substantial inter-and intra-programmatic productivity. Faculty additions enhanced tobacco control, tobacco-related cancer research, and precision medicine. Substantial investment in faculty, technology, and informatics significantly expanded cancer genomics capabilities. Enrollment of patients into treatment trials reached an all-time high in 2015, with a large increase in the number of patients enrolled in investigator-initiated trials. WFBCCC population scientists initiated exciting new efforts in cancer prevention and survivorship. Clinical scientists completed practice-changing studies in patients with glioma and lung cancer. Groundbreaking observations in prostate cancer emerged from WFBCCC inter-programmatic collaborations. WFBCCC basic science Programs continued to make high impact observations that are being translated into human therapeutics. The WFBCCC requests continued CCSG funding for 4 scientific Programs; 7 Shared Resources; 2 clinical research components; administration and leadership; planning and evaluation; and developmental funds.

Lee Moffitt Cancer Center & Research Institute (MCC) continues its ambitious trajectory of innovative cancer research and translation to benefit the gulf coast region of Florida and beyond. As a free-standing 501(c)3 not-for-profit institution with the sole purpose “to contribute to the prevention and cure of cancer,” all research funding ($71.8M), publications (2,430), and clinical research (>1,600 interventional accruals/ year) are cancer focused. Research and clinical space has expanded dramatically since the last renewal to more than 2 million square feet, and patient clinical volume places MCC among the largest Centers in the United States. MCC has benefitted from recent, ongoing annual state legislature funding of approximately $25 million, in addition to more than $39 million of annual institutional research support. The 142 MCC members span the basic, clinical, and population sciences. They are organized into five highly collaborative, multidisciplinary programs with exceptional levels of intra- (35%) and inter-programmatic (18%) publications. Under the leadership of Dr. Thomas Sellers, the third MCC Director, a Research Strategic Plan (RSP) was developed and implemented for “Moffitt 3.0.” Four of six Associate Center Directors are new; and new leaders have been appointed in every program, with bold goals and specific aims. Two of the 13 shared resources have been significantly restructured (Chemical Biology, Molecular Genomics), and one new resource created (Collaborative Data Services) to better meet the changing needs of MCC scientists. Implementation of the strategic plan has been bolstered by substantial institutional investment, especially in basic science, immunotherapy, and clinical research infrastructure, including the recruitment of 45 new faculty members, of whom 32 are CCSG members. MCC is a leader in immunotherapy, and more than 40% of overall clinical trial accrual is to investigator-initiated studies. MCC population scientists initiated significant new efforts in cancer prevention and outcomes that include vaccines, tobacco cessation, and health disparities. This is particularly true in the unique cancer problems in the catchment area – notably lung cancer, melanoma, and HPV- prevention. MCC's Total Cancer Care protocol, the ground-breaking research strategy to realize the promise of personalized medicine, has continued to thrive, resulting in dramatic utilization of the Tissue Core and the formation of the Oncology Research Information Exchange Network (ORIEN) that now includes eleven cancer centers across the nation, with several more poised to join the consortium this year. MCC requests funding for: five scientific programs, 13 shared resources, two clinical research components, planning and evaluation, administration, leadership, four staff investigators, and developmental funds. CCSG funds are leveraged more than 10-fold with institutional resources to maximize impact on cancer prevention, treatment, and cure in the catchment area, the state of Florida and beyond.

"COMPREHENSIVE CANCER CENTER CORE SUPPORT GRANT ﻿PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTACT The UAB CCC is the only NCI designated comprehensive cancer center in the states of Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana and Arkansas, states with higher cancer mortality and significant minority, mostly African American populations. The Cancer Center is in its 44th year of NCI funding and continues its major contributions to translational therapeutics and cancer disparity research with a focus on training minority investigators. The UAB CCC has 242 members who come from 30 departments in 9 UAB schools, Southern Research, and HudsonAlpha Institute for Biotechnology. The members are supported by $92,055,777 in annual direct extramural funding. The UAB CCC is organized into six research programs, two each in basic, translational, and prevention and control – Inflammation, Immunology & Immunotherapeutics; Cancer Cell Biology; Experimental Therapeutics; Neuro-Oncology; Cancer Chemoprevention; and Cancer Control & Population Sciences. Members published 1,684 cancer focused, peer reviewed publications between 2011 and 2015 of which 24% were intra-programmatic, 16% inter-programmatic, and 53% inter-institutional. These members are supported by eleven shared facilities – Biostatistics & Bioinformatics, Comprehensive Genomics, High Resolution Imaging, Human Imaging, Mass Spectrometry/2D Proteomics, Microbiome/Gnotobiotic, Preclinical Imaging, Recruitment & Retention, Structural Biology, Tissue Procurement, and Transgenic Animals as well as the developing Pharmacometrics Shared Facility. We have established a Phase I Clinical Trials Program, opened an Advanced Imaging Facility, advanced targets through the Alabama Drug Discovery Alliance, created the UAB Health System Cancer Community Network, and are now a consortium with HudsonAlpha Institute for Biotechnology. In addition to these achievements, we have created an Institute for Cancer Outcomes and Survivorship, and established a critical mass of investigators in energy balance and cancer. We have also expanded our minority training programs that since 2005 have trained 59 scholars resulting in 306 publications, 67 grant submissions with 30 funded, and have had a major impact at Morehouse School of Medicine and Tuskegee University. We have recruited 47 investigators to multiple programs in the Cancer Center since 2010. Strategic plans developed in 2011 with crosscutting themes of Translational Therapeutics, Systems Biomedicine, and Energetics and Cancer continue to be highly relevant today. For the future, we will continue to emphasize translational and cancer disparity research with an emphasis on personalized/genomic medicine, energy balance and cancer, outcomes and survivorship, and early phase clinical trials. OVERALL COMPONENT PROJECT NARRATIVE The UAB CCC has made a significant contribution to public health that is particularly relevant to the populations served by this Cancer Center who are located in the heart of the Deep South. Our research programs, in addition to their important contributions to translational science, have focused on the unique problems seen in African American populations that include higher incidences and mortality rates from certain cancers, lower age appropriate screening rates, greater obesity from poor diets and less physical activity, greater tobacco use, and lack of access to

"Georgetown University Lombardi Comprehensive Cancer Center Support Grant ABSTRACT The Georgetown Lombardi Comprehensive Cancer Center (LCCC) is the only NCI-designated comprehensive cancer center based in the nation’s capital. Led by Louis M. Weiner MD since 2008, LCCC’s vision is to prevent and cure cancer with a local focus and global impact. Our mission is to prevent, treat, and cure cancers by linking scientific discovery, expert and compassionate patient care, quality education, and partnership with the community, guided by the principle of cura personalis, “care for the whole person.” LCCC’s strategic objectives are to 1) advance transformative cancer research, 2) reduce the impact of cancer and diminish disparities in our catchment area, 3) lead high-impact clinical research, 4) ensure long-term growth, vibrancy and stability of the research enterprise, and 5) develop the next generation of cancer scientists, clinicians and educators. These objectives were furthered by LCCC’s deepening relationship with the John Theurer Cancer Center (JTCC) of Hackensack Meridian Health (HMH), a clinical and clinical research powerhouse that brings a substantial research base and extends LCCC’s impact. With this P30 competitive renewal application LCCC is applying as a CCSG consortium with JTCC, which meets CCSG FOA external funding requirements. The LCCC Consortium is comprised of Georgetown Lombardi Comprehensive Cancer Center, based in Washington, DC (LCCC-DC) and the John Theurer Cancer Center of Hackensack Meridian Health, based in Hackensack, NJ (LCCC-NJ). Accordingly, the LCCC catchment area is defined by the LCCC-DC and LCCC-NJ catchment areas. LCCC research is based in four research programs: Breast Cancer (BC), Cancer Prevention and Control (CPC), Experimental Therapeutics (ET) and Molecular Oncology (MO). Crosscutting initiatives in data science, minority health and health disparities, cancer precision medicine, immunotherapy and cancer survivorship focus and support the work of these programs. During the current CCSG funding cycle, LCCC employed a robust strategic planning process to develop and refine its research. LCCC conducts research that is practice changing, paradigm shifting and policy informing, with 114 members publishing 1,390 papers (18% with IF>8) during the current CCSG funding period. Current cancer-focused annual direct cost funding for LCCC members is $36,696,492 (of which $3,282,510 is from members based at LCCC-NJ). LCCC had 2,165 interventional clinical trial accruals from 2014-2017 in its DC catchment area, which consists of more than four million people in DC and each surrounding county in Maryland and Virginia. LCCC’s Bergen County NJ catchment area contains nearly 1 million residents. LCCC has increased opportunities for clinical research and care by serving these large, racially and ethnically diverse catchment areas, which suffer from excess mortality from breast, prostate, pancreas and liver cancers. Future plans include expansion of research addressing catchment areas’ needs, with a particular emphasis on hematologic malignancies and cellular therapy translational and clinical research. The Georgetown Lombardi Comprehensive Cancer Center (LCCC) is applying for this renewal of its CCSG as a consortium cancer center with the John Theurer Cancer Center of Hackensack Meridian Health. Our shared vision is to prevent and cure cancer with a local focus and global impact. This is achieved through basic, translational, clinical and population-directed research that addresses important causes and consequences of cancer.
