"NEIGHBORHOOD-LEVEL INFLUENCES ON ALL-CAUSE MORTALITY   DESCRIPTION (Taken from the Investigator's Abstract)                                 Few studies have examined how social and physical features of neighborhoods          interact with individual factors, e.g., health behaviors and socioeconomic           status (SES), to influence disparities in health.  Primary Aims:  The                investigators propose to test the independent and interrelated effects of the        neighborhood social environment (e.g., neighborhood SES, social                      disorganization, Hispanic concentration, crime rates), neighborhood physical         environment (e.g., housing conditions, availability of goods and services such       as licensed alcohol distributors, fast food restaurants, grocery stores, gun         shops, educational resources, recreational facilities, banking/lending               institutions), and individual risk factors in predicting all-cause and               cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality in women and men.  Design/methods:  The       investigators will conduct a prospective mortality follow-up study of 8,847          white (non-Hispanic) and Hispanic women and men who participated in the              Stanford Heart Disease Prevention Program (SHDPP), also referred to as the           Stanford Five-City Project.  This population-based CVD study included a random       sample of women and men aged 25-74 who participated in one of five                   cross-sectional surveys (1979-1990) and were from four socioeconomically             diverse California cities.  The SHDPP is recognized for its comprehensive and        well-standardized survey and physiologic measures that include SES (education,       income, occupation), CVD risk factors (e.g., smoking, high cholesterol and           saturated fat), psychosocial factors, and other health-related measures.  The        investigators propose to match survey data to death records for all-cause and        CVD mortality endpoints, and link geocoded addresses to census data and              archival data for measures of the neighborhood social and physical                   environment.  They anticipate 824 deaths by 2000 and 1690 deaths by 2005.            This work would create a new database where individuals' SES and health              indicators are linked with characteristics of their specific neighborhoods.          Based on their empirical findings, they will identity neighborhoods currently        at high and low risk for mortality, then conduct focus groups and map                neighborhood environments (e.g., social, physical, and service features) to          create a geographic information system (GIS).  These two activities will             hopefully extend their empirical findings, generate new hypotheses, and guide        the development of their Community Outreach and Education Program (COEP).            Dissemination:  The COEP will build on their collaborative partnerships with         members of the study cities, health advocates, and health agencies that serve        low SES and medically under served populations.  With the involvement of these       partners, they will integrate their empirical findings with knowledge from           existing studies and disseminate results via the Internet, media, targeted           mailings, and programs offered by the California State and local county health       departments in the four study cities.

"Neighborhood Disparities and Access to Cardiac Care  DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Although many studies have revealed that blacks have less access to cardiac revascular procedures than do white patients, the reasons for these racial disparities remain unclear. Barriers to receipt of high-quality medical care such as low socioeconomic status are well studied, and lamentably, race and ethnicity are strong correlates of socioeconomic variables in the United States. Bias on the part of medical care providers has also been implicated as a potential mediator of racial and ethnic disparities in access.  Unequal geographic distributions of health care professionals, hospitals, and services provided exist in the United States. In New York State, for example, only selected hospitals are licensed to provide advanced cardiac revascularization. Therefore, in many communities, especially in socioeconomic disadvantaged communities, including inner-city neighborhoods, residents who are admitted to their local hospital for coronary heart disease must rely on the availability of transfer to another hospital if they need to receive revascularization. Whether geography-related factors may impede access to care is important question, but one that has not been previously addressed.   The purpose of this study is to determine whether in New York City, there is an association of neighborhood characteristics, independent of race, and cardiac revascularization among coronary heart disease hospitalized patients. The relative importance of individual patient-related characteristics and community characteristics will be assessed. In addition, time-dependent trends of cardiac procedure use over three census period and factors associated with access to procedures will be determined. Finally, an index to define relative access to the cardiac procedures will be developed. Sensitivity analyses will be conducted using multilevel models to estimate the potential improvement of using revascular procedure in disadvantaged neighborhood by changing the associated neighborhood characteristics. This would be important for policy to eliminate the health disparity.

"Neighborhood, Race and Alcohol Use /Abuse Trajectories  DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Many studies have considered how personal background and family functioning are linked to alcohol use, progression, and desistance. The proposed study is novel in its potential to reveal the ways in which broader social contexts-neighborhoods and schools-contribute to the etiology of alcohol use and abuse. Data are drawn from a prospective, longitudinal study of 3000 youth living in 80 neighborhoods of Chicago. Subjects were surveyed on three occasions over 6 years, and range in age from 9 to 23. The study was designed to include 1) large numbers of three major race/ethnic subgroups (white, black and Hispanic); 2) substantial socioeconomic variation and overlap within each of these race/ethnic subgroups; and 3) substantial variation in the socioeconomic, racial, and ethnic composition of the study neighborhoods. Considerable information collected through surveys, observations, and other sources enable the research team to characterize the social processes in the neighborhoods in which the study participants have resided and in the schools that they have attended. The proposed work follows our previous findings, based on cross-sectional data, that neighborhood context accounted for roughly 50% of the observed black-white disparity in adolescent annual alcohol use rates. The disparity in alcohol use between a black and white youth living in the same neighborhood is roughly half that observed between the average black and white youth in the city of Chicago. Given this evidence of the strong association between neighborhood context and alcohol use, this study aims to 1) describe race/ethnic differences in alcohol use from age 9-23; 2) examine the extent to which these can be accounted for by group differences in socioeconomic status and immigrant generational status; 3) examine the extent to which these differences can be attributed to racial, ethnic, and socioeconomic segregation of groups into different residential and/or school contexts; and 4) determine whether a set of theoretically indicated characteristics of schools and neighborhoods explain these contextual effects. In addition, this study will also support the development of advanced statistical techniques needed to simultaneously estimate school and neighborhood contributions to race/ethnic disparities in alcohol use.

"Alcohol Outlet Density, Alcohol Beverages & Homicide  DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This study will compare the effects of alcohol outlet density and the availability and marketing of HACM (High Alcohol Content Malt) beverages on homicide rates in predominately African American, Hispanic, and Asian American inner-city neighborhoods in 10 cities in the U.S. from 2003 to 2005. The specific aims of this study are to investigate whether: (a) homicide and alcohol outlet density rates are higher in predominately African American neighborhoods than in predominately Hispanic and Asian American inner-city neighborhoods; (b) HACM beverages are more readily available in predominately African American neighborhoods, compared to predominately Hispanic and Asian American neighborhoods; (c) there are more billboards and store advertisements promoting HACM beverages in predominately African American neighborhoods, compared to predominately Hispanic and Asian American neighborhoods; (d) higher homicide rates in predominately African American neighborhoods are related to higher alcohol outlet density rates and to the greater availability and marketing of HACM beverages in predominately African American neighborhoods, compared to predominately Hispanic and Asian American inner-city neighborhoods; and, (e) develop a comprehensive causal model examining the interrelationships between neighborhood racial/ethnic composition, alcohol outlet density, availability and marketing of HACM beverages and homicide rates.  These aims will be achieved using an ecologic trend study design and multiple data collection methods and sources, including analyses of archival data from police reports and observations of alcohol outlets and billboards and stores that advertise HACM beverages. Results from this study will further (a) understanding of how characteristics of the alcohol environment affect disparities in alcohol-related mortality among minority groups; (b) development of conceptual models to guide interdisciplinary approaches to the study of alcohol-related mortality in minority populations; (c) development of new hypotheses regarding the relationships between neighborhood racial/ethnic composition, alcohol outlet density, availability and marketing of HACM beverages and homicide rates; and (d) selection of alcohol policies to reduce future alcohol-related mortality in minority populations.

"Neighborhood Context and the Health of Older Adults    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The capacity of communities to bolster and sustain the well being of individual residents is particularly salient for older adults; their daily activities are likely dependent on the infrastructure and social resources of their communities, particularly if health is already compromised. Although it has long been believed that the neighborhood one lives in affects one's health, it has been difficult to delineate why, and under what circumstances, neighborhood context contributes to health. We bring an important new sociological concept, collective efficacy, to bear on the study of neighborhood and the health of older persons. Using data from the Project on Human Development in Chicago Neighborhoods-Community Survey, the Metropolitan Community  Information Center-Metro Survey, Medicare Claims, and out-patient, hospitalization, and geocoded health services data, we ask: 1) Are structural features of urban neighborhoods--concentrated poverty, concentrated affluence, residential stability, ethnic heterogeneity, and age structurel associated with the  health status of older residents?; 2) Are neighborhood social processes--collective efficacy, social networks, social norms, and physical/social disorder associated with the health of older residents?; 3) is the health services infrastructure of the neighborhood associated with the health of older residents?; and 4) Does the health of older residents affect the ability of the community to sustain social networks and develop collective efficacy? This project goes beyond current research in four ways. First, it extends existing research on neighborhood context and the health of older adults by exploring theoretically informed mechanisms with multi-level statistical tools. Second, it incorporates an understudied area in the neighborhood effects literature--the role of health services and access to care. Simultaneously examining the effects of neighborhood context and health services could enhance our understanding of individual-level racial/ethnic and socioeconomic disparities in health. Third, it acknowledges that the relationship between neighborhood and health is both reciprocal and dynamic. Fourth, it provides a unique opportunity to examine interactions across a number of levels (e.g., individual-neighborhood, neighborhood-health services infrastructure). This project combines perspectives from sociology and health services research; it bridges these disciplines to formulate research that addresses a set of questions vital to both fields and to aging-related policy.

"RAPID VACCINATION OF HARD TO REACH POPULATI0NS    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Proposed is a quasi-experimental design involving a multilevel community participatory intervention that is designed to rapidly immunize hard-to-reach (HTR) populations in disadvantaged minority communities. Low vaccination coverage among minorities and persons living in and near poverty is a persistent problem that is particularly acute among HTR populations (e.g. injection drug users, elderly shut-ins). Immunization rates are affected by multiple factors including demographics, attitudes about vaccination, health norms, barriers to access, and immunization delivery methods. Efforts to successfully vaccinate HTR populations must address these factors. A community-based program with rapid vaccination can serve as an initial model for emergency preparedness vaccination plans and for future efforts to widely introduce HIV vaccination in disadvantaged urban communities. This project will be conducted by a community-public health partnership in eight disadvantaged neighborhoods within Harlem and the South Bronx in three phases. In Phase 1 we will implement a brief survey assessment of residents in designated neighborhoods to identify current key barriers to immunization faced by the target HTR populations in these neighborhoods. Also, using several estimation methods, we will determine the size of the target populations in the study neighborhoods to establish vaccine needed and to estimate denominators for vaccination rates. In Phase 2, we will implement two waves of a multilevel community intervention trial (developed with input from the survey and community partners). In the first wave, four randomly selected neighborhoods will receive the intervention (i.e., community education, community-organization engagement, and door-to-door influenza vaccination program for eligible groups etc). In the four control communities, target populations will be invited to come for vaccination at specified locations as part of usual public health efforts. In the second vaccination wave, using a crossover design, after updating and revising the approach based on experience from Wave 1, we will implement the intervention in the four control communities; this vaccination wave will be conducted over one week to test the feasibility of rapid vaccination of these populations. Phase 3 of this project will identify the promising elements of the program and develop materials to allow generalizability to other urban areas and to other vaccines (e.g., HIV, HBV, etc).         ",RAPID VACCINATION OF HARD TO REACH POPULATI0NS,6745440,R01DA017004,"['health education ', ' public health ', ' medical outreach /case finding ', ' human subject ', ' immunization ', ' health survey ', ' urban poverty area ', ' influenza vaccine ', ' clinical research ', ' behavioral /social science research tag ', ' medically underserved population ', ' health disparity ', ' ']",NIDA,NEW YORK ACADEMY OF MEDICINE,R01,2003,590307,0.10850896749067147
"Understanding Outcome Disparities in Alcohol Treatment  DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Racial disparities in alcohol treatment outcomes are a national problem. There are a number of possible explanations for these disparities in outcomes, including differential access to treatment, different motivations to seek and complete treatment, as well as cultural and sociodemographic factors. Neighborhood and other environmental triggers may also play a role, as well as prior treatment experience. We propose a secondary data analyses of existing alcohol treatment data, utilizing a multilevel modeling approach. The proposed secondary analysis is of the Los Angeles County Alcohol and Drug Treatment Program Participant annual data sets for years 1998, 1999 and 2000, which contain minority focused as well as non-minority focused treatment outcomes in publicly funded clinics for low income clients. The analysis will evaluate the relative effectiveness of the treatments in terms of minority groups, geographic and neighborhood factors, as well as reveal the treatment program characteristics that contribute to positive outcomes. This information about the rating of relative success of each treatment program will be combined with a cost/benefit analysis of treatment programs. Our analytical approach incorporates system level data on neighborhoods and geographic factors, as well as client demographics, and  treatment program characteristics, which may all be related to disparities in treatment outcomes. The county of Los Angeles is uniquely appropriate to address these questions regarding disparities in treatment access and outcome. With a total population of over 9.5 million, and with a multiracial mix of Caucasians, African-Americans and Latinos (31.1 %, 9.5% and 44.6% of the total county population, respectively).

In New York State, for example, only selected hospitals are licensed to provide advanced cardiac revascularization. Therefore, in many communities, especially in socioeconomic disadvantaged communities, including inner-city neighborhoods, residents who are admitted to their local hospital for coronary heart disease must rely on the availability of transfer to another hospital if they need to receive revascularization. Whether geography-related factors may impede access to care is important question, but one that has not been previously addressed.   The purpose of this study is to determine whether in New York City, there is an association of neighborhood characteristics, independent of race, and cardiac revascularization among coronary heart disease hospitalized patients. The relative importance of individual patient-related characteristics and community characteristics will be assessed. In addition, time-dependent trends of cardiac procedure use over three census period and factors associated with access to procedures will be determined. Finally, an index to define relative access to the cardiac procedures will be developed. Sensitivity analyses will be conducted using multilevel models to estimate the potential improvement of using revascular procedure in disadvantaged neighborhood by changing the associated neighborhood characteristics. This would be important for policy to eliminate the health disparity.

"A Dynamic Multilevel Analysis of Substance Use and HIV DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposed research will examine the relationship between neighborhood-level and macrolevel factors and individual HIV seroconversion and self-reported risk behaviors among a cohort of injection drug users (IDUs) in Baltimore, MD. As the epidemic of HIV/AIDS among IDUs persists in Baltimore despite a range of prevention interventions targeted to individual injectors, it is necessary to examine more closely potential risk factors at the neighborhood and macro- levels in order to formulate innovative new prevention strategies to complement efforts currently underway. The primary aim of the proposed research is to identify the relative and attributable risks associated with specific macrolevel versus microlevel risk factors for HIV seroconversion among IDUs in Baltimore. The following hypotheses will be tested: 1) Structural constraints (e.g., concentrated disadvantage, residential instability, population density, mixed land use) increase the risk of HIV transmission; 2) Formal social regulation (e.g., community policing, targeted narcotics crackdowns) increases the risk of HIV transmission; 3) Informal social regulation (e.g., collective efficacy) decreases the risk of HIV transmission; and 4) Narcotics price and purity are related to HIV seroconversion risk. The proposed research will involve the design and conduct of a multilevel analysis to investigate the spatial dynamics of HIV transmission among IDUs that are not entirely explained by the demographic and risk behavior characteristics of individuals. This analysis will begin with a descriptive exploration of the geography of narcotics abuse and HIV in Baltimore from 1988 to 2000, making use of data on HIV incidence and individual-level HIV risk behavior among local IDUs from the Johns Hopkins ALIVE cohort study, and over a decade of data on neighborhood crime from the Baltimore City Police Department. This will be followed by a review of recent and on-going qualitative Baltimore neighborhood assessments to obtain measures of informal social control and to achieve an understanding of the risk environment in which the epidemic of HIV/AIDS among injection drug users in has been unfolding. Spatial and temporal patterns of neighborhood crime and disease will be analyzed using SpaceStat and Geographic Information System (GIS) software. Results of this research will contribute to the design of structural interventions to interrupt causal pathways of both drug use and HIV transmission.

"Education, Resource Substitution, and Health DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The aim of this research is to examine the conditions under which education is more or less beneficial to health. The association between education and health is well-established, but whether the strength of this association depends on other social statuses is not. We propose to develop and test a theory of ""resource substitution"" which states that education's influence on health is greater for person's with fewer alternative resources than it is for the more advantaged. We focus mainly on three disadvantaged socioeconomic statuses, representing disadvantaged social origins (low parental education), individual socioeconomic disadvantage (low income) and neighborhood disadvantage (indexed by the prevalence of poverty, mother-only households, college education, and home ownership). The first precedes ones own educational attainment, and the other two follow from it. We also examine a number of other disadvantaged statuses that could modify the effect of education on health, including parental divorce, female gender, minority status, lack of full-time employment, and perceived neighborhood disorder. We will compare the hypotheses derived from resource substitution theory with the alternative (which we call ""resource multiplication"") which suggests that the influence of education is health is greater for persons with more resources. Finally we will examine mediators of the moderators, ff education has a larger effect on health for the disadvantaged, why does it?      We will analyze data from our two longitudinal surveys, ""Aging, Status, and the Sense of Control"" (ASOC; U.S. sample) and ""Community, Crime, and Health"" (CCH; Illinois sample). We measured self-reported health, physical functioning, chronic conditions, and psychological symptoms; the potential mediators and moderators of the education-health association; detailed information about education; and, in CCH, linked census data on respondents' neighborhoods. We will model the changes in health with subsequent and concurrent change models, structural equation models with latent factors, self-amplifying latent curve models, and multilevel models.

"Impact of Poverty, LBW, and Obesity Across the Lifespan    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application is in response to the Program Announcement entitled Social and Cultural Dimensions of Health (PA-02-043). Two important health problems are studied: low birth weight (LBW) and obesity. It is well known that LBW and obesity disproportionately affects those in the lowest socio-economic strata [1] [2]. However, while numerous studies have documented a strong and consistent relationship between poverty and low birth weight, and poverty and obesity [1, 4-6] [7], there is a paucity of research going beyond these descriptions to investigate the multiple dimensions of absolute and relative poverty. These health problems need to be studied in a new way that goes beyond the individual level and simple cross sectional designs. This study will do so. We will develop innovative cumulative measures of individual and neighborhood relative deprivation and a cumulative measure of the generosity of the social safety net (e.g. income supplements for TANF families) to supplement point-in-time measures of absolute deprivation at the individual and neighborhood level. Relative deprivation is a formal construct used in welfare economics to quantify relative social rank [8] [9]. This study will use three key health measures, birth weight, adult body mass index (BMI) and child percentile rank of BMI-for-age and gender (PR), to examine relationships between relative and absolute deprivation and these health problems. Longitudinal data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1979 (NLSY79) and its associated child study are used to implement these analyses. The specific aims for this application are: 1) Test the significance of relative deprivation, at a point-in-time and cumulatively, in explaining the observed socio-economic differences in birth weight controlling for absolute measures of individual income, neighborhood poverty and known risk factors. 2) Test the significance of relative deprivation, at a point-in-time and cumulatively, in explaining the observed socioeconomic differences in adult BMI controlling for absolute measures of individual income, neighborhood poverty and known risk factors.  3) Test the significance of relative deprivation, at a point-in-time and cumulatively, in explaining the observed socio-economic differences in childhood BMI, measured by percentile rankings, controlling for absolute measures of individual income, neighborhood poverty, maternal BMI and known risk factors.            ","Impact of Poverty, LBW, and Obesity Across the Lifespan",6669880,R01NR008512,"['obesity ', ' longitudinal human study ', ' socioeconomics ', ' public assistance ', ' socioenvironment ', ' urban poverty area ', ' environmental stressor ', ' psychological stressor ', ' low birth weight infant human ', ' human data ', ' clinical research ', ' behavioral /social science research tag ', ' health services research tag ', ' health disparity ', ' ']",NINR,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2003,227329,0.050201901736785313
"Neighborhoods and CVD Risk in a Multiethnic Cohort DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Recent epidemiologic studies have found that living in socioeconomically disadvantaged neighborhoods is associated with increased prevalence and incidence of coronary heart disease, even after controlling for measures of personal income, education, and occupation. Although this suggests that features of neighborhoods may be relevant to cardiovascular risk, important questions remain regarding whether the associations observed reflect causal processes. Two important unresolved issues are the role of selection factors in generating these associations and the need to identify the specific characteristics of neighborhoods that are relevant. The general aim of this epidemiologic study is to investigate if neighborhood characteristics are related to disease risk in a multiethnic cohort. Using publicly available and newly collected neighborhood data linked to the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) the project will: (1) examine the relationship between neighborhood socioeconomic characteristics and the prevalence and progression of subclinical atherosclerosis; (2) examine associations of neighborhood socioeconomic characteristics with specific individual-level factors which may mediate neighborhood differences in disease risk; (3) develop measures of specific characteristics of neighborhood environments (such as measures of resource availability, neighborhood social cohesion and neighborhood stress) and examine their relation to selected individual-level risk factors; (4) determine if these specific neighborhood characteristics explain differences in cardiovascular risk between socioeconomically advantaged and socioeconomically disadvantaged neighborhoods; and (5) examine if neighborhood characteristics contribute to race/ethnic differences in cardiovascular risk. Measures of neighborhood attributes will be based on Year 2000 Census data, surveys of area residents, and the use of GIS methods to link data on area resources to MESA neighborhoods. The examination of subclinical disease as outcomes avoids problems related to selection of persons into neighborhoods based on their health status. The project will use two innovative approaches (residential surveys and ecometric techniques and GIS-based methods) to develop direct measures of specific neighborhood attributes in order to test their relationship to disease risk. Confirming that specific features of neighborhoods are causally related to disease would have important implications for prevention.

"HIV Risk and Neighborhood Networks of New IDUs    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  New injecting drug users (IDUs) are at risk of becoming infected with the hepatitis C virus (HCV), the hepatitis B virus  (HBV) and HIV within the first few years after they start to inject. However, the risk of infection among new injectors varies by race/ethnicity, with African Americans at greater risk of infection than white new IDUs. Risk behaviors alone do not sufficiently explain why African American IDUs are at greater risk of infection. Racial/ethnic differences in the risk of infection among new injectors may be related to different probabilities in the risk of exposure to infection, which may stem from differences in sociocentric (groups of directly and indirectly connected IDUs) and egocentric (groups of directly connected IDUs) transmission networks. Variation by race/ethnicity in the transmission networks of new IDUs may also be influenced by neighborhood differences in the provision of harm reduction and other health services, as well as other differences in the social and physical environment of neighborhoods, since IDUs are often geographically separated by race/ethnicity into different neighborhoods.  In this study, we will investigate the sociocentric and egocentric network risks for infection with HIV, HCV and HBV in two high-risk neighborhoods in New York City, one of which is predominantly African-American and the other in which new IDUs are predominantly white. Using a sequential cross-section design with an imbedded prospective cohort, we will compare a predominantly African-American group of new injectors and a predominantly white group of new injectors m geographically separate neighborhoods to determine differences in: (1) The prevalence and incidence of HIV, HCV and HBV; (2) The relationship of sociocentric and egocentric networks to HIV, HCV, and HBV transmission; (3) The relationship of sociocentric and egocentric networks to risk and risk reduction behaviors, knowledge of infection risk and  prevention, and access to and utilization of harm reduction and other health services; (4) Factors associated with the  maintenance or change in sociocentric and egocentric networks and risk and risk reduction behaviors and practices, and  the relationship of these factors to the rate of HIV, HCV, and HBV seroconversions; and (5) using ethnographic methods  and Geographic Information Systems, to explore the relationship of neighborhood factors to network and behavioral  infection risk.  Understanding the extent to which the multi-level influences of neighborhood context, network characteristics and behavior shape the risk of acquiring or transmitting HIV, HCV and HBV among new injectors can contribute towards the development of structural interventions targeted at new injectors and their injecting and sex partners in high-risk neighborhoods.             ",HIV Risk and Neighborhood Networks of New IDUs,6591133,R01DA014515,"['disease /disorder proneness /risk ', ' intravenous drug abuse ', ' health care service utilization ', ' human subject ', ' HIV infection ', ' interview ', ' hepatitis B ', ' longitudinal human study ', ' high risk behavior /lifestyle ', ' African American ', ' caucasian American ', ' racial /ethnic difference ', ' socioenvironment ', ' needle sharing ', ' hepatitis C ', ' clinical research ', ' behavioral /social science research tag ', ' substance abuse epidemiology ', ' health disparity ', ' ']",NIDA,"NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT AND RESEARCH INSTITUTES, INC.",R01,2003,624291,0.14455826412775372
"Alcohol Outlet Density, Alcohol Beverages & Homicide  DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This study will compare the effects of alcohol outlet density and the availability and marketing of HACM (High Alcohol Content Malt) beverages on homicide rates in predominately African American, Hispanic, and Asian American inner-city neighborhoods in 10 cities in the U.S. from 2003 to 2005. The specific aims of this study are to investigate whether: (a) homicide and alcohol outlet density rates are higher in predominately African American neighborhoods than in predominately Hispanic and Asian American inner-city neighborhoods; (b) HACM beverages are more readily available in predominately African American neighborhoods, compared to predominately Hispanic and Asian American neighborhoods; (c) there are more billboards and store advertisements promoting HACM beverages in predominately African American neighborhoods, compared to predominately Hispanic and Asian American neighborhoods; (d) higher homicide rates in predominately African American neighborhoods are related to higher alcohol outlet density rates and to the greater availability and marketing of HACM beverages in predominately African American neighborhoods, compared to predominately Hispanic and Asian American inner-city neighborhoods; and, (e) develop a comprehensive causal model examining the interrelationships between neighborhood racial/ethnic composition, alcohol outlet density, availability and marketing of HACM beverages and homicide rates.  These aims will be achieved using an ecologic trend study design and multiple data collection methods and sources, including analyses of archival data from police reports and observations of alcohol outlets and billboards and stores that advertise HACM beverages.

"NEIGHBORHOODS AND THE HEALTH OF ELDERLY AMERICANS This project is coordinated with P50 ES012383, Nicole Lurie, ?UNDERSTANDING NEIGHBORHOOD IMPACTS ON HEALTH.? This project investigates how contextual factors, specifically the built and socioeconomic features of neighborhoods, affect the health of elderly Americans. Neighborhood characteristics may influence the health of elderly persons in two principal ways:  through direct contemporaneous effects on health status and functioning, or through cumulative effects from earlier points in the lifecourse. Because many neighborhood features are modifiable, identifying changes in those aspects of neighborhood environment with the greatest influence on health could become important in addressing health disparities and improving health overall. Understanding at what points in the lifecourse the neighborhood environment most affects health will further inform interventions to reduce disparities in health and functioning in old age. Unfortunately, there is a paucity of literature on how these contextual factors affect late-life health and functioning. The few existing studies of the elderly are based on small sample sizes drawn largely from confined geographic areas and are thus of limited generalizability. We propose to undertake a national study of the effect of neighborhoods, both built and social environments on health and functioning in old age. The study has the following aims: 1) to measure the effects of the built and social environment on the health and health trajectories of the elderly, with a focus on identifying those neighborhood features that have the most impact on health and are amenable to policy interventions; 2) to understand how and at what points neighborhood environments from earlier in life influence health in old age; and 3) to examine whether neighborhood features have differential impacts on important subpopulations of the elderly, such as men and women, people with low socioeconomic status, and racial/ethnic minorities.  The study will use two nationally representative panel data sets, the Health and Retirement Survey (1992-2002) and the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (1968-2003). These data sets contain large samples of elderly persons that are representative of the elderly population of the United States. Neighborhood characteristics, derived from the work of the Center's data core, will be merged with the individual level data at the census tract level.

"UTMB Center for Population Health and Health Disparities    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The proposed project will explore the relationship between neighborhood context and measures of health among Hispanics.  In preliminary analyses, the investigators have found that an increasing percentage of Hispanics residing in a census tract is related to low overall mortality, cancer mortality, and cancer incidence among Hispanics, after controlling for numerous community and individual characteristics and risk factors, including immigrant status and acculturation.  At the same time, increasing census tract percent Hispanics is associated with decreased survival after a diagnosis of cancer.  The investigators now propose to explore the reasons for these strong neighborhood effects on health by examining several data sets linked to census data: Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) data on cancer incidence and survival, vital registration data on cancer mortality, and the National Health Interview Survey-National Death Index file on cancer prevalence and mortality and all cause mortality.

"RAPID VACCINATION OF HARD TO REACH POPULATI0NS    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Proposed is a quasi-experimental design involving a multilevel community participatory intervention that is designed to rapidly immunize hard-to-reach (HTR) populations in disadvantaged minority communities. Low vaccination coverage among minorities and persons living in and near poverty is a persistent problem that is particularly acute among HTR populations (e.g. injection drug users, elderly shut-ins). Immunization rates are affected by multiple factors including demographics, attitudes about vaccination, health norms, barriers to access, and immunization delivery methods. Efforts to successfully vaccinate HTR populations must address these factors. A community-based program with rapid vaccination can serve as an initial model for emergency preparedness vaccination plans and for future efforts to widely introduce HIV vaccination in disadvantaged urban communities. This project will be conducted by a community-public health partnership in eight disadvantaged neighborhoods within Harlem and the South Bronx in three phases. In Phase 1 we will implement a brief survey assessment of residents in designated neighborhoods to identify current key barriers to immunization faced by the target HTR populations in these neighborhoods. Also, using several estimation methods, we will determine the size of the target populations in the study neighborhoods to establish vaccine needed and to estimate denominators for vaccination rates. In Phase 2, we will implement two waves of a multilevel community intervention trial (developed with input from the survey and community partners). In the first wave, four randomly selected neighborhoods will receive the intervention (i.e., community education, community-organization engagement, and door-to-door influenza vaccination program for eligible groups etc). In the four control communities, target populations will be invited to come for vaccination at specified locations as part of usual public health efforts. In the second vaccination wave, using a crossover design, after updating and revising the approach based on experience from Wave 1, we will implement the intervention in the four control communities; this vaccination wave will be conducted over one week to test the feasibility of rapid vaccination of these populations. Phase 3 of this project will identify the promising elements of the program and develop materials to allow generalizability to other urban areas and to other vaccines (e.g., HIV, HBV, etc).         ",RAPID VACCINATION OF HARD TO REACH POPULATI0NS,6925198,R01DA017004,"['health education ', ' public health ', ' medical outreach /case finding ', ' human subject ', ' immunization ', ' health survey ', ' urban poverty area ', ' influenza vaccine ', ' clinical research ', ' behavioral /social science research tag ', ' medically underserved population ', ' health disparity ', ' ']",NIDA,NEW YORK ACADEMY OF MEDICINE,R01,2004,99764,0.10850896749067147

"NEIGHBORHOOD-LEVEL INFLUENCES ON ALL-CAUSE MORTALITY   DESCRIPTION (Taken from the Investigator's Abstract)                                 Few studies have examined how social and physical features of neighborhoods          interact with individual factors, e.g., health behaviors and socioeconomic           status (SES), to influence disparities in health.  Primary Aims:  The                investigators propose to test the independent and interrelated effects of the        neighborhood social environment (e.g., neighborhood SES, social                      disorganization, Hispanic concentration, crime rates), neighborhood physical         environment (e.g., housing conditions, availability of goods and services such       as licensed alcohol distributors, fast food restaurants, grocery stores, gun         shops, educational resources, recreational facilities, banking/lending               institutions), and individual risk factors in predicting all-cause and               cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality in women and men.  Design/methods:  The       investigators will conduct a prospective mortality follow-up study of 8,847          white (non-Hispanic) and Hispanic women and men who participated in the              Stanford Heart Disease Prevention Program (SHDPP), also referred to as the           Stanford Five-City Project.  This population-based CVD study included a random       sample of women and men aged 25-74 who participated in one of five                   cross-sectional surveys (1979-1990) and were from four socioeconomically             diverse California cities.  The SHDPP is recognized for its comprehensive and        well-standardized survey and physiologic measures that include SES (education,       income, occupation), CVD risk factors (e.g., smoking, high cholesterol and           saturated fat), psychosocial factors, and other health-related measures.  The        investigators propose to match survey data to death records for all-cause and        CVD mortality endpoints, and link geocoded addresses to census data and              archival data for measures of the neighborhood social and physical                   environment.  They anticipate 824 deaths by 2000 and 1690 deaths by 2005.            This work would create a new database where individuals' SES and health              indicators are linked with characteristics of their specific neighborhoods.          Based on their empirical findings, they will identity neighborhoods currently        at high and low risk for mortality, then conduct focus groups and map                neighborhood environments (e.g., social, physical, and service features) to          create a geographic information system (GIS).  These two activities will             hopefully extend their empirical findings, generate new hypotheses, and guide        the development of their Community Outreach and Education Program (COEP).            Dissemination:  The COEP will build on their collaborative partnerships with         members of the study cities, health advocates, and health agencies that serve        low SES and medically under served populations.  With the involvement of these       partners, they will integrate their empirical findings with knowledge from           existing studies and disseminate results via the Internet, media, targeted           mailings, and programs offered by the California State and local county health       departments in the four study cities.

"UTMB Center for Population Health and Health Disparities    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The proposed project will explore the relationship between neighborhood context and measures of health among Hispanics.  In preliminary analyses, the investigators have found that an increasing percentage of Hispanics residing in a census tract is related to low overall mortality, cancer mortality, and cancer incidence among Hispanics, after controlling for numerous community and individual characteristics and risk factors, including immigrant status and acculturation.  At the same time, increasing census tract percent Hispanics is associated with decreased survival after a diagnosis of cancer.  The investigators now propose to explore the reasons for these strong neighborhood effects on health by examining several data sets linked to census data: Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) data on cancer incidence and survival, vital registration data on cancer mortality, and the National Health Interview Survey-National Death Index file on cancer prevalence and mortality and all cause mortality.  Finally, the researchers will investigate the relationship of Hispanic census tract density and other contextual measures with individual characteristics, health behaviors, social support, affective disorders and physiologic measures using a census-linked NHANES file.         ",UTMB Center for Population Health and Health Disparities,6796789,P50CA105631,"['disease /disorder prevention /control ', ' human subject ', ' epidemiology ', ' vital statistics ', ' Hispanic American ', ' clinical research ', ' health disparity ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS MED BR GALVESTON,P50,2004,2058686,0.0806809144822236

"Neighborhoods and CVD Risk in a Multiethnic Cohort DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Recent epidemiologic studies have found that living in socioeconomically disadvantaged neighborhoods is associated with increased prevalence and incidence of coronary heart disease, even after controlling for measures of personal income, education, and occupation. Although this suggests that features of neighborhoods may be relevant to cardiovascular risk, important questions remain regarding whether the associations observed reflect causal processes. Two important unresolved issues are the role of selection factors in generating these associations and the need to identify the specific characteristics of neighborhoods that are relevant. The general aim of this epidemiologic study is to investigate if neighborhood characteristics are related to disease risk in a multiethnic cohort. Using publicly available and newly collected neighborhood data linked to the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) the project will: (1) examine the relationship between neighborhood socioeconomic characteristics and the prevalence and progression of subclinical atherosclerosis; (2) examine associations of neighborhood socioeconomic characteristics with specific individual-level factors which may mediate neighborhood differences in disease risk; (3) develop measures of specific characteristics of neighborhood environments (such as measures of resource availability, neighborhood social cohesion and neighborhood stress) and examine their relation to selected individual-level risk factors; (4) determine if these specific neighborhood characteristics explain differences in cardiovascular risk between socioeconomically advantaged and socioeconomically disadvantaged neighborhoods; and (5) examine if neighborhood characteristics contribute to race/ethnic differences in cardiovascular risk. Measures of neighborhood attributes will be based on Year 2000 Census data, surveys of area residents, and the use of GIS methods to link data on area resources to MESA neighborhoods. The examination of subclinical disease as outcomes avoids problems related to selection of persons into neighborhoods based on their health status. The project will use two innovative approaches (residential surveys and ecometric techniques and GIS-based methods) to develop direct measures of specific neighborhood attributes in order to test their relationship to disease risk. Confirming that specific features of neighborhoods are causally related to disease would have important implications for prevention.

"NEIGHBORHOODS AND THE HEALTH OF ELDERLY AMERICANS This project is coordinated with P50 ES012383, Nicole Lurie, ?UNDERSTANDING NEIGHBORHOOD IMPACTS ON HEALTH.? This project investigates how contextual factors, specifically the built and socioeconomic features of neighborhoods, affect the health of elderly Americans. Neighborhood characteristics may influence the health of elderly persons in two principal ways:  through direct contemporaneous effects on health status and functioning, or through cumulative effects from earlier points in the lifecourse. Because many neighborhood features are modifiable, identifying changes in those aspects of neighborhood environment with the greatest influence on health could become important in addressing health disparities and improving health overall. Understanding at what points in the lifecourse the neighborhood environment most affects health will further inform interventions to reduce disparities in health and functioning in old age. Unfortunately, there is a paucity of literature on how these contextual factors affect late-life health and functioning. The few existing studies of the elderly are based on small sample sizes drawn largely from confined geographic areas and are thus of limited generalizability. We propose to undertake a national study of the effect of neighborhoods, both built and social environments on health and functioning in old age. The study has the following aims: 1) to measure the effects of the built and social environment on the health and health trajectories of the elderly, with a focus on identifying those neighborhood features that have the most impact on health and are amenable to policy interventions; 2) to understand how and at what points neighborhood environments from earlier in life influence health in old age; and 3) to examine whether neighborhood features have differential impacts on important subpopulations of the elderly, such as men and women, people with low socioeconomic status, and racial/ethnic minorities.  The study will use two nationally representative panel data sets, the Health and Retirement Survey (1992-2002) and the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (1968-2003). These data sets contain large samples of elderly persons that are representative of the elderly population of the United States. Neighborhood characteristics, derived from the work of the Center's data core, will be merged with the individual level data at the census tract level.

"Intra-Urban Health Assessed by Remote-Sensing and GIS DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This project explores the use of remotely sensed imagery and GIS to enhance our understanding of intraurban inequalities in health, using data for the metropolitan area of Accra, Ghana as a study site. The specific aims are as follows: (1) to derive local (neighborhood) measures of health by combining spatially referenced census data, survey data, and vital statistics into a geographic information system (GIS) for metropolitan Accra; (2) to derive local (neighborhood) measures of the built and natural environment through the classification and analysis of data from remotely sensed imagery; (3) to test the hypothesis that health levels in urban places are importantly influenced by the local neighborhood environmental context, including the natural and built environment, the socio-economic composition of the neighborhood's residents, and the location of a neighborhood within the broader urban environment (including its proximity to health clinics and hospitals); (4) to assess the relative contribution of neighborhood environmental context, population composition, and the neighborhood Iocational attributes to health outcomes in metropolitan Accra; (5) to model the interaction among the variables that predict health levels to determine what changes might be introduced into a neighborhood to bring its overall level of health up to a minimally acceptable standard; and (6) to evaluate how well the remotely-sensed data can, on their own as a proxy, model the intra-urban inequalities in health in ways that might lead these data to be used as health monitoring tools.  The research involves three major steps: (1) creation of data layers and specification of georeferenced variables to be measured, including data from the 2000 Census, the 1998 and 2003 Demographic and Health Surveys, the 2003 Women's Health in Accra Survey, the 2003 WHO World Health Survey in Ghana, data from the vital statistics for 1999-2001, and a high resolution multispectral satellite image which will be classified according to the Ridd V-I-S model of urban ecology, subsequent to which a set of landscape metrics will be calculated to measure the built and natural environments; (2) statistical analysis to answer the questions posed by our Specific Aims, which will include spatial statistics, regression, and multi-level approaches; and (3) interpretation and dissemination of the results.

"Neighborhoods and cardiovascular risk (RMI)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This supplement to ""Neighborhoods and Cardiovascular Risk in a Multiethnic Cohort"" (R01 HL071759) will build on work carried out in the parent grant in order to improve the measures of neighborhood-level attributes to be examined in relation to cardiovascular outcomes. The measurement of neighborhood-level attributes remains a key challenge in the rapidly growing field of the investigation of neighborhood health effects. There is scant information on the reliability of different types of measures of neighborhood environments, and on the agreement between self-reported and objective measures. In addition, the use of multilevel techniques to develop improved measures of neighborhood-level constructs for small areas based on small numbers of observations in each area remains in its infancy. The objectives of this supplement are (1) To investigate the reliability of self-reported measures of neighborhood attributes (2). To investigate the agreement between GIS-based measures and self-reported measures of the neighborhood environment (3) To investigate the use of census data to improve empirical-Bayes estimates of neighborhood-level attributes using multilevel techniques; and (4) To evaluate the impact of alternate measurement and estimation strategies on estimates of neighborhood-health effects obtained from observational studies. The work to be carried out as part of this methodological supplement will be of direct relevance to the analyses planned under the parent grant by (1) quantifying the reliability of the measures used and (2) improving the estimates of neighborhood-level constricts to be used as predictors in models relating neighborhood-level factors to health outcomes in the MESA cohort. More generally, the work proposed will inform future studies that measure neighborhood-level attributes by providing estimates of the reliability and validity of neighborhood-level measures and by further developing the application of econometric techniques to the measurement of neighborhood-level constructs.         ",Neighborhoods and cardiovascular risk (RMI),6857765,R01HL071759,"['atherosclerosis ', ' cardiovascular disorder epidemiology ', ' health economics ', ' human subject ', ' health survey ', ' anger ', ' anxiety ', ' depression ', ' racial /ethnic difference ', ' socioeconomics ', ' community ', ' stress ', ' human data ', ' smoking ', ' clinical research ', ' cardiovascular disorder risk ', ' geographic difference ', ' health disparity ', ' ']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2004,107888,0.16110550282749078
"HIV Risk and Neighborhood Networks of New IDUs    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  New injecting drug users (IDUs) are at risk of becoming infected with the hepatitis C virus (HCV), the hepatitis B virus  (HBV) and HIV within the first few years after they start to inject. However, the risk of infection among new injectors varies by race/ethnicity, with African Americans at greater risk of infection than white new IDUs. Risk behaviors alone do not sufficiently explain why African American IDUs are at greater risk of infection. Racial/ethnic differences in the risk of infection among new injectors may be related to different probabilities in the risk of exposure to infection, which may stem from differences in sociocentric (groups of directly and indirectly connected IDUs) and egocentric (groups of directly connected IDUs) transmission networks. Variation by race/ethnicity in the transmission networks of new IDUs may also be influenced by neighborhood differences in the provision of harm reduction and other health services, as well as other differences in the social and physical environment of neighborhoods, since IDUs are often geographically separated by race/ethnicity into different neighborhoods.  In this study, we will investigate the sociocentric and egocentric network risks for infection with HIV, HCV and HBV in two high-risk neighborhoods in New York City, one of which is predominantly African-American and the other in which new IDUs are predominantly white. Using a sequential cross-section design with an imbedded prospective cohort, we will compare a predominantly African-American group of new injectors and a predominantly white group of new injectors m geographically separate neighborhoods to determine differences in: (1) The prevalence and incidence of HIV, HCV and HBV; (2) The relationship of sociocentric and egocentric networks to HIV, HCV, and HBV transmission; (3) The relationship of sociocentric and egocentric networks to risk and risk reduction behaviors, knowledge of infection risk and  prevention, and access to and utilization of harm reduction and other health services; (4) Factors associated with the  maintenance or change in sociocentric and egocentric networks and risk and risk reduction behaviors and practices, and  the relationship of these factors to the rate of HIV, HCV, and HBV seroconversions; and (5) using ethnographic methods  and Geographic Information Systems, to explore the relationship of neighborhood factors to network and behavioral  infection risk.  Understanding the extent to which the multi-level influences of neighborhood context, network characteristics and behavior shape the risk of acquiring or transmitting HIV, HCV and HBV among new injectors can contribute towards the development of structural interventions targeted at new injectors and their injecting and sex partners in high-risk neighborhoods.             ",HIV Risk and Neighborhood Networks of New IDUs,6700832,R01DA014515,"['disease /disorder proneness /risk ', ' intravenous drug abuse ', ' health care service utilization ', ' human subject ', ' HIV infection ', ' interview ', ' hepatitis B ', ' longitudinal human study ', ' high risk behavior /lifestyle ', ' African American ', ' caucasian American ', ' racial /ethnic difference ', ' socioenvironment ', ' needle sharing ', ' hepatitis C ', ' clinical research ', ' behavioral /social science research tag ', ' substance abuse epidemiology ', ' health disparity ', ' ']",NIDA,"NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT AND RESEARCH INSTITUTES, INC.",R01,2004,826290,0.14455826412775372

"Understanding Outcome Disparities in Alcohol Treatment  DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Racial disparities in alcohol treatment outcomes are a national problem. There are a number of possible explanations for these disparities in outcomes, including differential access to treatment, different motivations to seek and complete treatment, as well as cultural and sociodemographic factors. Neighborhood and other environmental triggers may also play a role, as well as prior treatment experience. We propose a secondary data analyses of existing alcohol treatment data, utilizing a multilevel modeling approach. The proposed secondary analysis is of the Los Angeles County Alcohol and Drug Treatment Program Participant annual data sets for years 1998, 1999 and 2000, which contain minority focused as well as non-minority focused treatment outcomes in publicly funded clinics for low income clients. The analysis will evaluate the relative effectiveness of the treatments in terms of minority groups, geographic and neighborhood factors, as well as reveal the treatment program characteristics that contribute to positive outcomes. This information about the rating of relative success of each treatment program will be combined with a cost/benefit analysis of treatment programs. Our analytical approach incorporates system level data on neighborhoods and geographic factors, as well as client demographics, and  treatment program characteristics, which may all be related to disparities in treatment outcomes. The county of Los Angeles is uniquely appropriate to address these questions regarding disparities in treatment access and outcome. With a total population of over 9.5 million, and with a multiracial mix of Caucasians, African-Americans and Latinos (31.1 %, 9.5% and 44.6% of the total county population, respectively).

"Neighborhood, Race and Alcohol Use /Abuse Trajectories  DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Many studies have considered how personal background and family functioning are linked to alcohol use, progression, and desistance. The proposed study is novel in its potential to reveal the ways in which broader social contexts-neighborhoods and schools-contribute to the etiology of alcohol use and abuse. Data are drawn from a prospective, longitudinal study of 3000 youth living in 80 neighborhoods of Chicago. Subjects were surveyed on three occasions over 6 years, and range in age from 9 to 23. The study was designed to include 1) large numbers of three major race/ethnic subgroups (white, black and Hispanic); 2) substantial socioeconomic variation and overlap within each of these race/ethnic subgroups; and 3) substantial variation in the socioeconomic, racial, and ethnic composition of the study neighborhoods. Considerable information collected through surveys, observations, and other sources enable the research team to characterize the social processes in the neighborhoods in which the study participants have resided and in the schools that they have attended. The proposed work follows our previous findings, based on cross-sectional data, that neighborhood context accounted for roughly 50% of the observed black-white disparity in adolescent annual alcohol use rates. The disparity in alcohol use between a black and white youth living in the same neighborhood is roughly half that observed between the average black and white youth in the city of Chicago. Given this evidence of the strong association between neighborhood context and alcohol use, this study aims to 1) describe race/ethnic differences in alcohol use from age 9-23; 2) examine the extent to which these can be accounted for by group differences in socioeconomic status and immigrant generational status; 3) examine the extent to which these differences can be attributed to racial, ethnic, and socioeconomic segregation of groups into different residential and/or school contexts; and 4) determine whether a set of theoretically indicated characteristics of schools and neighborhoods explain these contextual effects. In addition, this study will also support the development of advanced statistical techniques needed to simultaneously estimate school and neighborhood contributions to race/ethnic disparities in alcohol use.

"RAPID VACCINATION OF HARD TO REACH POPULATI0NS    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Proposed is a quasi-experimental design involving a multilevel community participatory intervention that is designed to rapidly immunize hard-to-reach (HTR) populations in disadvantaged minority communities. Low vaccination coverage among minorities and persons living in and near poverty is a persistent problem that is particularly acute among HTR populations (e.g. injection drug users, elderly shut-ins). Immunization rates are affected by multiple factors including demographics, attitudes about vaccination, health norms, barriers to access, and immunization delivery methods. Efforts to successfully vaccinate HTR populations must address these factors. A community-based program with rapid vaccination can serve as an initial model for emergency preparedness vaccination plans and for future efforts to widely introduce HIV vaccination in disadvantaged urban communities. This project will be conducted by a community-public health partnership in eight disadvantaged neighborhoods within Harlem and the South Bronx in three phases. In Phase 1 we will implement a brief survey assessment of residents in designated neighborhoods to identify current key barriers to immunization faced by the target HTR populations in these neighborhoods. Also, using several estimation methods, we will determine the size of the target populations in the study neighborhoods to establish vaccine needed and to estimate denominators for vaccination rates. In Phase 2, we will implement two waves of a multilevel community intervention trial (developed with input from the survey and community partners). In the first wave, four randomly selected neighborhoods will receive the intervention (i.e., community education, community-organization engagement, and door-to-door influenza vaccination program for eligible groups etc). In the four control communities, target populations will be invited to come for vaccination at specified locations as part of usual public health efforts. In the second vaccination wave, using a crossover design, after updating and revising the approach based on experience from Wave 1, we will implement the intervention in the four control communities; this vaccination wave will be conducted over one week to test the feasibility of rapid vaccination of these populations.

"Impact of Poverty, LBW, and Obesity Across the Lifespan    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application is in response to the Program Announcement entitled Social and Cultural Dimensions of Health (PA-02-043). Two important health problems are studied: low birth weight (LBW) and obesity. It is well known that LBW and obesity disproportionately affects those in the lowest socio-economic strata [1] [2]. However, while numerous studies have documented a strong and consistent relationship between poverty and low birth weight, and poverty and obesity [1, 4-6] [7], there is a paucity of research going beyond these descriptions to investigate the multiple dimensions of absolute and relative poverty. These health problems need to be studied in a new way that goes beyond the individual level and simple cross sectional designs. This study will do so. We will develop innovative cumulative measures of individual and neighborhood relative deprivation and a cumulative measure of the generosity of the social safety net (e.g. income supplements for TANF families) to supplement point-in-time measures of absolute deprivation at the individual and neighborhood level. Relative deprivation is a formal construct used in welfare economics to quantify relative social rank [8] [9]. This study will use three key health measures, birth weight, adult body mass index (BMI) and child percentile rank of BMI-for-age and gender (PR), to examine relationships between relative and absolute deprivation and these health problems. Longitudinal data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1979 (NLSY79) and its associated child study are used to implement these analyses. The specific aims for this application are: 1) Test the significance of relative deprivation, at a point-in-time and cumulatively, in explaining the observed socio-economic differences in birth weight controlling for absolute measures of individual income, neighborhood poverty and known risk factors. 2) Test the significance of relative deprivation, at a point-in-time and cumulatively, in explaining the observed socioeconomic differences in adult BMI controlling for absolute measures of individual income, neighborhood poverty and known risk factors.  3) Test the significance of relative deprivation, at a point-in-time and cumulatively, in explaining the observed socio-economic differences in childhood BMI, measured by percentile rankings, controlling for absolute measures of individual income, neighborhood poverty, maternal BMI and known risk factors.            ","Impact of Poverty, LBW, and Obesity Across the Lifespan",6767618,R01NR008512,"['obesity ', ' longitudinal human study ', ' socioeconomics ', ' public assistance ', ' socioenvironment ', ' urban poverty area ', ' environmental stressor ', ' psychological stressor ', ' low birth weight infant human ', ' human data ', ' clinical research ', ' behavioral /social science research tag ', ' health services research tag ', ' health disparity ', ' ']",NINR,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2004,226573,0.050201901736785313
"Neighborhood Context and the Health of Older Adults    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The capacity of communities to bolster and sustain the well being of individual residents is particularly salient for older adults; their daily activities are likely dependent on the infrastructure and social resources of their communities, particularly if health is already compromised. Although it has long been believed that the neighborhood one lives in affects one's health, it has been difficult to delineate why, and under what circumstances, neighborhood context contributes to health. We bring an important new sociological concept, collective efficacy, to bear on the study of neighborhood and the health of older persons. Using data from the Project on Human Development in Chicago Neighborhoods-Community Survey, the Metropolitan Community  Information Center-Metro Survey, Medicare Claims, and out-patient, hospitalization, and geocoded health services data, we ask: 1) Are structural features of urban neighborhoods--concentrated poverty, concentrated affluence, residential stability, ethnic heterogeneity, and age structurel associated with the  health status of older residents?; 2) Are neighborhood social processes--collective efficacy, social networks, social norms, and physical/social disorder associated with the health of older residents?; 3) is the health services infrastructure of the neighborhood associated with the health of older residents?; and 4) Does the health of older residents affect the ability of the community to sustain social networks and develop collective efficacy? This project goes beyond current research in four ways. First, it extends existing research on neighborhood context and the health of older adults by exploring theoretically informed mechanisms with multi-level statistical tools. Second, it incorporates an understudied area in the neighborhood effects literature--the role of health services and access to care. Simultaneously examining the effects of neighborhood context and health services could enhance our understanding of individual-level racial/ethnic and socioeconomic disparities in health. Third, it acknowledges that the relationship between neighborhood and health is both reciprocal and dynamic. Fourth, it provides a unique opportunity to examine interactions across a number of levels (e.g., individual-neighborhood, neighborhood-health services infrastructure). This project combines perspectives from sociology and health services research; it bridges these disciplines to formulate research that addresses a set of questions vital to both fields and to aging-related policy.

"A Dynamic Multilevel Analysis of Substance Use and HIV DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposed research will examine the relationship between neighborhood-level and macrolevel factors and individual HIV seroconversion and self-reported risk behaviors among a cohort of injection drug users (IDUs) in Baltimore, MD. As the epidemic of HIV/AIDS among IDUs persists in Baltimore despite a range of prevention interventions targeted to individual injectors, it is necessary to examine more closely potential risk factors at the neighborhood and macro- levels in order to formulate innovative new prevention strategies to complement efforts currently underway. The primary aim of the proposed research is to identify the relative and attributable risks associated with specific macrolevel versus microlevel risk factors for HIV seroconversion among IDUs in Baltimore. The following hypotheses will be tested: 1) Structural constraints (e.g., concentrated disadvantage, residential instability, population density, mixed land use) increase the risk of HIV transmission; 2) Formal social regulation (e.g., community policing, targeted narcotics crackdowns) increases the risk of HIV transmission; 3) Informal social regulation (e.g., collective efficacy) decreases the risk of HIV transmission; and 4) Narcotics price and purity are related to HIV seroconversion risk. The proposed research will involve the design and conduct of a multilevel analysis to investigate the spatial dynamics of HIV transmission among IDUs that are not entirely explained by the demographic and risk behavior characteristics of individuals. This analysis will begin with a descriptive exploration of the geography of narcotics abuse and HIV in Baltimore from 1988 to 2000, making use of data on HIV incidence and individual-level HIV risk behavior among local IDUs from the Johns Hopkins ALIVE cohort study, and over a decade of data on neighborhood crime from the Baltimore City Police Department. This will be followed by a review of recent and on-going qualitative Baltimore neighborhood assessments to obtain measures of informal social control and to achieve an understanding of the risk environment in which the epidemic of HIV/AIDS among injection drug users in has been unfolding. Spatial and temporal patterns of neighborhood crime and disease will be analyzed using SpaceStat and Geographic Information System (GIS) software. Results of this research will contribute to the design of structural interventions to interrupt causal pathways of both drug use and HIV transmission.

"HIV Risk and Neighborhood Networks of New IDUs    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  New injecting drug users (IDUs) are at risk of becoming infected with the hepatitis C virus (HCV), the hepatitis B virus  (HBV) and HIV within the first few years after they start to inject. However, the risk of infection among new injectors varies by race/ethnicity, with African Americans at greater risk of infection than white new IDUs. Risk behaviors alone do not sufficiently explain why African American IDUs are at greater risk of infection. Racial/ethnic differences in the risk of infection among new injectors may be related to different probabilities in the risk of exposure to infection, which may stem from differences in sociocentric (groups of directly and indirectly connected IDUs) and egocentric (groups of directly connected IDUs) transmission networks. Variation by race/ethnicity in the transmission networks of new IDUs may also be influenced by neighborhood differences in the provision of harm reduction and other health services, as well as other differences in the social and physical environment of neighborhoods, since IDUs are often geographically separated by race/ethnicity into different neighborhoods.  In this study, we will investigate the sociocentric and egocentric network risks for infection with HIV, HCV and HBV in two high-risk neighborhoods in New York City, one of which is predominantly African-American and the other in which new IDUs are predominantly white. Using a sequential cross-section design with an imbedded prospective cohort, we will compare a predominantly African-American group of new injectors and a predominantly white group of new injectors m geographically separate neighborhoods to determine differences in: (1) The prevalence and incidence of HIV, HCV and HBV; (2) The relationship of sociocentric and egocentric networks to HIV, HCV, and HBV transmission; (3) The relationship of sociocentric and egocentric networks to risk and risk reduction behaviors, knowledge of infection risk and  prevention, and access to and utilization of harm reduction and other health services; (4) Factors associated with the  maintenance or change in sociocentric and egocentric networks and risk and risk reduction behaviors and practices, and  the relationship of these factors to the rate of HIV, HCV, and HBV seroconversions; and (5) using ethnographic methods  and Geographic Information Systems, to explore the relationship of neighborhood factors to network and behavioral  infection risk.  Understanding the extent to which the multi-level influences of neighborhood context, network characteristics and behavior shape the risk of acquiring or transmitting HIV, HCV and HBV among new injectors can contribute towards the development of structural interventions targeted at new injectors and their injecting and sex partners in high-risk neighborhoods.             ",HIV Risk and Neighborhood Networks of New IDUs,6948662,R01DA014515,"['disease /disorder proneness /risk ', ' intravenous drug abuse ', ' health care service utilization ', ' human subject ', ' HIV infection ', ' interview ', ' hepatitis B ', ' longitudinal human study ', ' high risk behavior /lifestyle ', ' African American ', ' caucasian American ', ' racial /ethnic difference ', ' socioenvironment ', ' needle sharing ', ' hepatitis C ', ' clinical research ', ' behavioral /social science research tag ', ' substance abuse epidemiology ', ' health disparity ', ' ']",NIDA,"NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT AND RESEARCH INSTITUTES, INC.",R01,2004,61520,0.14455826412775372
"UTMB Center for Population Health and Health Disparities    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The proposed project will explore the relationship between neighborhood context and measures of health among Hispanics.  In preliminary analyses, the investigators have found that an increasing percentage of Hispanics residing in a census tract is related to low overall mortality, cancer mortality, and cancer incidence among Hispanics, after controlling for numerous community and individual characteristics and risk factors, including immigrant status and acculturation.  At the same time, increasing census tract percent Hispanics is associated with decreased survival after a diagnosis of cancer.  The investigators now propose to explore the reasons for these strong neighborhood effects on health by examining several data sets linked to census data: Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) data on cancer incidence and survival, vital registration data on cancer mortality, and the National Health Interview Survey-National Death Index file on cancer prevalence and mortality and all cause mortality.  Finally, the researchers will investigate the relationship of Hispanic census tract density and other contextual measures with individual characteristics, health behaviors, social support, affective disorders and physiologic measures using a census-linked NHANES file.         ",UTMB Center for Population Health and Health Disparities,6949572,P50CA105631,"['disease /disorder prevention /control ', ' human subject ', ' epidemiology ', ' vital statistics ', ' Hispanic American ', ' clinical research ', ' health disparity ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS MED BR GALVESTON,P50,2005,1803530,0.0806809144822236
"NEIGHBORHOOD-LEVEL INFLUENCES ON ALL-CAUSE MORTALITY   DESCRIPTION (Taken from the Investigator's Abstract)                                 Few studies have examined how social and physical features of neighborhoods          interact with individual factors, e.g., health behaviors and socioeconomic           status (SES), to influence disparities in health.  Primary Aims:  The                investigators propose to test the independent and interrelated effects of the        neighborhood social environment (e.g., neighborhood SES, social                      disorganization, Hispanic concentration, crime rates), neighborhood physical         environment (e.g., housing conditions, availability of goods and services such       as licensed alcohol distributors, fast food restaurants, grocery stores, gun         shops, educational resources, recreational facilities, banking/lending               institutions), and individual risk factors in predicting all-cause and               cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality in women and men.  Design/methods:  The       investigators will conduct a prospective mortality follow-up study of 8,847          white (non-Hispanic) and Hispanic women and men who participated in the              Stanford Heart Disease Prevention Program (SHDPP), also referred to as the           Stanford Five-City Project.  This population-based CVD study included a random       sample of women and men aged 25-74 who participated in one of five                   cross-sectional surveys (1979-1990) and were from four socioeconomically             diverse California cities.  The SHDPP is recognized for its comprehensive and        well-standardized survey and physiologic measures that include SES (education,       income, occupation), CVD risk factors (e.g., smoking, high cholesterol and           saturated fat), psychosocial factors, and other health-related measures.  The        investigators propose to match survey data to death records for all-cause and        CVD mortality endpoints, and link geocoded addresses to census data and              archival data for measures of the neighborhood social and physical                   environment.  They anticipate 824 deaths by 2000 and 1690 deaths by 2005.            This work would create a new database where individuals' SES and health              indicators are linked with characteristics of their specific neighborhoods.          Based on their empirical findings, they will identity neighborhoods currently        at high and low risk for mortality, then conduct focus groups and map                neighborhood environments (e.g., social, physical, and service features) to          create a geographic information system (GIS).  These two activities will             hopefully extend their empirical findings, generate new hypotheses, and guide        the development of their Community Outreach and Education Program (COEP).            Dissemination:  The COEP will build on their collaborative partnerships with         members of the study cities, health advocates, and health agencies that serve        low SES and medically under served populations.  With the involvement of these       partners, they will integrate their empirical findings with knowledge from           existing studies and disseminate results via the Internet, media, targeted           mailings, and programs offered by the California State and local county health       departments in the four study cities.

"Accountable Communities: Healthy Together    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Georgia State University proposes to address its mission of promoting health in urban Atlanta by taking the leadership in undertaking a long-range community-based participatory research (CBPR) initiative aimed at reducing the health disparities and the associated social, economic and environmental determinants experienced by the residents of Neighborhood Planning Unit V (NPU-V). NPU-V consists of 15,800 residents in 5 contiguous neighborhoods in urban Atlanta. Evidence of the disparities already exists based on data gathered and reported by the residents of NPU-V in 2004. Georgia State's partners include the leadership and residents of NPU-V, Center for Black Women's Wellness (located in the area), Southside Medical Center (located in the area), Fulton County Department of Health and Wellness, and Atlanta Regional Health Forum. This Research will be directed through the Institute of Public Health at Georgia State, which is a multi-disciplinary research and training institute working with all six colleges of the university and reporting directly to the provost. The specific aims for this research effort are to:   * Engage community residents through community health forums designed to (1) strengthen community involvement and participation, (2) publicly assess relevant health related information including existing social, economic, demographic and health data, graphic depictions from Photovoice, and documented concerns expressed by community residents, (3) based on partnership consensus, identity, prioritize, and select for intervention the specific health disparities (and their relevant determinants), and (4) collectively develop a comprehensive intervention strategy designed to migrate the health disparities identified.   * Train residents of NPU-V as community health workers (CHWs) in a range of community health promotion skills, including Photovoice, which will be used to complement existing community specific data gathered by residents.    * Establish and implement a system to enable the ongoing monitoring and evaluation of the intervention strategy and the overall CBPR process. A critical additional assessment feature will include the measurement of extant levels of organizational social capital throughout the project to detect the effects of planned efforts to strengthen social capital.    * In parallel with the specific proximal health disparity intervention, undertake and document a longer range strategy to address distal social and economic issues, wherein community residents assume the leadership for proposing specific actions to promote specific actions to promote community transformation. Based on community input these might include: (1) enhancing employment opportunities, (2) improving housing through neighborhood renewal without tax increases on current residents, and (3) promoting economic developments.         ",Accountable Communities: Healthy Together,7057586,R24MD001657,[''],NIMHD,GEORGIA STATE UNIVERSITY,R24,2005,505698,0.05955785440336976
"Healthy Environments Partnership: Lean & Green in Motown    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)     The prevalence of obesity, a major risk factor for four of the ten leading causes of death (cardiovascular disease, diabetes, dietary cancers, and stroke), has risen dramatically over the past 20 years in the United States.  In neighborhoods with few economic resources, aspects of the built environment may be less conducive to physical activity and healthy diets, placing residents disproportionately at risk.  The growing health burden of obesity and co-morbidities highlight the need to identify effective measures of the means by which the built environment influences health, as well as effective interventions to create healthier environments.  The longitudinal study proposed here will contribute to both of these goals.  Specifically, the proposed initiative is to: 1) Assess independent and collective scientific contributions of five methods of assessing characteristics of the built environment (measures of accessibility; mapping; typologies of neighborhood characteristics; observation; and residents' perceptions) for understanding the means by which the built environment influences behavioral and biological factors associated with obesity and related co-morbidities among African American, Hispanic and white residents of Detroit; 2) Develop and implement additional components of a multilevel, multi-site intervention that incorporates modifications of the built environment and that builds on ongoing social and behavioral approaches to promote physical activity and access to healthy foods in eastside, northwest and southwest Detroit; 3) Conduct longitudinal analyses to evaluate the independent and cumulative effects of modifications of the built environment, alone and in conjunction with multilevel, multi-site social, informational and behavioral approaches to promote physical activity and access to healthy foods among African American, Hispanic and white residents of eastside, northwest and southwest Detroit; and 4) Disseminate knowledge gained about the implications of changes in the built environment alone, and in conjunction with behavioral and social interventions, for behavioral and biological indicators of obesity and related co-morbidities to community members and to local, regional and national decision makers.

"Engaging African-American Community in Reducing Obesity    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Researchers from the Cleveland State University's Center for Health Equity have partnered with residents and organizations from Cleveland's Central neighborhood (a predominately African-American community, one of the poorest and most significantly disadvantaged Statistical Planning Area in Cleveland) to determine if Community-Based Participatory Research (CBPR) methodologies will yield greater success in health interventions compared to those existing community health interventions that were initiated using traditional methodologies.  The long term goal is to identify those health interventions that have the greatest chance of reducing health disparities in this and other predominately low income, minority communities. Over a three year planning period, grant funds will be used to:    Aim 1: Develop a partnership between the Central neighborhood's Building Healthy Communities initiative and Cleveland State University wherein both citizens and scientists understand CBPR. Aim 2: Identify an intervention research project through which to test the CBPR methodology and partnership processes. Aim 3: Implement 1-2 pilot health intervention projects within the Central neighborhood using CBPR.       The first year of the grant will focus on building an infrastructure of trust and understanding between the community and researchers, including activities such as joint training on CPBR, community-informed needs assessments, and development of procedures that will guide the intervention. Years two and three of the grant will focus on a specific intervention(s) identified by the community in which the researchers will help validate and evaluate.  By the end of the grant period, it is expected that the partnership will have identified and tested an intervention that will become the basis for a full-scale intervention in the community.  One of the biggest gaps this planning grant will fill is the opportunity to bring CPBR methodologies into Cleveland, testing a methodology that has the potential to reduce the significant health disparities that exist in the city's poorest neighborhoods.  It is expected that true citizen participation and guidance coupled with university research expertise will result in a variety of measurable intervention programs that are proven to reduce health disparities in one of our nation's poorest cities.         ",Engaging African-American Community in Reducing Obesity,7058482,R24MD001794,"['body composition ', ' obesity ', ' weight control ', ' cholesterol ', ' health education ', ' university ', ' education evaluation /planning ', ' body physical activity ', ' human subject ', ' information dissemination ', ' questionnaire ', ' health survey ', ' health behavior ', ' decision making ', ' African American ', ' low socioeconomic status ', ' community ', ' human therapy evaluation ', ' clinical research ', ' behavioral /social science research tag ', ' health services research tag ', ' interdisciplinary collaboration ', ' educational resource design /development ', ' health disparity ', ' focus group ', ' ']",NIMHD,CLEVELAND STATE UNIVERSITY,R24,2005,444380,0.07511160334985538

"Intra-Urban Health Assessed by Remote-Sensing and GIS DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This project explores the use of remotely sensed imagery and GIS to enhance our understanding of intraurban inequalities in health, using data for the metropolitan area of Accra, Ghana as a study site. The specific aims are as follows: (1) to derive local (neighborhood) measures of health by combining spatially referenced census data, survey data, and vital statistics into a geographic information system (GIS) for metropolitan Accra; (2) to derive local (neighborhood) measures of the built and natural environment through the classification and analysis of data from remotely sensed imagery; (3) to test the hypothesis that health levels in urban places are importantly influenced by the local neighborhood environmental context, including the natural and built environment, the socio-economic composition of the neighborhood's residents, and the location of a neighborhood within the broader urban environment (including its proximity to health clinics and hospitals); (4) to assess the relative contribution of neighborhood environmental context, population composition, and the neighborhood Iocational attributes to health outcomes in metropolitan Accra; (5) to model the interaction among the variables that predict health levels to determine what changes might be introduced into a neighborhood to bring its overall level of health up to a minimally acceptable standard; and (6) to evaluate how well the remotely-sensed data can, on their own as a proxy, model the intra-urban inequalities in health in ways that might lead these data to be used as health monitoring tools.

"""Exploring Spatial Dynamics of Neighborhood Migration""    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal describes a program of research designed to explore the impacts of extra-local contextual conditions - characteristics of areas surrounding the neighborhood of actual or potential residence - on migration between neighborhoods with varying socioeconomic and demographic qualities. Residential mobility research has typically focused on individual- and family-level determinants of migration, occasionally taking into consideration reactions to the socio-demographic characteristics of the immediate neighborhood of residence. Due largely to data limitations and methodological complexity, the broader social and demographic context of surrounding neighborhoods, and the residential opportunity structures defined by housing markets in these areas, have received almost no attention in this research. This project applies for the first time spatial regression strategies to individual- and family-level data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics merged with data from the 1970, 1980, 1990, and 2000 censuses to study how housing market conditions and socio-demographic characteristics of both immediate and surrounding areas influence individuals' and families' decision to move out of the current neighborhood and how these extra-local conditions affect the choice of a destination neighborhood. Through the unique application of this modeling strategy, this project promises to facilitate a fuller understanding of the contextual conditions that promote or impede inter-neighborhood migration and, most importantly, of the migration processes that shape broader patterns of residential racial and ethnic segregation and racial differences in exposure to poor and distressed neighborhood contexts. In order to inform the development of more effective specification strategies for the future study of inter-neighborhood migration, the research will focus on the geographic scale of extra-local mobility influences, demographic (including racial and ethnic) and socioeconomic variations in this geographic scale of influence, the functional form of extra-local effects, and the ways in which the characteristics of extra-local neighborhoods moderate the effects of more traditional contextual- and micro-level predictors of migration.         ","""Exploring Spatial Dynamics of Neighborhood Migration""",6901531,R21HD049610,"['family structure /dynamics ', ' data collection methodology /evaluation ', ' human population study ', ' longitudinal human study ', ' human population dynamics ', ' human migration ', ' racial /ethnic difference ', ' social integration ', ' socioeconomics ', ' low socioeconomic status ', ' socioenvironment ', ' community ', ' housing ', ' residential mobility ', ' urban poverty area ', ' human data ', ' clinical research ', ' behavioral /social science research tag ', ' geographic difference ', ' health disparity ', ' ']",NICHD,WESTERN WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R21,2005,119534,0.21515339978207929
"Neighborhoods and CVD Risk in a Multiethnic Cohort (RMI) DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Recent epidemiologic studies have found that living in socioeconomically disadvantaged neighborhoods is associated with increased prevalence and incidence of coronary heart disease, even after controlling for measures of personal income, education, and occupation. Although this suggests that features of neighborhoods may be relevant to cardiovascular risk, important questions remain regarding whether the associations observed reflect causal processes. Two important unresolved issues are the role of selection factors in generating these associations and the need to identify the specific characteristics of neighborhoods that are relevant. The general aim of this epidemiologic study is to investigate if neighborhood characteristics are related to disease risk in a multiethnic cohort. Using publicly available and newly collected neighborhood data linked to the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) the project will: (1) examine the relationship between neighborhood socioeconomic characteristics and the prevalence and progression of subclinical atherosclerosis; (2) examine associations of neighborhood socioeconomic characteristics with specific individual-level factors which may mediate neighborhood differences in disease risk; (3) develop measures of specific characteristics of neighborhood environments (such as measures of resource availability, neighborhood social cohesion and neighborhood stress) and examine their relation to selected individual-level risk factors; (4) determine if these specific neighborhood characteristics explain differences in cardiovascular risk between socioeconomically advantaged and socioeconomically disadvantaged neighborhoods; and (5) examine if neighborhood characteristics contribute to race/ethnic differences in cardiovascular risk. Measures of neighborhood attributes will be based on Year 2000 Census data, surveys of area residents, and the use of GIS methods to link data on area resources to MESA neighborhoods. The examination of subclinical disease as outcomes avoids problems related to selection of persons into neighborhoods based on their health status. The project will use two innovative approaches (residential surveys and ecometric techniques and GIS-based methods) to develop direct measures of specific neighborhood attributes in order to test their relationship to disease risk. Confirming that specific features of neighborhoods are causally related to disease would have important implications for prevention.

"Education, Resource Substitution, and Health DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The aim of this research is to examine the conditions under which education is more or less beneficial to health. The association between education and health is well-established, but whether the strength of this association depends on other social statuses is not. We propose to develop and test a theory of ""resource substitution"" which states that education's influence on health is greater for person's with fewer alternative resources than it is for the more advantaged. We focus mainly on three disadvantaged socioeconomic statuses, representing disadvantaged social origins (low parental education), individual socioeconomic disadvantage (low income) and neighborhood disadvantage (indexed by the prevalence of poverty, mother-only households, college education, and home ownership). The first precedes ones own educational attainment, and the other two follow from it. We also examine a number of other disadvantaged statuses that could modify the effect of education on health, including parental divorce, female gender, minority status, lack of full-time employment, and perceived neighborhood disorder. We will compare the hypotheses derived from resource substitution theory with the alternative (which we call ""resource multiplication"") which suggests that the influence of education is health is greater for persons with more resources. Finally we will examine mediators of the moderators, ff education has a larger effect on health for the disadvantaged, why does it?      We will analyze data from our two longitudinal surveys, ""Aging, Status, and the Sense of Control"" (ASOC; U.S. sample) and ""Community, Crime, and Health"" (CCH; Illinois sample). We measured self-reported health, physical functioning, chronic conditions, and psychological symptoms; the potential mediators and moderators of the education-health association; detailed information about education; and, in CCH, linked census data on respondents' neighborhoods. We will model the changes in health with subsequent and concurrent change models, structural equation models with latent factors, self-amplifying latent curve models, and multilevel models.

"RAPID VACCINATION OF HARD TO REACH POPULATI0NS    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Proposed is a quasi-experimental design involving a multilevel community participatory intervention that is designed to rapidly immunize hard-to-reach (HTR) populations in disadvantaged minority communities. Low vaccination coverage among minorities and persons living in and near poverty is a persistent problem that is particularly acute among HTR populations (e.g. injection drug users, elderly shut-ins). Immunization rates are affected by multiple factors including demographics, attitudes about vaccination, health norms, barriers to access, and immunization delivery methods. Efforts to successfully vaccinate HTR populations must address these factors. A community-based program with rapid vaccination can serve as an initial model for emergency preparedness vaccination plans and for future efforts to widely introduce HIV vaccination in disadvantaged urban communities. This project will be conducted by a community-public health partnership in eight disadvantaged neighborhoods within Harlem and the South Bronx in three phases. In Phase 1 we will implement a brief survey assessment of residents in designated neighborhoods to identify current key barriers to immunization faced by the target HTR populations in these neighborhoods. Also, using several estimation methods, we will determine the size of the target populations in the study neighborhoods to establish vaccine needed and to estimate denominators for vaccination rates. In Phase 2, we will implement two waves of a multilevel community intervention trial (developed with input from the survey and community partners). In the first wave, four randomly selected neighborhoods will receive the intervention (i.e., community education, community-organization engagement, and door-to-door influenza vaccination program for eligible groups etc). In the four control communities, target populations will be invited to come for vaccination at specified locations as part of usual public health efforts. In the second vaccination wave, using a crossover design, after updating and revising the approach based on experience from Wave 1, we will implement the intervention in the four control communities; this vaccination wave will be conducted over one week to test the feasibility of rapid vaccination of these populations. Phase 3 of this project will identify the promising elements of the program and develop materials to allow generalizability to other urban areas and to other vaccines (e.g., HIV, HBV, etc).         ",RAPID VACCINATION OF HARD TO REACH POPULATI0NS,6896809,R01DA017004,"['health education ', ' public health ', ' medical outreach /case finding ', ' human subject ', ' immunization ', ' health survey ', ' urban poverty area ', ' influenza vaccine ', ' clinical research ', ' behavioral /social science research tag ', ' medically underserved population ', ' health disparity ', ' ']",NIDA,NEW YORK ACADEMY OF MEDICINE,R01,2005,910460,0.10850896749067147
"Understanding Outcome Disparities in Alcohol Treatment  DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Racial disparities in alcohol treatment outcomes are a national problem. There are a number of possible explanations for these disparities in outcomes, including differential access to treatment, different motivations to seek and complete treatment, as well as cultural and sociodemographic factors. Neighborhood and other environmental triggers may also play a role, as well as prior treatment experience. We propose a secondary data analyses of existing alcohol treatment data, utilizing a multilevel modeling approach. The proposed secondary analysis is of the Los Angeles County Alcohol and Drug Treatment Program Participant annual data sets for years 1998, 1999 and 2000, which contain minority focused as well as non-minority focused treatment outcomes in publicly funded clinics for low income clients. The analysis will evaluate the relative effectiveness of the treatments in terms of minority groups, geographic and neighborhood factors, as well as reveal the treatment program characteristics that contribute to positive outcomes. This information about the rating of relative success of each treatment program will be combined with a cost/benefit analysis of treatment programs. Our analytical approach incorporates system level data on neighborhoods and geographic factors, as well as client demographics, and  treatment program characteristics, which may all be related to disparities in treatment outcomes. The county of Los Angeles is uniquely appropriate to address these questions regarding disparities in treatment access and outcome. With a total population of over 9.5 million, and with a multiracial mix of Caucasians, African-Americans and Latinos (31.1 %, 9.5% and 44.6% of the total county population, respectively). The specific aims of the proposed research are as follows: (1) to determine the relationship of client demographics, geographic location, and treatment program and racial disparities in treatment outcomes; (2) to determine if the patterns of disparities in treatment outcomes differ by gender and by race for African Americans, Latinos and Caucasians    ",Understanding Outcome Disparities in Alcohol Treatment,6891848,R21AA013813,"['alcoholism /alcohol abuse therapy ', ' community health service ', ' health economics ', ' gender difference ', ' African American ', ' Hispanic American ', ' caucasian American ', ' racial /ethnic difference ', ' socioeconomics ', ' low socioeconomic status ', ' human data ', ' health services research tag ', ' outcomes research ', ' geographic difference ', ' health disparity ', ' ']",NIAAA,CHARLES R.

"NEIGHBORHOODS AND THE HEALTH OF ELDERLY AMERICANS This project is coordinated with P50 ES012383, Nicole Lurie, ?UNDERSTANDING NEIGHBORHOOD IMPACTS ON HEALTH.? This project investigates how contextual factors, specifically the built and socioeconomic features of neighborhoods, affect the health of elderly Americans. Neighborhood characteristics may influence the health of elderly persons in two principal ways:  through direct contemporaneous effects on health status and functioning, or through cumulative effects from earlier points in the lifecourse. Because many neighborhood features are modifiable, identifying changes in those aspects of neighborhood environment with the greatest influence on health could become important in addressing health disparities and improving health overall. Understanding at what points in the lifecourse the neighborhood environment most affects health will further inform interventions to reduce disparities in health and functioning in old age. Unfortunately, there is a paucity of literature on how these contextual factors affect late-life health and functioning. The few existing studies of the elderly are based on small sample sizes drawn largely from confined geographic areas and are thus of limited generalizability. We propose to undertake a national study of the effect of neighborhoods, both built and social environments on health and functioning in old age. The study has the following aims: 1) to measure the effects of the built and social environment on the health and health trajectories of the elderly, with a focus on identifying those neighborhood features that have the most impact on health and are amenable to policy interventions; 2) to understand how and at what points neighborhood environments from earlier in life influence health in old age; and 3) to examine whether neighborhood features have differential impacts on important subpopulations of the elderly, such as men and women, people with low socioeconomic status, and racial/ethnic minorities.

"Neighborhoods and the Management of Chronic Conditions    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Dr. Brown is a general internist seeking further training in multilevel modeling, geographic information systems methods, and community-based interventions in order to better assess and reduce socioeconomic and racial disparities in health for older adults. Her main area of interest is in the relationship between the neighborhood or community context and health, whether these associations vary for persons with chronic conditions and with aging, and ways to systematically incorporate the community context into evidence based interventions to improve outcomes among older persons with chronic conditions. Her project proposes to study these relationships in a representative sample of neighborhoods in Los Angeles County and to use these findings in combination with prior research to develop an intervention that integrates evidence-based clinical and behavioral strategies with an understanding of the ways in which neighborhood context may influence the ability to adhere to recommended treatments and implement behavior change for persons with chronic conditions. The study's aims are to: 1) assess the relationship between the neighborhood environment and current health behaviors and clinical outcomes in a longitudinal cohort of English-and Spanish-speaking persons in the Los Angeles Family and Neighborhood Study and to determine whether these relationships differ by age and chronic condition; 2) evaluate psychosocial mediators and moderators of the relationship between the socioeconomic, resource, and physical environments and health related behaviors and outcomes; and 3) develop a practice-based intervention that uses clinic and community partners to increase access to information about neighborhood resources that can be used to enhance self-management strategies, mitigate the negative influences of the physical and social environment on health, and ultimately improve clinical outcomes among middle-aged and older adults with chronic conditions.

"Neighborhood Context and the Health of Older Adults    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The capacity of communities to bolster and sustain the well being of individual residents is particularly salient for older adults; their daily activities are likely dependent on the infrastructure and social resources of their communities, particularly if health is already compromised. Although it has long been believed that the neighborhood one lives in affects one's health, it has been difficult to delineate why, and under what circumstances, neighborhood context contributes to health. We bring an important new sociological concept, collective efficacy, to bear on the study of neighborhood and the health of older persons. Using data from the Project on Human Development in Chicago Neighborhoods-Community Survey, the Metropolitan Community  Information Center-Metro Survey, Medicare Claims, and out-patient, hospitalization, and geocoded health services data, we ask: 1) Are structural features of urban neighborhoods--concentrated poverty, concentrated affluence, residential stability, ethnic heterogeneity, and age structurel associated with the  health status of older residents?; 2) Are neighborhood social processes--collective efficacy, social networks, social norms, and physical/social disorder associated with the health of older residents?; 3) is the health services infrastructure of the neighborhood associated with the health of older residents?; and 4) Does the health of older residents affect the ability of the community to sustain social networks and develop collective efficacy? This project goes beyond current research in four ways. First, it extends existing research on neighborhood context and the health of older adults by exploring theoretically informed mechanisms with multi-level statistical tools. Second, it incorporates an understudied area in the neighborhood effects literature--the role of health services and access to care. Simultaneously examining the effects of neighborhood context and health services could enhance our understanding of individual-level racial/ethnic and socioeconomic disparities in health. Third, it acknowledges that the relationship between neighborhood and health is both reciprocal and dynamic. Fourth, it provides a unique opportunity to examine interactions across a number of levels (e.g., individual-neighborhood, neighborhood-health services infrastructure).

"Social and built environment and race/ethnic variations in cancer outcomes    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cancer stage at diagnosis, treatment, and survival vary substantially across racial/ethnic groups, but the reasons for these disparities are incompletely understood and only partly characterized by Census-based socioeconomic measures. Cancer surveillance data can be a powerful and efficient resource for examining racial/ethnic disparities in cancer outcomes, and their utilization in this regard can be greatly improved by the addition of data that more fully characterize race/ethnicity and socioeconomic status. We propose to use these data to examine the effects on outcomes after colorectal, prostate, and breast cancers of previously unexplored factors (the neighborhood social and built environment and personal immigration experience), across several racial/ethnic groups. We will create measures of social and built environments using geodata from publicly-available Census, business, unemployment, and medical facility databases and incorporate these measures into a GIS with geocoded cancer incidence and mortality data from the population-based California Cancer Registry database. Using this data resource, we aim to: 1) identify patient subgroups delineated by individual-level and neighborhood sociodemographics who are more likely to be diagnosed with late or advanced disease; 2) determine the effect of proximity to and density of health care providers on selected treatment patterns; and 3) assess the effects of neighborhood socioeconomics and built environment on cancer survival. We are focusing on social and built environment constructs (neighborhood socioeconomic status and material deprivation, unemployment, medical care, walkability/sprawl and opportunities to access physical activity facilities, and neighborhood services) that have plausible associations with our outcomes of interest. The analyses will include 333,000 breast, 318,000 prostate, and 230,000 colorectal cancer cases who were diagnosed and resided in California during 1988-2003, and were non-Hispanic White, Black, Hispanic, Chinese, Japanese, Filipino, Korean, Vietnamese, Hawaiian/Pacific Islander, or South Asian. This study's objective is to understand the contributions of individual- and community-level factors to outcome measures across and within racial/ethnic groups. The long-term goal is to provide the necessary background information for more targeted studies that address the interactive roles of the neighborhood built and social environment on the survivorship experience. Discerning the contextual neighborhood effects from the individual effects is directly relevant to public health, as the results will help planners to focus interventions towards improving the survivorship experience on the individual or community level, or both. Addressing the survivorship experience via secondary data analysis is consistent with the Small Grants in Cancer Epidemiology Program Announcement, and the goal of determining the underlying causes of cancer health disparities is directly responsive to the mission of the NCI.              ",Social and built environment and race/ethnic variations in cancer outcomes,7116118,R03CA117324,"['neoplasm /cancer ', ' experience ', ' socioenvironment ', ' clinical research ', ' ']",NCI,CANCER PREVENTION INSTIT OF CALIFORNIA,R03,2006,70550,0.09361036992968119

"Engaging the African-American Community in Reducing Obe*    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Researchers from the Cleveland State University's Center for Health Equity have partnered with residents and organizations from Cleveland's Central neighborhood (a predominately African-American community, one of the poorest and most significantly disadvantaged Statistical Planning Area in Cleveland) to determine if Community-Based Participatory Research (CBPR) methodologies will yield greater success in health interventions compared to those existing community health interventions that were initiated using traditional methodologies.  The long term goal is to identify those health interventions that have the greatest chance of reducing health disparities in this and other predominately low income, minority communities. Over a three year planning period, grant funds will be used to:    Aim 1: Develop a partnership between the Central neighborhood's Building Healthy Communities initiative and Cleveland State University wherein both citizens and scientists understand CBPR. Aim 2: Identify an intervention research project through which to test the CBPR methodology and partnership processes. Aim 3: Implement 1-2 pilot health intervention projects within the Central neighborhood using CBPR.       The first year of the grant will focus on building an infrastructure of trust and understanding between the community and researchers, including activities such as joint training on CPBR, community-informed needs assessments, and development of procedures that will guide the intervention. Years two and three of the grant will focus on a specific intervention(s) identified by the community in which the researchers will help validate and evaluate.  By the end of the grant period, it is expected that the partnership will have identified and tested an intervention that will become the basis for a full-scale intervention in the community.  One of the biggest gaps this planning grant will fill is the opportunity to bring CPBR methodologies into Cleveland, testing a methodology that has the potential to reduce the significant health disparities that exist in the city's poorest neighborhoods.

"Neighborhood Context and the Health of Older Adults    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The capacity of communities to bolster and sustain the well being of individual residents is particularly salient for older adults; their daily activities are likely dependent on the infrastructure and social resources of their communities, particularly if health is already compromised. Although it has long been believed that the neighborhood one lives in affects one's health, it has been difficult to delineate why, and under what circumstances, neighborhood context contributes to health. We bring an important new sociological concept, collective efficacy, to bear on the study of neighborhood and the health of older persons. Using data from the Project on Human Development in Chicago Neighborhoods-Community Survey, the Metropolitan Community  Information Center-Metro Survey, Medicare Claims, and out-patient, hospitalization, and geocoded health services data, we ask: 1) Are structural features of urban neighborhoods--concentrated poverty, concentrated affluence, residential stability, ethnic heterogeneity, and age structurel associated with the  health status of older residents?; 2) Are neighborhood social processes--collective efficacy, social networks, social norms, and physical/social disorder associated with the health of older residents?; 3) is the health services infrastructure of the neighborhood associated with the health of older residents?; and 4) Does the health of older residents affect the ability of the community to sustain social networks and develop collective efficacy? This project goes beyond current research in four ways. First, it extends existing research on neighborhood context and the health of older adults by exploring theoretically informed mechanisms with multi-level statistical tools. Second, it incorporates an understudied area in the neighborhood effects literature--the role of health services and access to care. Simultaneously examining the effects of neighborhood context and health services could enhance our understanding of individual-level racial/ethnic and socioeconomic disparities in health. Third, it acknowledges that the relationship between neighborhood and health is both reciprocal and dynamic. Fourth, it provides a unique opportunity to examine interactions across a number of levels (e.g., individual-neighborhood, neighborhood-health services infrastructure).

"Healthy Environments Partnership: Lean & Green in Motown    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)     The prevalence of obesity, a major risk factor for four of the ten leading causes of death (cardiovascular disease, diabetes, dietary cancers, and stroke), has risen dramatically over the past 20 years in the United States.  In neighborhoods with few economic resources, aspects of the built environment may be less conducive to physical activity and healthy diets, placing residents disproportionately at risk.  The growing health burden of obesity and co-morbidities highlight the need to identify effective measures of the means by which the built environment influences health, as well as effective interventions to create healthier environments.  The longitudinal study proposed here will contribute to both of these goals.  Specifically, the proposed initiative is to: 1) Assess independent and collective scientific contributions of five methods of assessing characteristics of the built environment (measures of accessibility; mapping; typologies of neighborhood characteristics; observation; and residents' perceptions) for understanding the means by which the built environment influences behavioral and biological factors associated with obesity and related co-morbidities among African American, Hispanic and white residents of Detroit; 2) Develop and implement additional components of a multilevel, multi-site intervention that incorporates modifications of the built environment and that builds on ongoing social and behavioral approaches to promote physical activity and access to healthy foods in eastside, northwest and southwest Detroit; 3) Conduct longitudinal analyses to evaluate the independent and cumulative effects of modifications of the built environment, alone and in conjunction with multilevel, multi-site social, informational and behavioral approaches to promote physical activity and access to healthy foods among African American, Hispanic and white residents of eastside, northwest and southwest Detroit; and 4) Disseminate knowledge gained about the implications of changes in the built environment alone, and in conjunction with behavioral and social interventions, for behavioral and biological indicators of obesity and related co-morbidities to community members and to local, regional and national decision makers.

"NEIGHBORHOODS AND THE HEALTH OF ELDERLY AMERICANS This project is coordinated with P50 ES012383, Nicole Lurie, ?UNDERSTANDING NEIGHBORHOOD IMPACTS ON HEALTH.? This project investigates how contextual factors, specifically the built and socioeconomic features of neighborhoods, affect the health of elderly Americans. Neighborhood characteristics may influence the health of elderly persons in two principal ways:  through direct contemporaneous effects on health status and functioning, or through cumulative effects from earlier points in the lifecourse. Because many neighborhood features are modifiable, identifying changes in those aspects of neighborhood environment with the greatest influence on health could become important in addressing health disparities and improving health overall. Understanding at what points in the lifecourse the neighborhood environment most affects health will further inform interventions to reduce disparities in health and functioning in old age. Unfortunately, there is a paucity of literature on how these contextual factors affect late-life health and functioning. The few existing studies of the elderly are based on small sample sizes drawn largely from confined geographic areas and are thus of limited generalizability. We propose to undertake a national study of the effect of neighborhoods, both built and social environments on health and functioning in old age. The study has the following aims: 1) to measure the effects of the built and social environment on the health and health trajectories of the elderly, with a focus on identifying those neighborhood features that have the most impact on health and are amenable to policy interventions; 2) to understand how and at what points neighborhood environments from earlier in life influence health in old age; and 3) to examine whether neighborhood features have differential impacts on important subpopulations of the elderly, such as men and women, people with low socioeconomic status, and racial/ethnic minorities.  The study will use two nationally representative panel data sets, the Health and Retirement Survey (1992-2002) and the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (1968-2003). These data sets contain large samples of elderly persons that are representative of the elderly population of the United States. Neighborhood characteristics, derived from the work of the Center's data core, will be merged with the individual level data at the census tract level.

"Accountable Communities: Healthy Together    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Georgia State University proposes to address its mission of promoting health in urban Atlanta by taking the leadership in undertaking a long-range community-based participatory research (CBPR) initiative aimed at reducing the health disparities and the associated social, economic and environmental determinants experienced by the residents of Neighborhood Planning Unit V (NPU-V). NPU-V consists of 15,800 residents in 5 contiguous neighborhoods in urban Atlanta. Evidence of the disparities already exists based on data gathered and reported by the residents of NPU-V in 2004. Georgia State's partners include the leadership and residents of NPU-V, Center for Black Women's Wellness (located in the area), Southside Medical Center (located in the area), Fulton County Department of Health and Wellness, and Atlanta Regional Health Forum. This Research will be directed through the Institute of Public Health at Georgia State, which is a multi-disciplinary research and training institute working with all six colleges of the university and reporting directly to the provost. The specific aims for this research effort are to:   * Engage community residents through community health forums designed to (1) strengthen community involvement and participation, (2) publicly assess relevant health related information including existing social, economic, demographic and health data, graphic depictions from Photovoice, and documented concerns expressed by community residents, (3) based on partnership consensus, identity, prioritize, and select for intervention the specific health disparities (and their relevant determinants), and (4) collectively develop a comprehensive intervention strategy designed to migrate the health disparities identified.   * Train residents of NPU-V as community health workers (CHWs) in a range of community health promotion skills, including Photovoice, which will be used to complement existing community specific data gathered by residents.    * Establish and implement a system to enable the ongoing monitoring and evaluation of the intervention strategy and the overall CBPR process. A critical additional assessment feature will include the measurement of extant levels of organizational social capital throughout the project to detect the effects of planned efforts to strengthen social capital.    * In parallel with the specific proximal health disparity intervention, undertake and document a longer range strategy to address distal social and economic issues, wherein community residents assume the leadership for proposing specific actions to promote specific actions to promote community transformation. Based on community input these might include: (1) enhancing employment opportunities, (2) improving housing through neighborhood renewal without tax increases on current residents, and (3) promoting economic developments.         ",Accountable Communities: Healthy Together,7126392,R24MD001657,[''],NIMHD,GEORGIA STATE UNIVERSITY,R24,2006,480254,0.05955785440336976

"UTMB Center for Population Health and Health Disparities    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The proposed project will explore the relationship between neighborhood context and measures of health among Hispanics.  In preliminary analyses, the investigators have found that an increasing percentage of Hispanics residing in a census tract is related to low overall mortality, cancer mortality, and cancer incidence among Hispanics, after controlling for numerous community and individual characteristics and risk factors, including immigrant status and acculturation.  At the same time, increasing census tract percent Hispanics is associated with decreased survival after a diagnosis of cancer.  The investigators now propose to explore the reasons for these strong neighborhood effects on health by examining several data sets linked to census data: Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) data on cancer incidence and survival, vital registration data on cancer mortality, and the National Health Interview Survey-National Death Index file on cancer prevalence and mortality and all cause mortality.  Finally, the researchers will investigate the relationship of Hispanic census tract density and other contextual measures with individual characteristics, health behaviors, social support, affective disorders and physiologic measures using a census-linked NHANES file.         ",UTMB Center for Population Health and Health Disparities,7122786,P50CA105631,"['disease /disorder prevention /control ', ' human subject ', ' epidemiology ', ' vital statistics ', ' Hispanic American ', ' clinical research ', ' health disparity ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS MED BR GALVESTON,P50,2006,1455305,0.0806809144822236
"Neighborhoods and CVD Risk in a Multiethnic Cohort DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Recent epidemiologic studies have found that living in socioeconomically disadvantaged neighborhoods is associated with increased prevalence and incidence of coronary heart disease, even after controlling for measures of personal income, education, and occupation. Although this suggests that features of neighborhoods may be relevant to cardiovascular risk, important questions remain regarding whether the associations observed reflect causal processes. Two important unresolved issues are the role of selection factors in generating these associations and the need to identify the specific characteristics of neighborhoods that are relevant. The general aim of this epidemiologic study is to investigate if neighborhood characteristics are related to disease risk in a multiethnic cohort. Using publicly available and newly collected neighborhood data linked to the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) the project will: (1) examine the relationship between neighborhood socioeconomic characteristics and the prevalence and progression of subclinical atherosclerosis; (2) examine associations of neighborhood socioeconomic characteristics with specific individual-level factors which may mediate neighborhood differences in disease risk; (3) develop measures of specific characteristics of neighborhood environments (such as measures of resource availability, neighborhood social cohesion and neighborhood stress) and examine their relation to selected individual-level risk factors; (4) determine if these specific neighborhood characteristics explain differences in cardiovascular risk between socioeconomically advantaged and socioeconomically disadvantaged neighborhoods; and (5) examine if neighborhood characteristics contribute to race/ethnic differences in cardiovascular risk. Measures of neighborhood attributes will be based on Year 2000 Census data, surveys of area residents, and the use of GIS methods to link data on area resources to MESA neighborhoods. The examination of subclinical disease as outcomes avoids problems related to selection of persons into neighborhoods based on their health status. The project will use two innovative approaches (residential surveys and ecometric techniques and GIS-based methods) to develop direct measures of specific neighborhood attributes in order to test their relationship to disease risk. Confirming that specific features of neighborhoods are causally related to disease would have important implications for prevention.

"HIV Risk and Neighborhood Networks of New IDUs    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  New injecting drug users (IDUs) are at risk of becoming infected with the hepatitis C virus (HCV), the hepatitis B virus  (HBV) and HIV within the first few years after they start to inject. However, the risk of infection among new injectors varies by race/ethnicity, with African Americans at greater risk of infection than white new IDUs. Risk behaviors alone do not sufficiently explain why African American IDUs are at greater risk of infection. Racial/ethnic differences in the risk of infection among new injectors may be related to different probabilities in the risk of exposure to infection, which may stem from differences in sociocentric (groups of directly and indirectly connected IDUs) and egocentric (groups of directly connected IDUs) transmission networks. Variation by race/ethnicity in the transmission networks of new IDUs may also be influenced by neighborhood differences in the provision of harm reduction and other health services, as well as other differences in the social and physical environment of neighborhoods, since IDUs are often geographically separated by race/ethnicity into different neighborhoods.  In this study, we will investigate the sociocentric and egocentric network risks for infection with HIV, HCV and HBV in two high-risk neighborhoods in New York City, one of which is predominantly African-American and the other in which new IDUs are predominantly white. Using a sequential cross-section design with an imbedded prospective cohort, we will compare a predominantly African-American group of new injectors and a predominantly white group of new injectors m geographically separate neighborhoods to determine differences in: (1) The prevalence and incidence of HIV, HCV and HBV; (2) The relationship of sociocentric and egocentric networks to HIV, HCV, and HBV transmission; (3) The relationship of sociocentric and egocentric networks to risk and risk reduction behaviors, knowledge of infection risk and  prevention, and access to and utilization of harm reduction and other health services; (4) Factors associated with the  maintenance or change in sociocentric and egocentric networks and risk and risk reduction behaviors and practices, and  the relationship of these factors to the rate of HIV, HCV, and HBV seroconversions; and (5) using ethnographic methods  and Geographic Information Systems, to explore the relationship of neighborhood factors to network and behavioral  infection risk.  Understanding the extent to which the multi-level influences of neighborhood context, network characteristics and behavior shape the risk of acquiring or transmitting HIV, HCV and HBV among new injectors can contribute towards the development of structural interventions targeted at new injectors and their injecting and sex partners in high-risk neighborhoods.             ",HIV Risk and Neighborhood Networks of New IDUs,7013172,R01DA014515,"['disease /disorder proneness /risk ', ' intravenous drug abuse ', ' health care service utilization ', ' human subject ', ' HIV infection ', ' interview ', ' hepatitis B ', ' longitudinal human study ', ' high risk behavior /lifestyle ', ' African American ', ' caucasian American ', ' racial /ethnic difference ', ' socioenvironment ', ' needle sharing ', ' hepatitis C ', ' clinical research ', ' behavioral /social science research tag ', ' substance abuse epidemiology ', ' health disparity ', ' ']",NIDA,"NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT AND RESEARCH INSTITUTES, INC.",R01,2006,699367,0.14455826412775372
"""Exploring Spatial Dynamics of Neighborhood Migration""    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal describes a program of research designed to explore the impacts of extra-local contextual conditions - characteristics of areas surrounding the neighborhood of actual or potential residence - on migration between neighborhoods with varying socioeconomic and demographic qualities. Residential mobility research has typically focused on individual- and family-level determinants of migration, occasionally taking into consideration reactions to the socio-demographic characteristics of the immediate neighborhood of residence. Due largely to data limitations and methodological complexity, the broader social and demographic context of surrounding neighborhoods, and the residential opportunity structures defined by housing markets in these areas, have received almost no attention in this research. This project applies for the first time spatial regression strategies to individual- and family-level data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics merged with data from the 1970, 1980, 1990, and 2000 censuses to study how housing market conditions and socio-demographic characteristics of both immediate and surrounding areas influence individuals' and families' decision to move out of the current neighborhood and how these extra-local conditions affect the choice of a destination neighborhood. Through the unique application of this modeling strategy, this project promises to facilitate a fuller understanding of the contextual conditions that promote or impede inter-neighborhood migration and, most importantly, of the migration processes that shape broader patterns of residential racial and ethnic segregation and racial differences in exposure to poor and distressed neighborhood contexts. In order to inform the development of more effective specification strategies for the future study of inter-neighborhood migration, the research will focus on the geographic scale of extra-local mobility influences, demographic (including racial and ethnic) and socioeconomic variations in this geographic scale of influence, the functional form of extra-local effects, and the ways in which the characteristics of extra-local neighborhoods moderate the effects of more traditional contextual- and micro-level predictors of migration.         ","""Exploring Spatial Dynamics of Neighborhood Migration""",7029653,R21HD049610,"['family structure /dynamics ', ' data collection methodology /evaluation ', ' human population study ', ' longitudinal human study ', ' human population dynamics ', ' human migration ', ' racial /ethnic difference ', ' social integration ', ' socioeconomics ', ' low socioeconomic status ', ' socioenvironment ', ' community ', ' housing ', ' residential mobility ', ' urban poverty area ', ' human data ', ' clinical research ', ' behavioral /social science research tag ', ' geographic difference ', ' health disparity ', ' ']",NICHD,WESTERN WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R21,2006,136255,0.21515339978207929

"Urban Social Context, Health and Health Disparities    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project will capitalize on, extend, and enhance the Chicago Community Adult Health Study (CCAHS), (P50 HD 38986) which is designed to become a major prospective multi-level study of the impact of individual and social environmental factors on health, their role in understanding socioeconomic and racial- ethnic disparities in health, and the biological and behavioral pathways that are involved. This project has completed a major survey of a probability sample of 3105 adults age 18+ in the city of Chicago, with a response rate of 72 percent and including physical measurements of height, weight, waist, hip length, and blood pressure. In addition, saliva and/or a blood sample have been collected for 661 people (60 percent of respondents in a subsample of 80 of the 343 neighborhood clusters (NCs) covering the entire city of Chicago, developed and characterized by the Project on Human Development in Chicago Neighborhoods (PHDCN) (http://phdcn.harvard.edu/), from which the CCAHS sample is drawn. In addition to utilizing existing and collecting new archival data on these areas, the CCAHS carried out Systematic Social Observations of 1664 blocks containing sampled households for the study. Thus, the current application seeks to utilize all these data to extend and enhance the CCAHS as follows: 1) to estimate via state of the art multi-level analysis the role in health and health disparities of the immediate social contexts or ""neighborhoods"" in which people live; 2) to estimate how a wide range of aspects of immediate residential contexts and broader social contexts (assessed by multiple methods and measures and considered both singly and in interaction with each other and individual and household factors) affect health and health disparities and help to understand or flesh out the role of social context in health; 3) to estimate via innovative new methods the role in health and health disparities of the broader social contexts which surround more immediate residential contexts; and 4) to begin to convert the existing cross-sectional study into a longitudinal and prospective study via respondent tracking and mortality follow-up, which will allow initial prospective analyses of the predictive association with mortality of individual, household, and contextual psychosocial risk factors for health assessed in the CCAHS, as well as laying the foundation for a second wave of data collection in 2008-9, which will be funded by a subsequent competing renewal application, and allow for prospective analyses with respect to the full range of health outcomes in CCAHS.

"Health, Poverty and Place: Modeling Inequalities in Accra Using RS and GIS    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This project, through a detailed analysis of spatial disparities in health in Accra, Ghana, aims to provide a model for the interpretation of urban health inequalities in cities in poor countries. Using Accra in Ghana, we will generate methods that we hope will serve as templates for comparative analyses of other major cities in the developing world. The project will produce a geographical synopsis of the differentials in health and mortality within the urban area in a format immediately accessible to government and the development agencies tasked with the improvement of health overall and with the reduction of health inequalities; map the distribution of poverty (both income and wealth) in the city and assess its spatial association with selected health and mortality outcomes; using remote sensing and GIS technology, measure the association of adverse health and mortality outcomes with neighborhood ecology, including the association with spatial measures derived from observations of physical features and built structures visible from multi-spectral high spatial resolution satellite imagery; and assess the additional contribution of community-level variables including social organization and institutions to the production of inequalities in health and mortality, net of individual-level characteristics. Our research involves the following major steps: (i) apply new methods of defining urban neighborhoods across space and time using census and survey data and information from remotely sensed imagery; (2) validate data-derived neighborhood definitions, attributes, and boundaries with field assessments in a purposive sample of Accra neighborhoods; (3) assemble existing census-based, survey-based, and vital statistics-based measures of morbidity and mortality at the neighborhood level, based on the derived neighborhood definitions, as well as existing and updated imagery and geographic layers; (4) re-interview (in 2008) the respondents to the 2003 Accra Women's Health Survey to generate new measures of neighborhood-level health outcomes and changes in those outcomes; (5) employ spatial analytic, multivariate and multi-level analyses to predict the inequalities in health outcomes between and within neighborhoods of Accra; (6) develop models that build on the WHS and DHS data in combination with the imagery to predict health outcomes by neighborhood; (7) apply the modeling algorithms to two key resources-the Demographic and Health Survey and remotely sensed imagery-to predict the variability (inequality) in neighborhood level health outcomes in Accra; and (8) employ the results locally in Accra for health policy and planning purposes, and use the results from relatively data-rich Accra to develop models that can subsequently be used to estimate the spatial variability in health in data-poorer cities in sub-Saharan Africa.                    ","Health, Poverty and Place: Modeling Inequalities in Accra Using RS and GIS",7303439,R01HD054906,"['Child Mortality ', ' Geographic Information Systems ', ' deoxyhypusine synthase ', ' spermidine dehydrogenase (NAD, L-deoxyhypusyl-forming) ', ' EC 2.5.1.46 ', ' Case Study ', ' case report ', ' Longitudinal Surveys ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Cities ', ' model design ', ' Communities ', ' time use ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' comparative ', ' lens ', ' lenses ', ' Data Aggregation ', ' Aggregated Data ', ' Demography ', ' Population Studies / Demography ', ' Developing Countries ', ' Under-Developed Nations ', ' Under-Developed Countries ', ' Third-World Nations ', ' Third-World Countries ', ' Less-Developed Nations ', ' Less-Developed Countries ', ' Developing Nations ', ' Developing Nation ', ' Developing Country ', ' Institution ', ' Purpose ', ' Low income ', ' Ecology ', ' Environmental Science ', ' Economics ', ' Environment ', ' Address ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Data ', ' Measurable ', ' Resolution ', ' Update ', ' Validation ', ' Principal Investigator ', ' Characteristics ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Africa South of the Sahara ', ' Subsaharan Africa ', ' Sub-Saharan Africa ', ' Ghana ', ' Gold Coast ', ' Imagery ', ' Visualization ', ' Standards of Weights and Measures ', ' base ', ' concept ', ' urban area ', ' Goals ', ' Government ', ' improved ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' Health care facility ', ' Healthcare Facility ', ' Health Facilities ', ' Health Policy ', ' healthcare policy ', ' health care policy ', ' Health Status ', ' Level of Health ', ' Health Surveys ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Household ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Man (Taxonomy) ', ' Algorithms ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Link ', ' Income ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Interview ', ' Laboratories ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Individual ', ' Literature ', ' Rural ', ' Demographic and Health Surveys ', ' Inequality ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Mortality ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Respondent ', ' Developed Countries ', ' Industrialized Nations ', ' Industrialized Countries ', ' Developed Nations ', ' Developed Nation ', ' Developed Country ', ' Perception ', ' Population Dynamics ', ' Population Growth ', ' Poverty ', ' Production ', ' tool ', ' Records ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Slum ', ' Social Justice ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Urban Health ', ' Urbanization ', ' Attention ', ' Vital Statistics ', ' Investigation ', ' Work ', ' Week ', ' Dimensions ', ' Source ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' Country ', ' Transcend ', ' social organization ', ' remote sensing ', ' metropolitan ', ' Proxy ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' member ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Self-Report ', ' Censuses ', ' Environmental Hazards ', ' Measures ', ' Relative (related person) ', ' Relative ', "" Women's Health "", ' Female Health ', ' Child health care ', ' Child Health ', ' ']",NICHD,SAN DIEGO STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2007,638143,0.19194507387185789
"Development of Hierarchical Neighborhood Data Regarding Cancer in the Elderly    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): People living in different areas may differ in their health status because the residents differ in characteristics that influence health (e.g., demographic attributes, socioeconomic status, baseline morbidity) and/or because places differ in characteristics that influence the health of residents, such as neighborhood factors (e.g., local wealth, crime, residential stability) or medical service factors (e.g., physician supply, availability of specialized care). Here, we propose to assemble a data set that will allow us, in subsequent work, to examine the impact of place, defined at two different levels of spatial resolution, on cancer course in the elderly. Our first aim is to build a novel, three-level, hierarchical data set about an inception cohort of elderly Medicare beneficiaries diagnosed with cancer in 11 US regions during 1998-2002. There will be 550,000 individual patients drawn from the SEER cancer registry at level I, linked by Census tract of residence to information about their neighborhoods (N=8,790) at level II, and linked by their ZIP code to information about their health service areas (HSAs) (N=304) at level III. Sources of data include the SEER-Medicare data for level I variables, US Census data and other data for level II variables, and Dartmouth Atlas data for level III variables. Individual- level outcome variables include cancer stage at presentation, receipt of recommended anti-cancer therapies, and survival. The data set will also contain information about the hospitals at which individuals received their cancer care. Our second aim is to examine the relationships among variables measured at the two spatial levels in order to describe, for example, whether rich neighborhoods tend to be clustered in HSAs that are well endowed with medical infrastructure. Ultimately, analyses of this data set will allow us to distinguish the role of the individual (level I) from the roles of the two spatially nested geographic areas, i.e., micro neighborhood (level II) and macro health service area (level III) in determining illness course in cancer patients. Other analyses could also ultimately be done in order to evaluate the possible mediating role of the quality of hospitals used by patients in the relationship between place and individual outcomes. This work based on a national sample of cancer patients is relevant to public health since it will: help localize the level (individual versus neighborhood versus health service area) at which deficiencies in cancer care and outcomes in the elderly may arise; help explain racial and economic disparities in health outcomes; and address determinants of the course of patients' cancer, a leading cause of death.                ",Development of Hierarchical Neighborhood Data Regarding Cancer in the Elderly,7293270,R21AG030607,"['Crime ', ' Data Sources ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' geographic difference ', ' geographic variation ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Purpose ', ' Economics ', ' Environment ', ' Environmental Exposure ', ' Address ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Caring ', ' Data ', ' Range ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Resolution ', ' Stage at Diagnosis ', ' Subgroup ', ' Cancer Patient ', ' Zip Code ', ' Characteristics ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' beneficiary ', ' Future ', ' Affect ', ' Geographic Locations ', ' geographic site ', ' MeSH Descriptors Class 4 ', ' Geographical Location ', ' Geographic Region ', ' Geographic Area ', ' Geography ', ' base ', ' Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' Medicare ', ' health insurance for disabled ', ' Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Disabled Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Aged and Disabled, Title 18 ', ' Health Policy ', ' healthcare policy ', ' health care policy ', ' Health Services ', ' health care service ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' healthcare service availability ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare access availability ', ' health services availability ', ' health care service availability ', ' health care service access ', ' health care availability ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Availability of Health Services ', ' Accessibility of health care ', ' Access to Healthcare ', ' Access to Health Care ', ' Access to Care ', ' Health Status ', ' Level of Health ', ' Hospitals ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' Link ', ' residence ', ' Individual ', ' Americas ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Mortality ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Diagnostic Neoplasm Staging ', ' Tumor Staging ', ' Neoplasm Staging ', ' Cancer Staging ', ' Patients ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' well-being ', ' Physicians ', ' Poverty ', ' Staging ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Social Sciences ', ' Social support ', ' social support network ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Localized ', ' Atlases ', ' Work ', ' Techniques ', ' Services ', ' experience ', ' cohort ', ' Disease Outcome ', ' novel ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' Catchment Area (Health) ', ' Health Service Area ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Censuses ', ' County ', ' Measures ', ' neoplasm registry ', ' cancer registry ', ' Code ', ' Coding System ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Mediating ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Sampling ', ' cancer therapy ', ' anticancer therapy ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Treatment ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Therapy ', ' Cancer Treatment ', ' cancer care ', ' older patient ', ' elderly patient ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' tumor ', ' ']",NIA,HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL,R21,2007,208485,0.10054323213008519
"Causal Models of Segregation and Health    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Residential segregation has been argued by many as a fundamental cause of racial disparities in health (Acevedo-Garcia 2003; Schulz et al. 2002; Williams & Collins 2001). Segregation disproportionately affects minority groups by concentrating poverty, diminishing the quality of neighborhood social and physical environments, and attenuating individual socio-economic attainment and upward mobility (Collins and Williams 1999). However, we still do not fully understand the extent to which neighborhood segregation contributes to health disparities-not simply because relatively few studies have explicitly addressed this question, but because many of the past research attempts to measure the effects of racial segregation on health have used inappropriate methods and untenable assumptions (Duncan et al. 1997) and have relied largely on aggregate level data (Williams & Collins 2001). We are able to remedy many of the shortcomings in conventional analysis in the following ways. One, while prior studies have relied almost exclusively on aggregate data that is subject to ecological fallacy, we are able to utilize individual-level data to examine relationships between segregation and health (self-rated health and mortality) as well as neighborhood-level (census-tract) data to examine the possible pathways through which segregation affects health. Second, utilizing panel data, we can estimate the effects of segregation at various points in time during the life course; prior studies have almost all relied on a single (contemporary) point-in-time estimate of neighborhood effects on health. Third, we are able to calculate a broad set of segregation measures in addition to the traditionally used dissimilarity index-measures that have a much stronger theoretical and analytical correlation with concentrated poverty and other aspects of social space that may have a much stronger connection to health. Finally, and most importantly, by using panel data we are able to at least partially control for unobserved heterogeneity and recover causal estimates of the effects of segregation on health outcomes by controlling for unobserved individual-level characteristics through the application of various fixed-effect analyses. This project investigates the effect of residential segregation over the life-course on the health and mortality of Black and White adults using a sophisticated panel data set, merged with census data at the census-tract and county levels. This project will estimate unbiased effects of segregation and neighborhood poverty to determine how much any potential observed effects contribute to known racial disparities in health and mortality.             ",Causal Models of Segregation and Health,7242772,R21HD055612,"['Data Aggregation ', ' Aggregated Data ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Economics ', ' Address ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Data ', ' Rate ', ' Characteristics ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' Affect ', ' improved ', ' Health ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' indexing ', ' Life Cycle Stages ', ' life course ', ' Life Cycle ', ' Individual ', ' Literature ', ' Methods ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Mortality ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Respondent ', ' Poverty ', ' Attenuated ', ' Condition ', ' Research ', ' Time ', ' Dimensions ', ' Ecological Bias ', ' Ecological Fallacy ', ' Physical environment ', ' social space ', ' social ', ' Censuses ', ' County ', ' Measures ', ' segregation ', ' Racial Segregation ', ' Modeling ', ' Outcome ', ' ']",NICHD,SAN DIEGO STATE UNIVERSITY,R21,2007,149500,0.09890497201783487
"Neighborhoods and the Management of Chronic Conditions    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Dr. Brown is a general internist seeking further training in multilevel modeling, geographic information systems methods, and community-based interventions in order to better assess and reduce socioeconomic and racial disparities in health for older adults. Her main area of interest is in the relationship between the neighborhood or community context and health, whether these associations vary for persons with chronic conditions and with aging, and ways to systematically incorporate the community context into evidence based interventions to improve outcomes among older persons with chronic conditions. Her project proposes to study these relationships in a representative sample of neighborhoods in Los Angeles County and to use these findings in combination with prior research to develop an intervention that integrates evidence-based clinical and behavioral strategies with an understanding of the ways in which neighborhood context may influence the ability to adhere to recommended treatments and implement behavior change for persons with chronic conditions. The study's aims are to: 1) assess the relationship between the neighborhood environment and current health behaviors and clinical outcomes in a longitudinal cohort of English-and Spanish-speaking persons in the Los Angeles Family and Neighborhood Study and to determine whether these relationships differ by age and chronic condition; 2) evaluate psychosocial mediators and moderators of the relationship between the socioeconomic, resource, and physical environments and health related behaviors and outcomes; and 3) develop a practice-based intervention that uses clinic and community partners to increase access to information about neighborhood resources that can be used to enhance self-management strategies, mitigate the negative influences of the physical and social environment on health, and ultimately improve clinical outcomes among middle-aged and older adults with chronic conditions.

"Engaging the African-American Community in Reducing Obesity and its Consequences    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Researchers from the Cleveland State University's Center for Health Equity have partnered with residents and organizations from Cleveland's Central neighborhood (a predominately African-American community, one of the poorest and most significantly disadvantaged Statistical Planning Area in Cleveland) to determine if Community-Based Participatory Research (CBPR) methodologies will yield greater success in health interventions compared to those existing community health interventions that were initiated using traditional methodologies.  The long term goal is to identify those health interventions that have the greatest chance of reducing health disparities in this and other predominately low income, minority communities. Over a three year planning period, grant funds will be used to:    Aim 1: Develop a partnership between the Central neighborhood's Building Healthy Communities initiative and Cleveland State University wherein both citizens and scientists understand CBPR. Aim 2: Identify an intervention research project through which to test the CBPR methodology and partnership processes. Aim 3: Implement 1-2 pilot health intervention projects within the Central neighborhood using CBPR.       The first year of the grant will focus on building an infrastructure of trust and understanding between the community and researchers, including activities such as joint training on CPBR, community-informed needs assessments, and development of procedures that will guide the intervention. Years two and three of the grant will focus on a specific intervention(s) identified by the community in which the researchers will help validate and evaluate.  By the end of the grant period, it is expected that the partnership will have identified and tested an intervention that will become the basis for a full-scale intervention in the community.  One of the biggest gaps this planning grant will fill is the opportunity to bring CPBR methodologies into Cleveland, testing a methodology that has the potential to reduce the significant health disparities that exist in the city's poorest neighborhoods.  It is expected that true citizen participation and guidance coupled with university research expertise will result in a variety of measurable intervention programs that are proven to reduce health disparities in one of our nation's poorest cities.         ",Engaging the African-American Community in Reducing Obesity and its Consequences,7253244,R24MD001794,"['Decision Making ', ' Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System ', ' Behavior Risk Factor Surveillance System ', ' BRFSS ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Low income ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Educational Activities ', ' Environment ', ' Length ', ' Advocate ', ' Data ', ' Effectiveness of Interventions ', ' Measurable ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Underrepresented Minority ', ' underserved minority ', ' under-represented minority ', ' Monitor ', ' Principal Investigator ', ' Process ', ' Community Health ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Foundations ', ' base ', ' concept ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Health ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' healthcare service availability ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare access availability ', ' health services availability ', ' health care service availability ', ' health care service access ', ' health care availability ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Availability of Health Services ', ' Accessibility of health care ', ' Access to Healthcare ', ' Access to Health Care ', ' Access to Care ', ' Health Surveys ', ' Hospitals ', ' Area ', ' Hypertension ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' high blood pressure ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Adolescent ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Link ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' interventions research ', ' intervention research ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Israel ', ' Joints ', ' Articulation ', ' Justice ', ' Leadership ', ' Individual ', ' Numbers ', ' Trust ', ' Literature ', ' Funding ', ' Methodology ', ' Method LOINC Axis 6 ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Obesity ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Ohio ', ' Sister ', ' Condition ', ' Research ', ' Research Design ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Rewards ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Appendix ', ' Solutions ', ' programs ', ' stroke ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' brain attack ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Apoplexy ', ' Students ', ' Suggestion ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Testing ', ' Scientist ', ' Time ', ' Training Programs ', ' Asthma ', ' Bronchial Asthma ', ' Universities ', ' Vital Statistics ', ' Voice ', ' Work ', ' Awareness ', ' Overweight ', ' Over weight ', ' interest ', ' Needs Assessment ', ' Medical center ', ' success ', ' intervention program ', ' Family health status ', ' Family Health ', ' Structure ', ' Participant ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Charities ', ' Cholesterol ', ' Cholest-5-en-3-ol (3beta)- ', ' Administrator ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Hispanics ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' Cities ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' Community Participation ', ' forging ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' Prevalence ', ' Coupled ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' parental involvement ', ' community based participatory research ', ' Control Groups ', ' ']",NIMHD,CLEVELAND STATE UNIVERSITY,R24,2007,436826,0.07487495479695043
"Physical Frailty in Urban African-Americans    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This revised competitive renewal of ""Physical Frailty in Urban African Americans"" requests five years of funding (Y11-15) to enable additional data collection on and analysis of a representative cohort of community-dwelling African Americans living in St. Louis, known as the African American Health (AAH) project. The 998 enrolled AAH subjects were 49 to 65 years of age at baseline evaluation in 2000-2001, 463 from a very poor inner-city area and 535 from more affluent suburban conditions; 865 are alive and continue to participate. Five annual waves of high quality participation and data have already been collected by an experienced team that has made valuable contributions to the field. In the continuation, we propose to obtain telephone interviews (lasting 50 and 25 minutes, respectively) seven and eight years after baseline and a detailed in-home evaluation (120 minutes) nine years after baseline. We expand prior research themes by adding a comprehensive, innovative approach to examining contextual effects, extensive investigations of resilience, and cutting-edge analytic methods. With the combined eight waves of data over ten years, we will pursue two specific aims: (1) investigate the process of disablement in this cohort using individual-level data and (2) investigate the independent effect of adverse neighborhood conditions on the disablement process. We hypothesize that the disablement process can be viewed as an ordered progression in which the principal transitions for 25 tasks are from high functioning (HF), to subclinical status (SC; defined as no reported difficulty but change in either method or frequency of performance), from SC to difficulty (D), and from D to adverse health outcomes (e.g., falls, death). Primary analytic methods involve (a) multi-state transition models for individual tasks and (b) mixed effect models with both fixed and random intercepts and coefficients for three psychometrically-sound composite measures, examining the composite HF, SC, and D count trajectories both individually and simultaneously. For aim 2, our primary hypotheses are: (a) adverse neighborhood conditions (built environment less conducive to physical activity, lower availability of services, and increased area-level deprivation) are associated with disability outcomes, after adjusting for individual- level factors; (b) the negative effect of service availability operates at a different spatial scale than those of the built environment and deprivation; and, (c) adverse neighborhood conditions can be used to target future interventions to improve disability outcomes. Both aims examine recovery as well as deterioration and the effects of hypothesized risk (e.g., obesity) and protective (e.g., education) factors on disability outcomes. Analysis involves multilevel and novel geostatistical techniques. We have experience with all proposed assessment and analytic methods, which have adequate (> 80%) power to detect small to moderate effects for all hypotheses. Multiple secondary studies (e.g., fear of falling, life space mobility) will also be pursued.              ",Physical Frailty in Urban African-Americans,7258109,R01AG010436,"['access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Availability of Health Services ', ' Accessibility of health care ', ' Access to Healthcare ', ' Access to Health Care ', ' Access to Care ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Left ', ' Area ', ' Phase ', ' Lifting ', ' Income ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Interview ', ' Telephone Interviews ', ' Evaluation ', ' grasp ', ' Grips ', ' Physical activity ', ' Data Collection ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Dependency (Psychology) ', ' emotional dependency ', ' Dependency ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Activities of Daily Living ', ' functional capacity ', ' functional ability ', ' daily living functionality ', ' Activities of everyday life ', ' instrumental activity of daily living ', ' IADL ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Environment ', ' Bathing ', ' Baths ', ' Age-Years ', ' Data ', ' Cognitive ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Peak Expiratory Flow ', ' Seminal ', ' Rate ', ' Principal Investigator ', ' Process ', ' follow-up ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' Placement ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Limb structure ', ' Non-Trunk ', ' Limbs ', ' Extremities ', ' Future ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' pre-clinical ', ' preclinical ', ' Age ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Health ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' healthcare service availability ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare access availability ', ' health services availability ', ' health care service availability ', ' health care service access ', ' health care availability ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' disability ', ' Lower Extremity ', ' Membrum inferius ', ' Lower Limb ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Numbers ', ' Recovery ', ' Lung ', ' pulmonary ', ' Lung Respiratory System ', ' Databases ', ' data repository ', ' clinical data repository ', ' Electronic Database ', ' Electronic Databank ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Logistics ', ' Funding ', ' Methods ', ' middle age ', ' midlife ', ' middle aged ', ' mid-life ', ' mid life ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Mortality ', ' Persons ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Nursing Homes ', ' nursing home ', ' Obesity ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Probability ', ' Exposure to ', ' Staging ', ' Psychometrics ', ' Condition ', ' Validity and Reliability ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Selection Bias ', ' Skeletal system ', ' Smoking ', ' Social support ', ' social support network ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' sound ', ' Survival Analysis ', ' Survival Analyses ', ' cognitive function ', ' Taxes ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' frailty ', ' Vision ', ' visual function ', ' Sight ', ' Investigation ', ' Work ', ' Frequencies (time pattern) ', ' Frequency ', ' Complex ', ' Event ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' Location ', ' Visit ', ' inner city ', ' complement C2a ', ' complement C2a fragment ', ' complement 2a ', ' C2a ', ' C 2a ', ' American ', ' early experience ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' Intercept ', ' cohort ', ' Books ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Population Study ', ' Reporting ', ' Count ', ' Censuses ', ' Destinations ', ' Measures ', ' multilevel analysis ', ' multilevel modeling ', ' multilevel model ', ' methods to study multiple-level influences ', ' Geographic Information Systems ', ' Caregivers ', ' Care Givers ', ' falls ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Deterioration ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Property ', ' LOINC Axis 2 Property ', ' deprivation ', ' fear of falling ', ' Adverse effects ', ' treatment adverse effect ', ' therapy adverse effect ', ' side effect ', ' Treatment Side Effects ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Communities ', ' Comorbidity ', ' co-morbidity ', ' functional decline ', ' decline in function ', ' health related quality of life ', ' Social Functioning ', ' resilience ', ' Outcome ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' service utilization ', ' ']",NIA,INDIANA UNIV-PURDUE UNIV AT INDIANAPOLIS,R01,2007,606955,0.07721465704928879
"Accountable Communities: Healthy Together    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Georgia State University proposes to address its mission of promoting health in urban Atlanta by taking the leadership in undertaking a long-range community-based participatory research (CBPR) initiative aimed at reducing the health disparities and the associated social, economic and environmental determinants experienced by the residents of Neighborhood Planning Unit V (NPU-V). NPU-V consists of 15,800 residents in 5 contiguous neighborhoods in urban Atlanta. Evidence of the disparities already exists based on data gathered and reported by the residents of NPU-V in 2004. Georgia State's partners include the leadership and residents of NPU-V, Center for Black Women's Wellness (located in the area), Southside Medical Center (located in the area), Fulton County Department of Health and Wellness, and Atlanta Regional Health Forum. This Research will be directed through the Institute of Public Health at Georgia State, which is a multi-disciplinary research and training institute working with all six colleges of the university and reporting directly to the provost. The specific aims for this research effort are to:   * Engage community residents through community health forums designed to (1) strengthen community involvement and participation, (2) publicly assess relevant health related information including existing social, economic, demographic and health data, graphic depictions from Photovoice, and documented concerns expressed by community residents, (3) based on partnership consensus, identity, prioritize, and select for intervention the specific health disparities (and their relevant determinants), and (4) collectively develop a comprehensive intervention strategy designed to migrate the health disparities identified.   * Train residents of NPU-V as community health workers (CHWs) in a range of community health promotion skills, including Photovoice, which will be used to complement existing community specific data gathered by residents.    * Establish and implement a system to enable the ongoing monitoring and evaluation of the intervention strategy and the overall CBPR process. A critical additional assessment feature will include the measurement of extant levels of organizational social capital throughout the project to detect the effects of planned efforts to strengthen social capital.    * In parallel with the specific proximal health disparity intervention, undertake and document a longer range strategy to address distal social and economic issues, wherein community residents assume the leadership for proposing specific actions to promote specific actions to promote community transformation.

"Biomarkers of Stress and Health for Los Angeles Children DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In this project, we propose to add the collection of biomarkers of stress and health for children aged 0-17 to an ongoing longitudinal study of children, families, and neighborhoods. The study is the Los Angeles Family and Neighborhood Survey (L.A.FANS), whose design remedies many of the problems that have limited previous research on neighborhood effects, by collecting longitudinal data on neighborhoods, families, adults, and children, and on residential choice and neighborhood change. The first wave (L.A.FANS-1), completed in January 2002, interviewed adults and children living in 3,090 households in a diverse stratified probability sample of 65 neighborhoods throughout Los Angeles County. The second wave (L.A.FANS-2), planned for 2005-2006, has been funded by NICHD and NIA and includes the collection of biomarkers of stress and health for adults in the sample, questionnaire-based data on adults and on children and their caregivers, as well as information on neighborhood social and physical conditions. As part of this project (L.A.FANS-2/CB-for ""child biomarkers""), we propose to supplement Wave 2 data collection by undertaking fieldwork to collect similar biomarkers of stress and health for all children aged 0-17 in the sample. Data collection will be conducted simultaneously with the main L.A.FANS-2 survey, which will promote efficiency and reduce costs. These data will provide a major new resource for studying the effects of neighborhood and family environments on children's health and well-being.   The specific aims of this project are to: (1) Collect physiological markers of stress, disease, and health, including obesity, cortisol (a stress hormone), blood pressure, C-reactive protein (a marker of acute inflammation), Epstein-Barr virus antibodies (a marker of immune function), cholesterol, diabetes, and pulmonary function for all children in L.A.FANS-2; (2) Produce a well-documented data set from these data which, along with the L.A.FANS-1 and L.A.FANS-2 data, will be placed in the public domain for the research community to use in a variety of analyses; and (3) Provide support to the research community interested in using these data.   The child biomarker data collected in L.A.FANS-2/CB as part of this project along with other L.A.FANS data will provide an important new resource for a wide range of researchers to investigate the effects of social factors on children's stress, disease, and health.

"Neighborhood and Mammography: A multilevel approach to cancer screening behavior    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The underlying mechanisms for the persistent racial/ethnic and socioeconomic disparities in breast cancer mortality rates observed in the US are poorly understood. While many factors have been shown to influence these disparities, diagnosis at later stage of disease among African-Americans and women of low socioeconomic status (SES) continues to be a concern. Thus, the role of mammography screening, as delivered in the US health care system, has been an area of interest in explaining excess breast cancer deaths observed for African-American and low-SES women. While some studies show that African- American women are screened as often as White women, others have shown that African-American are less likely to receive adequate mammography services. Data have consistently shown that women with lower income, lower education levels, and no usual source of care are less likely to engage in repeat mammography screening. There is also evidence to show that SES exerts an impact on cancer screening at an ecologic level (e.g. county poverty levels). In addition to neighborhood socioeconomic conditions and resources, racial residential segregation has been shown to influence health outcomes. Yet to our knowledge, racial residential segregation has received little attention in terms of its effect on cancer prevention behavior. While administrative census data can yield insight into contextual neighborhood effects, the development and use of measures that extend beyond census data are necessary in order to identify mechanisms that can be identified for effective intervention efforts. Using a multilevel conceptual framework, I propose to: 1) Examine the influence of neighborhood factors (census tract level) and racial residential segregation on repeat mammography in a national sample; 2) Conduct key informant interviews and focus groups to determine neighborhood factors of concern to women; 3) Collect pilot data on neighborhood conditions in Jacksonville, FL; 4) Develop a grant proposal for independent funding to conduct a study on neighborhood and mammography screening behavior. This proposal specifically addresses neighborhood level influences on cancer prevention behavior with the ultimate goal of offering insight into the multilevel mechanisms that can lead to effective neighborhood level interventions in the area of cancer control and prevention.           ",Neighborhood and Mammography: A multilevel approach to cancer screening behavior,7394182,K01DP001121,[''],NCCDPHP,UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA,K01,2007,146762,0.11815114973895757
"Predoctoral Fellowships for Students with Disabilities    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There is a significant body of literature on the association between maternal depression and child behavior but considerably less evidence on the effects of neighborhood social conditions on both of these outcomes. Although there are prevention programs at individual and family levels, the potential for neighborhood level interventions has received less attention. The research proposal below will inform future theory and research on neighborhood level research and prevention mechanisms. The proposed study will use longitudinal data from a large-scale population-based study across urban, rural and suburban areas of Los Angeles County grounded in theories of neighborhood level determinants of health, providing the opportunity to refine the theoretical tradition of collective efficacy and neighborhood disorder by testing these theories, as well as adding empirical evidence of 1) the existence and effect, if any, of neighborhood disorder on maternal depression across diverse neighborhoods in LA County, 2) whether neighborhood disorder affects childhood internalizing and externalizing behavior and 3) the reciprocal relationship of maternal depression and child behavior within the social context of the neighborhood.           ",Predoctoral Fellowships for Students with Disabilities,7462368,F31HD049314,"['base ', ' Health ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' healthcare service availability ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare access availability ', ' health services availability ', ' health care service availability ', ' health care service access ', ' health care availability ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Availability of Health Services ', ' Accessibility of health care ', ' Access to Healthcare ', ' Access to Health Care ', ' Access to Care ', ' Area ', ' Childhood ', ' pediatric ', ' Individual ', ' Literature ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' Los Angeles ', ' Rural ', ' Policy Maker ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Mothers ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Parents ', ' Poverty ', ' Psychophysiology ', ' psychophysical ', ' psycho-physiological ', ' physiopsychology ', ' Psychophysiological ', ' Physiological Psychology ', ' Physiologic Psychology ', ' Condition ', ' Research ', ' Research Design ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Proposals ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Schools ', ' Single-Parent Family ', ' Social Conditions ', ' Societal Conditions ', ' Social Environment ', ' socioenvironment ', ' social context ', ' social climate ', ' programs ', ' Testing ', ' Attention ', ' Violence ', ' violent behavior ', ' violent ', ' Work ', ' Frequencies (time pattern) ', ' Frequency ', ' Behavior ', ' metropolitan ', ' Prevention Research ', ' Prevention program ', ' social inequality ', ' County ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Behavior ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' theories ', ' Cities ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' externalizing behavior ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' maternal depression ', ' depressed mother ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Predoctoral Fellowship--Students with Disabilities ', ' NRSA Predoctoral Fellowship Students w/Disabilities (F31) ', ' Characteristics ', ' Family ', ' Future ', ' Affect ', ' ']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,F31,2007,30851,0.14683912817266878

In preliminary analyses, the investigators have found that an increasing percentage of Hispanics residing in a census tract is related to low overall mortality, cancer mortality, and cancer incidence among Hispanics, after controlling for numerous community and individual characteristics and risk factors, including immigrant status and acculturation.  At the same time, increasing census tract percent Hispanics is associated with decreased survival after a diagnosis of cancer.  The investigators now propose to explore the reasons for these strong neighborhood effects on health by examining several data sets linked to census data: Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) data on cancer incidence and survival, vital registration data on cancer mortality, and the National Health Interview Survey-National Death Index file on cancer prevalence and mortality and all cause mortality.

"NEIGHBORHOOD CHARACTERISTICS AND RISK OF GESTATIONAL DIABETES IN NEW YORK CITY    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The incidence of gestational diabetes, characterized as glucose intolerance with onset during pregnancy, is increasing. Diet, physical activity, and obesity are modifiable risk factors that have been implicated in gestational diabetes. Concurrently, there has been concern regarding the increase in obesity, motivating interest in identifying environmental determinants of obesity that might impact individual behavior, including features of the neighborhood in which one lives. One neighborhood feature that might impact the risk of obesity and that of gestational diabetes is the availability of healthy foods. Another neighborhood feature is ethnic concentration. South Asian, Latin American, African, and Caribbean women are at an increased risk of gestational diabetes, especially those who are foreign-born. It has been suggested that this increased risk found in immigrant women might in part be due to change in diet and lifestyle upon immigration. Thus, it is likely that for immigrant women, living outside of ethnic enclaves might increase their risk of gestational diabetes by exposing them to greater changes in diet and lifestyle, while experiencing decreased social and instrumental support. Using linked New York City hospital discharge, birth certificate, commercial food, and census data, this study will be the first ever to examine the association between neighborhood characteristics and the risk of gestational diabetes. The following research questions will be addressed using multilevel models controlling for potential individual-level (education, ethnicity, parity, age, Medicaid status) and neighborhood-level (deprivation) confounders: 1) Is a poor neighborhood food environment score, defined as a combination of number of supermarkets, fast food restaurants, fruit and vegetable stands, and natural food stores, associated with higher risk of gestational diabetes?; 2) Does the strength of this association vary according to the mother's education level and employment status?; and 3) What is the association between neighborhood food environment, ethnic concentration and GDM within seven immigrant groups in NYC? Infants of mothers with gestational diabetes are at greater risk of complications at birth including macrosomia and trauma during delivery. They are also at greater risk of obesity, impaired glucose tolerance, and diabetes in childhood and adolescence. Given the increasing incidence of gestational diabetes, along with the ethnic disparity in risk, learning more about contextual risk factors for gestational diabetes is essential for addressing the CDC objectives of promoting healthy pregnancy and birth outcomes and improving risk factors for future disease among infants and toddlers. The proposed study is unique in that it addresses how the neighborhoods in which women live affect their risk of an important complication during pregnancy. Information regarding the associations of neighborhood food environment and ethnic concentration with gestational diabetes can support the design of healthy communities that promote health by encouraging healthy behaviors, quality of life, and social connectedness.              ",NEIGHBORHOOD CHARACTERISTICS AND RISK OF GESTATIONAL DIABETES IN NEW YORK CITY,7405150,R36DP001163,[''],NCCDPHP,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R36,2007,30559,-0.00012868597981771703
"A Community-Based Healthy Lifestyles Partnership    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Cardiovascular disease, cancer, and diabetes are the most common health problems in the US and a major cause of health disparities for African Americans.  The Austin neighborhood is an 118,000 person community located on the west side of Chicago.  The Austin population is 90% African American, with 46% of residents living below twice the federal poverty level. Westside Health Authority (WHA) is a community-based organization that was established in 1988 to empower residents of the Austin neighborhoods and to help them stay healthy, through better health behaviors related to health promotion and disease prevention.  The purpose of this application is to develop a partnership between WHA and Northwestern University for the purpose of community-based participatory research (CBPR).  This collaboration will build upon WHA's early work in the Healthy Lifestyles Progam (HLP) by working toward increasing community capacity for conducting their own research, intervention programs, and evaluations, all with the purpose of substantively improving the health of the Austin Community.  The application is based on four specific aims. Aim 1. To build a sustainable partnership between WHA, the Austin community and researchers from NU for action oriented health promotion research.  Aim 2. to conduct a community needs assessment around the issue of healthy lifestyles.  Aim 3. To build community based research capacity through community-focused education and training in research design, methods and dissemination.  Finally, Aim 4.  To design, refine and pilot test a research protocol around the Healthy Lifestyles Program in Austin to be conducted by WHA with community-involvement.

"Social and built environment and race/ethnic variations in cancer outcomes    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cancer stage at diagnosis, treatment, and survival vary substantially across racial/ethnic groups, but the reasons for these disparities are incompletely understood and only partly characterized by Census-based socioeconomic measures. Cancer surveillance data can be a powerful and efficient resource for examining racial/ethnic disparities in cancer outcomes, and their utilization in this regard can be greatly improved by the addition of data that more fully characterize race/ethnicity and socioeconomic status. We propose to use these data to examine the effects on outcomes after colorectal, prostate, and breast cancers of previously unexplored factors (the neighborhood social and built environment and personal immigration experience), across several racial/ethnic groups. We will create measures of social and built environments using geodata from publicly-available Census, business, unemployment, and medical facility databases and incorporate these measures into a GIS with geocoded cancer incidence and mortality data from the population-based California Cancer Registry database. Using this data resource, we aim to: 1) identify patient subgroups delineated by individual-level and neighborhood sociodemographics who are more likely to be diagnosed with late or advanced disease; 2) determine the effect of proximity to and density of health care providers on selected treatment patterns; and 3) assess the effects of neighborhood socioeconomics and built environment on cancer survival. We are focusing on social and built environment constructs (neighborhood socioeconomic status and material deprivation, unemployment, medical care, walkability/sprawl and opportunities to access physical activity facilities, and neighborhood services) that have plausible associations with our outcomes of interest. The analyses will include 333,000 breast, 318,000 prostate, and 230,000 colorectal cancer cases who were diagnosed and resided in California during 1988-2003, and were non-Hispanic White, Black, Hispanic, Chinese, Japanese, Filipino, Korean, Vietnamese, Hawaiian/Pacific Islander, or South Asian. This study's objective is to understand the contributions of individual- and community-level factors to outcome measures across and within racial/ethnic groups. The long-term goal is to provide the necessary background information for more targeted studies that address the interactive roles of the neighborhood built and social environment on the survivorship experience. Discerning the contextual neighborhood effects from the individual effects is directly relevant to public health, as the results will help planners to focus interventions towards improving the survivorship experience on the individual or community level, or both. Addressing the survivorship experience via secondary data analysis is consistent with the Small Grants in Cancer Epidemiology Program Announcement, and the goal of determining the underlying causes of cancer health disparities is directly responsive to the mission of the NCI.              ",Social and built environment and race/ethnic variations in cancer outcomes,7261307,R03CA117324,"['Goals ', ' Grant ', ' improved ', ' Health Personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' healthcare service availability ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare access availability ', ' health services availability ', ' health care service availability ', ' health care service access ', ' health care availability ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Availability of Health Services ', ' Accessibility of health care ', ' Access to Healthcare ', ' Access to Health Care ', ' Access to Care ', ' Clinical ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Biological ', ' Medical ', ' In-Migration ', ' Immigrations ', ' Incidence ', ' Physical activity ', ' Japanese Population ', ' Japanese ', ' Individual ', ' Numbers ', ' Filipino ', ' Pacific Island Americans ', ' Pacific Islander American ', ' Pacific Islander ', ' Databases ', ' data repository ', ' clinical data repository ', ' Electronic Database ', ' Electronic Databank ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' SEER Program ', ' Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program ', ' SEER-Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results ', ' SEER Program (National Cancer Institute (U.S.)) ', ' Funding ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Methods ', ' Mission ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Mortality ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Diagnostic Neoplasm Staging ', ' Tumor Staging ', ' Neoplasm Staging ', ' Cancer Staging ', ' Patients ', ' Genetic ', ' Staging ', ' Prostate ', ' Prostatic Gland ', ' Prostate Gland ', ' Koreans ', ' Hawaiian population ', ' Hawaiian ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Registries ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Discrimination (Psychology) ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Environment ', ' Environmental Exposure ', ' Address ', ' End Point ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Caring ', ' Data ', ' Stage at Diagnosis ', ' Subgroup ', ' Cancer Detection ', ' Cancer Patient ', ' Cancer Surveillance Research ', ' Cancer Survivor ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' South Asian ', ' Chinese People ', ' Chinese ', ' Characteristics ', ' Adjuvant ', ' socioeconomics ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomic ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio economic ', ' Colorectal Cancer ', ' Feasibility Studies ', ' Affect ', ' base ', ' concept ', ' density ', ' Social Environment ', ' socioenvironment ', ' social context ', ' social climate ', ' Knowledge ', ' Stress ', ' survivorship ', ' Technology ', ' Unemployment ', ' unemployed ', ' out of work ', ' joblessness ', ' jobless ', ' Pattern ', ' interest ', ' Colorectal ', ' Colon or Rectum ', ' Services ', ' experience ', ' Breast ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' California ', ' NIH Program Announcements ', ' Program Announcement ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' social ', ' Medical Surveillance ', ' Epidemiology / Surveillance ', ' Censuses ', ' Measures ', ' Relative (related person) ', ' Relative ', ' neoplasm registry ', ' cancer registry ', ' Geographic Information Systems ', ' Radiation ', ' ray (radiation) ', ' Businesses ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Hispanics ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Outcome Measure ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' response ', ' deprivation ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Breast-Conserving Surgery ', ' Breast Conservation Treatment ', ' BCT ', ' cancer epidemiology ', ' Communities ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' cancer disparity ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' racial/ethnic ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' ']",NCI,CANCER PREVENTION INSTIT OF CALIFORNIA,R03,2007,68504,0.09361036992968119
"Urban Social Context, Health and Health Disparities    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project will capitalize on, extend, and enhance the Chicago Community Adult Health Study (CCAHS), (P50 HD 38986) which is designed to become a major prospective multi-level study of the impact of individual and social environmental factors on health, their role in understanding socioeconomic and racial- ethnic disparities in health, and the biological and behavioral pathways that are involved. This project has completed a major survey of a probability sample of 3105 adults age 18+ in the city of Chicago, with a response rate of 72 percent and including physical measurements of height, weight, waist, hip length, and blood pressure. In addition, saliva and/or a blood sample have been collected for 661 people (60 percent of respondents in a subsample of 80 of the 343 neighborhood clusters (NCs) covering the entire city of Chicago, developed and characterized by the Project on Human Development in Chicago Neighborhoods (PHDCN) (http://phdcn.harvard.edu/), from which the CCAHS sample is drawn. In addition to utilizing existing and collecting new archival data on these areas, the CCAHS carried out Systematic Social Observations of 1664 blocks containing sampled households for the study. Thus, the current application seeks to utilize all these data to extend and enhance the CCAHS as follows: 1) to estimate via state of the art multi-level analysis the role in health and health disparities of the immediate social contexts or ""neighborhoods"" in which people live; 2) to estimate how a wide range of aspects of immediate residential contexts and broader social contexts (assessed by multiple methods and measures and considered both singly and in interaction with each other and individual and household factors) affect health and health disparities and help to understand or flesh out the role of social context in health; 3) to estimate via innovative new methods the role in health and health disparities of the broader social contexts which surround more immediate residential contexts; and 4) to begin to convert the existing cross-sectional study into a longitudinal and prospective study via respondent tracking and mortality follow-up, which will allow initial prospective analyses of the predictive association with mortality of individual, household, and contextual psychosocial risk factors for health assessed in the CCAHS, as well as laying the foundation for a second wave of data collection in 2008-9, which will be funded by a subsequent competing renewal application, and allow for prospective analyses with respect to the full range of health outcomes in CCAHS. This study will importantly advance the understanding of socioeconomic and racial/ethnic disparities in health - a major priority of the Public Health Service and National Institutes of Health for the new millennium.              ","Urban Social Context, Health and Health Disparities",7229398,R01HD050467,"['design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' social disparities ', ' Population ', ' prospective ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' racial/ethnic ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' Respondent ', ' Probability Samples ', ' Prospective Studies ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Nature ', ' Research ', ' Research Design ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Saliva ', ' Sampling Studies ', ' Social Environment ', ' socioenvironment ', ' social context ', ' social climate ', ' Life ', ' Arts ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' United States Public Health Service ', ' USPHS ', ' Public Health Service ', ' Weight ', ' Work ', ' Hour ', ' Source ', ' Height ', ' psychosocial ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Birth ', ' Parturition ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Blood Pressure ', ' Body Size ', ' behavior measurement ', ' behavioral measurement ', ' behavioral measure ', ' Disputes ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' Censuses ', ' Measures ', ' segregation ', ' Racial Segregation ', ' Chicago ', ' multilevel analysis ', ' multilevel modeling ', ' multilevel model ', ' methods to study multiple-level influences ', ' Mediating ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' Cities ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Communities ', ' Cross-Sectional Studies ', ' Disease Frequency Surveys ', ' Cross-Sectional Survey ', ' Cross-Sectional Analyses ', ' Cross Sectional Analysis ', ' Data Collection ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Purpose ', ' TNFRSF5 gene ', ' p50 ', ' Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor Superfamily Member 5 Gene ', ' TNFRSF5 ', ' MGC9013 ', ' CDW40 ', ' CD40 ', ' Bp50 ', ' Length ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Data ', ' Policy Research ', ' Range ', ' Collection ', ' Rate ', ' Process ', ' follow-up ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' socioeconomics ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomic ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio economic ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Behavioral ', ' Foundations ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' urban area ', ' Blood specimen ', ' Blood Sample ', ' Health ', ' Hip region structure ', ' Hip ', ' Coxa ', ' Household ', ' Human Development ', ' Area ', ' Biological ', ' psychologic ', ' psychological ', ' Interview ', ' Individual ', ' Measurement ', ' Funding ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Methods ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Mortality ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Collaborations ', ' ']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2007,501030,0.06619523639617456

"UNDERSTANDING NEIGHBORHOOD IMPACTS OF HEALTH Neighborhoods impact a host of health outcomes, including infant mortality, the development of asthma and heart disease and life expectancy, independent of personal characteristics. The pathways through which neighborhoods 'get under the skin', are only partly understood. This center will study neighborhood influences on health, focusing on those characteristics of neighborhoods that are potentially amenable to change through changes in public policy. The Center has the following goals: 1) To conduct research to explain how neighborhoods contribute to health throughout the life cycle, including through biological pathways and health behaviors 2) To develop a rich data resource that can be used to advance the understanding of how neighborhoods influence health, and the biological pathways through which such influences work. 3) To develop robust community-based participatory research (CBPR) partnerships within each of the 3 cities in which RAND is located, involving both community-based organizations and academic institutions. 4) To develop and foster a community of interdisciplinary researchers (including social and basic scientists) focused on the social determinants of health, specifically the role of neighborhoods in health. 5) To contribute to improving public policies that can improve population health through a set of policy recommendations that are developed from the results of the Center's research. The Center, which places a high priority on community-based participatory research, will be composed of 4 projects, 2 pilots, and 2 cores. Projects span 3 levels of analysis: biological, social/environmental, and behavioral/psychological. Project 1 will examine the impact of a large natural experiment involving the development and renovation of recreational facilities on physical activity and other health outcomes. Project 2 will study neighborhood factors that impact the functional and cognitive aspects of the disabling process in the elderly. Project 3 examines the relationships between neighborhoods and biological markers of allostatic load. Project 4 studies the impact of the built environment on mental health. Pilot 1 examines the impact of neighborhoods on oxidative stress and preterm birth. Pilot 2 examines gene-environment interactions in prostate cancer. An administrative core will support the entire project. A data and methods core provides data and computing support, and serves as a focus for intellectual activity around measurement and statistical issues.

"Neighborhoods, Women and Coronary Heart Disease: A Prospective Study    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Although research suggests that where one lives affects one's risk of coronary heart disease (CHD), scientists have only begun to explore the pathways through which neighborhoods ""get under the skin."" Recent studies demonstrate that the built environment affects individual health and health behaviors, but have not examined the relationship between the built environment and cardiovascular health risk or subsequent cardiac events. Moreover, factors influencing the development and clinical manifestations of CHD differ substantially in women and men, and studies suggest that neighborhood social and built environments also affect men and women differently. The overarching objective of the proposed project is to examine the impact of neighborhood factors on women's development of CHD. We aim to identify aspects of the built environment that can be modified through urban planning or public policy and are associated with health benefits. The project will expand on existing research by investigating both the social and built environment and by examining whether behavioral factors, social relationships, and psychological well-being mediate the links between environmental characteristics and CHD development among women. The specific aims of our 3-year project are: 1. To assess whether built and social characteristics of neighborhoods predict the development of CHD after controlling for baseline sociodemographic and biological measures of CHD risk. 2. To evaluate whether aspects of the built and social environment are associated with individual health behaviors, social support, and psychological well-being that are known to be related to CHD in women. 3. To determine whether pathways between environmental characteristics and CHD are mediated by individual health behaviors, social support, and/or psychological well-being. To address these aims this project brings together two unique resources: individual-level data from the Observational Study (OS) and Clinical Trial (CT) arms of the Women's Health Initiative (WHI), a prospective study of 161,809 women ages 50 to 79 at entry, and geocoded, census-tract level contextual data on the sociodemographic and built environment where study subjects reside derived by the RAND Center for Population Health and Health Disparities (CPHHD) data core from the Census and other sources.                       ","Neighborhoods, Women and Coronary Heart Disease: A Prospective Study",7319162,R01HL084425,"['Coronary heart disease ', ' coronary disorder ', ' Coronary Disease ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' heart disease risk ', ' heart disorder risk ', ' cardiac disorder risk ', ' cardiac disease risk ', ' cardiovascular disorder risk ', ' cardiovascular disease risk ', ' Skin ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Environment ', ' Address ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Data ', ' Centers for Population Health ', ' Observational Study ', ' Monitor ', ' Characteristics ', ' Cardiac ', ' Exercise ', ' Physical Exercise ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Behavioral ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' improved ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' Health Status ', ' Level of Health ', ' Clinical ', ' Biological ', ' Age of Onset ', ' Link ', ' Incidence ', ' Income ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Libraries ', ' Individual ', ' Literature ', ' Policies ', ' Measurement ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' middle age ', ' midlife ', ' middle aged ', ' mid-life ', ' mid life ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Genetic ', ' Poverty ', ' Prospective Studies ', ' Public Policy ', ' Condition ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Social Characteristics ', ' Social Environment ', ' socioenvironment ', ' social context ', ' social climate ', ' Social support ', ' social support network ', ' Life ', ' Pollution ', ' Testing ', ' Scientist ', ' United States ', ' Well in self ', ' self wellness ', ' psychological wellness ', ' Sense of well-being ', ' Psychological Well Being ', ' Normal psyche ', ' Normal mental state ', ' Normal mental condition ', ' Mental well-being ', ' Feels well ', ' Emotional well being ', ' Woman ', ' Event ', ' Upper arm ', ' Source ', ' Pattern ', ' Elderly woman ', ' contextual factors ', ' Application Context ', ' cohort ', ' Disease Outcome ', ' Study Subject ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' circulatory system ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' Cardiovascular system (all sites) ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' social ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Censuses ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', "" Women's Health "", ' Female Health ', ' Health Benefit ', ' Mediating ', ' Modeling ', ' behavioral health ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' clinical investigation ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' Coupled ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' ']",NHLBI,RAND CORPORATION,R01,2007,852992,0.10577748930010487
"Measuring Neighborhood: Key Aspects for Multiethnic Older Adults Health Status    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This Mentored Research Scientist Development Award (K01) proposes to provide the candidate, an early-career investigator with the UCSF Resource Center for Minority Aging Research (RCMAR), further training in measurement tool development and assessment, advanced statistical methods, and qualitative research methods. The additional training would enable her to pursue a career as an independent investigator identifying key social and environmental mechanisms that create racial/ethnic and socioeconomic disparities among older adults. In the shorter term, building on prior work of the candidate, this K01 focuses on the neighborhood environment as a possible key factor influencing health and contributing to health disparities. She proposes a career development plan that consists of coursework, training, and research experiences with a mentoring team of senior faculty and external mentors with expertise in the areas of measurement development, minority aging, health disparities, qualitative research methods, and advanced statistical methods. The research program consists of three parts: secondary data analysis, qualitative research project, and creation of a new pilot neighborhood measurement tool. Part one of the research program is analysis of the Chicago Health and Aging Project (CHAP), investigating the cross- sectional and longitudinal associations of neighborhood environment with perceived health status. Neighborhood environment is assessed in CHAP by self-report, street observations, census data, and secondary data on crime and traffic. Part two of the research program is intensive semi-structured interviews of older adults who are from diverse racial/ethnic backgrounds and live in economically diverse neighborhoods. The adults will be asked about the meaning of their neighborhood, the resources they use in their neighborhoods, the challenges they confront, how they cope with difficulties, and their health status. The interview data will be analyzed for key themes. In Part three, these themes will be translated into survey items to create a pilot measurement tool for neighborhood environment. Identifying mechanisms for health disparities among older adults is a priority of the NIA five-year strategic plan. Neighborhood environments could be crucial given that as people age they may be more dependent on their immediate surroundings.          ",Measuring Neighborhood: Key Aspects for Multiethnic Older Adults Health Status,7282988,K01AG027273,"['Crime ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Low income ', ' Economics ', ' Environment ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Mentored Research Scientist Development Award ', ' Research Scientist Development Award ', ' Mentored Training Award ', ' K01 Program ', ' K01 Mechanism ', ' K01 Award ', ' Research Training ', ' Strategic Planning ', ' Rate ', ' Principal Investigator ', ' Characteristics ', ' socioeconomics ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomic ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio economic ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Faculty ', ' Fibrinogen ', ' Factor One ', ' Factor I ', ' Coagulation Factor One ', ' Coagulation Factor I ', ' Blood Factor One ', ' Blood Coagulation Factor One ', ' Blood Coagulation Factor I ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' base ', ' career ', ' Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Aging ', ' Label ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' Health Status ', ' Level of Health ', ' Homes for the Aged ', ' home for elderly ', ' Old Age Homes ', ' Home for seniors ', ' Area ', ' Income ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Institutes ', ' Interview ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Literature ', ' Policies ', ' Measurement ', ' Development Plans ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Mentors ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' tool ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Condition ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' San Francisco ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' Trees ', ' Unemployment ', ' unemployed ', ' out of work ', ' joblessness ', ' jobless ', ' Work ', ' Side ', ' Class ', ' contextual factors ', ' Application Context ', ' Services ', ' age group ', ' experience ', ' cohesion ', ' trafficking ', ' Structure ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Self-Report ', ' social ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' Censuses ', ' Measures ', ' Chicago ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Research Methodology ', ' Research Methods ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Qualitative Research ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Minority ', ' coping ', ' federal poverty level ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' racial/ethnic ', ' tool development ', ' ']",NIA,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",K01,2007,117990,0.08310058923001883
"NEIGHBORHOODS AND THE HEALTH OF ELDERLY AMERICANS This project is coordinated with P50 ES012383, Nicole Lurie, ?UNDERSTANDING NEIGHBORHOOD IMPACTS ON HEALTH.? This project investigates how contextual factors, specifically the built and socioeconomic features of neighborhoods, affect the health of elderly Americans. Neighborhood characteristics may influence the health of elderly persons in two principal ways:  through direct contemporaneous effects on health status and functioning, or through cumulative effects from earlier points in the lifecourse. Because many neighborhood features are modifiable, identifying changes in those aspects of neighborhood environment with the greatest influence on health could become important in addressing health disparities and improving health overall. Understanding at what points in the lifecourse the neighborhood environment most affects health will further inform interventions to reduce disparities in health and functioning in old age. Unfortunately, there is a paucity of literature on how these contextual factors affect late-life health and functioning. The few existing studies of the elderly are based on small sample sizes drawn largely from confined geographic areas and are thus of limited generalizability. We propose to undertake a national study of the effect of neighborhoods, both built and social environments on health and functioning in old age. The study has the following aims: 1) to measure the effects of the built and social environment on the health and health trajectories of the elderly, with a focus on identifying those neighborhood features that have the most impact on health and are amenable to policy interventions; 2) to understand how and at what points neighborhood environments from earlier in life influence health in old age; and 3) to examine whether neighborhood features have differential impacts on important subpopulations of the elderly, such as men and women, people with low socioeconomic status, and racial/ethnic minorities.  The study will use two nationally representative panel data sets, the Health and Retirement Survey (1992-2002) and the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (1968-2003). These data sets contain large samples of elderly persons that are representative of the elderly population of the United States. Neighborhood characteristics, derived from the work of the Center's data core, will be merged with the individual level data at the census tract level.

"Health, Poverty and Place: Modeling Inequalities in Accra Using RS and GIS    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This project, through a detailed analysis of spatial disparities in health in Accra, Ghana, aims to provide a model for the interpretation of urban health inequalities in cities in poor countries. Using Accra in Ghana, we will generate methods that we hope will serve as templates for comparative analyses of other major cities in the developing world. The project will produce a geographical synopsis of the differentials in health and mortality within the urban area in a format immediately accessible to government and the development agencies tasked with the improvement of health overall and with the reduction of health inequalities; map the distribution of poverty (both income and wealth) in the city and assess its spatial association with selected health and mortality outcomes; using remote sensing and GIS technology, measure the association of adverse health and mortality outcomes with neighborhood ecology, including the association with spatial measures derived from observations of physical features and built structures visible from multi-spectral high spatial resolution satellite imagery; and assess the additional contribution of community-level variables including social organization and institutions to the production of inequalities in health and mortality, net of individual-level characteristics. Our research involves the following major steps: (i) apply new methods of defining urban neighborhoods across space and time using census and survey data and information from remotely sensed imagery; (2) validate data-derived neighborhood definitions, attributes, and boundaries with field assessments in a purposive sample of Accra neighborhoods; (3) assemble existing census-based, survey-based, and vital statistics-based measures of morbidity and mortality at the neighborhood level, based on the derived neighborhood definitions, as well as existing and updated imagery and geographic layers; (4) re-interview (in 2008) the respondents to the 2003 Accra Women's Health Survey to generate new measures of neighborhood-level health outcomes and changes in those outcomes; (5) employ spatial analytic, multivariate and multi-level analyses to predict the inequalities in health outcomes between and within neighborhoods of Accra; (6) develop models that build on the WHS and DHS data in combination with the imagery to predict health outcomes by neighborhood; (7) apply the modeling algorithms to two key resources-the Demographic and Health Survey and remotely sensed imagery-to predict the variability (inequality) in neighborhood level health outcomes in Accra; and (8) employ the results locally in Accra for health policy and planning purposes, and use the results from relatively data-rich Accra to develop models that can subsequently be used to estimate the spatial variability in health in data-poorer cities in sub-Saharan Africa.                    ","Health, Poverty and Place: Modeling Inequalities in Accra Using RS and GIS",7498369,R01HD054906,"['Ecology ', ' Environmental Science ', ' Economics ', ' Environment ', ' Address ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Data ', ' Measurable ', ' Resolution ', ' Update ', ' Validation ', ' Principal Investigator ', ' Characteristics ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Africa South of the Sahara ', ' Subsaharan Africa ', ' Sub-Saharan Africa ', ' Ghana ', ' Gold Coast ', ' Imagery ', ' Visualization ', ' Standards of Weights and Measures ', ' base ', ' concept ', ' urban area ', ' Goals ', ' Government ', ' improved ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' Health care facility ', ' Healthcare Facility ', ' Health Facilities ', ' Health Policy ', ' healthcare policy ', ' health care policy ', ' Health Status ', ' Level of Health ', ' Health Surveys ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Household ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Man (Taxonomy) ', ' Algorithms ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Link ', ' Income ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Interview ', ' Laboratories ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Individual ', ' Literature ', ' Rural ', ' Demographic and Health Surveys ', ' Inequality ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Mortality ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Respondent ', ' Developed Countries ', ' Industrialized Nations ', ' Industrialized Countries ', ' Developed Nations ', ' Developed Nation ', ' Developed Country ', ' Perception ', ' Population Dynamics ', ' Population Growth ', ' Poverty ', ' Production ', ' tool ', ' Records ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Slum ', ' Social Justice ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Urban Health ', ' Urbanization ', ' Attention ', ' Vital Statistics ', ' Investigation ', ' Work ', ' Week ', ' Dimensions ', ' Source ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' Country ', ' Transcend ', ' social organization ', ' remote sensing ', ' metropolitan ', ' Proxy ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' member ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Self-Report ', ' Censuses ', ' Environmental Hazards ', ' Measures ', ' Relative (related person) ', ' Relative ', "" Women's Health "", ' Female Health ', ' Child health care ', ' Child Health ', ' Child Mortality ', ' Data Aggregation ', ' Aggregated Data ', ' Demography ', ' Population Studies / Demography ', ' Developing Countries ', ' Under-Developed Nations ', ' Under-Developed Countries ', ' Third-World Nations ', ' Third-World Countries ', ' Less-Developed Nations ', ' Less-Developed Countries ', ' Developing Nations ', ' Developing Nation ', ' Developing Country ', ' Institution ', ' Purpose ', ' Low income ', ' Geographic Information Systems ', ' deoxyhypusine synthase ', ' spermidine dehydrogenase (NAD, L-deoxyhypusyl-forming) ', ' EC 2.5.1.46 ', ' Case Study ', ' case report ', ' Longitudinal Surveys ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Cities ', ' model design ', ' Communities ', ' time use ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' comparative ', ' lens ', ' lenses ', ' ']",NICHD,SAN DIEGO STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2008,615484,0.19194507387185789
"Neighborhood and Family Effects on Disparities in Chronic Disease    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There is increasing evidence that the social and physical environments in which individuals live may play a key role in health disparities by race/ethnicity and socioeconomic status. The goal of this study is to significantly advance our knowledge about the role of specific family and neighborhood characteristics for disparities in the emergence of chronic disease and its precursors during childhood and adolescence. This project is based on the Los Angeles Family and Neighborhood Survey (L.A.FANS), a longitudinal study of neighborhoods, families, adults, and children in Los Angeles County. The first wave (L.A.FANS-1), completed in January 2002, interviewed adults and children living in 3,090 households in a stratified probability sample of 65 neighborhoods throughout Los Angeles County. The second wave (L.A.FANS-2) is in the field and will be completed in 2008. This project will use these data to analyze the effects of specific family and neighborhood characteristics on asthma, obesity, glucose metabolism, hypertension, and metabolic syndrome. These conditions are increasing in prevalence and importance among the population and represent a major component of overall health disparities by race/ethnicity and socioeconomic status. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This study will test hypotheses about the effects of family and neighborhood characteristics on disparities in chronic disease among children using new data from a longitudinal survey of health in Los Angeles County. The results will provide new information on the causes of and potential strategies to reduce race/ethnic and SES disparities in health during childhood and over the life- course.          ",Neighborhood and Family Effects on Disparities in Chronic Disease,7498899,R01HD058514,"['health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' type II DM ', ' type 2 DM ', ' maturity onset diabetes ', ' ketosis resistant diabetes ', ' adult onset diabetes ', ' Type II diabetes ', ' Type II Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Type 2 diabetes ', ' Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus ', ' T2DM ', ' T2D ', ' T2 DM ', ' Stable Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Slow-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Noninsulin Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Non-Insulin Dependent Diabetes ', ' NIDDM ', ' Maturity-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' MODY ', ' Ketosis-Resistant Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Adult-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Environment ', ' Social Network ', ' Data ', ' Development, Other ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' Behavioral ', ' Family ', ' Family Characteristics ', ' Adolescence ', ' teenage ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' Food ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' base ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Health Surveys ', ' Household ', ' Hypertension ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' high blood pressure ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Biological ', ' Adolescent ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Interview ', ' Investments ', ' disability ', ' Childhood ', ' pediatric ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' insight ', ' Life Cycle Stages ', ' life course ', ' Life Cycle ', ' Individual ', ' Numbers ', ' Literature ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' Los Angeles ', ' Policies ', ' Measurement ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Childhood Asthma ', ' Pediatric asthma ', ' Asthma in Children ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Mortality ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Respondent ', ' Immigrant ', ' Obesity ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Parents ', ' Peer Group ', ' Physicians ', ' Play ', ' Probability Samples ', ' Shapes ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Condition ', ' Research ', ' Residential Mobility ', ' Residential Selections ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Schools ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Asthma ', ' Bronchial Asthma ', ' Dimensions ', ' Biological Markers ', ' Biologic Marker ', ' Physical environment ', ' glucose metabolism ', ' Population Study ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' Reporting ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' social ', ' County ', ' Measures ', ' National origin ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child health care ', ' Child Health ', ' Cholesterol ', ' Cholest-5-en-3-ol (3beta)- ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Latino ', ' Longitudinal Surveys ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' chronic disorder ', ' chronic disease/disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Sampling ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Metabolic syndrome ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' cost effective ', ' cost-effective ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' ']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R01,2008,442411,0.15528538707500236
"Neighborhood and Mammography: A multilevel approach to cancer screening behavior    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The underlying mechanisms for the persistent racial/ethnic and socioeconomic disparities in breast cancer mortality rates observed in the US are poorly understood. While many factors have been shown to influence these disparities, diagnosis at later stage of disease among African-Americans and women of low socioeconomic status (SES) continues to be a concern. Thus, the role of mammography screening, as delivered in the US health care system, has been an area of interest in explaining excess breast cancer deaths observed for African-American and low-SES women. While some studies show that African- American women are screened as often as White women, others have shown that African-American are less likely to receive adequate mammography services. Data have consistently shown that women with lower income, lower education levels, and no usual source of care are less likely to engage in repeat mammography screening. There is also evidence to show that SES exerts an impact on cancer screening at an ecologic level (e.g. county poverty levels). In addition to neighborhood socioeconomic conditions and resources, racial residential segregation has been shown to influence health outcomes. Yet to our knowledge, racial residential segregation has received little attention in terms of its effect on cancer prevention behavior. While administrative census data can yield insight into contextual neighborhood effects, the development and use of measures that extend beyond census data are necessary in order to identify mechanisms that can be identified for effective intervention efforts. Using a multilevel conceptual framework, I propose to: 1) Examine the influence of neighborhood factors (census tract level) and racial residential segregation on repeat mammography in a national sample; 2) Conduct key informant interviews and focus groups to determine neighborhood factors of concern to women; 3) Collect pilot data on neighborhood conditions in Jacksonville, FL; 4) Develop a grant proposal for independent funding to conduct a study on neighborhood and mammography screening behavior. This proposal specifically addresses neighborhood level influences on cancer prevention behavior with the ultimate goal of offering insight into the multilevel mechanisms that can lead to effective neighborhood level interventions in the area of cancer control and prevention.           ",Neighborhood and Mammography: A multilevel approach to cancer screening behavior,7493590,K01DP001121,[''],NCCDPHP,UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA,K01,2008,165077,0.11815114973895757
"Neighborhood and Family Effects on Stress and Health DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  In this project, we will investigate the effects of neighborhood social context on biomarkers of stress and health for children and adults of all ages. We will use new data from the Los Angeles Family and Neighborhood Survey (L.A.FANS), whose design remedies many of the problems that have limited previous research on neighborhood effects, by collecting longitudinal data on neighborhoods, families, adults, and children, and on residential choice and neighborhood change. The first wave (L.A.FANS-1), completed in January 2002, interviewed adults and children living in 3,090 households in a diverse stratified probability sample of 65 neighborhoods throughout Los Angeles County. The second wave (L.A.FANS-2), planned for 2005-2006, is being funded by NICHD and NIA and includes the collection of biomarkers of stress and health for adults in the sample, data on adults and on children and their caregivers, as well as information on neighborhood social and physical conditions. As part of this project (L.A.FANS-2/Health), fieldwork will be undertaken to collect similar biomarkers of stress and health for all children in the sample. Data collection will be conducted simultaneously with the main L.A.FANS-2 survey, which will promote efficiency and reduce costs.  The specific aims of this project are to: (1) collect physiological markers of stress, disease, and health, including obesity, cortisol (a stress hormone), blood pressure, C-reactive protein (a marker of acute inflammation), Epstein-Barr virus antibodies (a marker of immune function), cholesterol, diabetes, and pulmonary function for all children in L.A.FANS-2; and (2) investigate the effects of social context and family environment on health status for adults and children, focusing on physiological markers of stress and health across the life course.  Extensive information will be available from the L.A.FANS database on respondents' social environment as well as confounding factors such as neighborhood choice, residential mobility, migration, and neighborhood change. We will use multilevel statistical models to control for unobserved heterogeneity at the individual, family, and neighborhood levels and will employ extensions of these models, as well as fixed effects models, to tackle issues of endogeneity using longitudinal data and data on matched respondents from the same family.

"Predoctoral Fellowships for Students with Disabilities    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There is a significant body of literature on the association between maternal depression and child behavior but considerably less evidence on the effects of neighborhood social conditions on both of these outcomes. Although there are prevention programs at individual and family levels, the potential for neighborhood level interventions has received less attention. The research proposal below will inform future theory and research on neighborhood level research and prevention mechanisms. The proposed study will use longitudinal data from a large-scale population-based study across urban, rural and suburban areas of Los Angeles County grounded in theories of neighborhood level determinants of health, providing the opportunity to refine the theoretical tradition of collective efficacy and neighborhood disorder by testing these theories, as well as adding empirical evidence of 1) the existence and effect, if any, of neighborhood disorder on maternal depression across diverse neighborhoods in LA County, 2) whether neighborhood disorder affects childhood internalizing and externalizing behavior and 3) the reciprocal relationship of maternal depression and child behavior within the social context of the neighborhood.           ",Predoctoral Fellowships for Students with Disabilities,7478377,F31HD049314,"['Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Predoctoral Fellowship--Students with Disabilities ', ' NRSA Predoctoral Fellowship Students w/Disabilities (F31) ', ' Characteristics ', ' Family ', ' Future ', ' Affect ', ' base ', ' Health ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' healthcare service availability ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare access availability ', ' health services availability ', ' health care service availability ', ' health care service access ', ' health care availability ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Availability of Health Services ', ' Accessibility of health care ', ' Access to Healthcare ', ' Access to Health Care ', ' Access to Care ', ' Area ', ' Childhood ', ' pediatric ', ' Individual ', ' Literature ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' Los Angeles ', ' Rural ', ' Policy Maker ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Mothers ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Parents ', ' Poverty ', ' Psychophysiology ', ' psychophysical ', ' psycho-physiological ', ' physiopsychology ', ' Psychophysiological ', ' Physiological Psychology ', ' Physiologic Psychology ', ' Condition ', ' Research ', ' Research Design ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Proposals ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Schools ', ' Single-Parent Family ', ' Social Conditions ', ' Societal Conditions ', ' Social Environment ', ' socioenvironment ', ' social context ', ' social climate ', ' programs ', ' Testing ', ' Attention ', ' Violence ', ' violent behavior ', ' violent ', ' Work ', ' Frequencies (time pattern) ', ' Frequency ', ' Behavior ', ' metropolitan ', ' Prevention Research ', ' Prevention program ', ' social inequality ', ' County ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Behavior ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' theories ', ' Cities ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' externalizing behavior ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' maternal depression ', ' depressed mother ', ' ']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,F31,2008,30851,0.14683912817266878

"Work, Neighborhood, Commuting, and Occupational Health Disparities    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Efforts to identify and eliminate occupational health disparities require an understanding of the broader social and environmental context in which workers live their lives. New conceptual frameworks and research recognize that, not only do workers experience the physical and social hazards of their jobs, but their susceptibility or resilience to workplace experiences with regard to health is further shaped by their social and environmental context beyond work, including at home, and also by their commuting experience. Accordingly, we propose to use the previously validated methodology of geocoding and linkage of individual subjects to the area- based socioeconomic characteristics of their neighborhoods of residence to greatly enhance the available information on the social and environmental context of the workers in the United for Health (UFH) study. Specifically, we further enrich the UFH's already substantial data on workplace physical and social hazards and health outcomes with data on the workers' neighborhood, the workplace neighborhood, and the workers' commute time, as follows: Specific Aim A.1. Geocode workers' residential and workplace addresses in the United for Health study cohort, in order to (a) append residential and workplace US census-derived area-based socioeconomic measures (ABSMs) and (b) calculate the commute travel distance and travel time between the workers' home and worksite. Specific Aim A.2. Assess the extent to which individual socioeconomic position, residential and workplace ABSMs, and commute distance are associated with the following selected health outcomes, overall and in relation to race/ethnicity and gender:(a) fair or poor self-rated health; (b) smoking; (c) elevated blood pressure; and (d) increased respiratory symptoms. Specific Aim A.3. Assess the role of residential and workplace ABSMs and commute distance as modifiers of established associations between the selected health outcomes and workplace physical hazards (noise, dust/gases and chemical fumes, and ergonomic strain) and social hazards (workplace abuse, racial discrimination, sexual harassment, and job strain). By addressing these aims, this project will yield new information that can encourage and inform collaboration among occupational health and environmental health practitioners, regulators, and advocates, urban planners, community based groups, and worker organizations, including unions, about ways to create healthier communities and jobs.       This project explores how the social and environmental context of workers' residential and workplace neighborhoods, including commuting time and distance, impacts their health. In particular, we focus on interactions between individual and neighborhood socioeconomic position as modifiers of susceptibility to workplace physical and social hazards.          ","Work, Neighborhood, Commuting, and Occupational Health Disparities",7405277,R03OH009338,[''],NIOSH,HARVARD SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH,R03,2008,81500,0.03155050839605096
"Causal Models of Segregation and Health    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Residential segregation has been argued by many as a fundamental cause of racial disparities in health (Acevedo-Garcia 2003; Schulz et al. 2002; Williams & Collins 2001). Segregation disproportionately affects minority groups by concentrating poverty, diminishing the quality of neighborhood social and physical environments, and attenuating individual socio-economic attainment and upward mobility (Collins and Williams 1999). However, we still do not fully understand the extent to which neighborhood segregation contributes to health disparities-not simply because relatively few studies have explicitly addressed this question, but because many of the past research attempts to measure the effects of racial segregation on health have used inappropriate methods and untenable assumptions (Duncan et al. 1997) and have relied largely on aggregate level data (Williams & Collins 2001). We are able to remedy many of the shortcomings in conventional analysis in the following ways. One, while prior studies have relied almost exclusively on aggregate data that is subject to ecological fallacy, we are able to utilize individual-level data to examine relationships between segregation and health (self-rated health and mortality) as well as neighborhood-level (census-tract) data to examine the possible pathways through which segregation affects health. Second, utilizing panel data, we can estimate the effects of segregation at various points in time during the life course; prior studies have almost all relied on a single (contemporary) point-in-time estimate of neighborhood effects on health. Third, we are able to calculate a broad set of segregation measures in addition to the traditionally used dissimilarity index-measures that have a much stronger theoretical and analytical correlation with concentrated poverty and other aspects of social space that may have a much stronger connection to health. Finally, and most importantly, by using panel data we are able to at least partially control for unobserved heterogeneity and recover causal estimates of the effects of segregation on health outcomes by controlling for unobserved individual-level characteristics through the application of various fixed-effect analyses. This project investigates the effect of residential segregation over the life-course on the health and mortality of Black and White adults using a sophisticated panel data set, merged with census data at the census-tract and county levels. This project will estimate unbiased effects of segregation and neighborhood poverty to determine how much any potential observed effects contribute to known racial disparities in health and mortality.             ",Causal Models of Segregation and Health,7393741,R21HD055612,"['Data Aggregation ', ' Aggregated Data ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Economics ', ' Address ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Data ', ' Rate ', ' Characteristics ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' Affect ', ' improved ', ' Health ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' indexing ', ' Life Cycle Stages ', ' life course ', ' Life Cycle ', ' Individual ', ' Literature ', ' Methods ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Mortality ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Respondent ', ' Poverty ', ' Attenuated ', ' Condition ', ' Research ', ' Time ', ' Dimensions ', ' Ecological Bias ', ' Ecological Fallacy ', ' Physical environment ', ' social space ', ' social ', ' Censuses ', ' County ', ' Measures ', ' segregation ', ' Racial Segregation ', ' Modeling ', ' Outcome ', ' ']",NICHD,SAN DIEGO STATE UNIVERSITY,R21,2008,146510,0.09890497201783487
"Urban Social Context, Health and Health Disparities This project will capitalize on, extend, and enhance the Chicago Community Adult Health Study(CCAHS), (P50 HD 38986) which is designed to become a major prospective multi-level study of the impact of individual and social environmental factors on health, their role in understanding socioeconomic and racial- ethnic disparities in health, and the biological and behavioral pathways that are involved. This project has completed a major survey of a probability sample of 3105 adults age 18+ in the city of Chicago, with a response rate of 72% and including physical measurements of height, weight, waist, hip length, and blood pressure. In addition, saliva and/or a blood sample have been collected for 661 people (60% of respondents in a subsample of 80 of the 343 neighborhood clusters (NCs) covering the entire city of Chicago, developed and characterized by the Project on Human Development in Chicago Neighborhoods (PHDCN) (http://phdcn.harvard.edu/), from which the CCAHS sample is drawn. In addition to utilizing existing and collecting new archival data on these areas, the CCAHS carried out Systematic Social Observations of 1664 blocks containing sampled households for the study. Thus, the current proposal seeks to utilize all these data to extend and enhance the CCAHS as follows: 1) to estimate via state of the art multi-level analysis the role in health and health disparities of the immediate social contexts or ""neighborhoods"" in which people live; 2) to estimate how a wide range of aspects of immediate residential contexts and broader social contexts (assessed by multiple methods and measures and considered both singly and in interaction with each other and individual and household factors) affect health and health disparities and help to understand or flesh out the role of social context in health; 3) to estimate via innovative new methods the role in health and health disparities of the broader social contexts which surround more immediate residential contexts; and 4) to begin to convert the existing cross-sectional study into a longitudinal and prospective study via respondent tracking and mortality follow-up, which will allow initial prospective analyses of the predictive association with mortality of individual, household, and contextual psychosocial risk factors for health assessed in the CCAHS, as well as laying the foundation for a second wave of data collection in 2008-9, which will be funded by a subsequent competing renewal proposal, and allow for prospective analyses with respect to the full range of health outcomes in CCAHS. This study will importantly advance the understanding of socioeconomic and racial/ethnic disparities in health - a major priority of the Public Health Service and National Institutes of Health for the new millenium.

"Harlem Community Academic Partnership: Influenza Immunizations    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Proposed is a community based participatory research project (CBPR) and evaluation for improving influenza immunizations in high risk populations within disadvantaged minority communities. The Harlem Community and Academic Partnership (HCAP)'s Board includes residents, community based organizations, academic partners and the local health department who meet monthly to plan, conduct and review neighborhood assessments, interventions and evaluation activities; topic-specific issues are addressed through formation of Intervention Work Groups (IWGs). The HCAP Board noted especially low rates of influenza immunizations in Harlem and formed the VIVA (Venue Intensive Vaccine for Adults) IWG. This IWG has conducted separate pilots including a survey on barriers to immunization, development of culturally informed intervention materials, a pilot of ""yellow jacket"" outreach workers to engage and educate hard-to reach populations, and provision of immunizations at non-traditional sites. The goal of this proposal is to assemble these components to formally scale up and test the intervention for adults in the Harlem communities. To achieve these aims, the HCAP VIVA IWG will plan, organize and implement an intervention; our primary partner, Palladia Inc, provides outreach educators and a service network of over 120 CBOs to educate and mobilize the community for immunization as well as coordinate congregating persons with traditional and new non-traditional venues for immunizations; the local Visiting Nurse Service has agreed to provide nurses and influenza vaccines at the selected venues gratis. This program does not replace, but rather supplements existing vaccination programs in the city by adding more relevant education and new ""non-traditional"" venues. We expect that this program will increase rates of immunizations overall including the hard-to-reach populations. To evaluate this program, we will compare annual rates of immunization between Harlem and communities similar to Harlem in NYC, with data available by neighborhood through the NYC annual ""Community Health Survey"" (modified BRFSS from CDC) which includes 10,000 adult NYC residents. We will also conduct two cross sectional street intercept surveys (n=800) before and after each annual intervention program between harlem and comparison community residents. These data combined with yearly inventories of CBOs, will provide measures of barriers, intervention experiences and outcomes to broaden input for continuous program improvement.          ",Harlem Community Academic Partnership: Influenza Immunizations,7493793,R24MD002754,"['Persons ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' New York ', ' New York City ', ' Nurses ', ' Nursing Services ', ' Online Systems ', ' web based ', ' online computer ', ' On-Line Systems ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Appendix ', ' Social support ', ' social support network ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System ', ' Behavior Risk Factor Surveillance System ', ' BRFSS ', ' Healthy People 2010 ', ' Provider ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Elements ', ' Address ', ' AIDS prevention ', ' HIV/AIDS prevention ', ' HIV Prevention ', ' AIDS/HIV prevention ', ' Data ', ' Mutate ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Rate ', ' Principal Investigator ', ' Process ', ' Community Health ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Influenza A Virus, H5N1 Subtype ', ' avian influenza H5N1 virus ', ' avian influenza H5N1 ', ' H5N1 virus ', ' H5N1 ', ' pandemic disease ', ' pandemic ', ' Avian Influenza ', ' influenza in birds ', ' avian flu ', ' Fowl Plague ', ' Fowl Pest ', ' Bird Flu ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' base ', ' Goals ', ' Group Meetings ', ' improved ', ' Health ', ' Health Promotion ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' Health Surveys ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Immunization Programs ', ' Immunization ', ' Immunostimulation ', ' Immunological Stimulation ', ' Immunological Sensitization ', ' Immunologic Stimulation ', ' Immunologic Sensitization ', ' Influenza ', ' influenza infection ', ' flu infection ', ' Grippe ', ' Influenza virus vaccine ', ' Influenza Vaccines ', ' Flu vaccine ', ' Equipment and supply inventories ', ' Inventory ', ' Evaluation ', ' Joints ', ' Articulation ', ' Learning ', ' Trust ', ' Methods ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Mission ', ' Motivation ', ' Testing ', ' Vaccination ', ' Influenza vaccination ', ' flu immunisation ', ' Prophylactic vaccination against influenza ', ' Influenza immunization ', ' Flu vaccination ', ' Vaccines ', ' Adopted ', ' Attitude ', ' Visiting Nurse ', ' Home Health Nursing ', ' Work ', ' Yellow Jackets ', ' Awareness ', ' Source ', ' Services ', ' experience ', ' Intercept ', ' intervention program ', ' Structure ', ' disorder prevention ', ' disease prevention ', ' outreach ', ' social ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' CDC ', ' Measures ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' response ', ' Cities ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Communities ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' scale up ', ' Population ', ' novel vaccines ', ' next generation vaccines ', ' new vaccines ', ' community based participatory research ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' ']",NIMHD,NEW YORK ACADEMY OF MEDICINE,R24,2008,575839,0.05542685893538761
"UTMB Center for Population Health and Health Disparities    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The proposed project will explore the relationship between neighborhood context and measures of health among Hispanics.  In preliminary analyses, the investigators have found that an increasing percentage of Hispanics residing in a census tract is related to low overall mortality, cancer mortality, and cancer incidence among Hispanics, after controlling for numerous community and individual characteristics and risk factors, including immigrant status and acculturation.  At the same time, increasing census tract percent Hispanics is associated with decreased survival after a diagnosis of cancer.  The investigators now propose to explore the reasons for these strong neighborhood effects on health by examining several data sets linked to census data: Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) data on cancer incidence and survival, vital registration data on cancer mortality, and the National Health Interview Survey-National Death Index file on cancer prevalence and mortality and all cause mortality.

"Social and Neighborhood Predictors of Obesity in Belo Horizonte    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Obesity has emerged as a major and growing public health problem in Latin America, and specifically in Brazil. Social and physical environments have been hypothesized to be major determinants of obesity but their contribution to obesity in developing countries has been infrequently examined. This project will establish a collaboration between the Federal University of Minas Gerais and the Center for Social Epidemiology and Population Health of the University of Michigan to investigate the role of socioeconomic and neighborhood factors in shaping the distribution of obesity and the related behaviors of diet and physical activity in Belo Horizonte, a large city in Brazil. Using data from a large population-based survey of Belo Horizonte we will (1) examine socioeconomic predictors of obesity, diet, and physical activity (2) test and examine the measurement properties of instruments to measure neighborhood physical and social environments potentially related to cardiovascular risk in the context of a large Latin American; (3) use these instruments to examine associations between neighborhood environments and obesity, diet and physical activity (4) investigate the contribution of these neighborhood factors to the socioeconomic patterning of cardiovascular risk factors in Belo Horizonte. This research will be done primarily at the School of Medicine of the Federal University of Minas Gerais in Belo Horizonte, Brazil in collaboration with Fernando Proietti and Waleska Caiaffa as an extension of NIH.

"Methods for Evaluating the Physical and Social Environment of Urban Neighborhoods    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The purpose of this study is to design and evaluate a comprehensive, systematic approach to characterizing urban neighborhoods through direct observation of neighborhood characteristics. Public health researchers and practitioners have begun to refocus on the context in which an individual lives as an important determinant of health. Neighborhood characteristics are typically measured through participant self-report, observation (often via video), or secondary databases like the US Census. Major limitations of these approaches include the inability to monitor changes over time, costs and significant staff resources. This has limited their inclusion in more than a few studies and resulted in neighborhoods being evaluated at a single point during a study. Yet, during a multi-year study, the urban neighborhood context may significantly change as a result of seasonality, gentrification, immigration, etc. We propose to evaluate and revise a brief scale, already developed by the research team, aimed at measuring the social, physical and resource environment of urban neighborhoods through direct observation and examine the reliability and validity of the scale. To achieve these aims, we will be working within a larger multi-level parent study aimed at examining the associations between features of the urban environment and mental health, drug use, and HIV risk in 36 NYC neighborhoods that have already been ethnographically defined. We will first define an additional 15 neighborhoods in affluent and/or predominantly white neighborhoods in New York City, as our current sampling frame is overrepresented by neighborhoods with a high prevalence of economic deprivation and minorities. Next, we will use our neighborhood evaluation scale and neighborhood mapping to measure the urban environment. Each of the 51 target neighborhoods will be rated by two independent observers twice a year for 2 years, providing 4 iterations for data collection, analysis and scale revision. Reliability will be assessed via measures of inter-rater and test retest reliability and internal consistency. Problematic items will be eliminated or reworked in the next iteration. The scale will also be assessed for each type of validity. Face validity will be assessed through review by study investigators, consultants and staff. Content validity will be evaluated through internal consistency and evaluation of item values pre- and post-training. Factor analysis will be used to explore the presence and nature of factors. Criterion-related validity will be assessed by video recording and rating a sub-sample of blocks as a ""gold standard"" for the final iteration of the scale. External construct validity checks comparing the scale results for each neighborhood to key indicators from the US Census (e.g., residential segregation, income inequality) will be performed. In year 2, we will also administer the scale in 50 randomly selected Detroit neighborhoods to evaluate the scale's performance in another urban setting and assess the generalizability. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Public health researchers and practitioners have begun to refocus on the context in which as individual lives as an important determinant of health. Neighborhood characteristics are typically measured through participant   self-report, observation (often via video), or secondary databases like the US Census which are limited in their ability to monitor changes over time, are expensive and require significant staffing resources. The purpose of this study is to design and evaluate a comprehensive, systematic approach to characterizing urban neighborhoods through direct observation of neighborhood characteristics that will address these limitations.          ",Methods for Evaluating the Physical and Social Environment of Urban Neighborhoods,7472953,R21DA025343,"['Data Collection ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Purpose ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Economics ', ' Environment ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' High Prevalence ', ' Cognitive ', ' Social Health Services ', ' Update ', ' Monitor ', ' Rate ', ' Characteristics ', ' socioeconomics ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomic ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio economic ', ' Face ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Affect ', ' Standards of Weights and Measures ', ' base ', ' Gold ', ' Au element ', ' Health ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' healthcare service availability ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare access availability ', ' health services availability ', ' health care service availability ', ' health care service access ', ' health care availability ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Availability of Health Services ', ' Accessibility of health care ', ' Access to Healthcare ', ' Access to Health Care ', ' Access to Care ', ' HIV ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' Housing ', ' Area ', ' In-Migration ', ' Immigrations ', ' Income ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' residence ', ' Individual ', ' Numbers ', ' Databases ', ' data repository ', ' clinical data repository ', ' Electronic Database ', ' Electronic Databank ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Inequality ', ' Drug usage ', ' drug use ', ' Maps ', ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Methods ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' New York ', ' New York City ', ' Parents ', ' Poverty ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' instrument ', ' Nature ', ' Validity and Reliability ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Social Environment ', ' socioenvironment ', ' social context ', ' social climate ', ' Social work (field) ', ' Social Work ', ' Social Service ', ' Life ', ' statistics ', ' Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders ', ' traumatic neurosis ', ' Posttraumatic Stress Disorders ', ' Posttraumatic Neuroses ', ' Post-Traumatic Neuroses ', ' PTSD ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Transportation ', ' Urban Health ', ' Video Recording ', ' video recording system ', ' Videorecording ', ' Videotape ', ' Attention ', ' Work ', ' Automobile Driving ', ' driving ', ' Location ', ' Physical environment ', ' inner city ', ' health care service organization ', ' health care organization ', ' Performance ', ' stressor ', ' Participant ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Self-Report ', ' social ', ' AIDS/HIV problem ', ' HIV/AIDS problem ', ' HIV/AIDS ', ' AIDS/HIV ', ' Censuses ', ' Measures ', ' segregation ', ' Racial Segregation ', ' Code ', ' Coding System ', ' Factor Analysis ', ' Factor Analyses ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Sampling ', ' deprivation ', ' Cities ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Communities ', ' cost ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' racial/ethnic ', ' ']",NIDA,NEW YORK ACADEMY OF MEDICINE,R21,2008,211140,0.20496493011990272
"Neighborhoods, Women and Coronary Heart Disease: A Prospective Study    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Although research suggests that where one lives affects one's risk of coronary heart disease (CHD), scientists have only begun to explore the pathways through which neighborhoods ""get under the skin."" Recent studies demonstrate that the built environment affects individual health and health behaviors, but have not examined the relationship between the built environment and cardiovascular health risk or subsequent cardiac events. Moreover, factors influencing the development and clinical manifestations of CHD differ substantially in women and men, and studies suggest that neighborhood social and built environments also affect men and women differently. The overarching objective of the proposed project is to examine the impact of neighborhood factors on women's development of CHD. We aim to identify aspects of the built environment that can be modified through urban planning or public policy and are associated with health benefits. The project will expand on existing research by investigating both the social and built environment and by examining whether behavioral factors, social relationships, and psychological well-being mediate the links between environmental characteristics and CHD development among women. The specific aims of our 3-year project are: 1. To assess whether built and social characteristics of neighborhoods predict the development of CHD after controlling for baseline sociodemographic and biological measures of CHD risk. 2. To evaluate whether aspects of the built and social environment are associated with individual health behaviors, social support, and psychological well-being that are known to be related to CHD in women. 3. To determine whether pathways between environmental characteristics and CHD are mediated by individual health behaviors, social support, and/or psychological well-being. To address these aims this project brings together two unique resources: individual-level data from the Observational Study (OS) and Clinical Trial (CT) arms of the Women's Health Initiative (WHI), a prospective study of 161,809 women ages 50 to 79 at entry, and geocoded, census-tract level contextual data on the sociodemographic and built environment where study subjects reside derived by the RAND Center for Population Health and Health Disparities (CPHHD) data core from the Census and other sources.                       ","Neighborhoods, Women and Coronary Heart Disease: A Prospective Study",7435199,R01HL084425,"['improved ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' Health Status ', ' Level of Health ', ' Clinical ', ' Biological ', ' Age of Onset ', ' Link ', ' Incidence ', ' Income ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Libraries ', ' Individual ', ' Literature ', ' Policies ', ' Measurement ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' middle age ', ' midlife ', ' middle aged ', ' mid-life ', ' mid life ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Genetic ', ' Poverty ', ' Prospective Studies ', ' Public Policy ', ' Condition ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Social Characteristics ', ' Social Environment ', ' socioenvironment ', ' social context ', ' social climate ', ' Social support ', ' social support network ', ' Life ', ' Pollution ', ' Testing ', ' Scientist ', ' United States ', ' Well in self ', ' self wellness ', ' psychological wellness ', ' Sense of well-being ', ' Psychological Well Being ', ' Normal psyche ', ' Normal mental state ', ' Normal mental condition ', ' Mental well-being ', ' Feels well ', ' Emotional well being ', ' Woman ', ' Event ', ' Upper arm ', ' Source ', ' Pattern ', ' Elderly woman ', ' contextual factors ', ' Application Context ', ' cohort ', ' Disease Outcome ', ' Study Subject ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' circulatory system ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' Cardiovascular system (all sites) ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' social ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Censuses ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', "" Women's Health "", ' Female Health ', ' Health Benefit ', ' Mediating ', ' Modeling ', ' behavioral health ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' clinical investigation ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' Coupled ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' Coronary heart disease ', ' coronary disorder ', ' Coronary Disease ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' heart disease risk ', ' heart disorder risk ', ' cardiac disorder risk ', ' cardiac disease risk ', ' cardiovascular disorder risk ', ' cardiovascular disease risk ', ' Skin ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Environment ', ' Address ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Data ', ' Centers for Population Health ', ' Observational Study ', ' Monitor ', ' Characteristics ', ' Cardiac ', ' Exercise ', ' Physical Exercise ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Behavioral ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ']",NHLBI,RAND CORPORATION,R01,2008,804919,0.10577748930010487
"Measuring Neighborhood: Key Aspects for Multiethnic Older Adults Health Status    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This Mentored Research Scientist Development Award (K01) proposes to provide the candidate, an early-career investigator with the UCSF Resource Center for Minority Aging Research (RCMAR), further training in measurement tool development and assessment, advanced statistical methods, and qualitative research methods. The additional training would enable her to pursue a career as an independent investigator identifying key social and environmental mechanisms that create racial/ethnic and socioeconomic disparities among older adults. In the shorter term, building on prior work of the candidate, this K01 focuses on the neighborhood environment as a possible key factor influencing health and contributing to health disparities. She proposes a career development plan that consists of coursework, training, and research experiences with a mentoring team of senior faculty and external mentors with expertise in the areas of measurement development, minority aging, health disparities, qualitative research methods, and advanced statistical methods. The research program consists of three parts: secondary data analysis, qualitative research project, and creation of a new pilot neighborhood measurement tool. Part one of the research program is analysis of the Chicago Health and Aging Project (CHAP), investigating the cross- sectional and longitudinal associations of neighborhood environment with perceived health status. Neighborhood environment is assessed in CHAP by self-report, street observations, census data, and secondary data on crime and traffic. Part two of the research program is intensive semi-structured interviews of older adults who are from diverse racial/ethnic backgrounds and live in economically diverse neighborhoods. The adults will be asked about the meaning of their neighborhood, the resources they use in their neighborhoods, the challenges they confront, how they cope with difficulties, and their health status. The interview data will be analyzed for key themes. In Part three, these themes will be translated into survey items to create a pilot measurement tool for neighborhood environment. Identifying mechanisms for health disparities among older adults is a priority of the NIA five-year strategic plan. Neighborhood environments could be crucial given that as people age they may be more dependent on their immediate surroundings.          ",Measuring Neighborhood: Key Aspects for Multiethnic Older Adults Health Status,7429720,K01AG027273,"['Crime ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Low income ', ' Economics ', ' Environment ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Mentored Research Scientist Development Award ', ' Research Scientist Development Award ', ' Mentored Training Award ', ' K01 Program ', ' K01 Mechanism ', ' K01 Award ', ' Research Training ', ' Strategic Planning ', ' Rate ', ' Principal Investigator ', ' Characteristics ', ' socioeconomics ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomic ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio economic ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Faculty ', ' Fibrinogen ', ' Factor One ', ' Factor I ', ' Coagulation Factor One ', ' Coagulation Factor I ', ' Blood Factor One ', ' Blood Coagulation Factor One ', ' Blood Coagulation Factor I ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' base ', ' career ', ' Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Aging ', ' Label ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' Health Status ', ' Level of Health ', ' Homes for the Aged ', ' home for elderly ', ' Old Age Homes ', ' Home for seniors ', ' Area ', ' Income ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Institutes ', ' Interview ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Literature ', ' Policies ', ' Measurement ', ' Development Plans ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Mentors ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' tool ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Condition ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' San Francisco ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' Trees ', ' Unemployment ', ' unemployed ', ' out of work ', ' joblessness ', ' jobless ', ' Work ', ' Side ', ' Class ', ' contextual factors ', ' Application Context ', ' Services ', ' age group ', ' experience ', ' cohesion ', ' trafficking ', ' Structure ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Self-Report ', ' social ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' Censuses ', ' Measures ', ' Chicago ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Research Methodology ', ' Research Methods ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Qualitative Research ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Minority ', ' coping ', ' federal poverty level ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' racial/ethnic ', ' tool development ', ' ']",NIA,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",K01,2008,117990,0.08310058923001883
"School environments and adolescents weight status and physical activity patterns    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Child/adolescent obesity is one of the most pressing public health problems today; it disproportionately affects Hispanic and Black children/adolescents as well as those living in poverty. Lack of physical activity and poor diet are well-documented contributors to child/adolescent obesity and reflect these same disparities. Environmental contexts may provide new answers to the origins of these disparities. Though recent studies have begun to elucidate the influence of neighborhoods on child/adolescent weight and weight related behaviors, schools remain an understudied environmental context. My long-range goal is to increase understanding of the impact of schools on the health of children/adolescents and their potential contribution to racial/ethnic and/or socioeconomic disparities. Coupled with this goal is my desire to build relationships between clinicians, researchers, and policy makers so that empirical findings can be translated into effective interventions. My career development plan proposes additional training and mentorship in three areas critical to my development as an independent researcher: (1) population health sciences, including the social determinants of health (social epidemiology), demographic theory and methods, sociology (urban sociology, neighborhood influences, and social stratification), and economics; (2) advanced methods needed to analyze contextual influences on health (multi-level analysis, multi-equation models, sociometric analysis), as well as methods to address causal inference; and (3) substantive understanding of the role of macro-social forces, such as educational opportunities, on health. My research plan includes 3 aims: (1) To determine the extent to which school factors contribute to racial/ethnic differences in individual dietary intake; (2) To determine the extent to which school factors contribute to racial/ethnic and/or socioeconomic differences in individual physical activity and weight trajectories from adolescence to adulthood; and (3) To simultaneously examine the influence of school context and two other potentially influential contexts-peer networks and neighborhood environments-on physical activity and weight gain trajectories. The career development plan will provide the training necessary to support an R01 application toward the end of this proposed award period and the research proposed will lay the ground work for identifying school-based interventions that can reverse the obesity epidemic and eliminate disparities.           ",School environments and adolescents weight status and physical activity patterns,7588547,K01HD058042,"['Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Schools ', ' Sociology ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Students ', ' Translating ', ' Weight Gain ', ' wt gain ', ' body weight increase ', ' body weight gain ', ' Weight Increase ', ' Weight ', ' Work ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' Award ', ' Pattern ', ' Behavior ', ' Equation ', ' peer ', ' social ', ' Today ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child health care ', ' Child Health ', ' Hispanics ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Mediating ', ' Modeling ', ' desire ', ' theories ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' sweetened beverage ', ' Minority ', ' Population ', ' Consumption ', ' Coupled ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' racial/ethnic ', ' fruits and vegetables ', ' Diet ', ' Dietary intake ', ' Low income ', ' Economics ', ' Environment ', ' Address ', ' Epidemic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Data ', ' Health Sciences ', ' Range ', ' Stratification ', ' Characteristics ', ' socioeconomics ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomic ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio economic ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Adolescence ', ' teenage ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' Food ', ' Affect ', ' base ', ' career ', ' food resource ', ' racial/ethnic difference ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Area ', ' Adolescent ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Influentials ', ' Training ', ' Physical activity ', ' Individual ', ' Policy Maker ', ' sugar ', ' Development Plans ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methods ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Obesity ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Poverty ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' fast food ', ' convenience food ', ' ']",NICHD,BOSTON CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL,K01,2008,132300,0.048306177800623726
"Physical Frailty in Urban African-Americans    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This revised competitive renewal of ""Physical Frailty in Urban African Americans"" requests five years of funding (Y11-15) to enable additional data collection on and analysis of a representative cohort of community-dwelling African Americans living in St. Louis, known as the African American Health (AAH) project. The 998 enrolled AAH subjects were 49 to 65 years of age at baseline evaluation in 2000-2001, 463 from a very poor inner-city area and 535 from more affluent suburban conditions; 865 are alive and continue to participate. Five annual waves of high quality participation and data have already been collected by an experienced team that has made valuable contributions to the field. In the continuation, we propose to obtain telephone interviews (lasting 50 and 25 minutes, respectively) seven and eight years after baseline and a detailed in-home evaluation (120 minutes) nine years after baseline. We expand prior research themes by adding a comprehensive, innovative approach to examining contextual effects, extensive investigations of resilience, and cutting-edge analytic methods. With the combined eight waves of data over ten years, we will pursue two specific aims: (1) investigate the process of disablement in this cohort using individual-level data and (2) investigate the independent effect of adverse neighborhood conditions on the disablement process. We hypothesize that the disablement process can be viewed as an ordered progression in which the principal transitions for 25 tasks are from high functioning (HF), to subclinical status (SC; defined as no reported difficulty but change in either method or frequency of performance), from SC to difficulty (D), and from D to adverse health outcomes (e.g., falls, death). Primary analytic methods involve (a) multi-state transition models for individual tasks and (b) mixed effect models with both fixed and random intercepts and coefficients for three psychometrically-sound composite measures, examining the composite HF, SC, and D count trajectories both individually and simultaneously. For aim 2, our primary hypotheses are: (a) adverse neighborhood conditions (built environment less conducive to physical activity, lower availability of services, and increased area-level deprivation) are associated with disability outcomes, after adjusting for individual- level factors; (b) the negative effect of service availability operates at a different spatial scale than those of the built environment and deprivation; and, (c) adverse neighborhood conditions can be used to target future interventions to improve disability outcomes. Both aims examine recovery as well as deterioration and the effects of hypothesized risk (e.g., obesity) and protective (e.g., education) factors on disability outcomes. Analysis involves multilevel and novel geostatistical techniques. We have experience with all proposed assessment and analytic methods, which have adequate (> 80%) power to detect small to moderate effects for all hypotheses. Multiple secondary studies (e.g., fear of falling, life space mobility) will also be pursued.              ",Physical Frailty in Urban African-Americans,7417775,R01AG010436,"['Environment ', ' Bathing ', ' Baths ', ' Age-Years ', ' Data ', ' Cognitive ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Peak Expiratory Flow ', ' Seminal ', ' Rate ', ' Principal Investigator ', ' Process ', ' follow-up ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' Placement ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Limb structure ', ' Non-Trunk ', ' Limbs ', ' Extremities ', ' Future ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' pre-clinical ', ' preclinical ', ' Age ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Health ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' healthcare service availability ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare access availability ', ' health services availability ', ' health care service availability ', ' health care service access ', ' health care availability ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Availability of Health Services ', ' Accessibility of health care ', ' Access to Healthcare ', ' Access to Health Care ', ' Access to Care ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Left ', ' Area ', ' Phase ', ' Lifting ', ' Income ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Interview ', ' Telephone Interviews ', ' Evaluation ', ' grasp ', ' Grips ', ' Physical activity ', ' disability ', ' Lower Extremity ', ' Membrum inferius ', ' Lower Limb ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Numbers ', ' Recovery ', ' Lung ', ' pulmonary ', ' Lung Respiratory System ', ' Databases ', ' data repository ', ' clinical data repository ', ' Electronic Database ', ' Electronic Databank ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Logistics ', ' Funding ', ' Methods ', ' middle age ', ' midlife ', ' middle aged ', ' mid-life ', ' mid life ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Mortality ', ' Persons ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Nursing Homes ', ' nursing home ', ' Obesity ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Probability ', ' Exposure to ', ' Staging ', ' Psychometrics ', ' Condition ', ' Validity and Reliability ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Selection Bias ', ' Skeletal system ', ' Smoking ', ' Social support ', ' social support network ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' sound ', ' Survival Analysis ', ' Survival Analyses ', ' cognitive function ', ' Taxes ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' frailty ', ' Vision ', ' visual function ', ' Sight ', ' Investigation ', ' Work ', ' Frequencies (time pattern) ', ' Frequency ', ' Complex ', ' Event ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' Location ', ' Visit ', ' inner city ', ' complement C2a ', ' complement C2a fragment ', ' complement 2a ', ' C2a ', ' C 2a ', ' American ', ' early experience ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' Intercept ', ' cohort ', ' Books ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Population Study ', ' Reporting ', ' Count ', ' Censuses ', ' Destinations ', ' Measures ', ' multilevel analysis ', ' multilevel modeling ', ' multilevel model ', ' methods to study multiple-level influences ', ' Geographic Information Systems ', ' Caregivers ', ' Care Givers ', ' falls ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Deterioration ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Property ', ' LOINC Axis 2 Property ', ' deprivation ', ' fear of falling ', ' Adverse effects ', ' treatment adverse effect ', ' therapy adverse effect ', ' side effect ', ' Treatment Side Effects ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Communities ', ' Comorbidity ', ' co-morbidity ', ' functional decline ', ' decline in function ', ' health related quality of life ', ' Social Functioning ', ' resilience ', ' Outcome ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' service utilization ', ' Data Collection ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Dependency (Psychology) ', ' emotional dependency ', ' Dependency ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Activities of Daily Living ', ' functional capacity ', ' functional ability ', ' daily living functionality ', ' Activities of everyday life ', ' instrumental activity of daily living ', ' IADL ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' ']",NIA,INDIANA UNIV-PURDUE UNIV AT INDIANAPOLIS,R01,2008,645923,0.07721465704928879
"Development of Hierarchical Neighborhood Data Regarding Cancer in the Elderly    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): People living in different areas may differ in their health status because the residents differ in characteristics that influence health (e.g., demographic attributes, socioeconomic status, baseline morbidity) and/or because places differ in characteristics that influence the health of residents, such as neighborhood factors (e.g., local wealth, crime, residential stability) or medical service factors (e.g., physician supply, availability of specialized care). Here, we propose to assemble a data set that will allow us, in subsequent work, to examine the impact of place, defined at two different levels of spatial resolution, on cancer course in the elderly. Our first aim is to build a novel, three-level, hierarchical data set about an inception cohort of elderly Medicare beneficiaries diagnosed with cancer in 11 US regions during 1998-2002. There will be 550,000 individual patients drawn from the SEER cancer registry at level I, linked by Census tract of residence to information about their neighborhoods (N=8,790) at level II, and linked by their ZIP code to information about their health service areas (HSAs) (N=304) at level III. Sources of data include the SEER-Medicare data for level I variables, US Census data and other data for level II variables, and Dartmouth Atlas data for level III variables. Individual- level outcome variables include cancer stage at presentation, receipt of recommended anti-cancer therapies, and survival. The data set will also contain information about the hospitals at which individuals received their cancer care. Our second aim is to examine the relationships among variables measured at the two spatial levels in order to describe, for example, whether rich neighborhoods tend to be clustered in HSAs that are well endowed with medical infrastructure. Ultimately, analyses of this data set will allow us to distinguish the role of the individual (level I) from the roles of the two spatially nested geographic areas, i.e., micro neighborhood (level II) and macro health service area (level III) in determining illness course in cancer patients. Other analyses could also ultimately be done in order to evaluate the possible mediating role of the quality of hospitals used by patients in the relationship between place and individual outcomes. This work based on a national sample of cancer patients is relevant to public health since it will: help localize the level (individual versus neighborhood versus health service area) at which deficiencies in cancer care and outcomes in the elderly may arise; help explain racial and economic disparities in health outcomes; and address determinants of the course of patients' cancer, a leading cause of death.                ",Development of Hierarchical Neighborhood Data Regarding Cancer in the Elderly,7493419,R21AG030607,"['Cause of Death ', ' Censuses ', ' County ', ' Measures ', ' neoplasm registry ', ' cancer registry ', ' Code ', ' Coding System ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Mediating ', ' Small-Area Variations ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Sampling ', ' cancer therapy ', ' anticancer therapy ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Treatment ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Therapy ', ' Cancer Treatment ', ' cancer care ', ' older patient ', ' elderly patient ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' tumor ', ' Crime ', ' Data Sources ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' geographic difference ', ' geographic variation ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Purpose ', ' Economics ', ' Environment ', ' Environmental Exposure ', ' Address ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Caring ', ' Data ', ' Range ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Resolution ', ' Stage at Diagnosis ', ' Subgroup ', ' Cancer Patient ', ' Zip Code ', ' Characteristics ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' beneficiary ', ' Future ', ' Affect ', ' Geographic Locations ', ' geographic site ', ' MeSH Descriptors Class 4 ', ' Geographical Location ', ' Geographic Region ', ' Geographic Area ', ' Geography ', ' base ', ' Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' Medicare ', ' health insurance for disabled ', ' Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Disabled Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Aged and Disabled, Title 18 ', ' Health Policy ', ' healthcare policy ', ' health care policy ', ' Health Services ', ' health care service ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' healthcare service availability ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare access availability ', ' health services availability ', ' health care service availability ', ' health care service access ', ' health care availability ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Availability of Health Services ', ' Accessibility of health care ', ' Access to Healthcare ', ' Access to Health Care ', ' Access to Care ', ' Health Status ', ' Level of Health ', ' Hospitals ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' Link ', ' residence ', ' Individual ', ' Americas ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Mortality ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Diagnostic Neoplasm Staging ', ' Tumor Staging ', ' Neoplasm Staging ', ' Cancer Staging ', ' Patients ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' well-being ', ' Physicians ', ' Poverty ', ' Staging ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Social Sciences ', ' Social support ', ' social support network ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Localized ', ' Atlases ', ' Work ', ' Techniques ', ' Services ', ' experience ', ' cohort ', ' Disease Outcome ', ' novel ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' Catchment Area (Health) ', ' Health Service Area ', ' ']",NIA,HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL,R21,2008,170178,0.10054323213008519
"Exploring Micro-level Sources of Environmental Inequality    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Although a burgeoning body of literature has revealed substantial racial and ethnic differences in exposure to environmental hazards, we have very little information about the micro-level processes that shape and reinforce this environmental inequality. Certainly, there is evidence of racial biases in the process through which industrial facilities are sited. However, in the context of high residential mobility, the persistent concentration of minorities in hazardous neighborhoods necessarily reflects racially differentiated patterns of mobility between neighborhoods with varying levels of pollution. Indeed, the most common theoretical explanations for environmental inequality implicate household-level residential mobility patterns as the key mechanism through which environmental inequality is maintained. To date, however, data limitations have prevented the appropriate examination of household-level mobility patterns between neighborhoods with varying hazard levels, much less possible racial and ethnic differences therein. This dearth of information on household-level mobility processes not only leaves untested key theoretical arguments about the causes of environmental racial inequality, it also leaves open a number of questions related to the source of substantial variation in the magnitude of this inequality. This proposed study seeks to address these significant gaps in the literature by merging individual-level residential mobility data from the nationally representative Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID) with neighborhood-level demographic data from the U.S. Census and environmental hazard data derived from the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Toxics Release Inventory (TRI), Biennial Reporting System (BRS); Resource Conservation and Recovery Act Information System (RCRIS); and Risk-Screening Environmental Indicators (RSEI) project. The study will utilize a new and innovative Geographic Information Systems (GIS) technique that weights the potential impact of each hazard inversely according to geographic distance, allowing us to measure hazard proximity more precisely than has been possible in prior research, and the hazard data provide information on multiple types of environmental hazards, allowing us to compare the relative impact of different environmental hazards on residential mobility. In addition, the study will draw on the theoretical insights of neighborhood attainment research to provide a more nuanced theoretical understanding of the role residential mobility plays in the creation of environmental racial inequality. Combining these theoretical insights with more appropriate multi-level data makes it possible to address, for the first time, a number of research question that are crucial for understanding the processes that affect environmental inequality. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Recent research has found that residential proximity and exposure to environmental hazards can have a deleterious effect on physical and psychological health and perceptions of social disorder, and that perceptions of social disorder can negatively affect psychological health. Thus, in examining whether there are racial and ethnic differences in household-level mobility patterns between neighborhoods with varying levels of environmental hazard, this study will shed light on the public health implications of racially stratified mobility processes.

"The Demography of Prisoner Reentry: Residential Moves & Changing Social Contexts    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Incarceration represents an important change in the life course that can affect individuals' health and well- being, that of their families, and that of their communities. Over the last two decades, the number of individuals incarcerated in prisons and jails in the United States has risen dramatically. The large number of individuals exiting prison every year represents an important demographic phenomenon that has received relatively little attention from researchers, despite renewed interest among policy makers in integrating former prisoners back into society. Many of these ex-prisoners are returning to very disadvantaged neighborhood environments. Neighborhoods with high unemployment, poverty and crime rates are likely to have fewer resources that address the health and economic needs of returning prisoners, exert lower levels of social control over former prisoners, and present former prisoners with greater opportunities to return to substance use. Still, very little is known about where people live when they leave prison, how often they move, or which former prisoners experience ""upward"" residential mobility. Securing stable housing is one of the most important challenges for returning prisoners, yet no prior study has examined the residential mobility or living arrangements of released prisoners. The proposed research involves assembling administrative data through a unique arrangement with the Michigan Department of Corrections (MDOC) and prospectively analyzing the neighborhood contexts and living arrangements of returning parolees. This research would fill an important gap in the literatures on residential mobility, neighborhood context, and prisoner reentry, which have largely ignored the neighborhood contexts of the returning prisoner population. The specific aims are as follows: (1) To assemble, clean, geocode, and merge data from three sources on a one-third sample of parolees released from Michigan prisons in 2003: (a) prospective, spatially-referenced MDOC administrative records, (b) tract-level contextual data from both MDOC administrative records and the U.S. Census, and (c) Michigan Unemployment Insurance records. (2) To understand the social and institutional processes that sort returning parolees into different (a) neighborhood environments and (b) living arrangements (e.g., living alone, with a spouse, with other family, in a drug treatment center, or in a homeless shelter) upon their release from prison. (3) To understand the social and institutional processes that shape the residential mobility trajectories of returning parolees. The proposed project is exploratory in that it is the first to assemble and analyze a rich set of administrative records on individual parolees and to link these records with data on neighborhood context, a complex task that requires the time and expertise to code and verify information reported in parole agent case notes. It is also developmental in that it represents the first step in a larger trajectory of research examining the social conditions that affect the health and well-being of returning prisoners, a particularly vulnerable population. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Incarceration represents an important change in the life course that can affect individuals' health and well- being, that of their families, and that of their communities.

"Neighborhood Effects on Weight Change and Diabetes Risk Factors    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Diabetes is increasing at an alarming rate. Between 1980 and 2004, as obesity increased, the number of Americans with diabetes more than doubled. Individuals from minority, low-income and low education populations are disproportionately affected by diabetes (and by complication of diabetes), and these socioeconomic disparities may be growing. Health disparities are often attributed to differences in medical care or self-care, but data suggest that these individual level factors explain few of the existing disparities. Neighborhood environments are increasingly recognized as exerting influence on diet, on physical activity and on outcomes of chronic disease. The present proposal is based on the theory that the immediate neighborhood environment of a person living with diabetes may influence decisions and actions related to food procurement, weight status, diabetes self-care behaviors and cardiometabolic markers and, ultimately, on incidence of complications of diabetes. The proposed research project will assess neighborhood-level influences on health such as accessibility to supermarkets, the ratio of fast food and convenience store to supermarkets and produce vendors, and household food security, by collecting a broad range of data on participants' communities in an ongoing study of ethnic disparities in diabetes outcomes. Neighborhood- level data will be collected and linked to a vast array of detailed individual-level socio-demographic, behavioral, cardiometabolic and complications data existing on this cohort. The project's specific aims are: 1) to create a longitudinal database of neighborhood characteristics; 2) to assess the effect of the neighborhood food environement on cardiometabolic markers of risk among persons with diabetes; and, 3) to determine individual- and neighborhood-level factors on the causal pathway between the neighborhood food environment and cardiometabolic markers of risk among persons with diabetes. This study involves data collection and analysis of compositional (e.g., census), contextual (e.g., food resources), and spatially derived data (e.g., access to food resource) on health behaviors and cardiometabolic risk factors among persons with diabetes. Accomplishing the aims of this proposal will expand current understanding of the neighborhood food, physical activity and social environments that contribute to good health, and will inform further study of alternative strategies for measurement and analysis of environmental influences on health. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed study aims to assess neighborhood-level factors that are associated with weight status, diabetes self-care behaviors and cardiometabolic risk factors in a cohort of adult diabetics. We will add neighborhood data, such as neighborhood socioeconomic status, location of supermarkets, fast food restaurants, alcohol outlets, and parks, to the ongoing Kaiser Permanente Division of Research ""Distance Study"". We will model the influence of neighborhood factors on weight status, diet, physical activity, glycemic control, lipid levels and blood pressure.

"Health, Poverty and Place: Modeling Inequalities in Accra Using RS and GIS    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This project, through a detailed analysis of spatial disparities in health in Accra, Ghana, aims to provide a model for the interpretation of urban health inequalities in cities in poor countries. Using Accra in Ghana, we will generate methods that we hope will serve as templates for comparative analyses of other major cities in the developing world. The project will produce a geographical synopsis of the differentials in health and mortality within the urban area in a format immediately accessible to government and the development agencies tasked with the improvement of health overall and with the reduction of health inequalities; map the distribution of poverty (both income and wealth) in the city and assess its spatial association with selected health and mortality outcomes; using remote sensing and GIS technology, measure the association of adverse health and mortality outcomes with neighborhood ecology, including the association with spatial measures derived from observations of physical features and built structures visible from multi-spectral high spatial resolution satellite imagery; and assess the additional contribution of community-level variables including social organization and institutions to the production of inequalities in health and mortality, net of individual-level characteristics. Our research involves the following major steps: (i) apply new methods of defining urban neighborhoods across space and time using census and survey data and information from remotely sensed imagery; (2) validate data-derived neighborhood definitions, attributes, and boundaries with field assessments in a purposive sample of Accra neighborhoods; (3) assemble existing census-based, survey-based, and vital statistics-based measures of morbidity and mortality at the neighborhood level, based on the derived neighborhood definitions, as well as existing and updated imagery and geographic layers; (4) re-interview (in 2008) the respondents to the 2003 Accra Women's Health Survey to generate new measures of neighborhood-level health outcomes and changes in those outcomes; (5) employ spatial analytic, multivariate and multi-level analyses to predict the inequalities in health outcomes between and within neighborhoods of Accra; (6) develop models that build on the WHS and DHS data in combination with the imagery to predict health outcomes by neighborhood; (7) apply the modeling algorithms to two key resources-the Demographic and Health Survey and remotely sensed imagery-to predict the variability (inequality) in neighborhood level health outcomes in Accra; and (8) employ the results locally in Accra for health policy and planning purposes, and use the results from relatively data-rich Accra to develop models that can subsequently be used to estimate the spatial variability in health in data-poorer cities in sub-Saharan Africa.

"Causal Estimates of Neighborhood Poverty on Health and Mortality    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The disparities in the distribution of goods and services, and hazards and opportunities across space are increasing, underscoring the growing connection between place and health. Although ample evidence confirms that living in an economically disadvantaged neighborhood is associated with adverse health outcomes, the reliance on cross-sectional data and inadequate attention to two main sources of bias make causal inferences problematic. Residents tend to sort themselves into different types of neighborhoods based on a multitude of characteristics. Not accounting for all characteristics that are correlated to both the outcome and neighborhood context would likely lead to over-estimations of neighborhood effects. Because regression models cannot possibly account for all relevant factors, the strong possibility of unobserved heterogeneity make neighborhood effect studies open to criticisms of omitted variable bias. Yet, at the same time, neighborhood effect studies are also just as likely to be susceptible to bias due to over- adjustment. Many factors that are controlled for in neighborhood effect models, such as educational attainment, income, and employment, may arguably have been influenced by past neighborhood context. Adjusting for these factors eliminate possible critical pathways through which neighborhoods affect health, likely yielding overly conservative estimates of neighborhood effects. These two sources of bias, working in opposing directions, have plagued extant neighborhood-health research; consequently, results from current research yield tenuous and ambiguous inferences. This proposed project will use novel analytical methods and longitudinal data from an existing observational study to address the two major limitations described above and recover causal estimates of neighborhood poverty on self-rated health and mortality. We will 1) use marginal structural modeling to appropriately adjust for covariates that are simultaneously confounders as well as mediators and 2) conduct a sensitivity analysis to determine the robustness of the neighborhood effect findings to unobserved heterogeneity. Applying this combined methodology to neighborhood-health research has the potential to significantly advance our knowledge of the relationship between place and health, yielding far reaching policy implications. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Relevance Robust findings of a causal connection between residential context and health can help health policymakers judge the extent and magnitude of neighborhood impacts on health and guide public health policies. Evidence that the social and structural environment influences life-chances, and ultimately health outcomes, suggests that health policy, traditionally targeted at the individual level with little regard to neighborhood context, should consider underlying constraints or opportunities present in the residential environment in designing and implementing the most effective and efficient public health policies.                  Relevance  Robust findings of a causal connection between residential context and health can help health policymakers judge the extent and magnitude of neighborhood impacts on health and guide public health policies.

"Predoctoral Fellowships for Students with Disabilities    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There is a significant body of literature on the association between maternal depression and child behavior but considerably less evidence on the effects of neighborhood social conditions on both of these outcomes.

The proposed study will use longitudinal data from a large-scale population-based study across urban, rural and suburban areas of Los Angeles County grounded in theories of neighborhood level determinants of health, providing the opportunity to refine the theoretical tradition of collective efficacy and neighborhood disorder by testing these theories, as well as adding empirical evidence of 1) the existence and effect, if any, of neighborhood disorder on maternal depression across diverse neighborhoods in LA County, 2) whether neighborhood disorder affects childhood internalizing and externalizing behavior and 3) the reciprocal relationship of maternal depression and child behavior within the social context of the neighborhood.           ",Predoctoral Fellowships for Students with Disabilities,7673679,F31HD049314,"['Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Predoctoral Fellowship--Students with Disabilities ', ' NRSA Predoctoral Fellowship Students w/Disabilities (F31) ', ' Characteristics ', ' Family ', ' Future ', ' Affect ', ' suburb ', ' suburbia ', ' suburban ', ' Health ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' healthcare service availability ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare access availability ', ' health services availability ', ' health care service availability ', ' health care service access ', ' health care availability ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Availability of Health Services ', ' Accessibility of health care ', ' Access to Healthcare ', ' Access to Health Care ', ' Access to Care ', ' Area ', ' Childhood ', ' pediatric ', ' Individual ', ' Literature ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' Los Angeles ', ' Rural ', ' Policy Maker ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Mothers ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Parents ', ' Poverty ', ' Psychophysiology ', ' psychophysical ', ' psycho-physiological ', ' physiopsychology ', ' Psychophysiological ', ' Physiological Psychology ', ' Physiologic Psychology ', ' Research ', ' Research Design ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Proposals ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Schools ', ' Single-Parent Family ', ' Social Conditions ', ' Societal Conditions ', ' Social Environment ', ' socioenvironment ', ' social context ', ' social climate ', ' programs ', ' Testing ', ' Attention ', ' Violence ', ' violent behavior ', ' violent ', ' Work ', ' Frequencies (time pattern) ', ' Frequency ', ' Behavior ', ' metropolitan ', ' Prevention Research ', ' Prevention program ', ' social inequality ', ' County ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Behavior ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' theories ', ' Cities ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' externalizing behavior ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' maternal depression ', ' depressed mother ', ' population based ', ' ']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,F31,2009,7764,0.14683912817266878
"Exploring Micro-level Sources of Environmental Inequality    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Although a burgeoning body of literature has revealed substantial racial and ethnic differences in exposure to environmental hazards, we have very little information about the micro-level processes that shape and reinforce this environmental inequality. Certainly, there is evidence of racial biases in the process through which industrial facilities are sited. However, in the context of high residential mobility, the persistent concentration of minorities in hazardous neighborhoods necessarily reflects racially differentiated patterns of mobility between neighborhoods with varying levels of pollution. Indeed, the most common theoretical explanations for environmental inequality implicate household-level residential mobility patterns as the key mechanism through which environmental inequality is maintained. To date, however, data limitations have prevented the appropriate examination of household-level mobility patterns between neighborhoods with varying hazard levels, much less possible racial and ethnic differences therein. This dearth of information on household-level mobility processes not only leaves untested key theoretical arguments about the causes of environmental racial inequality, it also leaves open a number of questions related to the source of substantial variation in the magnitude of this inequality. This proposed study seeks to address these significant gaps in the literature by merging individual-level residential mobility data from the nationally representative Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID) with neighborhood-level demographic data from the U.S. Census and environmental hazard data derived from the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Toxics Release Inventory (TRI), Biennial Reporting System (BRS); Resource Conservation and Recovery Act Information System (RCRIS); and Risk-Screening Environmental Indicators (RSEI) project. The study will utilize a new and innovative Geographic Information Systems (GIS) technique that weights the potential impact of each hazard inversely according to geographic distance, allowing us to measure hazard proximity more precisely than has been possible in prior research, and the hazard data provide information on multiple types of environmental hazards, allowing us to compare the relative impact of different environmental hazards on residential mobility. In addition, the study will draw on the theoretical insights of neighborhood attainment research to provide a more nuanced theoretical understanding of the role residential mobility plays in the creation of environmental racial inequality. Combining these theoretical insights with more appropriate multi-level data makes it possible to address, for the first time, a number of research question that are crucial for understanding the processes that affect environmental inequality. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Recent research has found that residential proximity and exposure to environmental hazards can have a deleterious effect on physical and psychological health and perceptions of social disorder, and that perceptions of social disorder can negatively affect psychological health. Thus, in examining whether there are racial and ethnic differences in household-level mobility patterns between neighborhoods with varying levels of environmental hazard, this study will shed light on the public health implications of racially stratified mobility processes. It will also inform research on racial and ethnic health disparities in the United States.             ",Exploring Micro-level Sources of Environmental Inequality,7666887,R21HD058708,"['Data Sources ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Address ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Data ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' socioeconomics ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomic ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio economic ', ' Family ', ' Future ', ' Affect ', ' base ', ' racial/ethnic difference ', ' Household ', ' Housing ', ' Left ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Income ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Information Systems ', ' Information Technology Systems ', ' IT Systems ', ' Data Systems ', ' insight ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Individual ', ' Recovery ', ' Literature ', ' Inequality ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Respondent ', ' Occupations ', ' Professional Postions ', ' Jobs ', ' Perceptual Disorders ', ' perception disorder ', ' Play ', ' Exposure to ', ' Shapes ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Research ', ' Research Design ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Residential Mobility ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Social Perception ', ' Consensus ', ' programs ', ' Pollution ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' United States Environmental Protection Agency ', ' Environmental Protection Agency ', ' Weight ', ' Dimensions ', ' Reaction ', ' Source ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' Behavior ', ' contextual factors ', ' Application Context ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' hazard ', ' metropolitan ', ' research study ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' racial difference ', ' race differences ', ' ethnic difference ', ' Reporting ', ' Censuses ', ' Destinations ', ' Environmental Hazards ', ' Measures ', ' Relative (related person) ', ' Relative ', ' Geographic Information Systems ', ' Modeling ', ' Cities ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' racial/ethnic ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' public health relevance ', ' Toxics Release Inventory ', ' ']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO,R21,2009,181699,0.08863282030227504
"Neighborhood and Mammography: A multilevel approach to cancer screening behavior    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The underlying mechanisms for the persistent racial/ethnic and socioeconomic disparities in breast cancer mortality rates observed in the US are poorly understood. While many factors have been shown to influence these disparities, diagnosis at later stage of disease among African-Americans and women of low socioeconomic status (SES) continues to be a concern. Thus, the role of mammography screening, as delivered in the US health care system, has been an area of interest in explaining excess breast cancer deaths observed for African-American and low-SES women. While some studies show that African- American women are screened as often as White women, others have shown that African-American are less likely to receive adequate mammography services. Data have consistently shown that women with lower income, lower education levels, and no usual source of care are less likely to engage in repeat mammography screening. There is also evidence to show that SES exerts an impact on cancer screening at an ecologic level (e.g. county poverty levels). In addition to neighborhood socioeconomic conditions and resources, racial residential segregation has been shown to influence health outcomes. Yet to our knowledge, racial residential segregation has received little attention in terms of its effect on cancer prevention behavior. While administrative census data can yield insight into contextual neighborhood effects, the development and use of measures that extend beyond census data are necessary in order to identify mechanisms that can be identified for effective intervention efforts. Using a multilevel conceptual framework, I propose to: 1) Examine the influence of neighborhood factors (census tract level) and racial residential segregation on repeat mammography in a national sample; 2) Conduct key informant interviews and focus groups to determine neighborhood factors of concern to women; 3) Collect pilot data on neighborhood conditions in Jacksonville, FL; 4) Develop a grant proposal for independent funding to conduct a study on neighborhood and mammography screening behavior. This proposal specifically addresses neighborhood level influences on cancer prevention behavior with the ultimate goal of offering insight into the multilevel mechanisms that can lead to effective neighborhood level interventions in the area of cancer control and prevention.           ",Neighborhood and Mammography: A multilevel approach to cancer screening behavior,7666718,K01DP001121,[''],NCCDPHP,UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA,K01,2009,148118,0.11815114973895757
"Work, Neighborhood, Commuting, and Occupational Health Disparities    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Efforts to identify and eliminate occupational health disparities require an understanding of the broader social and environmental context in which workers live their lives. New conceptual frameworks and research recognize that, not only do workers experience the physical and social hazards of their jobs, but their susceptibility or resilience to workplace experiences with regard to health is further shaped by their social and environmental context beyond work, including at home, and also by their commuting experience. Accordingly, we propose to use the previously validated methodology of geocoding and linkage of individual subjects to the area- based socioeconomic characteristics of their neighborhoods of residence to greatly enhance the available information on the social and environmental context of the workers in the United for Health (UFH) study. Specifically, we further enrich the UFH's already substantial data on workplace physical and social hazards and health outcomes with data on the workers' neighborhood, the workplace neighborhood, and the workers' commute time, as follows: Specific Aim A.1. Geocode workers' residential and workplace addresses in the United for Health study cohort, in order to (a) append residential and workplace US census-derived area-based socioeconomic measures (ABSMs) and (b) calculate the commute travel distance and travel time between the workers' home and worksite. Specific Aim A.2. Assess the extent to which individual socioeconomic position, residential and workplace ABSMs, and commute distance are associated with the following selected health outcomes, overall and in relation to race/ethnicity and gender:(a) fair or poor self-rated health; (b) smoking; (c) elevated blood pressure; and (d) increased respiratory symptoms. Specific Aim A.3. Assess the role of residential and workplace ABSMs and commute distance as modifiers of established associations between the selected health outcomes and workplace physical hazards (noise, dust/gases and chemical fumes, and ergonomic strain) and social hazards (workplace abuse, racial discrimination, sexual harassment, and job strain). By addressing these aims, this project will yield new information that can encourage and inform collaboration among occupational health and environmental health practitioners, regulators, and advocates, urban planners, community based groups, and worker organizations, including unions, about ways to create healthier communities and jobs.       This project explores how the social and environmental context of workers' residential and workplace neighborhoods, including commuting time and distance, impacts their health. In particular, we focus on interactions between individual and neighborhood socioeconomic position as modifiers of susceptibility to workplace physical and social hazards.          ","Work, Neighborhood, Commuting, and Occupational Health Disparities",7675334,R03OH009338,[''],NIOSH,HARVARD SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH,R03,2009,81500,0.03155050839605096
"Neighborhoods and Cardiovascular Risk in a Multiethnic Cohort    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There has been much recent interest in how features of residential environments (the built environment as well as social features of neighborhoods) affect the prevalence and development of cardiovascular disease and its risk factors, including obesity, diabetes, and hypertension. Identifying modifiable features of neighborhoods that contribute to cardiovascular risk would have important implications for the development of interventions and strategies to prevent cardiovascular disease and reduce social inequalities and race/ethnic differences in cardiovascular risk. Although randomized trials and/or evaluation of quasi experiments or natural experiments will ultimately be needed to determine the effectiveness of specific neighborhood-level interventions, rigorous observational work is still needed to determine what the most promising areas for intervention may be. However, very few observational studies have the type of detailed neighborhood and individual-level data necessary for this work. This competing renewal application builds on prior work conducted under R01 HL071759. As part of the prior project cycle we created a unique and rich dataset with a multiplicity of rigorous objective and survey-based measures of residential environments linked to the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA), a state-of-the art, longitudinal, population-based, multi-site and multi-ethnic epidemiologic study of cardiovascular disease. In this renewal we propose to enhance and update the neighborhood-level environmental measures to allow for methodologically rigorous longitudinal analyses that build on key findings of cross-sectional analyses conducted as part of the prior cycle. The Specific Aims of the project are: (1) To examine associations of specific neighborhood characteristics (including measures of access to healthy foods, walkability and urban design, access to recreational resources, and neighborhood stressors) with changes in diet, physical activity, and body weight over time; (2) To examine associations of neighborhood characteristics with incident diabetes and hypertension as well as with changes over time in continuous measures of insulin resistance and blood pressure (3) To examine associations of neighborhood characteristics with incident fatal and non fatal cardiovascular events; and (4)To investigate the contribution of neighborhood environments to race/ethnic and socioeconomic differences in longitudinal changes in risk factors and incident disease. In addition, the creation and maintenance of a rich data set on environmental features for MESA participants over time will generate a unique resource to be used in gene-environment interaction studies as MESA genotyping proceeds. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: If features of neighborhoods are shown to be important in the development of cardiovascular disease and its risk factors, strategies to prevent cardiovascular disease may need to focus on environments as well as individuals. Identifying the specific neighborhood features that are most important is key to the development and future testing of these interventions.              Relevance If features of neighborhoods are shown to be important in the development of cardiovascular disease and its risk factors, strategies to prevent cardiovascular disease may need to focus on environments as well as individuals.

"Neighborhood Environments and Disparities in Obesity Rates in New York City    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project will determine whether racial/ethnic and socioeconomic disparities in the prevalence of obesity, sedentary lifestyles and poor diet in New York City are explained by disparities in neighborhood resources that support physical activity (e.g. gyms, parks, pleasant walking environments) and healthy diets (e.g. grocery stores, fruit markets, healthy food restaurants) across neighborhoods in New York. Obesity, sedentary lifestyles, and poor diets are major risk factors for the development of type 2 Diabetes and in New York City these risk factors are far more common among African Americans, Hispanics and those of lower socio-economic status. Prior research in New York City shows that neighborhood characteristics such as urban design features and neighborhood socioeconomic status predict body mass index (BMI). Furthermore, the availability of grocery stores, fruit markets, fast food restaurants, gyms and health clubs, vary by neighborhood in New York City, with minority and poorer neighborhoods having fewer positive resources. The proposed research is a collaboration between Columbia University and the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (NYCDOHMH). Interview data on demographic characteristics, physical activity, consumption of fruits and vegetables and height and weight (used to calculate BMI) from ~45,000 New Yorkers will be combined with a geographic information system (GIS) based model of the characteristics of New York City neighborhoods. The interview data and zip code of residence were collected as part of five annual citywide random digit dial interviews conducted by NYCDOHMH that occurred from 2002 to 2006, and the sample is representative of the city and its neighborhoods. The GIS model is being built as part of ongoing research on neighborhood effects and is the most comprehensive model of neighborhood resources in New York City built to date. The NYCDOHMH will contribute additional data on restaurant locations from the food service licensing database, locations of pedestrian injuries from automobiles, and neighborhood social capital from their neighborhood surveys. Neighborhoods will be defined using zip codes, and prior research has shown that variation in built and social environment variables at this level are strongly predictive of BMI. Multilevel models will be used to determine the extent to which neighborhood characteristics account for racial/ethnic and socioeconomic disparities in BMI, physical activity and consumption of fruits and vegetables across zip codes in New York City. In addition to analyzing the effects of race/ethnicity and socio-economic status the analyses will control for age, gender and U.S. or foreign born status, and the socio-demographic characteristics of the zip code of residence. This research will contribute to NIDDK's goal of understanding the underlying causes of disparities in the distribution of known risk factors for type 2 diabetes. Furthermore, the analyses will be used to guide New York City's ongoing long term planning process for using urban design to promote public health.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project will determine whether racial/ethnic and socioeconomic disparities in the prevalence of obesity, sedentary lifestyles and poor diet in New York City are explained by disparities in home neighborhood resources that support physical activity (e.g. gyms, parks, pleasant walking environments) and healthy diets (e.g. grocery stores, fruit markets, healthy food restaurants) across neighborhoods in New York.              This project will determine whether racial/ethnic and socioeconomic disparities in the prevalence of obesity, sedentary lifestyles and poor diet in New York City are explained by disparities in home neighborhood resources that support physical activity (e.g. gyms, parks, pleasant walking environments) and healthy diets (e.g. grocery stores, fruit markets, healthy food restaurants) across neighborhoods in New York.",Neighborhood Environments and Disparities in Obesity Rates in New York City,7652561,R01DK079885,"['Crime ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' type II DM ', ' type 2 DM ', ' maturity onset diabetes ', ' ketosis resistant diabetes ', ' adult onset diabetes ', ' Type II diabetes ', ' Type II Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Type 2 diabetes ', ' Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus ', ' T2DM ', ' T2D ', ' T2 DM ', ' Stable Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Slow-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Noninsulin Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Non-Insulin Dependent Diabetes ', ' NIDDM ', ' Maturity-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' MODY ', ' Ketosis-Resistant Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Adult-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Diet ', ' Body mass index ', ' Quetelet index ', ' BMI z-score ', ' BMI percentile ', ' low socioeconomic status ', ' low socioeconomic position ', ' low socio-economic status ', ' low socio-economic position ', ' Low income ', ' Economics ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Environment ', ' Address ', ' Esthetics ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' social capital ', ' Data ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' Community Health ', ' socioeconomics ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomic ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio economic ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Food ', ' Food Services ', ' Fruit ', ' dietary fruit ', ' Age ', ' base ', ' density ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health Surveys ', ' National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences ', ' NIEHS ', ' sedentary ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Series ', ' Incidence ', ' Income ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Interview ', ' Physical activity ', ' farmer ', ' Life Style ', ' Lifestyle ', ' residence ', ' Individual ', ' Literature ', ' Living Wills ', ' living will ', ' Databases ', ' data repository ', ' clinical data repository ', ' Electronic Database ', ' Electronic Databank ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Licensing ', ' Funding ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Marketing ', ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Morbidity -

"UNDERSTANDING NEIGHBORHOOD IMPACTS OF HEALTH Neighborhoods impact a host of health outcomes, including infant mortality, the development of asthma and heart disease and life expectancy, independent of personal characteristics. The pathways through which neighborhoods 'get under the skin', are only partly understood. This center will study neighborhood influences on health, focusing on those characteristics of neighborhoods that are potentially amenable to change through changes in public policy. The Center has the following goals: 1) To conduct research to explain how neighborhoods contribute to health throughout the life cycle, including through biological pathways and health behaviors 2) To develop a rich data resource that can be used to advance the understanding of how neighborhoods influence health, and the biological pathways through which such influences work. 3) To develop robust community-based participatory research (CBPR) partnerships within each of the 3 cities in which RAND is located, involving both community-based organizations and academic institutions. 4) To develop and foster a community of interdisciplinary researchers (including social and basic scientists) focused on the social determinants of health, specifically the role of neighborhoods in health. 5) To contribute to improving public policies that can improve population health through a set of policy recommendations that are developed from the results of the Center's research. The Center, which places a high priority on community-based participatory research, will be composed of 4 projects, 2 pilots, and 2 cores. Projects span 3 levels of analysis: biological, social/environmental, and behavioral/psychological. Project 1 will examine the impact of a large natural experiment involving the development and renovation of recreational facilities on physical activity and other health outcomes. Project 2 will study neighborhood factors that impact the functional and cognitive aspects of the disabling process in the elderly. Project 3 examines the relationships between neighborhoods and biological markers of allostatic load. Project 4 studies the impact of the built environment on mental health. An administrative core will support the entire project.

"Neighborhood and Family Effects on Disparities in Chronic Disease    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There is increasing evidence that the social and physical environments in which individuals live may play a key role in health disparities by race/ethnicity and socioeconomic status. The goal of this study is to significantly advance our knowledge about the role of specific family and neighborhood characteristics for disparities in the emergence of chronic disease and its precursors during childhood and adolescence. This project is based on the Los Angeles Family and Neighborhood Survey (L.A.FANS), a longitudinal study of neighborhoods, families, adults, and children in Los Angeles County. The first wave (L.A.FANS-1), completed in January 2002, interviewed adults and children living in 3,090 households in a stratified probability sample of 65 neighborhoods throughout Los Angeles County. The second wave (L.A.FANS-2) is in the field and will be completed in 2008. This project will use these data to analyze the effects of specific family and neighborhood characteristics on asthma, obesity, glucose metabolism, hypertension, and metabolic syndrome. These conditions are increasing in prevalence and importance among the population and represent a major component of overall health disparities by race/ethnicity and socioeconomic status. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This study will test hypotheses about the effects of family and neighborhood characteristics on disparities in chronic disease among children using new data from a longitudinal survey of health in Los Angeles County.

"North Lawndale Diabetes Community Action Project     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The North Lawndale Diabetes Community Action Project addresses Challenge Area Comparative Effectiveness Research and the specific Challenge Topic 05-MD-102 Prevention of Chronic Diseases in Disparity Populations. The Sinai Urban Health Institute, Sinai Health Systems, Rush University Medical Center and a community based organization (Family Focus North Lawndale) are proposing to develop and deliver a multi- level community intervention using a media campaign, community engagement, and individual self- management training by ""Diabetes Block Captains (DBC)"" in a very poor African American community on the west side of Chicago. Neighborhood residents working as DBCs will conduct household screenings for diabetes and then will engage their neighbors in activities that promote diabetes self-management. This Community Based Participatory Research (CBPR) approach seeks to support residents in changing the culture within the target community, to make diabetes a neighborhood priority, and to address the cultural and social environment to support healthier lifestyles. This is a collaborative research approach, drawing on the strengths of several partners and incorporating full and meaningful participation by the community. Our goal is to survey 2,500 persons in the neighborhood identifying persons with both confirmed diabetes status and those at high risk for the chronic disease over a 12-week recruitment period, with the intention of completing an entire 12-month intervention with 280 enrolled participants. DBCs will make 4 home visits over the course of the intervention, during which they will develop comprehensive action plans to improve diabetes self-management. Our primary aim is to determine whether a multi-level community intervention, featuring an educational campaign, community engagement, and individual self-management training by a ""Diabetes Block Captain"" will result in a mean reduction of HbA1c greater than 0.5 among persons with type 2 diabetes mellitus living in a medically underserved urban neighborhood. Our 2 secondary goals are to a) demonstrate the cost-effectiveness of a multi-level community intervention resulting from significant improvements in rates of diabetes self-management behaviors among persons with type 2 diabetes mellitus; and b) determine whether this multi-level community intervention can improve early detection of diabetes in a medically underserved urban neighborhood by increasing the number of persons diagnosed by at least 25 percent over a one-year period. Evaluation activities will focus on documenting the process of the intervention and the associated outcomes (effectiveness). Outcomes will be evaluated using a treatment-only quasi-experimental design in which the primary aim will be evaluated by a within-subject comparison of HbA1C, a marker of blood glucose control and demonstrated predictor of diabetes complications and mortality, between baseline and 2 follow-up testing periods. Self-management will be documented by use of the Summary of Diabetes Self-Care Activities measure (SDSCA), a validated instrument assessing general diet, specific diet, exercise, blood-glucose testing, foot care, and smoking behaviors. It will be administered at baseline and 1-yr anniversary follow-up. Poor self-management behaviors often lead to increased numbers of diabetes related hospitalizations and emergency room visits. We will assess whether the intervention has helped reduce costs associated with these chronic disease experiences. Monitoring of the process is particularly important as it will allow for an assessment of the intervention's translatability, documenting the successes and challenges of implementing the program within the target community, and paving the way for the translation of the initiative to other populations. Qualitative methods will supplement quantitative data collection in better documenting issues related to translatability, assessing both community strengths which facilitate implementation and challenges that impede upon it, and the process of addressing any barriers. The study has more than adequate power to detect effect sizes that are clinically meaningful. Substantial attention will be paid to matters of fidelity, uptake and other issues that will influence translatability. The project seeks to maximize the resources which will remain in the community at the end of the study. This includes the continued development of expertise in solving other health problems of the community. The public health relevance is that through this collaborative approach and implementation of an evidence-based intervention it is believed that the North Lawndale Community Action Project will significantly influence diabetes health disparities, ultimately helping to improve health equity. It is estimated that the direct medical care costs per person per year with diabetes is 2.3 times higher than for the person without diabetes. This Community Based Participatory Research (CBPR) approach seeks to support residents in changing the culture within the target community, to make diabetes a neighborhood priority, and to address the cultural and social environment to support healthier lifestyles.

"Social and Neighborhood Predictors of Obesity in Belo Horizonte    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Obesity has emerged as a major and growing public health problem in Latin America, and specifically in Brazil. Social and physical environments have been hypothesized to be major determinants of obesity but their contribution to obesity in developing countries has been infrequently examined. This project will establish a collaboration between the Federal University of Minas Gerais and the Center for Social Epidemiology and Population Health of the University of Michigan to investigate the role of socioeconomic and neighborhood factors in shaping the distribution of obesity and the related behaviors of diet and physical activity in Belo Horizonte, a large city in Brazil. Using data from a large population-based survey of Belo Horizonte we will (1) examine socioeconomic predictors of obesity, diet, and physical activity (2) test and examine the measurement properties of instruments to measure neighborhood physical and social environments potentially related to cardiovascular risk in the context of a large Latin American; (3) use these instruments to examine associations between neighborhood environments and obesity, diet and physical activity (4) investigate the contribution of these neighborhood factors to the socioeconomic patterning of cardiovascular risk factors in Belo Horizonte. This research will be done primarily at the School of Medicine of the Federal University of Minas Gerais in Belo Horizonte, Brazil in collaboration with Fernando Proietti and Waleska Caiaffa as an extension of NIH. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Obesity has emerged as major health problem in Latin America. Although social and physical environments (including features of the neighborhoods where people live) have been hypothesized to contribute to obesity these factors remain understudied especially in countries of Latin America.

"School environments and adolescents weight status and physical activity patterns    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Child/adolescent obesity is one of the most pressing public health problems today; it disproportionately affects Hispanic and Black children/adolescents as well as those living in poverty. Lack of physical activity and poor diet are well-documented contributors to child/adolescent obesity and reflect these same disparities. Environmental contexts may provide new answers to the origins of these disparities. Though recent studies have begun to elucidate the influence of neighborhoods on child/adolescent weight and weight related behaviors, schools remain an understudied environmental context. My long-range goal is to increase understanding of the impact of schools on the health of children/adolescents and their potential contribution to racial/ethnic and/or socioeconomic disparities. Coupled with this goal is my desire to build relationships between clinicians, researchers, and policy makers so that empirical findings can be translated into effective interventions. My career development plan proposes additional training and mentorship in three areas critical to my development as an independent researcher: (1) population health sciences, including the social determinants of health (social epidemiology), demographic theory and methods, sociology (urban sociology, neighborhood influences, and social stratification), and economics; (2) advanced methods needed to analyze contextual influences on health (multi-level analysis, multi-equation models, sociometric analysis), as well as methods to address causal inference; and (3) substantive understanding of the role of macro-social forces, such as educational opportunities, on health. My research plan includes 3 aims: (1) To determine the extent to which school factors contribute to racial/ethnic differences in individual dietary intake; (2) To determine the extent to which school factors contribute to racial/ethnic and/or socioeconomic differences in individual physical activity and weight trajectories from adolescence to adulthood; and (3) To simultaneously examine the influence of school context and two other potentially influential contexts-peer networks and neighborhood environments-on physical activity and weight gain trajectories. The career development plan will provide the training necessary to support an R01 application toward the end of this proposed award period and the research proposed will lay the ground work for identifying school-based interventions that can reverse the obesity epidemic and eliminate disparities.           ",School environments and adolescents weight status and physical activity patterns,7694972,K01HD058042,"['Consumption ', ' Coupled ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' racial/ethnic ', ' fruits and vegetables ', ' effective intervention ', ' population health ', ' social health determinants ', ' Diet ', ' Dietary intake ', ' Low income ', ' Economics ', ' Environment ', ' Address ', ' Epidemic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Data ', ' Health Sciences ', ' Stratification ', ' Characteristics ', ' socioeconomics ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomic ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio economic ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Adolescence ', ' teenage ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' Food ', ' Affect ', ' base ', ' food resource ', ' racial/ethnic difference ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Area ', ' Adolescent ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Influentials ', ' Training ', ' Physical activity ', ' Individual ', ' Policy Maker ', ' sugar ', ' Development Plans ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methods ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Obesity ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Poverty ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' fast food ', ' convenience food ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Schools ', ' Sociology ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Students ', ' Translating ', ' Weight Gain ', ' wt gain ', ' body weight increase ', ' body weight gain ', ' Weight Increase ', ' Weight ', ' Work ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' Award ', ' Pattern ', ' Behavior ', ' Equation ', ' peer ', ' social ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child health care ', ' Child Health ', ' Hispanics ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Mediating ', ' Modeling ', ' career development ', ' theories ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' sweetened beverage ', ' Minority ', ' ']",NICHD,BOSTON CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL,K01,2009,125820,0.048306177800623726
"Spatial Patterns of Social Isolation, Youthful Marijuana Use, and Sexual/HIV Risk    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The proposed study has two overarching aims: (1) to advance theory on the spatial dynamics of neighborhood exposure for understanding youthful health risk behavior; and (2) to model adolescent participation in high risk marijuana use (early onset and high frequency use) and co-morbid sexual/HIV risk behavior employing state- of-the-art GIS-derived measures of urban space and time use patterns, and recently developed hierarchical Bayesian models for multilevel and spatial data. Central to our analysis of the impact of neighborhood exposure is theoretically defining and empirically exploring the concept of social isolation as evident in space- time activity patterns at both the individual and neighborhood levels, and exploring the implications of this concept for youthful drug use and co-morbid HIV risk behavior. Social isolation represents the extent and character of connections between a focal individual or neighborhood and other communities. Individuals are potentially linked to a wide range of communities through regular activities such work, school, child care, health care, informal socializing, and religious activities. These patterns of non-residential community exposure will vary across individuals and, in the aggregate, across communities in ways that may be important for understanding variation and disparities (by gender, race-ethnicity, and immigrant status) among adolescents in the onset and frequency of using marijuana, and the extent to which youth engage in risky sexual activity. To address these questions, we use data from the Los Angeles Family and Neighborhood Survey (L.A. FANS) along with census data for the neighborhoods in which youth and their families reside as well as travel to through the course of their day. L.A. FANS includes information for a diverse sample of youth, their families, and neighborhoods within 65 randomly selected census tracts in Los Angeles County. The analyses focus on all persons in the sample between the ages of 12 and 17. Our analytic strategy relies on geospatial measurement techniques, geovisualization, and hierarchical Bayesian models for multilevel and spatial data to explore key hypotheses. Findings from the study have the potential to broaden understanding of the role of context in organizing problematic youthful marijuana use and co-morbid sexual/HIV risk behavior, the consequences of which may ramify throughout, or truncate, the life course. The proposed research will contribute to a better understanding of how the different neighborhood environments that youth and their families move through during the course of their daily lives affect high risk marijuana use and risky sexual activity among adolescents. These activities are of concern for public health because they put youth at risk for physical and mental health problems in the current stage of their lives and into the future. Findings from the research may suggest the extent to which interventions to address adolescent health risks should target neighborhoods that are the most isolated from contact with other areas, and whether such interventions would be more influential for some youth than others (girls versus boys, youth of color versus whites, immigrants versus non-immigrants).          ","Spatial Patterns of Social Isolation, Youthful Marijuana Use, and Sexual/HIV Risk",7506632,R01DA025415,"['Affect ', ' Geography ', ' Age ', ' base ', ' early onset ', ' Health ', ' HIV ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Man (Taxonomy) ', ' Area ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Adolescent ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Link ', ' Influentials ', ' Failure (biologic function) ', ' failure ', ' FLR ', ' Life Cycle Stages ', ' life course ', ' Life Cycle ', ' residence ', ' Individual ', ' Literature ', ' Los Angeles ', ' Measurement ', ' Drug usage ', ' drug use ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Marihuana ', ' marijuana ', ' Marijuana Smoking ', ' marijuana use ', ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Method LOINC Axis 6 ', ' Persons ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Immigrant ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' well-being ', ' Exposure to ', ' Staging ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Research ', ' Residence Characteristics ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Schools ', ' Sex Behavior ', ' sex activity ', ' Sexual Behavior ', ' Sexual Activity ', ' Social Environment ', ' socioenvironment ', ' social context ', ' social climate ', ' Social Interaction ', ' Social isolation ', ' Life ', ' Arts ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Time ', ' Travel ', ' Attention ', ' Attitude ', ' Work ', ' Frequencies (time pattern) ', ' Frequency ', ' Complex ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' Behavior ', ' experience ', ' Structure ', ' Participant ', ' Religion and Spirituality ', ' religious ', ' social ', ' Censuses ', ' County ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', ' Child Care ', ' Puericulture ', ' multilevel analysis ', ' multilevel modeling ', ' multilevel model ', ' methods to study multiple-level influences ', ' Geographic Information Systems ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Latino ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' boys ', ' girls ', ' Youth ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' theories ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Accounting ', ' Color ', ' Communities ', ' sex risk ', ' sexual risk behavior ', ' neglect ', ' time use ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' Adolescent Risk Behavior ', ' Youth Risk Behavior ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' protective effect ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' high risk ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Environment ', ' Address ', ' social capital ', ' Data ', ' Characteristics ', ' sex ', ' socioeconomics ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomic ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio economic ', ' Family ', ' Female ', ' Male Adolescents ', ' adolescent boy ', ' Future ', ' ']",NIDA,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2009,348334,0.06017282366234667
"Neighborhoods and Cardiovascular Risk in a Multiethnic Cohort    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There has been much recent interest in how features of residential environments (the built environment as well as social features of neighborhoods) affect the prevalence and development of cardiovascular disease and its risk factors, including obesity, diabetes, and hypertension. Identifying modifiable features of neighborhoods that contribute to cardiovascular risk would have important implications for the development of interventions and strategies to prevent cardiovascular disease and reduce social inequalities and race/ethnic differences in cardiovascular risk. Although randomized trials and/or evaluation of quasi experiments or natural experiments will ultimately be needed to determine the effectiveness of specific neighborhood-level interventions, rigorous observational work is still needed to determine what the most promising areas for intervention may be. However, very few observational studies have the type of detailed neighborhood and individual-level data necessary for this work. This competing renewal application builds on prior work conducted under R01 HL071759. As part of the prior project cycle we created a unique and rich dataset with a multiplicity of rigorous objective and survey-based measures of residential environments linked to the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA), a state-of-the art, longitudinal, population-based, multi-site and multi-ethnic epidemiologic study of cardiovascular disease. In this renewal we propose to enhance and update the neighborhood-level environmental measures to allow for methodologically rigorous longitudinal analyses that build on key findings of cross-sectional analyses conducted as part of the prior cycle. The Specific Aims of the project are: (1) To examine associations of specific neighborhood characteristics (including measures of access to healthy foods, walkability and urban design, access to recreational resources, and neighborhood stressors) with changes in diet, physical activity, and body weight over time; (2) To examine associations of neighborhood characteristics with incident diabetes and hypertension as well as with changes over time in continuous measures of insulin resistance and blood pressure (3) To examine associations of neighborhood characteristics with incident fatal and non fatal cardiovascular events; and (4)To investigate the contribution of neighborhood environments to race/ethnic and socioeconomic differences in longitudinal changes in risk factors and incident disease. In addition, the creation and maintenance of a rich data set on environmental features for MESA participants over time will generate a unique resource to be used in gene-environment interaction studies as MESA genotyping proceeds. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: If features of neighborhoods are shown to be important in the development of cardiovascular disease and its risk factors, strategies to prevent cardiovascular disease may need to focus on environments as well as individuals.

"Neighborhoods, Women and Coronary Heart Disease: A Prospective Study    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Although research suggests that where one lives affects one's risk of coronary heart disease (CHD), scientists have only begun to explore the pathways through which neighborhoods ""get under the skin."" Recent studies demonstrate that the built environment affects individual health and health behaviors, but have not examined the relationship between the built environment and cardiovascular health risk or subsequent cardiac events. Moreover, factors influencing the development and clinical manifestations of CHD differ substantially in women and men, and studies suggest that neighborhood social and built environments also affect men and women differently. The overarching objective of the proposed project is to examine the impact of neighborhood factors on women's development of CHD. We aim to identify aspects of the built environment that can be modified through urban planning or public policy and are associated with health benefits. The project will expand on existing research by investigating both the social and built environment and by examining whether behavioral factors, social relationships, and psychological well-being mediate the links between environmental characteristics and CHD development among women. The specific aims of our 3-year project are: 1. To assess whether built and social characteristics of neighborhoods predict the development of CHD after controlling for baseline sociodemographic and biological measures of CHD risk. 2. To evaluate whether aspects of the built and social environment are associated with individual health behaviors, social support, and psychological well-being that are known to be related to CHD in women. 3. To determine whether pathways between environmental characteristics and CHD are mediated by individual health behaviors, social support, and/or psychological well-being. To address these aims this project brings together two unique resources: individual-level data from the Observational Study (OS) and Clinical Trial (CT) arms of the Women's Health Initiative (WHI), a prospective study of 161,809 women ages 50 to 79 at entry, and geocoded, census-tract level contextual data on the sociodemographic and built environment where study subjects reside derived by the RAND Center for Population Health and Health Disparities (CPHHD) data core from the Census and other sources.                       ","Neighborhoods, Women and Coronary Heart Disease: A Prospective Study",7617952,R01HL084425,"['Clinical Trials ', ' clinical investigation ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' Coupled ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' depression ', ' Coronary heart disease ', ' coronary disorder ', ' Coronary Disease ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' heart disease risk ', ' heart disorder risk ', ' cardiac disorder risk ', ' cardiac disease risk ', ' cardiovascular disorder risk ', ' cardiovascular disease risk ', ' Skin ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Environment ', ' Address ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Data ', ' Centers for Population Health ', ' Observational Study ', ' Monitor ', ' Characteristics ', ' Cardiac ', ' Exercise ', ' Physical Exercise ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Behavioral ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' suburb ', ' suburbia ', ' suburban ', ' improved ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' Health Status ', ' Level of Health ', ' Clinical ', ' Biological ', ' Age of Onset ', ' Link ', ' Incidence ', ' Income ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Libraries ', ' Individual ', ' Literature ', ' Policies ', ' Measurement ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' middle age ', ' midlife ', ' middle aged ', ' mid-life ', ' mid life ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Genetic ', ' Poverty ', ' Prospective Studies ', ' Public Policy ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Social Characteristics ', ' Social Environment ', ' socioenvironment ', ' social context ', ' social climate ', ' Social support ', ' social support network ', ' Life ', ' Pollution ', ' Testing ', ' Scientist ', ' United States ', ' Well in self ', ' self wellness ', ' psychological wellness ', ' Sense of well-being ', ' Psychological Well Being ', ' Normal psyche ', ' Normal mental state ', ' Normal mental condition ', ' Mental well-being ', ' Feels well ', ' Emotional well being ', ' Woman ', ' Event ', ' Upper arm ', ' Source ', ' Pattern ', ' Elderly woman ', ' contextual factors ', ' Application Context ', ' cohort ', ' Disease Outcome ', ' Study Subject ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' circulatory system ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' Cardiovascular system (all sites) ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' social ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Censuses ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', "" Women's Health "", ' Female Health ', ' Health Benefit ', ' Mediating ', ' Modeling ', ' behavioral health ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' ']",NHLBI,RAND CORPORATION,R01,2009,790904,0.10577748930010487
"Health, Poverty and Place: Modeling Inequalities in Accra Using RS and GIS    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This project, through a detailed analysis of spatial disparities in health in Accra, Ghana, aims to provide a model for the interpretation of urban health inequalities in cities in poor countries. Using Accra in Ghana, we will generate methods that we hope will serve as templates for comparative analyses of other major cities in the developing world. The project will produce a geographical synopsis of the differentials in health and mortality within the urban area in a format immediately accessible to government and the development agencies tasked with the improvement of health overall and with the reduction of health inequalities; map the distribution of poverty (both income and wealth) in the city and assess its spatial association with selected health and mortality outcomes; using remote sensing and GIS technology, measure the association of adverse health and mortality outcomes with neighborhood ecology, including the association with spatial measures derived from observations of physical features and built structures visible from multi-spectral high spatial resolution satellite imagery; and assess the additional contribution of community-level variables including social organization and institutions to the production of inequalities in health and mortality, net of individual-level characteristics. Our research involves the following major steps: (i) apply new methods of defining urban neighborhoods across space and time using census and survey data and information from remotely sensed imagery; (2) validate data-derived neighborhood definitions, attributes, and boundaries with field assessments in a purposive sample of Accra neighborhoods; (3) assemble existing census-based, survey-based, and vital statistics-based measures of morbidity and mortality at the neighborhood level, based on the derived neighborhood definitions, as well as existing and updated imagery and geographic layers; (4) re-interview (in 2008) the respondents to the 2003 Accra Women's Health Survey to generate new measures of neighborhood-level health outcomes and changes in those outcomes; (5) employ spatial analytic, multivariate and multi-level analyses to predict the inequalities in health outcomes between and within neighborhoods of Accra; (6) develop models that build on the WHS and DHS data in combination with the imagery to predict health outcomes by neighborhood; (7) apply the modeling algorithms to two key resources-the Demographic and Health Survey and remotely sensed imagery-to predict the variability (inequality) in neighborhood level health outcomes in Accra; and (8) employ the results locally in Accra for health policy and planning purposes, and use the results from relatively data-rich Accra to develop models that can subsequently be used to estimate the spatial variability in health in data-poorer cities in sub-Saharan Africa.                    ","Health, Poverty and Place: Modeling Inequalities in Accra Using RS and GIS",7646593,R01HD054906,"['Data Aggregation ', ' Aggregated Data ', ' Demography ', ' Population Studies / Demography ', ' Developing Countries ', ' Under-Developed Nations ', ' Under-Developed Countries ', ' Third-World Nations ', ' Third-World Countries ', ' Less-Developed Nations ', ' Less-Developed Countries ', ' Developing Nations ', ' Developing Nation ', ' Developing Country ', ' Institution ', ' Low income ', ' Ecology ', ' Environmental Science ', ' Economics ', ' Environment ', ' Address ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Data ', ' Measurable ', ' Resolution ', ' Update ', ' Validation ', ' Characteristics ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Africa South of the Sahara ', ' Subsaharan Africa ', ' Sub-Saharan Africa ', ' Ghana ', ' Gold Coast ', ' Imagery ', ' Visualization ', ' base ', ' urban area ', ' Goals ', ' Government ', ' improved ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' Health care facility ', ' Healthcare Facility ', ' Health Facilities ', ' Health Policy ', ' healthcare policy ', ' health care policy ', ' Health Status ', ' Level of Health ', ' Health Surveys ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Household ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Man (Taxonomy) ', ' Algorithms ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Link ', ' Income ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Interview ', ' Laboratories ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Individual ', ' Literature ', ' Rural ', ' Demographic and Health Surveys ', ' Inequality ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Mortality ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Respondent ', ' Developed Countries ', ' Industrialized Nations ', ' Industrialized Countries ', ' Developed Nations ', ' Developed Nation ', ' Developed Country ', ' Perception ', ' Population Dynamics ', ' Population Growth ', ' Poverty ', ' Production ', ' tool ', ' Records ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Slum ', ' Social Justice ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Urban Health ', ' Urbanization ', ' Attention ', ' Vital Statistics ', ' Investigation ', ' Work ', ' Dimensions ', ' Source ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' Country ', ' Transcend ', ' social organization ', ' remote sensing ', ' metropolitan ', ' Proxy ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' member ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Self-Report ', ' Censuses ', ' Environmental Hazards ', ' Measures ', ' Relative (related person) ', ' Relative ', "" Women's Health "", ' Female Health ', ' Child Mortality ', ' Geographic Information Systems ', ' Case Study ', ' case report ', ' Longitudinal Surveys ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Cities ', ' model design ', ' Accounting ', ' Communities ', ' time use ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' comparative ', ' lens ', ' lenses ', ' health inequalities ', ' ']",NICHD,SAN DIEGO STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2009,689224,0.19194507387185789
"Harlem Community Academic Partnership: Influenza Immunizations    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Proposed is a community based participatory research project (CBPR) and evaluation for improving influenza immunizations in high risk populations within disadvantaged minority communities. The Harlem Community and Academic Partnership (HCAP)'s Board includes residents, community based organizations, academic partners and the local health department who meet monthly to plan, conduct and review neighborhood assessments, interventions and evaluation activities; topic-specific issues are addressed through formation of Intervention Work Groups (IWGs). The HCAP Board noted especially low rates of influenza immunizations in Harlem and formed the VIVA (Venue Intensive Vaccine for Adults) IWG. This IWG has conducted separate pilots including a survey on barriers to immunization, development of culturally informed intervention materials, a pilot of ""yellow jacket"" outreach workers to engage and educate hard-to reach populations, and provision of immunizations at non-traditional sites. The goal of this proposal is to assemble these components to formally scale up and test the intervention for adults in the Harlem communities. To achieve these aims, the HCAP VIVA IWG will plan, organize and implement an intervention; our primary partner, Palladia Inc, provides outreach educators and a service network of over 120 CBOs to educate and mobilize the community for immunization as well as coordinate congregating persons with traditional and new non-traditional venues for immunizations; the local Visiting Nurse Service has agreed to provide nurses and influenza vaccines at the selected venues gratis. This program does not replace, but rather supplements existing vaccination programs in the city by adding more relevant education and new ""non-traditional"" venues. We expect that this program will increase rates of immunizations overall including the hard-to-reach populations. To evaluate this program, we will compare annual rates of immunization between Harlem and communities similar to Harlem in NYC, with data available by neighborhood through the NYC annual ""Community Health Survey"" (modified BRFSS from CDC) which includes 10,000 adult NYC residents. We will also conduct two cross sectional street intercept surveys (n=800) before and after each annual intervention program between harlem and comparison community residents. These data combined with yearly inventories of CBOs, will provide measures of barriers, intervention experiences and outcomes to broaden input for continuous program improvement.          ",Harlem Community Academic Partnership: Influenza Immunizations,7626362,R24MD002754,"['Mission ', ' Motivation ', ' Persons ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' New York ', ' New York City ', ' Nurses ', ' Nursing Services ', ' web based ', ' online computer ', ' On-Line Systems ', ' Online Systems ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' social support network ', ' Social support ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Testing ', ' Vaccination ', ' flu immunisation ', ' Prophylactic vaccination against influenza ', ' Influenza immunization ', ' Flu vaccination ', ' Influenza vaccination ', ' Vaccines ', ' Adopted ', ' Attitude ', ' Home Health Nursing ', ' Visiting Nurse ', ' Work ', ' Yellow Jackets ', ' Awareness ', ' Source ', ' meetings ', ' Services ', ' experience ', ' Intercept ', ' intervention program ', ' Structure ', ' disease prevention ', ' disorder prevention ', ' outreach ', ' social ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' CDC ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' Measures ', ' youngster ', ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' response ', ' Cities ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Communities ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' scale up ', ' Population ', ' next generation vaccines ', ' new vaccines ', ' novel vaccines ', ' community based participatory research ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' high risk ', ' group intervention ', ' social health determinants ', ' Behavior Risk Factor Surveillance System ', ' BRFSS ', ' Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System ', ' Healthy People 2010 ', ' Provider ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Elements ', ' Address ', ' HIV/AIDS prevention ', ' HIV Prevention ', ' AIDS/HIV prevention ', ' AIDS prevention ', ' Data ', ' Mutate ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Principal Investigator ', ' Process ', ' Community Health ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' avian influenza H5N1 virus ', ' avian influenza H5N1 ', ' H5N1 virus ', ' H5N1 ', ' Influenza A Virus, H5N1 Subtype ', ' pandemic ', ' pandemic disease ', ' influenza in birds ', ' avian flu ', ' Fowl Plague ', ' Fowl Pest ', ' Bird Flu ', ' Avian Influenza ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' base ', ' Goals ', ' Group Meetings ', ' improved ', ' Health ', ' Health Promotion ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' Health Surveys ', ' working group ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Immunization Programs ', ' Immunostimulation ', ' Immunological Stimulation ', ' Immunological Sensitization ', ' Immunologic Stimulation ', ' Immunologic Sensitization ', ' Immunization ', ' influenza infection ', ' flu infection ', ' Grippe ', ' Influenza ', ' Influenza Vaccines ', ' Flu vaccine ', ' Influenza virus vaccine ', ' Inventory ', ' Equipment and supply inventories ', ' Evaluation ', ' Articulation ', ' Joints ', ' Learning ', ' post intervention ', ' Trust ', ' Methods ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' ']",NIMHD,NEW YORK ACADEMY OF MEDICINE,R24,2009,576637,0.05542685893538761
"Measuring Neighborhood: Key Aspects for Multiethnic Older Adults' Health Status    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This Mentored Research Scientist Development Award (K01) proposes to provide the candidate, an early-career investigator with the UCSF Resource Center for Minority Aging Research (RCMAR), further training in measurement tool development and assessment, advanced statistical methods, and qualitative research methods. The additional training would enable her to pursue a career as an independent investigator identifying key social and environmental mechanisms that create racial/ethnic and socioeconomic disparities among older adults. In the shorter term, building on prior work of the candidate, this K01 focuses on the neighborhood environment as a possible key factor influencing health and contributing to health disparities. She proposes a career development plan that consists of coursework, training, and research experiences with a mentoring team of senior faculty and external mentors with expertise in the areas of measurement development, minority aging, health disparities, qualitative research methods, and advanced statistical methods. The research program consists of three parts: secondary data analysis, qualitative research project, and creation of a new pilot neighborhood measurement tool. Part one of the research program is analysis of the Chicago Health and Aging Project (CHAP), investigating the cross- sectional and longitudinal associations of neighborhood environment with perceived health status. Neighborhood environment is assessed in CHAP by self-report, street observations, census data, and secondary data on crime and traffic. Part two of the research program is intensive semi-structured interviews of older adults who are from diverse racial/ethnic backgrounds and live in economically diverse neighborhoods. The adults will be asked about the meaning of their neighborhood, the resources they use in their neighborhoods, the challenges they confront, how they cope with difficulties, and their health status. The interview data will be analyzed for key themes. In Part three, these themes will be translated into survey items to create a pilot measurement tool for neighborhood environment. Identifying mechanisms for health disparities among older adults is a priority of the NIA five-year strategic plan. Neighborhood environments could be crucial given that as people age they may be more dependent on their immediate surroundings.          ",Measuring Neighborhood: Key Aspects for Multiethnic Older Adults' Health Status,7629000,K01AG027273,"['Crime ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Low income ', ' Economics ', ' Environment ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Mentored Research Scientist Development Award ', ' Research Scientist Development Award ', ' Mentored Training Award ', ' K01 Program ', ' K01 Mechanism ', ' K01 Award ', ' Research Training ', ' Strategic Planning ', ' Principal Investigator ', ' Characteristics ', ' socioeconomics ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomic ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio economic ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Faculty ', ' Fibrinogen ', ' Factor One ', ' Factor I ', ' Coagulation Factor One ', ' Coagulation Factor I ', ' Blood Factor One ', ' Blood Coagulation Factor One ', ' Blood Coagulation Factor I ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' base ', ' career ', ' Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Aging ', ' Label ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' Health Status ', ' Level of Health ', ' National Institute on Aging ', ' Homes for the Aged ', ' home for elderly ', ' Old Age Homes ', ' Home for seniors ', ' Area ', ' Income ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Interview ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Literature ', ' Policies ', ' Measurement ', ' Development Plans ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Mentors ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' tool ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' San Francisco ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' Trees ', ' Unemployment ', ' unemployed ', ' out of work ', ' joblessness ', ' jobless ', ' Work ', ' Side ', ' contextual factors ', ' Application Context ', ' Services ', ' age group ', ' experience ', ' cohesion ', ' trafficking ', ' Structure ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Self-Report ', ' social ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' Censuses ', ' Measures ', ' Chicago ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Research Methodology ', ' Research Methods ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' career development ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Qualitative Research ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Minority ', ' coping ', ' federal poverty level ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' racial/ethnic ', ' tool development ', ' neighborhood association ', ' ']",NIA,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",K01,2009,117990,0.08310058923001883

"Neighborhood Poverty, Health and Economic Security Over the Adult Lifespan OTHER PROJECT INFORMATION - Project Summary/Abstract This proposal seeks support to add detailed measures of health and economic security to a long-term follow-up study of low-income middle and older aged adults participating in a unique randomized neighborhood mobility experiment know as Moving to Opportunity (MTO). The MTO demonstration used a randomized lottery to offer some public housing residents but not others the chance to relocate to less disadvantaged neighborhoods using a rental housing subsidy. MTO experimentally generated large difference in neighborhood characteristics for otherwise comparable groups of low-income, disproportionately minority families. At the time of our proposed survey fieldwork (10 to 12 years after random assignment) 31% of the adult sample will be age 50 or older, with a mean age of 46.8. An interim study found that compared to the control group, adults in the treatment groups had substantially lower estimated prevalence of serious mental illness 4-7 years after randomization, were 20% less likely to be obese and showed signs of improved diet and exercise, but had no differences in labor market outcomes. However environmental toxicity, dietary quality, physical activity and the burdens of psychosocial stress are difficult to capture through surveys. The effects of MTO on economic security could potentially increase over time due to health improvements or if adults become more socially integrated into their new areas, but the possibility of convergence across groups in neighborhood attributes over time suggests labor market impacts could instead attenuate over time. This proposal has four main aims: "" To expand our long-term data collection to administer to all MTO adults a set of detailed assessments of  health (including blood samples to measure disease precursors such as cholesterol, C-reactive protein,  and glycosylated hemoglobin)and DSM-IV mental health disorders, and indicators of economic security  such as earnings, savings, assets, and participation in programs such as TANF or SSI. The interim MTO  impacts on diet, exercise and obesity are about as large as those found with public health lifestyle  interventions, which have been shown to impact biomarkers of the sort we propose to collect for MTO. "" To estimate long-term effects of the MTO experiment on these outcomes in the total sample and sub- samples defined by age, gender, and other baseline risk factors. "" To decompose the total effects of the intervention on these outcomes and narrow down the the set of  behavioral mechanisms through which the aggregate effects occurred. "" To develop a public MTO data archive that is made available for secondary analysis. The overarching goal is to better understand the effects of MTO and neighborhood mobility on adult long-term health and economic security as well as the processes by which these outcomes are affected. This study will help shed light on larger disparities in health and economic outcomes across race and class lines. NIA funding is essential to administer the full range of outcomes described here to all MTO adults. OTHER PROJECT INFORMATION - Project Narrative This project examines whether disparities in health and other outcomes can be explained in part by the increased likelihood that low-income and minority adults live in high-poverty, highly-disadvantaged neighborhoods. It will draw on biomeasures, surveys and other data from a unique housing-mobility experiment known as Moving to Opportunity (MTO) that helps overcome the self-selection problems that plague most previous research in the area of neighborhoods and health.","Neighborhood Poverty, Health and Economic Security Over the Adult Lifespan",7750807,R56AG031259,"['Crime ', ' Data Collection ', ' Decision Making ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Low income ', ' Economics ', ' Environment ', ' Behavioral Mechanisms ', ' Mechanisms of Behavior and Behavior Change ', ' Data ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Collection ', ' Security ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' follow-up ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' Family ', ' Follow-Up Studies ', ' Followup Studies ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Future ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' base ', ' Glycosylated Hemoglobin ', ' Glycated Hemoglobins ', ' Blood specimen ', ' Blood Sample ', ' Goals ', ' Aging ', ' improved ', ' Health ', ' Housing ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Biological ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' DSM-IV ', ' Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-IV ', ' Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th edition ', ' DSM4 ', ' Physical activity ', ' Distress ', ' Life Cycle Stages ', ' life course ', ' Life Cycle ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Literature ', ' Longevity ', ' lifespan ', ' life span ', ' Length of Life ', ' Long-Term Effects ', ' Longterm Effects ', ' Funding ', ' Marketing ', ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Obesity ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Occupations ', ' Professional Postions ', ' Jobs ', ' Plague ', ' Yersinia pestis disease ', ' Poverty ', ' Poverty Areas ', ' Exposure to ', ' Attenuated ', ' Productivity ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' Public Housing ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Savings ', ' Archives ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Victimization ', ' Survey Methodology ', ' Survey Method ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Time ', ' Attitude ', ' Weight ', ' Work ', ' waist circumference ', ' Height ', ' Mental disorders ', ' psychological disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' physical conditioning ', ' physical health ', ' experience ', ' Toxic effect ', ' Toxicities ', ' C-reactive protein ', ' Proteins, specific or class, C-reactive ', ' Disease Outcome ', ' Participant ', ' research study ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Self-Report ', ' Sorting - Cell Movement ', ' sorting ', ' social ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' psychological distress ', ' Cholesterol ', ' Cholest-5-en-3-ol (3beta)- ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' abstracting ', ' Sampling ', ' voucher ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Communities ', ' cost ', ' health economics ', ' Minority ', ' diet and exercise ', ' severe mental illness ', ' serious mental illness ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' Psychosocial Stress ', ' aged ', ' lifestyle intervention ', ' life style intervention ', ' economic outcome ', ' biomarker ', ' intervention effect ', ' Control Groups ', ' ']",NIA,NATIONAL BUREAU OF ECONOMIC RESEARCH,R56,2009,200139,0.14464832661446464
"Methods for Evaluating the Physical and Social Environment of Urban Neighborhoods    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The purpose of this study is to design and evaluate a comprehensive, systematic approach to characterizing urban neighborhoods through direct observation of neighborhood characteristics. Public health researchers and practitioners have begun to refocus on the context in which an individual lives as an important determinant of health. Neighborhood characteristics are typically measured through participant self-report, observation (often via video), or secondary databases like the US Census. Major limitations of these approaches include the inability to monitor changes over time, costs and significant staff resources. This has limited their inclusion in more than a few studies and resulted in neighborhoods being evaluated at a single point during a study. Yet, during a multi-year study, the urban neighborhood context may significantly change as a result of seasonality, gentrification, immigration, etc. We propose to evaluate and revise a brief scale, already developed by the research team, aimed at measuring the social, physical and resource environment of urban neighborhoods through direct observation and examine the reliability and validity of the scale. To achieve these aims, we will be working within a larger multi-level parent study aimed at examining the associations between features of the urban environment and mental health, drug use, and HIV risk in 36 NYC neighborhoods that have already been ethnographically defined. We will first define an additional 15 neighborhoods in affluent and/or predominantly white neighborhoods in New York City, as our current sampling frame is overrepresented by neighborhoods with a high prevalence of economic deprivation and minorities. Next, we will use our neighborhood evaluation scale and neighborhood mapping to measure the urban environment. Each of the 51 target neighborhoods will be rated by two independent observers twice a year for 2 years, providing 4 iterations for data collection, analysis and scale revision. Reliability will be assessed via measures of inter-rater and test retest reliability and internal consistency. Problematic items will be eliminated or reworked in the next iteration. The scale will also be assessed for each type of validity. Face validity will be assessed through review by study investigators, consultants and staff. Content validity will be evaluated through internal consistency and evaluation of item values pre- and post-training. Factor analysis will be used to explore the presence and nature of factors. Criterion-related validity will be assessed by video recording and rating a sub-sample of blocks as a ""gold standard"" for the final iteration of the scale. External construct validity checks comparing the scale results for each neighborhood to key indicators from the US Census (e.g., residential segregation, income inequality) will be performed. In year 2, we will also administer the scale in 50 randomly selected Detroit neighborhoods to evaluate the scale's performance in another urban setting and assess the generalizability. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Public health researchers and practitioners have begun to refocus on the context in which as individual lives as an important determinant of health. Neighborhood characteristics are typically measured through participant   self-report, observation (often via video), or secondary databases like the US Census which are limited in their ability to monitor changes over time, are expensive and require significant staffing resources. The purpose of this study is to design and evaluate a comprehensive, systematic approach to characterizing urban neighborhoods through direct observation of neighborhood characteristics that will address these limitations.          ",Methods for Evaluating the Physical and Social Environment of Urban Neighborhoods,7575799,R21DA025343,"['Data Collection ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Economics ', ' Environment ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' High Prevalence ', ' Cognitive ', ' Social Health Services ', ' Update ', ' Monitor ', ' Characteristics ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomic ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio economic ', ' socioeconomics ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' Affect ', ' base ', ' Au element ', ' Gold ', ' Health ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' healthcare service availability ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare access availability ', ' health services availability ', ' health care service availability ', ' health care service access ', ' health care availability ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Availability of Health Services ', ' Accessibility of health care ', ' Access to Healthcare ', ' Access to Health Care ', ' Access to Care ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' Housing ', ' Area ', ' Immigrations ', ' In-Migration ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Income ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' residence ', ' Individual ', ' data repository ', ' clinical data repository ', ' Electronic Database ', ' Electronic Databank ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Databases ', ' Inequality ', ' drug use ', ' Drug usage ', ' Maps ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Methods ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' New York ', ' New York City ', ' Parents ', ' Poverty ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' instrument ', ' Nature ', ' Validity and Reliability ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' socioenvironment ', ' social context ', ' social climate ', ' Social Environment ', ' Social Work ', ' Social Service ', ' Social work (field) ', ' Life ', ' statistics ', ' traumatic neurosis ', ' Posttraumatic Stress Disorders ', ' Posttraumatic Neuroses ', ' Post-Traumatic Neuroses ', ' PTSD ', ' Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Transportation ', ' Urban Health ', ' video recording system ', ' Videorecording ', ' Video Recording ', ' Videotape ', ' Attention ', ' Work ', ' driving ', ' Automobile Driving ', ' Location ', ' Physical environment ', ' inner city ', ' health care organization ', ' health care service organization ', ' Performance ', ' stressor ', ' Participant ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' social ', ' HIV/AIDS problem ', ' HIV/AIDS ', ' AIDS/HIV ', ' AIDS/HIV problem ', ' Censuses ', ' Measures ', ' Racial Segregation ', ' segregation ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Factor Analyses ', ' Factor Analysis ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Sampling ', ' deprivation ', ' Cities ', ' Systematics ', ' Classification ', ' Communities ', ' cost ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' racial/ethnic ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' public health relevance ', ' ']",NIDA,NEW YORK ACADEMY OF MEDICINE,R21,2009,175950,0.20496493011990272
"Community Mapping of Environmental Hazards and Barriers in an Immigrant Populatio    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Community Mapping of Environmental Hazards and Barriers in an Immigrant Population Abstract The proposed project addresses broad Challenge Area (09), Health Disparities, and specific Challenge Topic 09-ES-101, ""Building trust between researchers and communities through capacity building in Environmental Public Health"". It is designed to address a major gap in health prevention for minority communities by bringing together researchers and members of an underserved racial/ethnic community to produce a collaboratively developed profile of neighborhood environmental hazards and barriers to health care access. In particular, this work will build on a developmental community-based participatory research project focused on the recently high profile concerns of health risks from chemical exposures in the burgeoning nail salon industry, an industry dominated in California by Vietnamese immigrant workers. With that as a starting point, we will conduct an equal partnership community mapping project, bringing expertise in the use of geographic information systems (GIS) tools from the research partner together with the knowledge and perceptions of the community partner to characterize neighborhood work and residential environments influencing the health risks of Vietnamese immigrants. It is anticipated that this partnership will provide greater insights into factors associated with the increasing adverse health experience of Vietnamese immigrants in the US, as well as provide an opportunity to empower community members to better illustrate and articulate their concerns to the health care establishment and local government. The aims of this community mapping project are to: 1) Identify community-perceived economic, environmental, social and built environmental stressors and health access barriers through a series of focus groups with Vietnamese community members, stratified by general age groups. 2) Create initial community maps using existing data sources to characterize differences in economic, environmental, social and built environmental stressors across neighborhoods. 3) Develop and implement a community mapping survey tool for collecting neighborhood-level information to enhance baseline community maps (Aim 2). a. Develop a community mapping survey instrument to collect information on community-perceived stressors and barriers (identified from Aim 1). b. Engage Vietnamese nail salon workers in the collection of neighborhood data to describe community- perceived stressors and barriers. c. Collect air monitoring data on diesel exhaust, an air contaminant of known high community concern, to assess differences in levels across neighborhoods and evaluate existing data on this contaminant. 4) Develop enhanced community maps using existing and newly-collected data (Aim 3) to describe variations in neighborhood economic, environmental, social and built environmental stressors.

"Physical Frailty in Urban African-Americans    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This revised competitive renewal of ""Physical Frailty in Urban African Americans"" requests five years of funding (Y11-15) to enable additional data collection on and analysis of a representative cohort of community-dwelling African Americans living in St. Louis, known as the African American Health (AAH) project. The 998 enrolled AAH subjects were 49 to 65 years of age at baseline evaluation in 2000-2001, 463 from a very poor inner-city area and 535 from more affluent suburban conditions; 865 are alive and continue to participate. Five annual waves of high quality participation and data have already been collected by an experienced team that has made valuable contributions to the field. In the continuation, we propose to obtain telephone interviews (lasting 50 and 25 minutes, respectively) seven and eight years after baseline and a detailed in-home evaluation (120 minutes) nine years after baseline. We expand prior research themes by adding a comprehensive, innovative approach to examining contextual effects, extensive investigations of resilience, and cutting-edge analytic methods. With the combined eight waves of data over ten years, we will pursue two specific aims: (1) investigate the process of disablement in this cohort using individual-level data and (2) investigate the independent effect of adverse neighborhood conditions on the disablement process. We hypothesize that the disablement process can be viewed as an ordered progression in which the principal transitions for 25 tasks are from high functioning (HF), to subclinical status (SC; defined as no reported difficulty but change in either method or frequency of performance), from SC to difficulty (D), and from D to adverse health outcomes (e.g., falls, death). Primary analytic methods involve (a) multi-state transition models for individual tasks and (b) mixed effect models with both fixed and random intercepts and coefficients for three psychometrically-sound composite measures, examining the composite HF, SC, and D count trajectories both individually and simultaneously. For aim 2, our primary hypotheses are: (a) adverse neighborhood conditions (built environment less conducive to physical activity, lower availability of services, and increased area-level deprivation) are associated with disability outcomes, after adjusting for individual- level factors; (b) the negative effect of service availability operates at a different spatial scale than those of the built environment and deprivation; and, (c) adverse neighborhood conditions can be used to target future interventions to improve disability outcomes. Both aims examine recovery as well as deterioration and the effects of hypothesized risk (e.g., obesity) and protective (e.g., education) factors on disability outcomes. Analysis involves multilevel and novel geostatistical techniques. We have experience with all proposed assessment and analytic methods, which have adequate (> 80%) power to detect small to moderate effects for all hypotheses. Multiple secondary studies (e.g., fear of falling, life space mobility) will also be pursued.              ",Physical Frailty in Urban African-Americans,7805547,R01AG010436,"['early experience ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' Intercept ', ' cohort ', ' Books ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Population Study ', ' Reporting ', ' Censuses ', ' Destinations ', ' Measures ', ' multilevel modeling ', ' multilevel model ', ' methods to study multiple-level influences ', ' multilevel analysis ', ' Geographic Information Systems ', ' Care Givers ', ' Caregivers ', ' falls ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Deterioration ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' LOINC Axis 2 Property ', ' Property ', ' deprivation ', ' fear of falling ', ' treatment adverse effect ', ' therapy adverse effect ', ' side effect ', ' Treatment Side Effects ', ' Adverse effects ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Communities ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Comorbidity ', ' decline in function ', ' functional decline ', ' health related quality of life ', ' Social Functioning ', ' resilience ', ' Outcome ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' service utilization ', ' adverse consequence ', ' adverse outcome ', ' Data Collection ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' emotional dependency ', ' Dependency ', ' Dependency (Psychology) ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' diabetes ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' functional capacity ', ' functional ability ', ' daily living functionality ', ' Activities of everyday life ', ' Activities of Daily Living ', ' IADL ', ' instrumental activity of daily living ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Environment ', ' Baths ', ' Bathing ', ' Age-Years ', ' Data ', ' Cognitive ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Peak Expiratory Flow ', ' Seminal ', ' Principal Investigator ', ' Process ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Non-Trunk ', ' Limbs ', ' Extremities ', ' Limb structure ', ' Future ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' preclinical ', ' pre-clinical ', ' Age ', ' base ', ' suburbia ', ' suburban ', ' suburb ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Health ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' healthcare service availability ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare access availability ', ' health services availability ', ' health care service availability ', ' health care service access ', ' health care availability ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Availability of Health Services ', ' Accessibility of health care ', ' Access to Healthcare ', ' Access to Health Care ', ' Access to Care ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Left ', ' Area ', ' Phase ', ' Lifting ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Income ', ' Interview ', ' Telephone Interviews ', ' Evaluation ', ' Grips ', ' grasp ', ' Physical activity ', ' disability ', ' Membrum inferius ', ' Lower Limb ', ' Lower Extremity ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Recovery ', ' pulmonary ', ' Lung Respiratory System ', ' Lung ', ' data repository ', ' clinical data repository ', ' Electronic Database ', ' Electronic Databank ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Databases ', ' Logistics ', ' Funding ', ' Methods ', ' midlife ', ' middle aged ', ' mid-life ', ' mid life ', ' middle age ', ' Mortality ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' muscular ', ' Muscle Tissue ', ' Muscle ', ' Persons ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' nursing home ', ' Nursing Homes ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Obesity ', ' Probability ', ' Exposure to ', ' Staging ', ' Psychometrics ', ' Validity and Reliability ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Selection Bias ', ' Smoking ', ' social support network ', ' Social support ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' sound ', ' Survival Analyses ', ' Survival Analysis ', ' cognitive function ', ' Taxes ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' frailty ', ' visual function ', ' Sight ', ' Vision ', ' Investigation ', ' Work ', ' Frequency ', ' Frequencies (time pattern) ', ' Complex ', ' Event ', ' Home ', ' Home environment ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' Location ', ' skeletal ', ' Visit ', ' inner city ', ' complement C2a fragment ', ' complement 2a ', ' C2a ', ' C 2a ', ' complement C2a ', ' American ', ' ']",NIA,INDIANA UNIV-PURDUE UNIV AT INDIANAPOLIS,R01,2010,1134161,0.07721465704928879
"Measuring neighborhood: Key aspects for multiethnic older adults' health status    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This Mentored Research Scientist Development Award (K01) proposes to provide the candidate, an early-career investigator with the UCSF Resource Center for Minority Aging Research (RCMAR), further training in measurement tool development and assessment, advanced statistical methods, and qualitative research methods. The additional training would enable her to pursue a career as an independent investigator identifying key social and environmental mechanisms that create racial/ethnic and socioeconomic disparities among older adults. In the shorter term, building on prior work of the candidate, this K01 focuses on the neighborhood environment as a possible key factor influencing health and contributing to health disparities. She proposes a career development plan that consists of coursework, training, and research experiences with a mentoring team of senior faculty and external mentors with expertise in the areas of measurement development, minority aging, health disparities, qualitative research methods, and advanced statistical methods. The research program consists of three parts: secondary data analysis, qualitative research project, and creation of a new pilot neighborhood measurement tool. Part one of the research program is analysis of the Chicago Health and Aging Project (CHAP), investigating the cross- sectional and longitudinal associations of neighborhood environment with perceived health status. Neighborhood environment is assessed in CHAP by self-report, street observations, census data, and secondary data on crime and traffic. Part two of the research program is intensive semi-structured interviews of older adults who are from diverse racial/ethnic backgrounds and live in economically diverse neighborhoods. The adults will be asked about the meaning of their neighborhood, the resources they use in their neighborhoods, the challenges they confront, how they cope with difficulties, and their health status. The interview data will be analyzed for key themes. In Part three, these themes will be translated into survey items to create a pilot measurement tool for neighborhood environment. Identifying mechanisms for health disparities among older adults is a priority of the NIA five-year strategic plan. Neighborhood environments could be crucial given that as people age they may be more dependent on their immediate surroundings.          ",Measuring neighborhood: Key aspects for multiethnic older adults' health status,7844931,K01AG027273,"['Crime ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Low income ', ' Economics ', ' Environment ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Mentored Research Scientist Development Award ', ' Research Scientist Development Award ', ' Mentored Training Award ', ' K01 Program ', ' K01 Mechanism ', ' K01 Award ', ' Research Training ', ' Strategic Planning ', ' Principal Investigator ', ' Characteristics ', ' socioeconomics ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomic ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio economic ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Faculty ', ' Fibrinogen ', ' Factor One ', ' Factor I ', ' Coagulation Factor One ', ' Coagulation Factor I ', ' Blood Factor One ', ' Blood Coagulation Factor One ', ' Blood Coagulation Factor I ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' base ', ' career ', ' Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Aging ', ' Label ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' Health Status ', ' Level of Health ', ' National Institute on Aging ', ' Homes for the Aged ', ' home for elderly ', ' Old Age Homes ', ' Home for seniors ', ' Area ', ' Income ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Interview ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Literature ', ' Policies ', ' Measurement ', ' Development Plans ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Mentors ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' tool ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' San Francisco ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' Trees ', ' Unemployment ', ' unemployed ', ' out of work ', ' joblessness ', ' jobless ', ' Work ', ' Side ', ' contextual factors ', ' Application Context ', ' Services ', ' age group ', ' experience ', ' cohesion ', ' trafficking ', ' Structure ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Self-Report ', ' social ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' Censuses ', ' Measures ', ' Chicago ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Research Methodology ', ' Research Methods ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' career development ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Qualitative Research ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Minority ', ' coping ', ' federal poverty level ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' racial/ethnic ', ' tool development ', ' neighborhood association ', ' ']",NIA,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",K01,2010,117990,0.08310058923001883
"Health Poverty and Place: Modeling Inequalities in Accra Using RS and GIS    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This project, through a detailed analysis of spatial disparities in health in Accra, Ghana, aims to provide a model for the interpretation of urban health inequalities in cities in poor countries. Using Accra in Ghana, we will generate methods that we hope will serve as templates for comparative analyses of other major cities in the developing world. The project will produce a geographical synopsis of the differentials in health and mortality within the urban area in a format immediately accessible to government and the development agencies tasked with the improvement of health overall and with the reduction of health inequalities; map the distribution of poverty (both income and wealth) in the city and assess its spatial association with selected health and mortality outcomes; using remote sensing and GIS technology, measure the association of adverse health and mortality outcomes with neighborhood ecology, including the association with spatial measures derived from observations of physical features and built structures visible from multi-spectral high spatial resolution satellite imagery; and assess the additional contribution of community-level variables including social organization and institutions to the production of inequalities in health and mortality, net of individual-level characteristics. Our research involves the following major steps: (i) apply new methods of defining urban neighborhoods across space and time using census and survey data and information from remotely sensed imagery; (2) validate data-derived neighborhood definitions, attributes, and boundaries with field assessments in a purposive sample of Accra neighborhoods; (3) assemble existing census-based, survey-based, and vital statistics-based measures of morbidity and mortality at the neighborhood level, based on the derived neighborhood definitions, as well as existing and updated imagery and geographic layers; (4) re-interview (in 2008) the respondents to the 2003 Accra Women's Health Survey to generate new measures of neighborhood-level health outcomes and changes in those outcomes; (5) employ spatial analytic, multivariate and multi-level analyses to predict the inequalities in health outcomes between and within neighborhoods of Accra; (6) develop models that build on the WHS and DHS data in combination with the imagery to predict health outcomes by neighborhood; (7) apply the modeling algorithms to two key resources-the Demographic and Health Survey and remotely sensed imagery-to predict the variability (inequality) in neighborhood level health outcomes in Accra; and (8) employ the results locally in Accra for health policy and planning purposes, and use the results from relatively data-rich Accra to develop models that can subsequently be used to estimate the spatial variability in health in data-poorer cities in sub-Saharan Africa.                    ",Health Poverty and Place: Modeling Inequalities in Accra Using RS and GIS,7885584,R01HD054906,"['Algorithms ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Link ', ' Income ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Interview ', ' Laboratories ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Individual ', ' Literature ', ' Rural ', ' Demographic and Health Surveys ', ' Inequality ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Mortality ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Respondent ', ' Perception ', ' Population Dynamics ', ' Population Growth ', ' Poverty ', ' Production ', ' tool ', ' Records ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Slum ', ' Social Justice ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Urban Health ', ' Urbanization ', ' Attention ', ' Vital Statistics ', ' Investigation ', ' Work ', ' Dimensions ', ' Source ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' Country ', ' Transcend ', ' social organization ', ' remote sensing ', ' metropolitan ', ' Proxy ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' member ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Self-Report ', ' Censuses ', ' Environmental Hazards ', ' Measures ', ' Relative (related person) ', ' Relative ', "" Women's Health "", ' Female Health ', ' Child Mortality ', ' Geographic Information Systems ', ' Case Study ', ' case report ', ' Longitudinal Surveys ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Cities ', ' model design ', ' Communities ', ' time use ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' comparative ', ' lens ', ' lenses ', ' health inequalities ', ' Data Aggregation ', ' Aggregated Data ', ' Demography ', ' Population Studies / Demography ', ' Developing Countries ', ' Under-Developed Nations ', ' Under-Developed Countries ', ' Third-World Nations ', ' Third-World Countries ', ' Less-Developed Nations ', ' Less-Developed Countries ', ' Developing Nations ', ' Developing Nation ', ' Developing Country ', ' Institution ', ' Low income ', ' Ecology ', ' Environmental Science ', ' Economics ', ' Environment ', ' Address ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Data ', ' Measurable ', ' Resolution ', ' Update ', ' Validation ', ' Principal Investigator ', ' Characteristics ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Africa South of the Sahara ', ' Subsaharan Africa ', ' Sub-Saharan Africa ', ' Ghana ', ' Gold Coast ', ' Imagery ', ' Visualization ', ' base ', ' urban area ', ' Goals ', ' Government ', ' improved ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' Health care facility ', ' Healthcare Facility ', ' Health Facilities ', ' Health Policy ', ' healthcare policy ', ' health care policy ', ' Health Status ', ' Level of Health ', ' Health Surveys ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Household ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Man (Taxonomy) ', ' ']",NICHD,SAN DIEGO STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2010,654447,0.19194507387185789
"School environments and adolescents weight status and physical activity patterns    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Child/adolescent obesity is one of the most pressing public health problems today; it disproportionately affects Hispanic and Black children/adolescents as well as those living in poverty. Lack of physical activity and poor diet are well-documented contributors to child/adolescent obesity and reflect these same disparities. Environmental contexts may provide new answers to the origins of these disparities. Though recent studies have begun to elucidate the influence of neighborhoods on child/adolescent weight and weight related behaviors, schools remain an understudied environmental context. My long-range goal is to increase understanding of the impact of schools on the health of children/adolescents and their potential contribution to racial/ethnic and/or socioeconomic disparities. Coupled with this goal is my desire to build relationships between clinicians, researchers, and policy makers so that empirical findings can be translated into effective interventions. My career development plan proposes additional training and mentorship in three areas critical to my development as an independent researcher: (1) population health sciences, including the social determinants of health (social epidemiology), demographic theory and methods, sociology (urban sociology, neighborhood influences, and social stratification), and economics; (2) advanced methods needed to analyze contextual influences on health (multi-level analysis, multi-equation models, sociometric analysis), as well as methods to address causal inference; and (3) substantive understanding of the role of macro-social forces, such as educational opportunities, on health. My research plan includes 3 aims: (1) To determine the extent to which school factors contribute to racial/ethnic differences in individual dietary intake; (2) To determine the extent to which school factors contribute to racial/ethnic and/or socioeconomic differences in individual physical activity and weight trajectories from adolescence to adulthood; and (3) To simultaneously examine the influence of school context and two other potentially influential contexts-peer networks and neighborhood environments-on physical activity and weight gain trajectories. The career development plan will provide the training necessary to support an R01 application toward the end of this proposed award period and the research proposed will lay the ground work for identifying school-based interventions that can reverse the obesity epidemic and eliminate disparities.           ",School environments and adolescents weight status and physical activity patterns,7913027,K01HD058042,"['Diet ', ' Dietary intake ', ' Low income ', ' Economics ', ' Environment ', ' Address ', ' Epidemic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Data ', ' Health Sciences ', ' Stratification ', ' Characteristics ', ' socioeconomics ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomic ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio economic ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Adolescence ', ' teenage ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' Food ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Affect ', ' base ', ' food resource ', ' racial/ethnic difference ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Area ', ' Adolescent ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Influentials ', ' Training ', ' Physical activity ', ' Individual ', ' Policy Maker ', ' sugar ', ' Development Plans ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methods ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Obesity ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Poverty ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' fast food ', ' convenience food ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Schools ', ' Sociology ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Students ', ' Translating ', ' Weight Gain ', ' wt gain ', ' body weight increase ', ' body weight gain ', ' Weight Increase ', ' Weight ', ' Work ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' Award ', ' Pattern ', ' Behavior ', ' Equation ', ' peer ', ' social ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child health care ', ' Child Health ', ' Hispanics ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Mediating ', ' Modeling ', ' career development ', ' theories ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' sweetened beverage ', ' Minority ', ' Consumption ', ' Coupled ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' racial/ethnic ', ' fruits and vegetables ', ' effective intervention ', ' population health ', ' social health determinants ', ' ']",NICHD,BOSTON CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL,K01,2010,125820,0.048306177800623726
"Adolescent Experiences and Adult Cardiovascular Health: Effects of the Social and    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Childhood socioeconomic status (SES) has been associated with adult cardiovascular disease, but the mechanisms of how this occurs have not been fully explored. Furthermore, low SES is associated with the co-occurrence of multiple social (i.e., increased violence exposure), physical (i.e., higher air pollution levels, poor access to recreational facilities and access to fresh fruits and vegetables) and behavioral (i.e., poor diet, low physical activity, tobacco use) risk factors associated with cardiovascular disease. However, exposures to these factors during childhood and adolescence have not been evaluated with respect to their role in the development of metabolic and cardiovascular risk profiles in a prospective study. Given the complexity of interactions (individual and neighborhood, social and physical) a life course framework may be a fruitful approach to exploring the individual exposures and social attributes of neighborhoods that contribute to the development of metabolic and cardiovascular risk profiles. This proposal aims to examine the contribution of social stressors and physical environment experienced at both the individual and neighborhood level during adolescence, and their interactions on the development of cardiovascular and metabolic risk profiles (i.e., blood pressure, CRP, Hemoglobin A1c, BMI, waist circumference, total cholesterol, triglycerides, LDL, HDL, non-HDL cholesterol). The research goals of this proposal will be achieved with two projects. First, using the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health), a longitudinal cohort of adolescents followed through adulthood, I will employ a life course approach to determine whether social stressors (i.e., interpersonal violence, school and community violence) and physical environment (i.e., access to food stores, proximity to parks and recreation) experienced in adolescence plays a role in the development of metabolic and cardiovascular risk profiles in adulthood. Interactive effects between social and physical environmental factors will also be examined. Second, I will develop a primary collection cross-sectional study of 100 adolescents to examine the mediating effect of diet (not available in Add Health) and the modifying effects of air pollutants (also not available in the Add Health study) on the stress-cardiovascular health relationship. I will dedicate no less than 75 percent of my time to a highly structured and intensely focused research experience over the next 5 years, which will extend my expertise in characterizing social and environmental determinants as stressors in relation to physiological outcomes in children and young adults. A career development plan is outlined to gain practical skills in research design and implementation, expertise in statistical models to predict air pollutant levels and structural equation models as well as knowledge in the mechanisms of cardiovascular and metabolic disorders. The career development plan includes: 1) formal graduate course work in survey design, latent statistical models, mechanisms of cardiovascular disease, 2) tutorial with project advisor to learn clinical aspects of cardiovascular and metabolic disorders in adolescents 3) tutorial with advisor to discuss air pollutant modeling strategies 4) interactions with mentoring team to discuss research and career goals and project progress. I will work closely with the mentoring team which collectively has extensive experience in mentoring new clinical investigators, disparities in psychosocial factors, life experiences and cardiovascular disease outcomes, effects of neighborhood environment and cardiovascular disease, and disparities in physical environmental factors. The proposed training, consisting of interactions with mentors and advisors, tutorials and coursework, complements my previous training and experience in social and environmental epidemiologic research and will allow me to develop the necessary transdisciplinary expertise to achieve my goal and successfully transition to independent investigator at the end of this award. The proposed project will focus on a major health problem in the U.S. - cardiovascular disease, particularly its onset during the adolescent years and explore new models of how individual and community factors, in this case exposure to violence and environmental toxins, impact health outcomes. Findings from these studies can inform clinical practice in chronic disease prevention so that providers and policymakers alike can tailor age appropriate interventions to adolescents and young adults that jointly address the individual as well as the environmental context to more effectively reduce cardiovascular disease risk.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Childhood socioeconomic status (SES) has been associated with adult cardiovascular disease, but the mechanisms of how this occurs have not been fully explored.

"The Demography of Prisoner Reentry: Residential Moves & Changing Social Contexts    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Incarceration represents an important change in the life course that can affect individuals' health and well- being, that of their families, and that of their communities. Over the last two decades, the number of individuals incarcerated in prisons and jails in the United States has risen dramatically. The large number of individuals exiting prison every year represents an important demographic phenomenon that has received relatively little attention from researchers, despite renewed interest among policy makers in integrating former prisoners back into society. Many of these ex-prisoners are returning to very disadvantaged neighborhood environments. Neighborhoods with high unemployment, poverty and crime rates are likely to have fewer resources that address the health and economic needs of returning prisoners, exert lower levels of social control over former prisoners, and present former prisoners with greater opportunities to return to substance use. Still, very little is known about where people live when they leave prison, how often they move, or which former prisoners experience ""upward"" residential mobility. Securing stable housing is one of the most important challenges for returning prisoners, yet no prior study has examined the residential mobility or living arrangements of released prisoners. The proposed research involves assembling administrative data through a unique arrangement with the Michigan Department of Corrections (MDOC) and prospectively analyzing the neighborhood contexts and living arrangements of returning parolees. This research would fill an important gap in the literatures on residential mobility, neighborhood context, and prisoner reentry, which have largely ignored the neighborhood contexts of the returning prisoner population. The specific aims are as follows: (1) To assemble, clean, geocode, and merge data from three sources on a one-third sample of parolees released from Michigan prisons in 2003: (a) prospective, spatially-referenced MDOC administrative records, (b) tract-level contextual data from both MDOC administrative records and the U.S. Census, and (c) Michigan Unemployment Insurance records. (2) To understand the social and institutional processes that sort returning parolees into different (a) neighborhood environments and (b) living arrangements (e.g., living alone, with a spouse, with other family, in a drug treatment center, or in a homeless shelter) upon their release from prison. (3) To understand the social and institutional processes that shape the residential mobility trajectories of returning parolees. The proposed project is exploratory in that it is the first to assemble and analyze a rich set of administrative records on individual parolees and to link these records with data on neighborhood context, a complex task that requires the time and expertise to code and verify information reported in parole agent case notes. It is also developmental in that it represents the first step in a larger trajectory of research examining the social conditions that affect the health and well-being of returning prisoners, a particularly vulnerable population. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Incarceration represents an important change in the life course that can affect individuals' health and well- being, that of their families, and that of their communities.

"Measuring the effects of In-Place Subsidized Housing: A Randomized Experiment for    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  From a public health perspective, moving to subsidized housing, to less poor neighborhoods, to housing developments with low rates of crime, or to more mixed income settings might reduce health disparities between children and families who have low income and those who do not. Children and young adolescents may be particularly influenced by housing given that they spend a large proportion of their time in their home neighborhood where the accessibility and quality of local amenities and institutions matter, and because they are influenced by their parents' responses to residential location. Receipt of in-place subsidized housing, the focus of our proposal, may help to improve the health and developmental trajectories of at-risk youth through multiple pathways. The proposed experimental research will utilize the NYC Department of Housing Preservation and Development's lottery system to identify treatment and control households that fit our study criteria. Group assignment will include families with children who move to a subsidized apartment in one of eleven newly constructed housing sites (treatment) and matched families who do not receive housing (control). This proposal's design improves and expands upon the design of earlier housing experiments in that it (a) compares the impact of moving to a new neighborhood versus staying in the same neighborhood among recipients of subsidized housing, (b) compares the impact of moving into mixed-income versus solely low- income buildings, (c) examines the impact of subsidized housing on near-poor families (rather than just families below the poverty threshold), (d) examines the effect of subsidized housing where the uptake of the offer is 90% (rather than less than one-half in Moving to Opportunity), and (e) examines the effect of subsidized housing where the families are likely to stay in the subsidized housing (in Moving to Opportunity, over half of those who did move ended up moving again, typically back to poor neighborhoods). Our proposed data collection strategy will include baseline data collection at time of application for housing, using a self-administered questionnaire to be completed by the primary caregiver and augmented by information obtained from the housing application itself. Follow-up assessments will include in-person interviews with the primary caregiver and detailed information on up to two co-resident children for each participating household. Our follow-up information on children will be collected by proxy for children under age eight and in-person with children ages eight to eighteen. Experimental analyses will be used to quantify the impact of moving to subsidized housing and additional exploratory analyses will be conducted to investigate the potential benefits of housing relative to neighborhoods and assess evidence of differential impacts among those receiving particular types of subsidized housing. Relationships among household, housing, and neighborhood features will be examined as potential outcomes as well as mediators of individual-level health outcomes.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The health of children and adults is influenced by the environments in which they live. Experimental research has shown that moving to new housing in particular kinds of neighborhoods may improve the life chances of poor families; however, previous research confounded housing- and neighborhood mobility and did not investigate the benefits of mixed-income housing developments.

"Harlem Community Academic Partnership: Influenza Immunizations    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Proposed is a community based participatory research project (CBPR) and evaluation for improving influenza immunizations in high risk populations within disadvantaged minority communities. The Harlem Community and Academic Partnership (HCAP)'s Board includes residents, community based organizations, academic partners and the local health department who meet monthly to plan, conduct and review neighborhood assessments, interventions and evaluation activities; topic-specific issues are addressed through formation of Intervention Work Groups (IWGs). The HCAP Board noted especially low rates of influenza immunizations in Harlem and formed the VIVA (Venue Intensive Vaccine for Adults) IWG. This IWG has conducted separate pilots including a survey on barriers to immunization, development of culturally informed intervention materials, a pilot of ""yellow jacket"" outreach workers to engage and educate hard-to reach populations, and provision of immunizations at non-traditional sites. The goal of this proposal is to assemble these components to formally scale up and test the intervention for adults in the Harlem communities. To achieve these aims, the HCAP VIVA IWG will plan, organize and implement an intervention; our primary partner, Palladia Inc, provides outreach educators and a service network of over 120 CBOs to educate and mobilize the community for immunization as well as coordinate congregating persons with traditional and new non-traditional venues for immunizations; the local Visiting Nurse Service has agreed to provide nurses and influenza vaccines at the selected venues gratis. This program does not replace, but rather supplements existing vaccination programs in the city by adding more relevant education and new ""non-traditional"" venues. We expect that this program will increase rates of immunizations overall including the hard-to-reach populations. To evaluate this program, we will compare annual rates of immunization between Harlem and communities similar to Harlem in NYC, with data available by neighborhood through the NYC annual ""Community Health Survey"" (modified BRFSS from CDC) which includes 10,000 adult NYC residents. We will also conduct two cross sectional street intercept surveys (n=800) before and after each annual intervention program between harlem and comparison community residents. These data combined with yearly inventories of CBOs, will provide measures of barriers, intervention experiences and outcomes to broaden input for continuous program improvement.          ",Harlem Community Academic Partnership: Influenza Immunizations,7778895,R24MD002754,"['Disadvantaged ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Elements ', ' Address ', ' AIDS prevention ', ' HIV/AIDS prevention ', ' HIV Prevention ', ' AIDS/HIV prevention ', ' Data ', ' Mutate ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Principal Investigator ', ' Process ', ' Community Health ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Influenza A Virus, H5N1 Subtype ', ' avian influenza H5N1 virus ', ' avian influenza H5N1 ', ' H5N1 virus ', ' H5N1 ', ' pandemic disease ', ' pandemic ', ' Avian Influenza ', ' influenza in birds ', ' avian flu ', ' Fowl Plague ', ' Fowl Pest ', ' Bird Flu ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' base ', ' Goals ', ' Group Meetings ', ' improved ', ' Health ', ' Health Promotion ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' Health Surveys ', ' working group ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Immunization Programs ', ' Immunization ', ' Immunostimulation ', ' Immunological Stimulation ', ' Immunological Sensitization ', ' Immunologic Stimulation ', ' Immunologic Sensitization ', ' Influenza ', ' influenza infection ', ' flu infection ', ' Grippe ', ' Influenza virus vaccine ', ' Influenza Vaccines ', ' Flu vaccine ', ' Equipment and supply inventories ', ' Inventory ', ' Evaluation ', ' Joints ', ' Articulation ', ' Learning ', ' post intervention ', ' Trust ', ' Methods ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Mission ', ' Motivation ', ' Persons ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' New York ', ' New York City ', ' Nurses ', ' Nursing Services ', ' Online Systems ', ' web based ', ' online computer ', ' On-Line Systems ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Social support ', ' social support network ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Testing ', ' Vaccination ', ' Influenza vaccination ', ' flu immunisation ', ' Prophylactic vaccination against influenza ', ' Influenza immunization ', ' Flu vaccination ', ' Vaccines ', ' Adopted ', ' Attitude ', ' Visiting Nurse ', ' Home Health Nursing ', ' Work ', ' Yellow Jackets ', ' Awareness ', ' Source ', ' meetings ', ' Services ', ' experience ', ' Intercept ', ' intervention program ', ' Structure ', ' disorder prevention ', ' disease prevention ', ' outreach ', ' social ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' CDC ', ' Measures ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' response ', ' Cities ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Communities ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' scale up ', ' Population ', ' novel vaccines ', ' next generation vaccines ', ' new vaccines ', ' community based participatory research ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' high risk ', ' group intervention ', ' social health determinants ', ' Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System ', ' Behavior Risk Factor Surveillance System ', ' BRFSS ', ' Healthy People 2010 ', ' Provider ', ' ']",NIMHD,NEW YORK ACADEMY OF MEDICINE,R24,2010,571153,0.05542685893538761
"Neighborhood Poverty, Health and Economic Security Over the Adult Lifespan OTHER PROJECT INFORMATION - Project Summary/Abstract This proposal seeks support to add detailed measures of health and economic security to a long-term follow-up study of low-income middle and older aged adults participating in a unique randomized neighborhood mobility experiment know as Moving to Opportunity (MTO). The MTO demonstration used a randomized lottery to offer some public housing residents but not others the chance to relocate to less disadvantaged neighborhoods using a rental housing subsidy. MTO experimentally generated large difference in neighborhood characteristics for otherwise comparable groups of low-income, disproportionately minority families. At the time of our proposed survey fieldwork (10 to 12 years after random assignment) 31% of the adult sample will be age 50 or older, with a mean age of 46.8. An interim study found that compared to the control group, adults in the treatment groups had substantially lower estimated prevalence of serious mental illness 4-7 years after randomization, were 20% less likely to be obese and showed signs of improved diet and exercise, but had no differences in labor market outcomes. However environmental toxicity, dietary quality, physical activity and the burdens of psychosocial stress are difficult to capture through surveys. The effects of MTO on economic security could potentially increase over time due to health improvements or if adults become more socially integrated into their new areas, but the possibility of convergence across groups in neighborhood attributes over time suggests labor market impacts could instead attenuate over time. This proposal has four main aims: "" To expand our long-term data collection to administer to all MTO adults a set of detailed assessments of  health (including blood samples to measure disease precursors such as cholesterol, C-reactive protein,  and glycosylated hemoglobin)and DSM-IV mental health disorders, and indicators of economic security  such as earnings, savings, assets, and participation in programs such as TANF or SSI. The interim MTO  impacts on diet, exercise and obesity are about as large as those found with public health lifestyle  interventions, which have been shown to impact biomarkers of the sort we propose to collect for MTO. "" To estimate long-term effects of the MTO experiment on these outcomes in the total sample and sub- samples defined by age, gender, and other baseline risk factors. "" To decompose the total effects of the intervention on these outcomes and narrow down the the set of  behavioral mechanisms through which the aggregate effects occurred. "" To develop a public MTO data archive that is made available for secondary analysis. The overarching goal is to better understand the effects of MTO and neighborhood mobility on adult long-term health and economic security as well as the processes by which these outcomes are affected. This study will help shed light on larger disparities in health and economic outcomes across race and class lines. NIA funding is essential to administer the full range of outcomes described here to all MTO adults. This project examines whether disparities in health and other outcomes can be explained in part by the  increased likelihood that low-income and minority adults live in high-poverty, highly-disadvantaged  neighborhoods. It will draw on biomeasures, surveys and other data from a unique housing-mobility  experiment known as Moving to Opportunity (MTO) that helps overcome the self-selection problems that  plague most previous research in the area of neighborhoods and health.","Neighborhood Poverty, Health and Economic Security Over the Adult Lifespan",7760124,R56AG031259,"['Crime ', ' Data Collection ', ' Decision Making ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Quetelet index ', ' BMI z-score ', ' BMI percentile ', ' Body mass index ', ' Low income ', ' Economics ', ' Environment ', ' Data ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Randomized ', ' Collection ', ' Security ', ' Process ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' Family ', ' Followup Studies ', ' Follow-Up Studies ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Future ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' base ', ' Goals ', ' Aging ', ' Health ', ' Housing ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Biological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-IV ', ' Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th edition ', ' DSM4 ', ' DSM-IV ', ' Physical activity ', ' Distress ', ' life course ', ' Life Cycle ', ' Life Cycle Stages ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Light ', ' Literature ', ' lifespan ', ' life span ', ' Length of Life ', ' Longevity ', ' Longterm Effects ', ' Long-Term Effects ', ' Funding ', ' Marketing ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Obesity ', ' Professional Postions ', ' Jobs ', ' Occupations ', ' Yersinia pestis disease ', ' Plague ', ' Poverty ', ' Poverty Areas ', ' Exposure to ', ' Attenuated ', ' Productivity ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Housing ', ' QOL ', ' Quality of life ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Savings ', ' Archives ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Victimization ', ' Survey Method ', ' Survey Methodology ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Time ', ' Attitude ', ' Weight ', ' Work ', ' waist circumference ', ' Height ', ' psychological disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Mental disorders ', ' physical health ', ' physical conditioning ', ' experience ', ' Toxicities ', ' Toxic effect ', ' Disease Outcome ', ' Participant ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' research study ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' sorting ', ' Sorting - Cell Movement ', ' social ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', ' youngster ', ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' psychological distress ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' Sampling ', ' voucher ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Communities ', ' cost ', ' health economics ', ' Minority ', ' diet and exercise ', ' serious mental illness ', ' severe mental illness ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' Psychosocial Stress ', ' aged ', ' life style intervention ', ' lifestyle intervention ', ' economic outcome ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' intervention effect ', ' ']",NIA,NATIONAL BUREAU OF ECONOMIC RESEARCH,R56,2010,198138,0.14464832661446464
"Social and Family Environments and Child Obesity in Diverse Neighborhoods    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): My long-term career goal is to establish a center that conducts interdisciplinary research to address public health problems that afflict culturally diverse immigrants. My shorter-term objective is to enrich my current research program with new theories, methods, and approaches from the fields of sociology, demography, and psychology to address health disparities, with a focus on child obesity in immigrant populations. To do this, I propose to take time off from my regular teaching, advising and departmental responsibilities to focus on learning theories and methods used in the social sciences, particularly sociology.  Trained in nutrition and epidemiology, I have shifted my research from the investigation of individual risk factors for obesity to the investigation of environmental risk factors. Since 2002, I have focused my research on studying neighborhood environments and in particular, how the presence (or absence) of different types of food stores (supermarkets, convenience stores, small 'corner' markets, etc.) and restaurants may shape people's eating behaviors. In the process, I realized that the theories derived from nutritional epidemiology do not adequately explain the processes whereby neighborhoods contribute to obesity. In particular, I am keen to learn how social and family processes influence people's food and physical activity behaviors, which are the factors known to affect obesity development. Accordingly, I wish to formally train with an established sociologist and social demographer in order to learn new theories and methodologies.  For this application, I have proposed a training program that will give me protected time to learn about those theories and methods used in sociology that are relevant to understanding how societies and families influence obesity risk in children and adolescents. I will have Dr. Anne Pebley, a sociologist and social demographer at UCLA, as my primary mentor. Dr. Pebley co-directs the NIH-funded Los Angeles Family and Neighborhood Study (L.A.FANS), which has been researching how communities and neighborhoods affect health and well-being and also children's development. I will use the data collected by L.A.FANS as a 'training ground' for understanding how social and family processes are measured and interpreted in ways that are relevant to the study of obesity. I hope this will enrich my current research program with new theories and approaches for addressing the obesity crisis and the social disparities in health that result from it.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: One of the most serious public health issues facing our country today is obesity. Obesity rates have been climbing quickly and are higher in socially disadvantaged groups, where social issues present barriers to the effective implementation of traditional public health education programs. The most cost-effective way to address obesity is through prevention especially during childhood and adolescence. This application proposes to train a mid-level nutrition researcher in theories and approaches applied in the social sciences so as to enrich her current child obesity research program, hence providing her with the interdisciplinary knowledge and skills helpful for addressing social disparities in obesity.           Project Summary  One of the most serious public health issues facing our country today is obesity.

"Neighborhood and Family Effects on Disparities in Chronic Disease    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There is increasing evidence that the social and physical environments in which individuals live may play a key role in health disparities by race/ethnicity and socioeconomic status. The goal of this study is to significantly advance our knowledge about the role of specific family and neighborhood characteristics for disparities in the emergence of chronic disease and its precursors during childhood and adolescence. This project is based on the Los Angeles Family and Neighborhood Survey (L.A.FANS), a longitudinal study of neighborhoods, families, adults, and children in Los Angeles County. The first wave (L.A.FANS-1), completed in January 2002, interviewed adults and children living in 3,090 households in a stratified probability sample of 65 neighborhoods throughout Los Angeles County. The second wave (L.A.FANS-2) is in the field and will be completed in 2008. This project will use these data to analyze the effects of specific family and neighborhood characteristics on asthma, obesity, glucose metabolism, hypertension, and metabolic syndrome. These conditions are increasing in prevalence and importance among the population and represent a major component of overall health disparities by race/ethnicity and socioeconomic status. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This study will test hypotheses about the effects of family and neighborhood characteristics on disparities in chronic disease among children using new data from a longitudinal survey of health in Los Angeles County. The results will provide new information on the causes of and potential strategies to reduce race/ethnic and SES disparities in health during childhood and over the life- course.          ",Neighborhood and Family Effects on Disparities in Chronic Disease,7885543,R01HD058514,"['health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' type II DM ', ' type 2 DM ', ' maturity onset diabetes ', ' ketosis resistant diabetes ', ' adult onset diabetes ', ' Type II diabetes ', ' Type II Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Type 2 diabetes ', ' Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus ', ' T2DM ', ' T2D ', ' T2 DM ', ' Stable Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Slow-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Noninsulin Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Non-Insulin Dependent Diabetes ', ' NIDDM ', ' Maturity-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' MODY ', ' Ketosis-Resistant Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Adult-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Environment ', ' Social Network ', ' Data ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Behavioral ', ' Family ', ' Family Characteristics ', ' Adolescence ', ' teenage ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' Food ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' base ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Health Surveys ', ' Household ', ' Hypertension ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' high blood pressure ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Biological ', ' Adolescent ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Interview ', ' Investments ', ' disability ', ' Childhood ', ' pediatric ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' insight ', ' Life Cycle Stages ', ' life course ', ' Life Cycle ', ' Individual ', ' Literature ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' Los Angeles ', ' Policies ', ' Measurement ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Childhood Asthma ', ' Pediatric asthma ', ' Asthma in Children ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Mortality ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Respondent ', ' Immigrant ', ' Obesity ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Parents ', ' Peer Group ', ' Physicians ', ' Play ', ' Probability Samples ', ' Shapes ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Research ', ' Residential Mobility ', ' Residential Selections ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Schools ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Asthma ', ' Bronchial Asthma ', ' Dimensions ', ' Physical environment ', ' glucose metabolism ', ' Population Study ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' Reporting ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' social ', ' County ', ' Measures ', ' National origin ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child health care ', ' Child Health ', ' Cholesterol ', ' Cholest-5-en-3-ol (3beta)- ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Latino ', ' Longitudinal Surveys ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' chronic disorder ', ' chronic disease/disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Sampling ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Metabolic syndrome ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' cost effective ', ' cost-effective ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' public health relevance ', ' biomarker ', ' ']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R01,2010,397598,0.15528538707500236
"Community Mapping of Environmental Hazards and Barriers in an Immigrant Populatio    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Community Mapping of Environmental Hazards and Barriers in an Immigrant Population Abstract The proposed project addresses broad Challenge Area (09), Health Disparities, and specific Challenge Topic 09-ES-101, ""Building trust between researchers and communities through capacity building in Environmental Public Health"". It is designed to address a major gap in health prevention for minority communities by bringing together researchers and members of an underserved racial/ethnic community to produce a collaboratively developed profile of neighborhood environmental hazards and barriers to health care access. In particular, this work will build on a developmental community-based participatory research project focused on the recently high profile concerns of health risks from chemical exposures in the burgeoning nail salon industry, an industry dominated in California by Vietnamese immigrant workers. With that as a starting point, we will conduct an equal partnership community mapping project, bringing expertise in the use of geographic information systems (GIS) tools from the research partner together with the knowledge and perceptions of the community partner to characterize neighborhood work and residential environments influencing the health risks of Vietnamese immigrants. It is anticipated that this partnership will provide greater insights into factors associated with the increasing adverse health experience of Vietnamese immigrants in the US, as well as provide an opportunity to empower community members to better illustrate and articulate their concerns to the health care establishment and local government. The aims of this community mapping project are to: 1) Identify community-perceived economic, environmental, social and built environmental stressors and health access barriers through a series of focus groups with Vietnamese community members, stratified by general age groups. 2) Create initial community maps using existing data sources to characterize differences in economic, environmental, social and built environmental stressors across neighborhoods. 3) Develop and implement a community mapping survey tool for collecting neighborhood-level information to enhance baseline community maps (Aim 2). a. Develop a community mapping survey instrument to collect information on community-perceived stressors and barriers (identified from Aim 1). b. Engage Vietnamese nail salon workers in the collection of neighborhood data to describe community- perceived stressors and barriers. c. Collect air monitoring data on diesel exhaust, an air contaminant of known high community concern, to assess differences in levels across neighborhoods and evaluate existing data on this contaminant. 4) Develop enhanced community maps using existing and newly-collected data (Aim 3) to describe variations in neighborhood economic, environmental, social and built environmental stressors.

"North Lawndale Diabetes Community Action Project     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The North Lawndale Diabetes Community Action Project addresses Challenge Area Comparative Effectiveness Research and the specific Challenge Topic 05-MD-102 Prevention of Chronic Diseases in Disparity Populations. The Sinai Urban Health Institute, Sinai Health Systems, Rush University Medical Center and a community based organization (Family Focus North Lawndale) are proposing to develop and deliver a multi- level community intervention using a media campaign, community engagement, and individual self- management training by ""Diabetes Block Captains (DBC)"" in a very poor African American community on the west side of Chicago. Neighborhood residents working as DBCs will conduct household screenings for diabetes and then will engage their neighbors in activities that promote diabetes self-management. This Community Based Participatory Research (CBPR) approach seeks to support residents in changing the culture within the target community, to make diabetes a neighborhood priority, and to address the cultural and social environment to support healthier lifestyles. This is a collaborative research approach, drawing on the strengths of several partners and incorporating full and meaningful participation by the community. Our goal is to survey 2,500 persons in the neighborhood identifying persons with both confirmed diabetes status and those at high risk for the chronic disease over a 12-week recruitment period, with the intention of completing an entire 12-month intervention with 280 enrolled participants. DBCs will make 4 home visits over the course of the intervention, during which they will develop comprehensive action plans to improve diabetes self-management. Our primary aim is to determine whether a multi-level community intervention, featuring an educational campaign, community engagement, and individual self-management training by a ""Diabetes Block Captain"" will result in a mean reduction of HbA1c greater than 0.5 among persons with type 2 diabetes mellitus living in a medically underserved urban neighborhood. Our 2 secondary goals are to a) demonstrate the cost-effectiveness of a multi-level community intervention resulting from significant improvements in rates of diabetes self-management behaviors among persons with type 2 diabetes mellitus; and b) determine whether this multi-level community intervention can improve early detection of diabetes in a medically underserved urban neighborhood by increasing the number of persons diagnosed by at least 25 percent over a one-year period. Evaluation activities will focus on documenting the process of the intervention and the associated outcomes (effectiveness). Outcomes will be evaluated using a treatment-only quasi-experimental design in which the primary aim will be evaluated by a within-subject comparison of HbA1C, a marker of blood glucose control and demonstrated predictor of diabetes complications and mortality, between baseline and 2 follow-up testing periods. Self-management will be documented by use of the Summary of Diabetes Self-Care Activities measure (SDSCA), a validated instrument assessing general diet, specific diet, exercise, blood-glucose testing, foot care, and smoking behaviors. It will be administered at baseline and 1-yr anniversary follow-up. Poor self-management behaviors often lead to increased numbers of diabetes related hospitalizations and emergency room visits. We will assess whether the intervention has helped reduce costs associated with these chronic disease experiences. Monitoring of the process is particularly important as it will allow for an assessment of the intervention's translatability, documenting the successes and challenges of implementing the program within the target community, and paving the way for the translation of the initiative to other populations. Qualitative methods will supplement quantitative data collection in better documenting issues related to translatability, assessing both community strengths which facilitate implementation and challenges that impede upon it, and the process of addressing any barriers. The study has more than adequate power to detect effect sizes that are clinically meaningful. Substantial attention will be paid to matters of fidelity, uptake and other issues that will influence translatability. The project seeks to maximize the resources which will remain in the community at the end of the study. This includes the continued development of expertise in solving other health problems of the community. The public health relevance is that through this collaborative approach and implementation of an evidence-based intervention it is believed that the North Lawndale Community Action Project will significantly influence diabetes health disparities, ultimately helping to improve health equity. It is estimated that the direct medical care costs per person per year with diabetes is 2.3 times higher than for the person without diabetes. This Community Based Participatory Research (CBPR) approach seeks to support residents in changing the culture within the target community, to make diabetes a neighborhood priority, and to address the cultural and social environment to support healthier lifestyles. The public health relevance is that through this collaborative approach and implementation of an evidence-based intervention it is believed that the North Lawndale Community Action Project will significantly influence diabetes health disparities, ultimately helping to improve health equity.                   Program Director/Principal Investigator (Last, First, Middle): Whitman, Steven Project Narrative It is estimated that the direct medical care costs per person per year with diabetes is 2.3 times higher than for the person without diabetes.

"Neighborhood Characteristics and Diabetes Incidence in the Multiethnic Cohort Stu    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Candidate. The overarching goal of this Mentored Career Development Award (K01) is to provide Dr. Sinclair with the skills and experience to establish an independent program of diabetes-related disparities research. This career development award is grounded in a multilevel population health conceptual framework that merges advanced didactic instruction with individualized one-on-one mentorship. The advanced research training will serve to catalyze Dr. Sinclair's work, which focuses on unexplored contextual factors that contribute to diabetes prevalence and incidence. This award will provide her with time and salary support to develop an educational foundation and research program that broadens her capabilities to carry out multilevel health disparities research. To build this foundation, the training program consists of three core components: 1) formal coursework in epidemiology, biostatistics, Geographic Information Systems (GIS) technology, spatial analysis, and health disparities research, 2) mentored research training in multilevel modeling and GIS, and 3) instruction in the responsible conduct of research. Dr. Sinclair brings together an interdisciplinary mentorship board that offers extensive research experience and support of her career development program. The K01 award will allow her to benefit from a rich, multidisciplinary mentorship and training environment, which includes experts in epidemiology, biostatistics, GIS, diabetes, and health disparities research. Research Project. Dr. Sinclair proposes to empirically examine the spatial patterning and distribution of diabetes risk factors, prevalence and incidence among the Multiethnic Cohort Study participants by combining individual- and area-level data. The Multiethnic Cohort Study includes a diverse population-based sample of more than 100,000 Hawaiian residents, identified in 1993-1996, who have been followed for more than 15 years. In the proposed project, Dr. Sinclair will geocode the residential addresses of study participants at the time of entry into the cohort. Neighborhood socioeconomic status will be defined from the 1990 U.S. Census. Similarly, measures of neighborhood resources for physical activity and access to healthy foods will be defined. Research aims are to: 1) determine the cross-sectional association between neighborhood characteristics and the prevalence of diabetes and individual-level risk factors for diabetes, including obesity, poor diet, and low levels of physical activity, 2) assess the longitudinal association between neighborhood characteristics and the incidence of diabetes after adjustment for individual-level diabetes risk factors, and 3) examine if the association between neighborhood characteristics and diabetes prevalence and incidence differs by race and ethnicity. The use of a multilevel perspective can help to identify factors associated with diabetes-related disparities, and is congruent with the NIH strategic plan to move the country toward health equity. Findings from this study will illuminate the larger social and economic forces that create differences in health between neighborhoods, and identify geographical areas where traditional and novel public health interventions may best be targeted. The K01 award is critical to Dr. Sinclair's future as a diabetes researcher and will provide her with the time, mentorship, research skills, analytical training, and practical research experience to develop into an independently funded investigator in diabetes prevention and control among health disparate populations. Environment. The University of Hawaii at Manoa is a major education and research facility that serves as the center for research and advanced graduate and professional studies. The UH School of Medicine houses the largest biomedical research facility in Hawaii, and is the most culturally and ethnically diverse medical school in the U.S. Housed within the medical school is the Department of Native Hawaiian Health where Dr. Sinclair is a member of the research faculty. Laurence N. Kolonel, MD, PhD, will serve as Dr. Sinclair's primary mentor. Dr. Kolonel is a Professor at the UH Cancer Research Center and Principal Investigator of the Multiethnic Cohort Study from which Dr. Sinclair will draw her research project. The Cancer Research Center is an NCI- designated cancer center and receives funding from a Cancer Center Support Grant. The Center's mission is to reduce the burden of cancer through research, education, and service with an emphasis on the unique ethnic, cultural, and environmental characteristics of Hawaii and the Pacific. There are currently three cohort studies in the Epidemiology Program, including the Multiethnic Cohort Study. A GIS workgroup, of which Dr. Sinclair is a member, was recently formed to examine contextual factors and cancer incidence. There are several shared resources of the Cancer Center including the Hawaii Tumor registry which is a member of NCI's SEER Program; biostatistics which provides support for study design and data analysis; nutrition support which provides expertise in dietary questionnaire development and maintains extensive food and supplement composition databases; an analytical laboratory capable of analyzing biospecimens and foods for a wide array of constituents; a genomics laboratory which supports studies of genetic susceptibilities and whole-genome expression; and a bioinformatics group which supports the management and analysis of large and complex datasets. While the research activities of the faculty are varied, they are thematically related to the focus on ethnic diversity. 2   PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The NIDDK Mentored Research Scientist Development Award will allow for additional training and mentorship that will position Dr. Sinclair to become an independent investigator. She will need protected time to acquire the comprehensive training in health disparities research and multilevel modeling. Dr. Sinclair's proposed research is may aid in efforts to understand and address the persistent problem of inequalities in health from a multilevel perspective. The proposed research has the potential to move our current understanding of contextual/environmental factors and diabetes forward.        Relevance.

"Neighborhood Environments and Disparities in Obesity Rates in New York City    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project will determine whether racial/ethnic and socioeconomic disparities in the prevalence of obesity, sedentary lifestyles and poor diet in New York City are explained by disparities in neighborhood resources that support physical activity (e.g. gyms, parks, pleasant walking environments) and healthy diets (e.g. grocery stores, fruit markets, healthy food restaurants) across neighborhoods in New York. Obesity, sedentary lifestyles, and poor diets are major risk factors for the development of type 2 Diabetes and in New York City these risk factors are far more common among African Americans, Hispanics and those of lower socio-economic status. Prior research in New York City shows that neighborhood characteristics such as urban design features and neighborhood socioeconomic status predict body mass index (BMI). Furthermore, the availability of grocery stores, fruit markets, fast food restaurants, gyms and health clubs, vary by neighborhood in New York City, with minority and poorer neighborhoods having fewer positive resources. The proposed research is a collaboration between Columbia University and the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (NYCDOHMH). Interview data on demographic characteristics, physical activity, consumption of fruits and vegetables and height and weight (used to calculate BMI) from ~45,000 New Yorkers will be combined with a geographic information system (GIS) based model of the characteristics of New York City neighborhoods. The interview data and zip code of residence were collected as part of five annual citywide random digit dial interviews conducted by NYCDOHMH that occurred from 2002 to 2006, and the sample is representative of the city and its neighborhoods. The GIS model is being built as part of ongoing research on neighborhood effects and is the most comprehensive model of neighborhood resources in New York City built to date. The NYCDOHMH will contribute additional data on restaurant locations from the food service licensing database, locations of pedestrian injuries from automobiles, and neighborhood social capital from their neighborhood surveys. Neighborhoods will be defined using zip codes, and prior research has shown that variation in built and social environment variables at this level are strongly predictive of BMI. Multilevel models will be used to determine the extent to which neighborhood characteristics account for racial/ethnic and socioeconomic disparities in BMI, physical activity and consumption of fruits and vegetables across zip codes in New York City. In addition to analyzing the effects of race/ethnicity and socio-economic status the analyses will control for age, gender and U.S. or foreign born status, and the socio-demographic characteristics of the zip code of residence. This research will contribute to NIDDK's goal of understanding the underlying causes of disparities in the distribution of known risk factors for type 2 diabetes. Furthermore, the analyses will be used to guide New York City's ongoing long term planning process for using urban design to promote public health.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project will determine whether racial/ethnic and socioeconomic disparities in the prevalence of obesity, sedentary lifestyles and poor diet in New York City are explained by disparities in home neighborhood resources that support physical activity (e.g. gyms, parks, pleasant walking environments) and healthy diets (e.g. grocery stores, fruit markets, healthy food restaurants) across neighborhoods in New York.              This project will determine whether racial/ethnic and socioeconomic disparities in the prevalence of obesity, sedentary lifestyles and poor diet in New York City are explained by disparities in home neighborhood resources that support physical activity (e.g. gyms, parks, pleasant walking environments) and healthy diets (e.g. grocery stores, fruit markets, healthy food restaurants) across neighborhoods in New York.",Neighborhood Environments and Disparities in Obesity Rates in New York City,7812116,R01DK079885,"['density ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health Surveys ', ' National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences ', ' NIEHS ', ' sedentary ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Series ', ' Incidence ', ' Income ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Interview ', ' Physical activity ', ' farmer ', ' Life Style ', ' Lifestyle ', ' residence ', ' Individual ', ' Literature ', ' Databases ', ' data repository ', ' clinical data repository ', ' Electronic Database ', ' Electronic Databank ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Licensing ', ' Funding ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Marketing ', ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Morbidity -

"Reconceptualizing Socioeonomic Status and Health    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The primary question is whether collective neighborhood socioeconomic status influences the health of residents adjusting for their own personal or household socioeconomic statuses. If it does, the second question is how. To answer these questions, we propose a reconceptualization of socioeconomic status on both levels. If neighborhood socioeconomic statuses have an effect on residents' health over and above the impact of their own socioeconomic characteristics, we suggest that it is because collective socioeconomic statuses indicate concepts distinct from individual ones. The proposed project will consider the differences between what a measure indicates on the personal level that might affect health and what concept it indicates on the collective level that might affect health. Distinct concepts on the two levels likely have different associations with health and different pathways to health.  We delineate three elements of socioeconomic status on the personal and contextual levels: education, work/employment, and economic circumstances. On the neighborhood level we propose that education indicates collective human capital; employment, collective watch; and economic circumstances (especially home ownership), collective interest. Multi-level, multi-indicator structural equation models will allow us to distinguish separate elements of neighborhood socioeconomic status, which most previous research on neighborhoods and health has not. Distinguishing and defining elements of socioeconomic status on the personal and contextual level is the first step necessary in order to examine associations between health and neighborhood socioeconomic status and it's elements, and compare these results to personal socioeconomic statuses. For instance, on the personal level economic hardship may be the economic element with the strongest relationship to health; on the neighborhood level, the prevalence of home ownership may be. Next we propose to explain the associations. We focus on two main explanations linking neighborhoods to health: the neighborhood context of disorder and stress, and health lifestyle. The analyses will use data from our 1995 survey of Community, Crime and Health (CCH), a probability sample of Illinois households with linked census tract information, and a follow-up in 1998.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The project will examine whether collective socioeconomic status influences the health of residents adjusting for their own personal or household socioeconomic statuses. Results may suggest ways of decreasing health disparities, preventing health problems among residents of disadvantaged neighborhoods, and improving public health.           The project will examine whether collective socioeconomic status influences the health of residents adjusting for their own personal or household socioeconomic statuses.

"Social and Neighborhood Predictors of Obesity in Belo Horizonte    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Obesity has emerged as a major and growing public health problem in Latin America, and specifically in Brazil. Social and physical environments have been hypothesized to be major determinants of obesity but their contribution to obesity in developing countries has been infrequently examined. This project will establish a collaboration between the Federal University of Minas Gerais and the Center for Social Epidemiology and Population Health of the University of Michigan to investigate the role of socioeconomic and neighborhood factors in shaping the distribution of obesity and the related behaviors of diet and physical activity in Belo Horizonte, a large city in Brazil. Using data from a large population-based survey of Belo Horizonte we will (1) examine socioeconomic predictors of obesity, diet, and physical activity (2) test and examine the measurement properties of instruments to measure neighborhood physical and social environments potentially related to cardiovascular risk in the context of a large Latin American; (3) use these instruments to examine associations between neighborhood environments and obesity, diet and physical activity (4) investigate the contribution of these neighborhood factors to the socioeconomic patterning of cardiovascular risk factors in Belo Horizonte. This research will be done primarily at the School of Medicine of the Federal University of Minas Gerais in Belo Horizonte, Brazil in collaboration with Fernando Proietti and Waleska Caiaffa as an extension of NIH. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Obesity has emerged as major health problem in Latin America. Although social and physical environments (including features of the neighborhoods where people live) have been hypothesized to contribute to obesity these factors remain understudied especially in countries of Latin America.

"Neighborhood Effects on Weight Change and Diabetes Risk Factors    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Diabetes is increasing at an alarming rate. Between 1980 and 2004, as obesity increased, the number of Americans with diabetes more than doubled. Individuals from minority, low-income and low education populations are disproportionately affected by diabetes (and by complication of diabetes), and these socioeconomic disparities may be growing. Health disparities are often attributed to differences in medical care or self-care, but data suggest that these individual level factors explain few of the existing disparities. Neighborhood environments are increasingly recognized as exerting influence on diet, on physical activity and on outcomes of chronic disease. The present proposal is based on the theory that the immediate neighborhood environment of a person living with diabetes may influence decisions and actions related to food procurement, weight status, diabetes self-care behaviors and cardiometabolic markers and, ultimately, on incidence of complications of diabetes. The proposed research project will assess neighborhood-level influences on health such as accessibility to supermarkets, the ratio of fast food and convenience store to supermarkets and produce vendors, and household food security, by collecting a broad range of data on participants' communities in an ongoing study of ethnic disparities in diabetes outcomes. Neighborhood- level data will be collected and linked to a vast array of detailed individual-level socio-demographic, behavioral, cardiometabolic and complications data existing on this cohort. The project's specific aims are: 1) to create a longitudinal database of neighborhood characteristics; 2) to assess the effect of the neighborhood food environement on cardiometabolic markers of risk among persons with diabetes; and, 3) to determine individual- and neighborhood-level factors on the causal pathway between the neighborhood food environment and cardiometabolic markers of risk among persons with diabetes. This study involves data collection and analysis of compositional (e.g., census), contextual (e.g., food resources), and spatially derived data (e.g., access to food resource) on health behaviors and cardiometabolic risk factors among persons with diabetes. Accomplishing the aims of this proposal will expand current understanding of the neighborhood food, physical activity and social environments that contribute to good health, and will inform further study of alternative strategies for measurement and analysis of environmental influences on health. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed study aims to assess neighborhood-level factors that are associated with weight status, diabetes self-care behaviors and cardiometabolic risk factors in a cohort of adult diabetics. We will add neighborhood data, such as neighborhood socioeconomic status, location of supermarkets, fast food restaurants, alcohol outlets, and parks, to the ongoing Kaiser Permanente Division of Research ""Distance Study"". We will model the influence of neighborhood factors on weight status, diet, physical activity, glycemic control, lipid levels and blood pressure.

"The role of social factors in cardiovascular risk behaviors disparities    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Socioeconomic disparities in cardiovascular (CV) disease are evidenced by a 2.5 times higher risk of cardiovascular mortality for low-income Americans, when compared to those in the highest income bracket. Despite well-documented awareness that social environments can influence CV disease risk, and the increasing attention given to disparities research, there is relatively little knowledge of the underlying social pathways contributing to socioeconomic disparities, and socioeconomic disparities in CV disease have only widened in the last three decades. Socioeconomic disparities exist for many CV risk behaviors, including smoking, lack of physical activity and insufficient fruit and vegetable intake, and these disparities contribute to socioeconomic gradients in CV disease. These behaviors are shaped by social environmental resource factors, including social support, loneliness and neighborhood social cohesion. These three social environmental resource measures are independently associated with CV morbidity, but their role in CV risk behaviors is not well understood. Also, interaction between social resources is likely to have a ""multiplier effect"", where the net effect is greater than the sum of the individual effects. However, few studies utilize an ecological framework to identify the magnitude of these effects simultaneously. Furthermore, these social resource measures are often correlated with socioeconomic position (SEP), indicating that the resources may represent a fundamental social inequality. The purpose of this study is to examine the relationships among SEP and three distinct, but related, measures of social resources - social support (both emotional and instrumental), loneliness and neighborhood social cohesion - with CV risk behavior outcomes (smoking, lack of physical activity, and insufficient fruit and vegetable intake). The aims of this study are: 1) To examine associations of social support, loneliness and neighborhood social cohesion with CV risk behaviors after controlling for confounders. 2) To explore the interactions of social support, loneliness and neighborhood social cohesion as they relate to CV risk behaviors. 3) To determine the contributions of social support, loneliness and neighborhood social cohesion to SEP gradients in CV risk behaviors. This study will use cross-sectional data obtained by the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis, a prospective cohort study of a diverse, population-based sample of 6814 adults without apparent CVD from six US sites. Multi-level statistical modeling techniques will be used to test the proposed inter-relationships of SEP and the three social resource measures, based on an ecological framework.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Results of this study will elucidate the pathways that contribute to socioeconomic CV risk behavior disparities, responding to a NINR research priority area, and this knowledge may inform future research into other health disparities. This knowledge also is important for the development of socially and contextually based behavioral interventions for clinicians and researchers, meeting a critical need in health behavior research. Moreover, these findings may be used to improve patient advocacy and shape policies to address health disparities at a societal level.           Results of this study will elucidate the pathways that contribute to socioeconomic CV risk behavior disparities, responding to a NINR research priority area, and this knowledge may inform future research into other health disparities.

"Spatial Patterns of Social Isolation, Youthful Marijuana Use, and Sexual/HIV Risk    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The proposed study has two overarching aims: (1) to advance theory on the spatial dynamics of neighborhood exposure for understanding youthful health risk behavior; and (2) to model adolescent participation in high risk marijuana use (early onset and high frequency use) and co-morbid sexual/HIV risk behavior employing state- of-the-art GIS-derived measures of urban space and time use patterns, and recently developed hierarchical Bayesian models for multilevel and spatial data. Central to our analysis of the impact of neighborhood exposure is theoretically defining and empirically exploring the concept of social isolation as evident in space- time activity patterns at both the individual and neighborhood levels, and exploring the implications of this concept for youthful drug use and co-morbid HIV risk behavior. Social isolation represents the extent and character of connections between a focal individual or neighborhood and other communities. Individuals are potentially linked to a wide range of communities through regular activities such work, school, child care, health care, informal socializing, and religious activities. These patterns of non-residential community exposure will vary across individuals and, in the aggregate, across communities in ways that may be important for understanding variation and disparities (by gender, race-ethnicity, and immigrant status) among adolescents in the onset and frequency of using marijuana, and the extent to which youth engage in risky sexual activity. To address these questions, we use data from the Los Angeles Family and Neighborhood Survey (L.A. FANS) along with census data for the neighborhoods in which youth and their families reside as well as travel to through the course of their day. L.A. FANS includes information for a diverse sample of youth, their families, and neighborhoods within 65 randomly selected census tracts in Los Angeles County. The analyses focus on all persons in the sample between the ages of 12 and 17. Our analytic strategy relies on geospatial measurement techniques, geovisualization, and hierarchical Bayesian models for multilevel and spatial data to explore key hypotheses. Findings from the study have the potential to broaden understanding of the role of context in organizing problematic youthful marijuana use and co-morbid sexual/HIV risk behavior, the consequences of which may ramify throughout, or truncate, the life course. The proposed research will contribute to a better understanding of how the different neighborhood environments that youth and their families move through during the course of their daily lives affect high risk marijuana use and risky sexual activity among adolescents. These activities are of concern for public health because they put youth at risk for physical and mental health problems in the current stage of their lives and into the future. Findings from the research may suggest the extent to which interventions to address adolescent health risks should target neighborhoods that are the most isolated from contact with other areas, and whether such interventions would be more influential for some youth than others (girls versus boys, youth of color versus whites, immigrants versus non-immigrants).          ","Spatial Patterns of Social Isolation, Youthful Marijuana Use, and Sexual/HIV Risk",7894898,R01DA025415,"['Disadvantaged ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Environment ', ' Address ', ' social capital ', ' Data ', ' Characteristics ', ' sex ', ' socioeconomics ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomic ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio economic ', ' Family ', ' Female ', ' Male Adolescents ', ' adolescent boy ', ' Future ', ' Affect ', ' Geography ', ' Age ', ' base ', ' early onset ', ' Health ', ' HIV ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Man (Taxonomy) ', ' Area ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Adolescent ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Link ', ' Influentials ', ' Failure (biologic function) ', ' failure ', ' FLR ', ' Life Cycle Stages ', ' life course ', ' Life Cycle ', ' residence ', ' Individual ', ' Literature ', ' Los Angeles ', ' Measurement ', ' Drug usage ', ' drug use ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Marihuana ', ' marijuana ', ' Marijuana Smoking ', ' marijuana use ', ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Method LOINC Axis 6 ', ' Persons ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Immigrant ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' well-being ', ' Exposure to ', ' Staging ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Research ', ' Residence Characteristics ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Schools ', ' Sex Behavior ', ' sex activity ', ' Sexual Behavior ', ' Sexual Activity ', ' Social Environment ', ' socioenvironment ', ' social context ', ' social climate ', ' Social Interaction ', ' Social isolation ', ' Life ', ' Arts ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Time ', ' Travel ', ' Attention ', ' Attitude ', ' Work ', ' Frequencies (time pattern) ', ' Frequency ', ' Complex ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' Behavior ', ' experience ', ' Structure ', ' Participant ', ' Religion and Spirituality ', ' religious ', ' social ', ' Censuses ', ' County ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', ' Child Care ', ' Puericulture ', ' multilevel analysis ', ' multilevel modeling ', ' multilevel model ', ' methods to study multiple-level influences ', ' Geographic Information Systems ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Latino ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' boys ', ' girls ', ' Youth ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' theories ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Accounting ', ' Color ', ' Communities ', ' sex risk ', ' sexual risk behavior ', ' neglect ', ' time use ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' Adolescent Risk Behavior ', ' Youth Risk Behavior ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' protective effect ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' high risk ', ' ']",NIDA,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2010,349515,0.06017282366234667
"Health of Low-Income Adults in Subsidized Housing: Randomized Experiment, NY City    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): From a public health perspective, moving to subsidized housing, to less poor neighborhoods, to housing developments with low rates of crime, or to more mixed income settings might reduce health disparities through multiple pathways.  The proposed experimental research will utilize the NYC Department of Housing Preservation and Development's lottery system to identify treatment and control households that fit our study criteria. Group assignment will include households who move to a subsidized apartment in one of ten newly constructed housing sites (treatment) and matched households who do not receive housing (control). We estimate that our experimental sample will be comprised of about 1,300 participating treatment households and 1,690 lottery- matched controls.  This proposal's design improves and expands upon the design of earlier housing experiments in that it (a)  compares the impact of moving to a new neighborhood versus staying in the same neighborhood among  recipients of subsidized housing, (b) compares the impact of moving into mixed-income versus solely low-  income buildings, (c) examines the impact of subsidized housing on near-poor families (rather than just  families below the poverty threshold), (d) examines the effect of subsidized housing where the uptake of the  offer is 90% (rather than less than one-half in previous demonstrations of subsidized housing), and (e)  examines the effect of subsidized housing where the families are likely to stay in the subsidized housing  (compared to studies of vouchers, where over half of those who did move ended up moving again, typically  back to poor neighborhoods).  Our proposed data collection strategy will include baseline data collection at time of application for housing using a self-administered questionnaire to be completed by a single adult household member and augmented by information obtained from the housing application itself. Follow-up telephone interviews will take place 12-18 months after move-in, or equivalent for non-movers. A variety of information on current health status and health behaviors will be collected at baseline and follow-up to enable assessment of within-household change as well as average change between comparison groups at follow-up. Experimental analyses will be used to quantify the impact of moving to subsidized housing in a new neighborhood relative to moving to subsidized housing in the same neighborhood of residence at time of application. Exploratory analysis will compare two types of treatment: moves to mixed-income housing and exclusively low-income housing developments.  Relationships among household, housing, and neighborhood features will be examined as potential outcomes as well as mediators of individual-level health outcomes.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Experimental research has shown that moving to new housing in particular kinds of neighborhoods may improve the life chances of poor families; however, previous research confounded housing- and neighborhood mobility and did not investigate the benefits of mixed-income housing developments. Our randomized experiment will track about 1,300 households who receive city-subsidized housing and about 1,700 matched households who do not receive housing over the first 12-18 months after move-in to assess changes in physical and mental health, and health behaviors. In addition, we will explore changes in physical, economic, and social environments that may mediate the relationship between residential context and health and well-being of low-income residents.             Project Narrative: The Health of Low-Income Adults in NYC Subsidized Housing: A  Randomized experiment  Experimental research has shown that moving to new housing in particular kinds of  neighborhoods may improve the life chances of poor families; however, previous  research confounded housing- and neighborhood mobility and did not investigate the  benefits of mixed-income housing developments.

"Neighborhoods and Cardiovascular Risk in a Multiethnic Cohort    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There has been much recent interest in how features of residential environments (the built environment as well as social features of neighborhoods) affect the prevalence and development of cardiovascular disease and its risk factors, including obesity, diabetes, and hypertension. Identifying modifiable features of neighborhoods that contribute to cardiovascular risk would have important implications for the development of interventions and strategies to prevent cardiovascular disease and reduce social inequalities and race/ethnic differences in cardiovascular risk. Although randomized trials and/or evaluation of quasi experiments or natural experiments will ultimately be needed to determine the effectiveness of specific neighborhood-level interventions, rigorous observational work is still needed to determine what the most promising areas for intervention may be. However, very few observational studies have the type of detailed neighborhood and individual-level data necessary for this work. This competing renewal application builds on prior work conducted under R01 HL071759. As part of the prior project cycle we created a unique and rich dataset with a multiplicity of rigorous objective and survey-based measures of residential environments linked to the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA), a state-of-the art, longitudinal, population-based, multi-site and multi-ethnic epidemiologic study of cardiovascular disease. In this renewal we propose to enhance and update the neighborhood-level environmental measures to allow for methodologically rigorous longitudinal analyses that build on key findings of cross-sectional analyses conducted as part of the prior cycle. The Specific Aims of the project are: (1) To examine associations of specific neighborhood characteristics (including measures of access to healthy foods, walkability and urban design, access to recreational resources, and neighborhood stressors) with changes in diet, physical activity, and body weight over time; (2) To examine associations of neighborhood characteristics with incident diabetes and hypertension as well as with changes over time in continuous measures of insulin resistance and blood pressure (3) To examine associations of neighborhood characteristics with incident fatal and non fatal cardiovascular events; and (4)To investigate the contribution of neighborhood environments to race/ethnic and socioeconomic differences in longitudinal changes in risk factors and incident disease. In addition, the creation and maintenance of a rich data set on environmental features for MESA participants over time will generate a unique resource to be used in gene-environment interaction studies as MESA genotyping proceeds.

"Using Google Streetview to Measure Neighborhood Characteristics    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Racial, ethnic, and economic characteristics of neighborhoods have long been viewed by sociologists as determinants of socioeconomic attainment and social outcomes (most notably, crime and delinquency). More recently, interest has shifted to the role of neighborhood environments in shaping health and health disparities, following mounting evidence that poor health outcomes tend to cluster spatially. While social attributes of neighborhoods, such as social cohesion, collective efficacy, and demographic composition, can be measured using survey questions or existing censuses, measuring physical aspects of neighborhoods, including physical disorder and the built environment, usually require some form of systematic field observation. The high costs and logistical constraints of sending field observers to neighborhoods have greatly limited the inclusion of measures of neighborhood physical characteristics in analyses of health, with most such studies focusing on single cities and often on selected neighborhoods within cities. The proposed research will assess the feasibility, reliability, and validity of using new technology, freely available online via Google, to measure neighborhood physical disorder and built environment at a fraction of the cost of field studies. Specifically, we will develop procedures for using Google Earth and Google Street View to measure neighborhood physical disorder and the built environment, and evaluate the validity, reliability, cost- effectiveness, and psychometric properties of these procedures. Furthermore, we will assess the efficiency of alternative neighborhood spatial scales and block face sampling strategies within the Google Street View and Earth frameworks. The methodology we propose to develop has the potential to transform the way neighborhood data are collected, allowing the linkage of contextual data to local and national studies very inexpensively and creating unparalleled public resources for studying contextual influences on health and well-being. It will be particularly useful for large-sample, multi-site studies such as the new National Children's Study.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research will assess the feasibility, reliability, and validity of using new technology, freely available online via Google, to measure neighborhood physical disorder and built environment at a fraction of the cost of field studies.

"Neighborhoods, Speech Patterns, and Schooling    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal requests funding to launch a research program to understand how and why speech patterns vary across neighborhoods, as well as the implications of speech for the schooling outcomes of disadvantaged children. Speech is socially constructed, and so neighborhood environments may have some effect on the use of dialects such as African-American Vernacular English (AAVE). Previous research suggests use of AAVE is negatively associated with academic achievement, which could occur if AAVE makes it more difficult to read and write standard American English (SAE), or because use of AAVE may engender discrimination from teachers. We have assembled a team of leading economists and socio-linguists to address these questions by exploiting unique new speech data collected using comparable speech measures as part of the HUD-funded Moving to Opportunity (MTO) randomized mobility experiment, and as part of a major population study, the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth, 1997 cohort (NLSY97). We request funding for the following main aims:  1. Transcribe speech samples from MTO and NLSY97, categorize speech through listener perceptions of  the speaker's race, as well as linguistic analysis, which will include measurement of phonological,  morphosyntactic, phonetic, and acoustic features;  2. Document the amount of across-neighborhood variation in speech that exists in the national NLSY97  sample, and determine how much of this variation is accounted for by family background;  3. Estimate the causal effects of neighborhood environments on the speech patterns of some of our  nation's most disadvantaged minority children by exploiting the experimental design of MTO;  4. Use the NLSY97 to establish where in the national speech distribution MTO youth fall as a way of  understanding the magnitude of speech impacts and the generalizability of the MTO results;  5. Exploit variation in MTO children's age at baseline to determine how the sensitivity of speech to  environmental conditions varies by age (which has been a major question in the socio-linguistics field);  6. Determine whether the speech patterns of male and female youth respond differently to neighborhood  social environments, as research in socio-linguistics suggests could be the case and which in turn  could potentially explain gender differences in MTO impacts on youth found in previous MTO research;  7. Estimate non-experimentally the association between speech and schooling outcomes in the MTO and  NLSY97 data, and whether speech mediates neighborhood effects on schooling;  8. Create versions of the MTO and NLSY97 datasets to be made available for secondary analysis. Successfully addressing these aims would generate new evidence about how and why speech varies across neighborhoods and the potential implications of this speech variation for schooling outcomes, and would also help motivate and guide future research that seeks to identify the causal speech-schooling link.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This proposal requests funding to launch a research program to understand how and why speech patterns vary across neighborhoods, as well as the implications of speech patterns for the schooling outcomes of children growing up in disadvantaged communities.

"Causal Estimates of Neighborhood Poverty on Health and Mortality    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The disparities in the distribution of goods and services, and hazards and opportunities across space are increasing, underscoring the growing connection between place and health. Although ample evidence confirms that living in an economically disadvantaged neighborhood is associated with adverse health outcomes, the reliance on cross-sectional data and inadequate attention to two main sources of bias make causal inferences problematic. Residents tend to sort themselves into different types of neighborhoods based on a multitude of characteristics. Not accounting for all characteristics that are correlated to both the outcome and neighborhood context would likely lead to over-estimations of neighborhood effects. Because regression models cannot possibly account for all relevant factors, the strong possibility of unobserved heterogeneity make neighborhood effect studies open to criticisms of omitted variable bias. Yet, at the same time, neighborhood effect studies are also just as likely to be susceptible to bias due to over- adjustment. Many factors that are controlled for in neighborhood effect models, such as educational attainment, income, and employment, may arguably have been influenced by past neighborhood context. Adjusting for these factors eliminate possible critical pathways through which neighborhoods affect health, likely yielding overly conservative estimates of neighborhood effects. These two sources of bias, working in opposing directions, have plagued extant neighborhood-health research; consequently, results from current research yield tenuous and ambiguous inferences. This proposed project will use novel analytical methods and longitudinal data from an existing observational study to address the two major limitations described above and recover causal estimates of neighborhood poverty on self-rated health and mortality. We will 1) use marginal structural modeling to appropriately adjust for covariates that are simultaneously confounders as well as mediators and 2) conduct a sensitivity analysis to determine the robustness of the neighborhood effect findings to unobserved heterogeneity. Applying this combined methodology to neighborhood-health research has the potential to significantly advance our knowledge of the relationship between place and health, yielding far reaching policy implications. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Relevance Robust findings of a causal connection between residential context and health can help health policymakers judge the extent and magnitude of neighborhood impacts on health and guide public health policies. Evidence that the social and structural environment influences life-chances, and ultimately health outcomes, suggests that health policy, traditionally targeted at the individual level with little regard to neighborhood context, should consider underlying constraints or opportunities present in the residential environment in designing and implementing the most effective and efficient public health policies.                  Relevance  Robust findings of a causal connection between residential context and health can help health policymakers judge the extent and magnitude of neighborhood impacts on health and guide public health policies.

"Neighborhood Socioeconomic Status and Alcohol Outcomes: Moderators and Mediators    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This grant application responds to the program announcements for the Secondary Analysis of Existing Epidemiology Data (PA-08-168) and for studies of Epidemiology and Prevention in Alcohol Research (PA-07-449) calling for exploratory and developmental research issued by the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism. The application proposes a secondary analysis of data from the 2000 and 2005 National Alcohol Surveys (conducted by the Alcohol Research Group) linked with data from the 2000 US Decennial Census to examine whether, for whom and how neighborhood socioeconomic status is associated with alcohol use and alcohol problems. First, the study will investigate whether there are direct effects of neighborhood SES on alcohol use, high-risk drinking and alcohol problems in a nationally-representative sample of US adults. To determine the groups for whom the neighborhood socioeconomic context matters, we will examine whether the associations between neighborhood SES and the outcomes vary by demographic group. Analyses using linear and logistic regression will examine the relevance of the neighborhood environment for residents of different races/ethnicities and socioeconomic backgrounds, as well as for young, midlife and senior adults. Additional analyses focusing on high-risk drinking and alcohol problems will examine whether early-life risk factors moderate the effects of exposure to neighborhood risk later in life. This innovative approach is informed by developmental psychopathology and a life-course perspective in examining alcohol use and alcohol problems among a general population sample of adults. The final analyses will address how the neighborhood socioeconomic context may impact behavior by ascertaining whether psychosocial mediating factors help explain the influence of neighborhood SES on the alcohol outcomes. The mediation analysis will involve preliminary linear and logistic regression to inform overall path analysis models.  The objectives of this project are directly relevant to the mission of the NIH to explain and reduce health disparities related to alcohol. This exploratory epidemiologic study will inform prevention science by permitting the identification of groups of neighborhood residents at increased risk for heavy alcohol use and alcohol problems. The study also will extend prior research by exploring the pathways through which neighborhoods contribute to alcohol outcomes. As noted in the program announcements, multi-level prevention initiatives are of great interest. This study identifies risk and protective factors at the individual, familial, and neighborhood levels and explores their interrelationships using a socioecological perspective. Future projects will be designed to help translate the study findings into community-focused, multi-level prevention interventions for at-risk individuals living in high-risk neighborhoods, including mental health support services for people most in need, targeted public education campaigns in affluent and disadvantaged neighborhoods, and environmental change to reduce the burden of alcohol problems in disadvantaged communities.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Our health and behavior are influenced by where we live. This study explores whether neighborhoods are related to alcohol use and alcohol problems. It focuses on neighborhood socioeconomic status (both affluence and disadvantage) and whether some groups (such as racial minority group members, people with low incomes, young adults, or formerly heavy drinkers) are more at risk if they live in disadvantaged neighborhoods. The study also examines how neighborhoods are related to expression of alcohol problems, such as by heavier drinking, depression or reasons for drinking.

"Dynamic Models of Racial Residential Segregation    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal outlines a plan of research to better understand the causes of racial residential segregation in American cities. Racial residential segregation contributes to the formation of high-poverty neighborhoods and has been implicated as an important source of enduring racial health disparities (e.g., Mechanic 2007). Yet social scientists do not know what forces contribute to maintaining residential racial segregation, what the respective importance of these forces are, or how these forces combine. Two obstacles limit accumulation of causal knowledge in this research area. First, we lack a plausible model of how individual demographic factors and neighborhood characteristics simultaneously affect individual mobility decisions. Second, most past research measures potential explanatory factors at the individual or intermediary (e.g., real-estate agents or lenders) level, but do not represent how those factors affect neighborhood racial composition in the aggregate. Our project addresses these problems through a discrete choice statistical model of residential choice and an agent-based simulation of neighborhood formation. The discrete choice models are estimated using the data on residential mobility from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics matched with data from the Decennial Censuses. Our basic model of residential mobility incorporates race and neighborhood racial composition, income and neighborhood housing cost, neighborhood income composition, housing tenure (owning or renting), and household composition; proposed extensions to the model incorporate family wealth, mobility impacts of nearby neighborhood changes, and housing market discrimination. The agent-based model creates simulated cities with the demography, geography, and housing stock of actual urban areas in which household mobility is governed by behavioral rules estimated in the discrete choice model. Taken together, this framework can be used to address questions regarding how preferences for race of neighbors, affordability constraints, housing market discrimination, and metropolitan population composition affect racial segregation. The model can also be used to explore the effects of spatially targeted housing policies on residential segregation, like the demolition of distressed public housing under Hope VI legislation.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Racial residential segregation contributes to the formation of high-poverty neighborhoods and has been implicated as an important source of enduring racial health disparities (e.g., Mechanic 2007). One strategy for reducing health disparities among racial groups, particularly among blacks and whites, would be to reduce racial residential segregation and the corresponding geographic concentration of poverty. The proposed research aims to provide a better understanding of the causes of segregation, suggest solutions for reducing neighborhood racial segregation, and develop new analytical and technical tools for modeling dynamic processes in scientific research.                              Health Relevance:    Racial residential segregation contributes to the formation of high-poverty neighborhoods and has been implicated as an important source of enduring racial health disparities (e.g., Mechanic 2007).

"Neighborhood Environments and Disparities in Obesity Rates in New York City   This project will determine whether racial/ethnic and socioeconomic disparities in the prevalence of obesity, sedentary lifestyles and poor diet in New York City are explained by disparities in neighborhood resources that support physical activity (e.g. gyms, parks, pleasant walking environments) and healthy diets (e.g. grocery stores, fruit markets, healthy food restaurants) across neighborhoods in New York. Obesity, sedentary lifestyles, and poor diets are major risk factors for the development of type 2 Diabetes and in New York City these risk factors are far more common among African Americans, Hispanics and those of lower socio-economic status. Prior research in New York City shows that neighborhood characteristics such as urban design features and neighborhood socioeconomic status predict body mass index (BMI). Furthermore, the availability of grocery stores, fruit markets, fast food restaurants, gyms and health clubs, vary by neighborhood in New York City, with minority and poorer neighborhoods having fewer positive resources. The proposed research is a collaboration between Columbia University and the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (NYCDOHMH). Interview data on demographic characteristics, physical activity, consumption of fruits and vegetables and height and weight (used to calculate BMI) from ~45,000 New Yorkers will be combined with a geographic information system (GIS) based model of the characteristics of New York City neighborhoods. The interview data and zip code of residence were collected as part of five annual citywide random digit dial interviews conducted by NYCDOHMH that occurred from 2002 to 2006, and the sample is representative of the city and its neighborhoods. The GIS model is being built as part of ongoing research on neighborhood effects and is the most comprehensive model of neighborhood resources in New York City built to date. The NYCDOHMH will contribute additional data on restaurant locations from the food service licensing database, locations of pedestrian injuries from automobiles, and neighborhood social capital from their neighborhood surveys. Neighborhoods will be defined using zip codes, and prior research has shown that variation in built and social environment variables at this level are strongly predictive of BMI. Multilevel models will be used to determine the extent to which neighborhood characteristics account for racial/ethnic and socioeconomic disparities in BMI, physical activity and consumption of fruits and vegetables across zip codes in New York City. In addition to analyzing the effects of race/ethnicity and socio-economic status the analyses will control for age, gender and U.S. or foreign born status, and the socio-demographic characteristics of the zip code of residence. This research will contribute to NIDDK's goal of understanding the underlying causes of disparities in the distribution of known risk factors for type 2 diabetes. Furthermore, the analyses will be used to guide New York City's ongoing long term planning process for using urban design to promote public health.   This project will determine whether racial/ethnic and socioeconomic disparities in the prevalence of obesity, sedentary lifestyles and poor diet in New York City are explained by disparities in home neighborhood resources that support physical activity (e.g. gyms, parks, pleasant walking environments) and healthy diets (e.g. grocery stores, fruit markets, healthy food restaurants) across neighborhoods in New York.",Neighborhood Environments and Disparities in Obesity Rates in New York City,8017874,R01DK079885,"['Address ', ' Esthetics ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' social capital ', ' Data ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' Community Health ', ' socioeconomics ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomic ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio economic ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Food ', ' Food Services ', ' Fruit ', ' dietary fruit ', ' Age ', ' base ', ' density ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health Surveys ', ' National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences ', ' NIEHS ', ' sedentary ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Series ', ' Incidence ', ' Income ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Interview ', ' Physical activity ', ' farmer ', ' Life Style ', ' Lifestyle ', ' residence ', ' Individual ', ' Literature ', ' Databases ', ' data repository ', ' clinical data repository ', ' Electronic Database ', ' Electronic Databank ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Licensing ', ' Funding ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Marketing ', ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' New York ', ' New York City ', ' Collaborations ', ' Respondent ', ' Obesity ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' fast food ', ' convenience food ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Recreation ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Restaurants ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Safety ', ' Schools ', ' Social Environment ', ' socioenvironment ', ' social context ', ' social climate ', ' Life ', ' Sports ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Telephone ', ' Phone ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' Weight ', ' Caucasians ', ' Work ', ' Automobiles ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' Pattern ', ' Location ', ' Diet good ', ' Healthy diet ', ' Height ', ' Supermarket ', ' Services ', ' Digit structure ', ' Digit ', ' Body Size ', ' Body Weight ', ' trafficking ', ' Health Club ', ' simulation ', ' Reporting ', ' Caucasoid Race ', ' white race ', ' Occidental ', ' Caucasoid ', ' Caucasian Race ', ' Caucasian ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', ' Walking ', ' Code ', ' Coding System ', ' land use ', ' multilevel analysis ', ' multilevel modeling ', ' multilevel model ', ' methods to study multiple-level influences ', ' Geographic Information Systems ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Hispanics ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Mediating ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Cities ', ' Accounting ', ' pedestrian injury ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Minority ', ' Prevalence ', ' Consumption ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' racial/ethnic ', ' fruits and vegetables ', ' Crime ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' type II DM ', ' type 2 DM ', ' maturity onset diabetes ', ' ketosis resistant diabetes ', ' adult onset diabetes ', ' Type II diabetes ', ' Type II Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Type 2 diabetes ', ' Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus ', ' T2DM ', ' T2D ', ' T2 DM ', ' Stable Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Slow-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Noninsulin Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Non-Insulin Dependent Diabetes ', ' NIDDM ', ' Maturity-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' MODY ', ' Ketosis-Resistant Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Adult-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Diet ', ' Body mass index ', ' Quetelet index ', ' BMI z-score ', ' BMI percentile ', ' low socioeconomic status ', ' low socioeconomic position ', ' low socio-economic status ', ' low socio-economic position ', ' Low income ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Environment ', ' ']",NIDDK,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2010,43631,0.11442143148434629
"Traci Bethea: Neighborhood Deprivation, Social Factors, and Head and Neck Cancer DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), the tenth most common cancer in the United States (US), is a collective term that typically includes oral cancer (tongue, buccal cavity, gum, floor of mouth), pharyngeal cancer, and laryngeal cancer. Smoking, alcohol consumption, and human papillomavirus (HPV) seropositivity are all known to be associated with increased risk of HNSCC. However, while neighborhood deprivation and other social factors have been found to be associated with tobacco and alcohol consumption and with sexually transmitted infections (i.e. HPV), the role of such factors on HNSCC and on cancer in general is considerably less clear. Accordingly, the proposed study will utilize an existing HNSCC case-control study to investigate the role of individual-level and community-level social factors on HNSCC risk. The parent study included the recruitment of 705 incident cases and 815 matched controls in the greater Boston metropolitan area from 1999 to 2003. Data include participant characteristics such as age, gender, ethnicity, tobacco and alcohol use, and diet. Additional information will be obtained from the US Census on community-level social and economic factors such as education, employment, poverty, housing, and racial composition. An index of neighborhood deprivation and an index of community-level socio-economic status will be developed to address the following specific aims (Messer et al, 2006, Roberts et al, 2004): (1) investigate the role of individual and community-level social factors on HNSCC risk and disease survival, (2) determine whether individual and community-level social factors are associated with tobacco and alcohol consumption, (3) determine whether individual and community-level social factors are associated with sexual behavior and HPV seropositivity, and (4) determine whether individual and community-level social factors modify the effect of smoking, drinking, and HPV on HNSCC risk. These objectives are consistent with the goals of the National Cancer Institute (NCI) and relate to the NCI's strategic plan with respect to the stated need for additional research on cancer health disparities. Additionally, the existing infrastructure of the parent study presents a unique and cost-effective opportunity to investigate the role of neighborhood deprivation and community-level socio-economic status on HNSCC risk. With access to the data from the parent study, access to the extensive resources at Boston University, the support of an excellent mentoring team, and a carefully designed research training plan, the applicant is ideally positioned to conduct the proposed research. The mentoring team has expertise in environmental and social epidemiology, biostatistics, and exposure biology and is committed to providing the necessary guidance during the training period. The long term goal of the applicant is develop an active research program in the areas of environmental and social epidemiology, such that the proposed research will not only provide valuable insights into the role of neighborhood deprivation and community-level socio-economic status on HNSCC risk, but also play a key role in the development of a promising research career. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This research will enhance our understanding of the role that community-level social factors play in the development of head and neck cancer and thereby help to focus health-related interventions to reduce cancer risk. In addition, the project will further investigate the relationship between the social environment and health and the influence of health disparities on cancer outcomes.","Traci Bethea: Neighborhood Deprivation, Social Factors, and Head and Neck Cancer",8007032,F31CA142280,"['Diet ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' low socioeconomic status ', ' low socioeconomic position ', ' low socio-economic status ', ' low socio-economic position ', ' Low income ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Employment ', ' Environment ', ' Environmental Health ', ' Environmental Health Science ', ' Address ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Data ', ' National Cancer Institute ', ' NCI Organization ', ' Qualifying ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Research Training ', ' Strategic Planning ', ' Environmental Epidemiology ', ' Characteristics ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' malignant mouth neoplasm ', ' malignant mouth tumor ', ' Oral Cancer ', ' Mouth Cancer ', ' Malignant Oral Neoplasm ', ' Malignant Oral Cavity Tumor ', ' Malignant Oral Cavity Neoplasm ', ' Malignant neoplasm of pharynx ', ' Pharynx Cancer ', ' Pharyngeal Cancer ', ' Pharnyx Cancer ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Pharynx ', ' Malignant Pharyngeal Tumor ', ' Malignant Pharyngeal Neoplasm ', ' Age ', ' career ', ' urban area ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Alcohol consumption ', ' etoh use ', ' ethanol use ', ' ethanol product use ', ' ethanol intake ', ' ethanol ingestion ', ' ethanol drinking ', ' ethanol consumption ', ' alcoholic drink intake ', ' alcoholic beverage consumption ', ' alcohol use ', ' alcohol product use ', ' alcohol intake ', ' alcohol ingestion ', ' alcohol consumed ', ' EtOH drinking ', ' Alcohol Drinking ', ' Housing ', ' Area ', ' Economic Factors ', ' Economical Factors ', ' indexing ', ' Human Papillomavirus ', ' wart virus ', ' Infectious Human Wart Virus ', ' Human Papilloma Virus ', ' HPV ', ' Training ', ' Oral cavity ', ' Mouth ', ' Cavitas Oris ', ' Buccal Cavity Head and Neck ', ' Buccal Cavity ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Mentors ', ' Sublingual Region ', ' Mouth Floor ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Head and Neck Cancer ', ' malignant head and neck tumor ', ' Malignant Head and Neck Neoplasm ', ' Parents ', ' Genetic Predisposition to Disease ', ' genetic vulnerability ', ' genetic mechanism of disease ', ' genetic etiology ', ' Inherited Susceptibility ', ' Inherited Predisposition ', ' Genetic Susceptibility ', ' Genetic Predisposition ', ' Play ', ' Poverty ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Public Health Schools ', ' Sex Behavior ', ' sex activity ', ' Sexual Behavior ', ' Sexual Activity ', ' Sexual Partners ', ' sex partner ', ' Sexually Transmitted Diseases ', ' Venereal Infections ', ' Venereal Disorders ', ' Venereal Diseases ', ' Sexually Transmitted Infection ', ' Sexually Transmitted Disorder ', ' Smoke ', ' Smoking ', ' Social Environment ', ' socioenvironment ', ' social context ', ' social climate ', ' programs ', ' Students ', ' Tobacco ', ' Tongue ', ' Unemployment ', ' unemployed ', ' out of work ', ' joblessness ', ' jobless ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' Investigation ', ' Biology ', ' Biometry ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Biometrics ', ' cancer risk ', ' metropolitan ', ' Boston ', ' social deprivation ', ' Participant ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' disorder risk ', ' disease risk ', ' drinking ', ' Malignant neoplasm of larynx ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Larynx ', ' Malignant Laryngeal Tumor ', ' Malignant Laryngeal Neoplasm ', ' Larynx Cancer ', ' Laryngeal Cancer ', ' social ', ' Case-Control Studies ', ' Case-Referrent Studies ', ' Case-Referent Studies ', ' Case-Compeer Studies ', ' Case-Comparison Studies ', ' Case-Base Studies ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' Censuses ', ' Gender ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' deprivation ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Communities ', ' cost ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' cancer disparity ', ' tumor ', ' public health relevance ', ' Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma ', ' SCCHN ', ' Head and Neck Carcinoma ', ' HNSCC ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Commit ', ' ']",NCI,BOSTON UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CAMPUS,F31,2010,34270,0.03394787431066833
"Effects of a housing policy experiment on youth behavioral problems    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Adverse neighborhood contexts predict poor mental health and externalizing behavior among adolescents, and the vast racial inequalities in neighborhood environment may play an important role in creating and maintaining racial disparities in health. However, since most research has been observational rather than experimental, it is potentially biased. Neighborhood-health research typically models point-in-time exposures of neighborhoods, in lieu of understanding neighborhood exposure trajectories, and insufficient attention has been paid to the specific contexts navigated by minority, impoverished, adolescents. Our study proposes a secondary analysis of data from a social experiment of voluntary neighborhood relocation using Section 8 Housing Vouchers in 5 cities (the Moving to Opportunity, MTO, Study), to test how and why random assignment of an offer to move to a low-poverty neighborhood unexpectedly adversely affected behavioral problems for boys over a 4-7 year period, and to inform the program's opposite gender effects on mental health. We will complement the existing data with additional neighborhood-level data collection to enrich the dataset. MTO is the only available large- scale study that has randomly assigned individuals to receive different neighborhood contexts, to support strong causal inferences of how neighborhoods shape mental health. Yet prior MTO analyses have not integrated theoretical understanding of adolescent development to motivate empirical analyses. Nor have prior analyses probed why neighborhood context may increase behavioral problems of boys, whether certain subgroups are more likely to be affected than others by neighborhood relocation, or whether there are important developmentally-sensitive periods when exposure to neighborhood deprivation may be especially influential on youth mental health. Our project proposes 3 aims: Aim 1: To test whether effects of moving to a low-poverty neighborhood on behavioral problems for boys are mediated by neighborhood characteristics, family context, or substance use. Aim 2: To examine, separately among boys and girls, whether the effect of moving to a low-poverty neighborhood on behavioral problems is modified by baseline health status, family/adolescent vulnerability, or program site. Aim 3: To compare the importance of alternative timing or sequencing patterns of exposure to neighborhood poverty on behavioral problems among boys. The project will leverage an interdisciplinary team of investigators, including fields of social epidemiology, psychiatric epidemiology, developmental psychology, demography, public policy, statistics, medicine. This project will capitalize on an experimental design, will innovatively apply causal methods to understand mediation, and will model time-varying neighborhood exposures, which will inform relevant early life course developmental timing of neighborhood exposure periods for adolescent well-being. Because of the rigorous experimental design, this project can provide strong policy-relevant evidence on the mechanisms by which social policies like Section 8 housing vouchers may influence population health and mental health.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Neighborhood context may be an important cause of health disparities, especially taking into account risks which accumulate early in life. The results of this project, leveraging a social experiment of housing relocation, have the potential to inform the literature on why neighborhood context is a cause of behavioral problems among adolescents, including probing more specificity on when and for how long living in low-poverty neighborhoods may be most influential for affecting adolescent mental health. This knowledge will inform the next generation of interventions and policies to ensure that adolescents are not harmed by rental assistance policies; results from the experimental design will inform causal pathways and potential intervention points by which to reduce the population burden of mental health and subsequent health disparities.           Neighborhood context may be an important cause of health disparities, especially taking into account risks which accumulate early in life.

"Adolescent Experiences and Adult Cardiovascular Health: Effects of the Social and    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Childhood socioeconomic status (SES) has been associated with adult cardiovascular disease, but the mechanisms of how this occurs have not been fully explored. Furthermore, low SES is associated with the co-occurrence of multiple social (i.e., increased violence exposure), physical (i.e., higher air pollution levels, poor access to recreational facilities and access to fresh fruits and vegetables) and behavioral (i.e., poor diet, low physical activity, tobacco use) risk factors associated with cardiovascular disease. However, exposures to these factors during childhood and adolescence have not been evaluated with respect to their role in the development of metabolic and cardiovascular risk profiles in a prospective study. Given the complexity of interactions (individual and neighborhood, social and physical) a life course framework may be a fruitful approach to exploring the individual exposures and social attributes of neighborhoods that contribute to the development of metabolic and cardiovascular risk profiles. This proposal aims to examine the contribution of social stressors and physical environment experienced at both the individual and neighborhood level during adolescence, and their interactions on the development of cardiovascular and metabolic risk profiles (i.e., blood pressure, CRP, Hemoglobin A1c, BMI, waist circumference, total cholesterol, triglycerides, LDL, HDL, non-HDL cholesterol). The research goals of this proposal will be achieved with two projects. First, using the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health), a longitudinal cohort of adolescents followed through adulthood, I will employ a life course approach to determine whether social stressors (i.e., interpersonal violence, school and community violence) and physical environment (i.e., access to food stores, proximity to parks and recreation) experienced in adolescence plays a role in the development of metabolic and cardiovascular risk profiles in adulthood. Interactive effects between social and physical environmental factors will also be examined. Second, I will develop a primary collection cross-sectional study of 100 adolescents to examine the mediating effect of diet (not available in Add Health) and the modifying effects of air pollutants (also not available in the Add Health study) on the stress-cardiovascular health relationship. I will dedicate no less than 75 percent of my time to a highly structured and intensely focused research experience over the next 5 years, which will extend my expertise in characterizing social and environmental determinants as stressors in relation to physiological outcomes in children and young adults. A career development plan is outlined to gain practical skills in research design and implementation, expertise in statistical models to predict air pollutant levels and structural equation models as well as knowledge in the mechanisms of cardiovascular and metabolic disorders. The career development plan includes: 1) formal graduate course work in survey design, latent statistical models, mechanisms of cardiovascular disease, 2) tutorial with project advisor to learn clinical aspects of cardiovascular and metabolic disorders in adolescents 3) tutorial with advisor to discuss air pollutant modeling strategies 4) interactions with mentoring team to discuss research and career goals and project progress. I will work closely with the mentoring team which collectively has extensive experience in mentoring new clinical investigators, disparities in psychosocial factors, life experiences and cardiovascular disease outcomes, effects of neighborhood environment and cardiovascular disease, and disparities in physical environmental factors. The proposed training, consisting of interactions with mentors and advisors, tutorials and coursework, complements my previous training and experience in social and environmental epidemiologic research and will allow me to develop the necessary transdisciplinary expertise to achieve my goal and successfully transition to independent investigator at the end of this award. The proposed project will focus on a major health problem in the U.S. - cardiovascular disease, particularly its onset during the adolescent years and explore new models of how individual and community factors, in this case exposure to violence and environmental toxins, impact health outcomes. Findings from these studies can inform clinical practice in chronic disease prevention so that providers and policymakers alike can tailor age appropriate interventions to adolescents and young adults that jointly address the individual as well as the environmental context to more effectively reduce cardiovascular disease risk.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Childhood socioeconomic status (SES) has been associated with adult cardiovascular disease, but the mechanisms of how this occurs have not been fully explored.

"Health of Low-Income Adults in Subsidized Housing: Randomized Experiment, NY City    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): From a public health perspective, moving to subsidized housing, to less poor neighborhoods, to housing developments with low rates of crime, or to more mixed income settings might reduce health disparities through multiple pathways.  The proposed experimental research will utilize the NYC Department of Housing Preservation and Development's lottery system to identify treatment and control households that fit our study criteria. Group assignment will include households who move to a subsidized apartment in one of ten newly constructed housing sites (treatment) and matched households who do not receive housing (control). We estimate that our experimental sample will be comprised of about 1,300 participating treatment households and 1,690 lottery- matched controls.  This proposal's design improves and expands upon the design of earlier housing experiments in that it (a)  compares the impact of moving to a new neighborhood versus staying in the same neighborhood among  recipients of subsidized housing, (b) compares the impact of moving into mixed-income versus solely low-  income buildings, (c) examines the impact of subsidized housing on near-poor families (rather than just  families below the poverty threshold), (d) examines the effect of subsidized housing where the uptake of the  offer is 90% (rather than less than one-half in previous demonstrations of subsidized housing), and (e)  examines the effect of subsidized housing where the families are likely to stay in the subsidized housing  (compared to studies of vouchers, where over half of those who did move ended up moving again, typically  back to poor neighborhoods).  Our proposed data collection strategy will include baseline data collection at time of application for housing using a self-administered questionnaire to be completed by a single adult household member and augmented by information obtained from the housing application itself. Follow-up telephone interviews will take place 12-18 months after move-in, or equivalent for non-movers. A variety of information on current health status and health behaviors will be collected at baseline and follow-up to enable assessment of within-household change as well as average change between comparison groups at follow-up. Experimental analyses will be used to quantify the impact of moving to subsidized housing in a new neighborhood relative to moving to subsidized housing in the same neighborhood of residence at time of application.

"School environments and adolescents weight status and physical activity patterns    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Child/adolescent obesity is one of the most pressing public health problems today; it disproportionately affects Hispanic and Black children/adolescents as well as those living in poverty. Lack of physical activity and poor diet are well-documented contributors to child/adolescent obesity and reflect these same disparities. Environmental contexts may provide new answers to the origins of these disparities. Though recent studies have begun to elucidate the influence of neighborhoods on child/adolescent weight and weight related behaviors, schools remain an understudied environmental context. My long-range goal is to increase understanding of the impact of schools on the health of children/adolescents and their potential contribution to racial/ethnic and/or socioeconomic disparities. Coupled with this goal is my desire to build relationships between clinicians, researchers, and policy makers so that empirical findings can be translated into effective interventions. My career development plan proposes additional training and mentorship in three areas critical to my development as an independent researcher: (1) population health sciences, including the social determinants of health (social epidemiology), demographic theory and methods, sociology (urban sociology, neighborhood influences, and social stratification), and economics; (2) advanced methods needed to analyze contextual influences on health (multi-level analysis, multi-equation models, sociometric analysis), as well as methods to address causal inference; and (3) substantive understanding of the role of macro-social forces, such as educational opportunities, on health. My research plan includes 3 aims: (1) To determine the extent to which school factors contribute to racial/ethnic differences in individual dietary intake; (2) To determine the extent to which school factors contribute to racial/ethnic and/or socioeconomic differences in individual physical activity and weight trajectories from adolescence to adulthood; and (3) To simultaneously examine the influence of school context and two other potentially influential contexts-peer networks and neighborhood environments-on physical activity and weight gain trajectories. The career development plan will provide the training necessary to support an R01 application toward the end of this proposed award period and the research proposed will lay the ground work for identifying school-based interventions that can reverse the obesity epidemic and eliminate disparities.           ",School environments and adolescents weight status and physical activity patterns,8120826,K01HD058042,"['food resource ', ' Child health care ', ' Child Health ', ' Stratification ', ' Poverty ', ' sugar ', ' population health ', ' Dietary intake ', ' sweetened beverage ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' racial/ethnic ', ' Adolescence ', ' teenage ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' Weight Gain ', ' wt gain ', ' body weight increase ', ' body weight gain ', ' Weight Increase ', ' fruits and vegetables ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' effective intervention ', ' Hispanics ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Equation ', ' Economics ', ' Award ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Schools ', ' theories ', ' racial/ethnic difference ', ' Consumption ', ' Weight ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Work ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' socioeconomics ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomic ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio economic ', ' Area ', ' Epidemic ', ' Translating ', ' Life ', ' Mentorship ', ' Goals ', ' Characteristics ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Mediating ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Individual ', ' Pattern ', ' Students ', ' peer ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Low income ', ' Affect ', ' Health Sciences ', ' Data ', ' Coupled ', ' Training ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Minority ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' Address ', ' Research ', ' Diet ', ' Modeling ', ' programs ', ' Adolescent ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Physical activity ', ' Methods ', ' Food ', ' Behavior ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' career development ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Policy Maker ', ' social ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' Environment ', ' Health ', ' base ', ' Development Plans ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Obesity ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' social health determinants ', ' Sociology ', ' fast food ', ' convenience food ', ' Influentials ', ' ']",NICHD,BOSTON CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL,K01,2011,125820,0.048306177800623726
"Reconceptualizing Socioeonomic Status and Health    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The primary question is whether collective neighborhood socioeconomic status influences the health of residents adjusting for their own personal or household socioeconomic statuses. If it does, the second question is how. To answer these questions, we propose a reconceptualization of socioeconomic status on both levels. If neighborhood socioeconomic statuses have an effect on residents' health over and above the impact of their own socioeconomic characteristics, we suggest that it is because collective socioeconomic statuses indicate concepts distinct from individual ones. The proposed project will consider the differences between what a measure indicates on the personal level that might affect health and what concept it indicates on the collective level that might affect health. Distinct concepts on the two levels likely have different associations with health and different pathways to health.  We delineate three elements of socioeconomic status on the personal and contextual levels: education, work/employment, and economic circumstances. On the neighborhood level we propose that education indicates collective human capital; employment, collective watch; and economic circumstances (especially home ownership), collective interest. Multi-level, multi-indicator structural equation models will allow us to distinguish separate elements of neighborhood socioeconomic status, which most previous research on neighborhoods and health has not. Distinguishing and defining elements of socioeconomic status on the personal and contextual level is the first step necessary in order to examine associations between health and neighborhood socioeconomic status and it's elements, and compare these results to personal socioeconomic statuses. For instance, on the personal level economic hardship may be the economic element with the strongest relationship to health; on the neighborhood level, the prevalence of home ownership may be. Next we propose to explain the associations. We focus on two main explanations linking neighborhoods to health: the neighborhood context of disorder and stress, and health lifestyle. The analyses will use data from our 1995 survey of Community, Crime and Health (CCH), a probability sample of Illinois households with linked census tract information, and a follow-up in 1998.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The project will examine whether collective socioeconomic status influences the health of residents adjusting for their own personal or household socioeconomic statuses. Results may suggest ways of decreasing health disparities, preventing health problems among residents of disadvantaged neighborhoods, and improving public health.           The project will examine whether collective socioeconomic status influences the health of residents adjusting for their own personal or household socioeconomic statuses.

"Harlem Community Academic Partnership: Influenza Immunizations    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Proposed is a community based participatory research project (CBPR) and evaluation for improving influenza immunizations in high risk populations within disadvantaged minority communities. The Harlem Community and Academic Partnership (HCAP)'s Board includes residents, community based organizations, academic partners and the local health department who meet monthly to plan, conduct and review neighborhood assessments, interventions and evaluation activities; topic-specific issues are addressed through formation of Intervention Work Groups (IWGs). The HCAP Board noted especially low rates of influenza immunizations in Harlem and formed the VIVA (Venue Intensive Vaccine for Adults) IWG. This IWG has conducted separate pilots including a survey on barriers to immunization, development of culturally informed intervention materials, a pilot of ""yellow jacket"" outreach workers to engage and educate hard-to reach populations, and provision of immunizations at non-traditional sites. The goal of this proposal is to assemble these components to formally scale up and test the intervention for adults in the Harlem communities. To achieve these aims, the HCAP VIVA IWG will plan, organize and implement an intervention; our primary partner, Palladia Inc, provides outreach educators and a service network of over 120 CBOs to educate and mobilize the community for immunization as well as coordinate congregating persons with traditional and new non-traditional venues for immunizations; the local Visiting Nurse Service has agreed to provide nurses and influenza vaccines at the selected venues gratis. This program does not replace, but rather supplements existing vaccination programs in the city by adding more relevant education and new ""non-traditional"" venues. We expect that this program will increase rates of immunizations overall including the hard-to-reach populations. To evaluate this program, we will compare annual rates of immunization between Harlem and communities similar to Harlem in NYC, with data available by neighborhood through the NYC annual ""Community Health Survey"" (modified BRFSS from CDC) which includes 10,000 adult NYC residents. We will also conduct two cross sectional street intercept surveys (n=800) before and after each annual intervention program between harlem and comparison community residents. These data combined with yearly inventories of CBOs, will provide measures of barriers, intervention experiences and outcomes to broaden input for continuous program improvement.          ",Harlem Community Academic Partnership: Influenza Immunizations,8037097,R24MD002754,"['Nurses ', ' scale up ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' community based participatory research ', ' Health Promotion ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' novel vaccines ', ' next generation vaccines ', ' new vaccines ', ' Trust ', ' Visiting Nurse ', ' Home Health Nursing ', ' AIDS prevention ', ' HIV/AIDS prevention ', ' HIV Prevention ', ' AIDS/HIV prevention ', ' Nursing Services ', ' Group Meetings ', ' working group ', ' Community Health ', ' New York ', ' Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System ', ' Behavior Risk Factor Surveillance System ', ' BRFSS ', ' Equipment and supply inventories ', ' Inventory ', ' Influenza A Virus, H5N1 Subtype ', ' avian influenza H5N1 virus ', ' avian influenza H5N1 ', ' H5N1 virus ', ' H5N1 ', ' Intercept ', ' Avian Influenza ', ' influenza in birds ', ' avian flu ', ' Fowl Plague ', ' Fowl Pest ', ' Bird Flu ', ' social health determinants ', ' Healthy People 2010 ', ' Yellow Jackets ', ' outreach ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' high risk ', ' Structure ', ' social ', ' Data ', ' Outcome ', ' Measures ', ' base ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Health ', ' Work ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' improved ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Population ', ' Goals ', ' experience ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Site ', ' Online Systems ', ' web based ', ' online computer ', ' On-Line Systems ', ' Methods ', ' Testing ', ' programs ', ' Mutate ', ' Address ', ' Area ', ' Principal Investigator ', ' Joints ', ' Articulation ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Adopted ', ' Learning ', ' Source ', ' Process ', ' Knowledge ', ' Provider ', ' response ', ' Cities ', ' Health Surveys ', ' post intervention ', ' Influenza vaccination ', ' flu immunisation ', ' Prophylactic vaccination against influenza ', ' Influenza immunization ', ' Flu vaccination ', ' Influenza ', ' influenza infection ', ' flu infection ', ' Grippe ', ' New York City ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Vaccines ', ' Immunization Programs ', ' Immunization ', ' Immunostimulation ', ' Immunological Stimulation ', ' Immunological Sensitization ', ' Immunologic Stimulation ', ' Immunologic Sensitization ', ' Awareness ', ' Persons ', ' pandemic disease ', ' pandemic ', ' Services ', ' disorder prevention ', ' disease prevention ', ' Mission ', ' meetings ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Attitude ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' CDC ', ' Social support ', ' social support network ', ' Motivation ', ' Influenza virus vaccine ', ' Influenza Vaccines ', ' Flu vaccine ', ' Elements ', ' Evaluation ', ' Communities ', ' intervention program ', ' Minority ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Vaccination ', ' ']",NIMHD,NEW YORK ACADEMY OF MEDICINE,R24,2011,86745,0.05542685893538761
"Child and Family Health in Subsidized Housing: A Randomized Experiment in NY City    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  From a public health perspective, moving to subsidized housing, to less poor neighborhoods, to housing developments with low rates of crime, or to more mixed income settings might reduce health disparities between children and families who have low income and those who do not. Children and young adolescents may be particularly influenced by housing given that they spend a large proportion of their time in their home neighborhood where the accessibility and quality of local amenities and institutions matter, and because they are influenced by their parents' responses to residential location. Receipt of in-place subsidized housing, the focus of our proposal, may help to improve the health and developmental trajectories of at-risk youth through multiple pathways. The proposed experimental research will utilize the NYC Department of Housing Preservation and Development's lottery system to identify treatment and control households that fit our study criteria. Group assignment will include families with children who move to a subsidized apartment in one of eleven newly constructed housing sites (treatment) and matched families who do not receive housing (control). This proposal's design improves and expands upon the design of earlier housing experiments in that it (a) compares the impact of moving to a new neighborhood versus staying in the same neighborhood among recipients of subsidized housing, (b) compares the impact of moving into mixed-income versus solely low- income buildings, (c) examines the impact of subsidized housing on near-poor families (rather than just families below the poverty threshold), (d) examines the effect of subsidized housing where the uptake of the offer is 90% (rather than less than one-half in Moving to Opportunity), and (e) examines the effect of subsidized housing where the families are likely to stay in the subsidized housing (in Moving to Opportunity, over half of those who did move ended up moving again, typically back to poor neighborhoods). Our proposed data collection strategy will include baseline data collection at time of application for housing, using a self-administered questionnaire to be completed by the primary caregiver and augmented by information obtained from the housing application itself. Follow-up assessments will include in-person interviews with the primary caregiver and detailed information on up to two co-resident children for each participating household. Our follow-up information on children will be collected by proxy for children under age eight and in-person with children ages eight to eighteen. Experimental analyses will be used to quantify the impact of moving to subsidized housing and additional exploratory analyses will be conducted to investigate the potential benefits of housing relative to neighborhoods and assess evidence of differential impacts among those receiving particular types of subsidized housing. Relationships among household, housing, and neighborhood features will be examined as potential outcomes as well as mediators of individual-level health outcomes.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The health of children and adults is influenced by the environments in which they live.

"The role of social factors in cardiovascular risk behaviors disparities    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Socioeconomic disparities in cardiovascular (CV) disease are evidenced by a 2.5 times higher risk of cardiovascular mortality for low-income Americans, when compared to those in the highest income bracket. Despite well-documented awareness that social environments can influence CV disease risk, and the increasing attention given to disparities research, there is relatively little knowledge of the underlying social pathways contributing to socioeconomic disparities, and socioeconomic disparities in CV disease have only widened in the last three decades. Socioeconomic disparities exist for many CV risk behaviors, including smoking, lack of physical activity and insufficient fruit and vegetable intake, and these disparities contribute to socioeconomic gradients in CV disease. These behaviors are shaped by social environmental resource factors, including social support, loneliness and neighborhood social cohesion. These three social environmental resource measures are independently associated with CV morbidity, but their role in CV risk behaviors is not well understood. Also, interaction between social resources is likely to have a ""multiplier effect"", where the net effect is greater than the sum of the individual effects. However, few studies utilize an ecological framework to identify the magnitude of these effects simultaneously. Furthermore, these social resource measures are often correlated with socioeconomic position (SEP), indicating that the resources may represent a fundamental social inequality. The purpose of this study is to examine the relationships among SEP and three distinct, but related, measures of social resources - social support (both emotional and instrumental), loneliness and neighborhood social cohesion - with CV risk behavior outcomes (smoking, lack of physical activity, and insufficient fruit and vegetable intake). The aims of this study are: 1) To examine associations of social support, loneliness and neighborhood social cohesion with CV risk behaviors after controlling for confounders. 2) To explore the interactions of social support, loneliness and neighborhood social cohesion as they relate to CV risk behaviors. 3) To determine the contributions of social support, loneliness and neighborhood social cohesion to SEP gradients in CV risk behaviors. This study will use cross-sectional data obtained by the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis, a prospective cohort study of a diverse, population-based sample of 6814 adults without apparent CVD from six US sites. Multi-level statistical modeling techniques will be used to test the proposed inter-relationships of SEP and the three social resource measures, based on an ecological framework.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Results of this study will elucidate the pathways that contribute to socioeconomic CV risk behavior disparities, responding to a NINR research priority area, and this knowledge may inform future research into other health disparities. This knowledge also is important for the development of socially and contextually based behavioral interventions for clinicians and researchers, meeting a critical need in health behavior research. Moreover, these findings may be used to improve patient advocacy and shape policies to address health disparities at a societal level.           Results of this study will elucidate the pathways that contribute to socioeconomic CV risk behavior disparities, responding to a NINR research priority area, and this knowledge may inform future research into other health disparities.

"Health, Poverty and Place: Modeling Inequalities in Accra Using RS and GIS    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This project, through a detailed analysis of spatial disparities in health in Accra, Ghana, aims to provide a model for the interpretation of urban health inequalities in cities in poor countries. Using Accra in Ghana, we will generate methods that we hope will serve as templates for comparative analyses of other major cities in the developing world. The project will produce a geographical synopsis of the differentials in health and mortality within the urban area in a format immediately accessible to government and the development agencies tasked with the improvement of health overall and with the reduction of health inequalities; map the distribution of poverty (both income and wealth) in the city and assess its spatial association with selected health and mortality outcomes; using remote sensing and GIS technology, measure the association of adverse health and mortality outcomes with neighborhood ecology, including the association with spatial measures derived from observations of physical features and built structures visible from multi-spectral high spatial resolution satellite imagery; and assess the additional contribution of community-level variables including social organization and institutions to the production of inequalities in health and mortality, net of individual-level characteristics. Our research involves the following major steps: (i) apply new methods of defining urban neighborhoods across space and time using census and survey data and information from remotely sensed imagery; (2) validate data-derived neighborhood definitions, attributes, and boundaries with field assessments in a purposive sample of Accra neighborhoods; (3) assemble existing census-based, survey-based, and vital statistics-based measures of morbidity and mortality at the neighborhood level, based on the derived neighborhood definitions, as well as existing and updated imagery and geographic layers; (4) re-interview (in 2008) the respondents to the 2003 Accra Women's Health Survey to generate new measures of neighborhood-level health outcomes and changes in those outcomes; (5) employ spatial analytic, multivariate and multi-level analyses to predict the inequalities in health outcomes between and within neighborhoods of Accra; (6) develop models that build on the WHS and DHS data in combination with the imagery to predict health outcomes by neighborhood; (7) apply the modeling algorithms to two key resources-the Demographic and Health Survey and remotely sensed imagery-to predict the variability (inequality) in neighborhood level health outcomes in Accra; and (8) employ the results locally in Accra for health policy and planning purposes, and use the results from relatively data-rich Accra to develop models that can subsequently be used to estimate the spatial variability in health in data-poorer cities in sub-Saharan Africa.                    ","Health, Poverty and Place: Modeling Inequalities in Accra Using RS and GIS",8103213,R01HD054906,"['Case Study ', ' case report ', ' Transcend ', ' Proxy ', ' Health care facility ', ' Healthcare Facility ', ' Health Facilities ', ' Income ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Health Status ', ' Level of Health ', ' Rural ', ' Censuses ', ' Poverty ', ' Low income ', ' Demography ', ' Population Studies / Demography ', ' Government ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' social organization ', ' Developing Countries ', ' Under-Developed Nations ', ' Under-Developed Countries ', ' Third-World Nations ', ' Third-World Countries ', ' Less-Developed Nations ', ' Less-Developed Countries ', ' Developing Nations ', ' Developing Nation ', ' Developing Country ', ' Imagery ', ' Visualization ', ' Health behavior ', ' Africa South of the Sahara ', ' Subsaharan Africa ', ' Sub-Saharan Africa ', ' Perception ', ' Household ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Respondent ', ' Health Policy ', ' healthcare policy ', ' health care policy ', ' Records ', ' Ecology ', ' Environmental Science ', "" Women's Health "", ' Female Health ', ' Urban Health ', ' Update ', ' Data Aggregation ', ' Aggregated Data ', ' time use ', ' Communities ', ' Economics ', ' comparative ', ' Vital Statistics ', ' Production ', ' Relative (related person) ', ' Relative ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' Resolution ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Source ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Mortality ', ' Algorithms ', ' Work ', ' base ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Principal Investigator ', ' Knowledge ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Health ', ' improved ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Self-Report ', ' Link ', ' Measurable ', ' Validation ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Methods ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' Cities ', ' Individual ', ' metropolitan ', ' Interview ', ' Urbanization ', ' Institution ', ' Life ', ' Dimensions ', ' Research ', ' Attention ', ' Modeling ', ' Population ', ' Maps ', ' Time ', ' Data ', ' Country ', ' Investigation ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Area ', ' member ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Environment ', ' Techniques ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Outcome ', ' Goals ', ' Laboratories ', ' Characteristics ', ' Pattern ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Man (Taxonomy) ', ' programs ', ' Address ', ' Measures ', ' Risk ', ' Sampling ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Site ', ' Literature ', ' tool ', ' Social Justice ', ' Slum ', ' Ghana ', ' Gold Coast ', ' Environmental Hazards ', ' Inequality ', ' urban area ', ' Population Dynamics ', ' Geographic Information Systems ', ' Longitudinal Surveys ', ' Child Mortality ', ' Urban Population ', ' Population Growth ', ' Health Planning ', ' health inequalities ', ' lens ', ' lenses ', ' Demographic and Health Surveys ', ' Health Surveys ', ' model design ', ' UNICEF ', ' remote sensing ', ' ']",NICHD,SAN DIEGO STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2011,570396,0.19194507387185789
"Using Google Streetview to Measure Neighborhood Characteristics    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Racial, ethnic, and economic characteristics of neighborhoods have long been viewed by sociologists as determinants of socioeconomic attainment and social outcomes (most notably, crime and delinquency). More recently, interest has shifted to the role of neighborhood environments in shaping health and health disparities, following mounting evidence that poor health outcomes tend to cluster spatially. While social attributes of neighborhoods, such as social cohesion, collective efficacy, and demographic composition, can be measured using survey questions or existing censuses, measuring physical aspects of neighborhoods, including physical disorder and the built environment, usually require some form of systematic field observation. The high costs and logistical constraints of sending field observers to neighborhoods have greatly limited the inclusion of measures of neighborhood physical characteristics in analyses of health, with most such studies focusing on single cities and often on selected neighborhoods within cities. The proposed research will assess the feasibility, reliability, and validity of using new technology, freely available online via Google, to measure neighborhood physical disorder and built environment at a fraction of the cost of field studies. Specifically, we will develop procedures for using Google Earth and Google Street View to measure neighborhood physical disorder and the built environment, and evaluate the validity, reliability, cost- effectiveness, and psychometric properties of these procedures. Furthermore, we will assess the efficiency of alternative neighborhood spatial scales and block face sampling strategies within the Google Street View and Earth frameworks. The methodology we propose to develop has the potential to transform the way neighborhood data are collected, allowing the linkage of contextual data to local and national studies very inexpensively and creating unparalleled public resources for studying contextual influences on health and well-being. It will be particularly useful for large-sample, multi-site studies such as the new National Children's Study.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research will assess the feasibility, reliability, and validity of using new technology, freely available online via Google, to measure neighborhood physical disorder and built environment at a fraction of the cost of field studies.

"Neighborhood and Family Effects on Disparities in Chronic Disease    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There is increasing evidence that the social and physical environments in which individuals live may play a key role in health disparities by race/ethnicity and socioeconomic status. The goal of this study is to significantly advance our knowledge about the role of specific family and neighborhood characteristics for disparities in the emergence of chronic disease and its precursors during childhood and adolescence. This project is based on the Los Angeles Family and Neighborhood Survey (L.A.FANS), a longitudinal study of neighborhoods, families, adults, and children in Los Angeles County. The first wave (L.A.FANS-1), completed in January 2002, interviewed adults and children living in 3,090 households in a stratified probability sample of 65 neighborhoods throughout Los Angeles County. The second wave (L.A.FANS-2) is in the field and will be completed in 2008. This project will use these data to analyze the effects of specific family and neighborhood characteristics on asthma, obesity, glucose metabolism, hypertension, and metabolic syndrome. These conditions are increasing in prevalence and importance among the population and represent a major component of overall health disparities by race/ethnicity and socioeconomic status. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This study will test hypotheses about the effects of family and neighborhood characteristics on disparities in chronic disease among children using new data from a longitudinal survey of health in Los Angeles County. The results will provide new information on the causes of and potential strategies to reduce race/ethnic and SES disparities in health during childhood and over the life- course.          ",Neighborhood and Family Effects on Disparities in Chronic Disease,8116698,R01HD058514,"['ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' Child health care ', ' Child Health ', ' Los Angeles ', ' Population Study ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Social Network ', ' Household ', ' Respondent ', ' Adolescence ', ' teenage ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Social Environment ', ' socioenvironment ', ' social context ', ' social climate ', ' Investments ', ' Immigrant ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Cholesterol ', ' Cholest-5-en-3-ol (3beta)- ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' chronic disorder ', ' chronic disease/disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' glucose metabolism ', ' Hypertension ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' high blood pressure ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' type II DM ', ' type 2 DM ', ' maturity onset diabetes ', ' ketosis resistant diabetes ', ' adult onset diabetes ', ' Type II diabetes ', ' Type II Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Type 2 diabetes ', ' Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus ', ' T2DM ', ' T2D ', ' T2 DM ', ' Stable Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Slow-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Noninsulin Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Non-Insulin Dependent Diabetes ', ' NIDDM ', ' Maturity-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' MODY ', ' Ketosis-Resistant Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Adult-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Childhood ', ' pediatric ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Schools ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' disability ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Policies ', ' County ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' social ', ' Parents ', ' Knowledge ', ' Metabolic syndrome ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Life ', ' Age ', ' Measures ', ' base ', ' Family ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Mortality ', ' insight ', ' Health ', ' Biological ', ' Individual ', ' Dimensions ', ' Reporting ', ' Research ', ' Environment ', ' Characteristics ', ' Obesity ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Affect ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Data ', ' Latino ', ' Sampling ', ' Literature ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Goals ', ' Life Cycle Stages ', ' life course ', ' Life Cycle ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' Prevalence ', ' Time ', ' Testing ', ' biomarker ', ' Behavioral ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Population ', ' Interview ', ' Adolescent ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Food ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Asthma ', ' Bronchial Asthma ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Shapes ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Play ', ' cost effective ', ' cost-effective ', ' Physicians ', ' Risk ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Measurement ', ' Process ', ' Childhood Asthma ', ' Pediatric asthma ', ' Asthma in Children ', ' Physical environment ', ' Longitudinal Surveys ', ' Residential Mobility ', ' Family Characteristics ', ' Residential Selections ', ' Health Surveys ', ' Peer Group ', ' National origin ', ' Probability Samples ', ' ']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R01,2011,395603,0.15528538707500236
"Neighborhood Effects on Weight Change and Diabetes Risk Factors    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Diabetes is increasing at an alarming rate. Between 1980 and 2004, as obesity increased, the number of Americans with diabetes more than doubled. Individuals from minority, low-income and low education populations are disproportionately affected by diabetes (and by complication of diabetes), and these socioeconomic disparities may be growing. Health disparities are often attributed to differences in medical care or self-care, but data suggest that these individual level factors explain few of the existing disparities. Neighborhood environments are increasingly recognized as exerting influence on diet, on physical activity and on outcomes of chronic disease. The present proposal is based on the theory that the immediate neighborhood environment of a person living with diabetes may influence decisions and actions related to food procurement, weight status, diabetes self-care behaviors and cardiometabolic markers and, ultimately, on incidence of complications of diabetes. The proposed research project will assess neighborhood-level influences on health such as accessibility to supermarkets, the ratio of fast food and convenience store to supermarkets and produce vendors, and household food security, by collecting a broad range of data on participants' communities in an ongoing study of ethnic disparities in diabetes outcomes. Neighborhood- level data will be collected and linked to a vast array of detailed individual-level socio-demographic, behavioral, cardiometabolic and complications data existing on this cohort. The project's specific aims are: 1) to create a longitudinal database of neighborhood characteristics; 2) to assess the effect of the neighborhood food environement on cardiometabolic markers of risk among persons with diabetes; and, 3) to determine individual- and neighborhood-level factors on the causal pathway between the neighborhood food environment and cardiometabolic markers of risk among persons with diabetes. This study involves data collection and analysis of compositional (e.g., census), contextual (e.g., food resources), and spatially derived data (e.g., access to food resource) on health behaviors and cardiometabolic risk factors among persons with diabetes. Accomplishing the aims of this proposal will expand current understanding of the neighborhood food, physical activity and social environments that contribute to good health, and will inform further study of alternative strategies for measurement and analysis of environmental influences on health. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed study aims to assess neighborhood-level factors that are associated with weight status, diabetes self-care behaviors and cardiometabolic risk factors in a cohort of adult diabetics. We will add neighborhood data, such as neighborhood socioeconomic status, location of supermarkets, fast food restaurants, alcohol outlets, and parks, to the ongoing Kaiser Permanente Division of Research ""Distance Study"".

"Neighborhoods and Cardiovascular Risk in a Multiethnic Cohort    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There has been much recent interest in how features of residential environments (the built environment as well as social features of neighborhoods) affect the prevalence and development of cardiovascular disease and its risk factors, including obesity, diabetes, and hypertension. Identifying modifiable features of neighborhoods that contribute to cardiovascular risk would have important implications for the development of interventions and strategies to prevent cardiovascular disease and reduce social inequalities and race/ethnic differences in cardiovascular risk. Although randomized trials and/or evaluation of quasi experiments or natural experiments will ultimately be needed to determine the effectiveness of specific neighborhood-level interventions, rigorous observational work is still needed to determine what the most promising areas for intervention may be. However, very few observational studies have the type of detailed neighborhood and individual-level data necessary for this work. This competing renewal application builds on prior work conducted under R01 HL071759. As part of the prior project cycle we created a unique and rich dataset with a multiplicity of rigorous objective and survey-based measures of residential environments linked to the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA), a state-of-the art, longitudinal, population-based, multi-site and multi-ethnic epidemiologic study of cardiovascular disease. In this renewal we propose to enhance and update the neighborhood-level environmental measures to allow for methodologically rigorous longitudinal analyses that build on key findings of cross-sectional analyses conducted as part of the prior cycle. The Specific Aims of the project are: (1) To examine associations of specific neighborhood characteristics (including measures of access to healthy foods, walkability and urban design, access to recreational resources, and neighborhood stressors) with changes in diet, physical activity, and body weight over time; (2) To examine associations of neighborhood characteristics with incident diabetes and hypertension as well as with changes over time in continuous measures of insulin resistance and blood pressure (3) To examine associations of neighborhood characteristics with incident fatal and non fatal cardiovascular events; and (4)To investigate the contribution of neighborhood environments to race/ethnic and socioeconomic differences in longitudinal changes in risk factors and incident disease. In addition, the creation and maintenance of a rich data set on environmental features for MESA participants over time will generate a unique resource to be used in gene-environment interaction studies as MESA genotyping proceeds. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: If features of neighborhoods are shown to be important in the development of cardiovascular disease and its risk factors, strategies to prevent cardiovascular disease may need to focus on environments as well as individuals. Identifying the specific neighborhood features that are most important is key to the development and future testing of these interventions.              Relevance If features of neighborhoods are shown to be important in the development of cardiovascular disease and its risk factors, strategies to prevent cardiovascular disease may need to focus on environments as well as individuals.

"Harlem Community Academic Partnership: Influenza Immunizations    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Proposed is a community based participatory research project (CBPR) and evaluation for improving influenza immunizations in high risk populations within disadvantaged minority communities. The Harlem Community and Academic Partnership (HCAP)'s Board includes residents, community based organizations, academic partners and the local health department who meet monthly to plan, conduct and review neighborhood assessments, interventions and evaluation activities; topic-specific issues are addressed through formation of Intervention Work Groups (IWGs). The HCAP Board noted especially low rates of influenza immunizations in Harlem and formed the VIVA (Venue Intensive Vaccine for Adults) IWG. This IWG has conducted separate pilots including a survey on barriers to immunization, development of culturally informed intervention materials, a pilot of ""yellow jacket"" outreach workers to engage and educate hard-to reach populations, and provision of immunizations at non-traditional sites. The goal of this proposal is to assemble these components to formally scale up and test the intervention for adults in the Harlem communities. To achieve these aims, the HCAP VIVA IWG will plan, organize and implement an intervention; our primary partner, Palladia Inc, provides outreach educators and a service network of over 120 CBOs to educate and mobilize the community for immunization as well as coordinate congregating persons with traditional and new non-traditional venues for immunizations; the local Visiting Nurse Service has agreed to provide nurses and influenza vaccines at the selected venues gratis. This program does not replace, but rather supplements existing vaccination programs in the city by adding more relevant education and new ""non-traditional"" venues. We expect that this program will increase rates of immunizations overall including the hard-to-reach populations. To evaluate this program, we will compare annual rates of immunization between Harlem and communities similar to Harlem in NYC, with data available by neighborhood through the NYC annual ""Community Health Survey"" (modified BRFSS from CDC) which includes 10,000 adult NYC residents.

"Trajectories of Physical & Cognitive Functioning in the Neighborhood Environment    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Prevalence of physical and cognitive functioning problems increases dramatically with age. These conditions are associated with mobility challenges, decline in quality of life, and increases in falls and bone fractures, loss of independence and increased healthcare costs. Important disparities in these outcomes by socioeconomic status (SES) and race/ethnicity exist. This application seeks to improve knowledge about physical and cognitive functioning and their decline over time in the context of the neighborhood environment, with special emphasis on social and physical aspects of neighborhoods. Additionally, this proposal seeks to further understand how neighborhood environments contribute to race/ethnic and SES disparities in function. This proposed study involves separate secondary analyses of two datasets, including the ongoing MESA (Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis) study of 6,000 mid-aged and older men and women nationwide, and SWAN (Study of Women's Health Across the Nation), an ongoing annual study of 3,302 multi-ethnic midlife women. We hypothesize that neighborhoods with lower SES, fewer resources for physical engagement, fewer resources for intellectual engagement and less favorable social environments (fewer resources for social engagement and higher stress levels) will predispose to poorer physical and cognitive function. Aim 1 proposes cross-sectional investigation of how the neighborhood environment is associated with physical and cognitive function after adjusting for individual-level factors, and how neighborhood factors contribute to cross-sectional health disparities in function. Aim 2 will investigate whether neighborhood factors and changes in neighborhood factors are related to changes in physical and cognitive function over time as well as the contribution of neighborhoods to differential changes in function over time by SES and race/ethnicity. A variety of analytical methods will be used to address the causal inference challenges present in neighborhood health effects research. The analyses are embedded in a training and mentoring plan including training in substantive areas related to cognition, function, and aging as well as methodological training in longitudinal data analyses, propensity scores, econometric techniques and causal inference generally. This application will provide preliminary data and the mentoring necessary to establish the applicant as an independent investigator and promote the development of a successful R01 application.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Prevalence of physical and cognitive functioning problems increases dramatically with age, and gender and health disparities highlight the vulnerable status of minorities and women. There is substantial public health relevance in extending our understanding of how aspects of the neighborhood environment may impact physical and cognitive function because all three factors are modifiable. Deepening our understanding of the role that neighborhoods play in health disparities in functioning will provide valuable information in addressing these disparities.              Prevalence of physical and cognitive functioning problems increases dramatically with age, and gender and health disparities highlight the vulnerable status of minorities and women.

"Dynamic Models of Racial Residential Segregation    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal outlines a plan of research to better understand the causes of racial residential segregation in American cities. Racial residential segregation contributes to the formation of high-poverty neighborhoods and has been implicated as an important source of enduring racial health disparities (e.g., Mechanic 2007). Yet social scientists do not know what forces contribute to maintaining residential racial segregation, what the respective importance of these forces are, or how these forces combine. Two obstacles limit accumulation of causal knowledge in this research area. First, we lack a plausible model of how individual demographic factors and neighborhood characteristics simultaneously affect individual mobility decisions. Second, most past research measures potential explanatory factors at the individual or intermediary (e.g., real-estate agents or lenders) level, but do not represent how those factors affect neighborhood racial composition in the aggregate. Our project addresses these problems through a discrete choice statistical model of residential choice and an agent-based simulation of neighborhood formation. The discrete choice models are estimated using the data on residential mobility from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics matched with data from the Decennial Censuses. Our basic model of residential mobility incorporates race and neighborhood racial composition, income and neighborhood housing cost, neighborhood income composition, housing tenure (owning or renting), and household composition; proposed extensions to the model incorporate family wealth, mobility impacts of nearby neighborhood changes, and housing market discrimination. The agent-based model creates simulated cities with the demography, geography, and housing stock of actual urban areas in which household mobility is governed by behavioral rules estimated in the discrete choice model. Taken together, this framework can be used to address questions regarding how preferences for race of neighbors, affordability constraints, housing market discrimination, and metropolitan population composition affect racial segregation. The model can also be used to explore the effects of spatially targeted housing policies on residential segregation, like the demolition of distressed public housing under Hope VI legislation.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Racial residential segregation contributes to the formation of high-poverty neighborhoods and has been implicated as an important source of enduring racial health disparities (e.g., Mechanic 2007). One strategy for reducing health disparities among racial groups, particularly among blacks and whites, would be to reduce racial residential segregation and the corresponding geographic concentration of poverty. The proposed research aims to provide a better understanding of the causes of segregation, suggest solutions for reducing neighborhood racial segregation, and develop new analytical and technical tools for modeling dynamic processes in scientific research.                              Health Relevance:    Racial residential segregation contributes to the formation of high-poverty neighborhoods and has been implicated as an important source of enduring racial health disparities (e.g., Mechanic 2007).

"Effects of a housing policy experiment on youth behavioral problems    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Adverse neighborhood contexts predict poor mental health and externalizing behavior among adolescents, and the vast racial inequalities in neighborhood environment may play an important role in creating and maintaining racial disparities in health. However, since most research has been observational rather than experimental, it is potentially biased. Neighborhood-health research typically models point-in-time exposures of neighborhoods, in lieu of understanding neighborhood exposure trajectories, and insufficient attention has been paid to the specific contexts navigated by minority, impoverished, adolescents. Our study proposes a secondary analysis of data from a social experiment of voluntary neighborhood relocation using Section 8 Housing Vouchers in 5 cities (the Moving to Opportunity, MTO, Study), to test how and why random assignment of an offer to move to a low-poverty neighborhood unexpectedly adversely affected behavioral problems for boys over a 4-7 year period, and to inform the program's opposite gender effects on mental health. We will complement the existing data with additional neighborhood-level data collection to enrich the dataset. MTO is the only available large- scale study that has randomly assigned individuals to receive different neighborhood contexts, to support strong causal inferences of how neighborhoods shape mental health. Yet prior MTO analyses have not integrated theoretical understanding of adolescent development to motivate empirical analyses. Nor have prior analyses probed why neighborhood context may increase behavioral problems of boys, whether certain subgroups are more likely to be affected than others by neighborhood relocation, or whether there are important developmentally-sensitive periods when exposure to neighborhood deprivation may be especially influential on youth mental health. Our project proposes 3 aims: Aim 1: To test whether effects of moving to a low-poverty neighborhood on behavioral problems for boys are mediated by neighborhood characteristics, family context, or substance use. Aim 2: To examine, separately among boys and girls, whether the effect of moving to a low-poverty neighborhood on behavioral problems is modified by baseline health status, family/adolescent vulnerability, or program site. Aim 3: To compare the importance of alternative timing or sequencing patterns of exposure to neighborhood poverty on behavioral problems among boys. The project will leverage an interdisciplinary team of investigators, including fields of social epidemiology, psychiatric epidemiology, developmental psychology, demography, public policy, statistics, medicine. This project will capitalize on an experimental design, will innovatively apply causal methods to understand mediation, and will model time-varying neighborhood exposures, which will inform relevant early life course developmental timing of neighborhood exposure periods for adolescent well-being. Because of the rigorous experimental design, this project can provide strong policy-relevant evidence on the mechanisms by which social policies like Section 8 housing vouchers may influence population health and mental health.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Neighborhood context may be an important cause of health disparities, especially taking into account risks which accumulate early in life. The results of this project, leveraging a social experiment of housing relocation, have the potential to inform the literature on why neighborhood context is a cause of behavioral problems among adolescents, including probing more specificity on when and for how long living in low-poverty neighborhoods may be most influential for affecting adolescent mental health. This knowledge will inform the next generation of interventions and policies to ensure that adolescents are not harmed by rental assistance policies; results from the experimental design will inform causal pathways and potential intervention points by which to reduce the population burden of mental health and subsequent health disparities.           Neighborhood context may be an important cause of health disparities, especially taking into account risks which accumulate early in life.

"Neighborhood Poverty, Health and Economic Security Over the Adult Lifespan    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Does living in a distressed neighborhood affect the long-term health and economic security of low-income adults over the life course, and if so, what types of policy responses can remediate these ""neighborhood effects"" on health and well-being? We seek funding to answer these questions by analyzing data collected as part of the long-term follow-up (10-15 years) of low-income middle and older-aged adults participating in a unique randomized neighborhood mobility experiment known as Moving to Opportunity (MTO). The MTO demonstration used a randomized lottery to offer some public housing residents but not others the chance to relocate to less disadvantaged neighborhoods using a rental housing subsidy. MTO experimentally generated large differences in neighborhood characteristics for otherwise comparable groups of low-income, dispropor- tionately minority families. From 2008-10 in-person survey data and biomarkers were collected by our team from 3,215 female adults in MTO (mean age 45.6). The effective response rate to our surveys was 89 percent, and was quite similar across randomly-assigned MTO groups. Preliminary intention-to-treat analyses suggest that neighborhood environments may play an important role in determining some outcomes for low-income aging adults in the U.S., which in turn suggests the importance for science and policy of fully understanding these impacts and the nature of their determinants and underlying mechanisms. The specific aims of the present application are as follows:  1. To estimate the long-term effects of MTO-induced neighborhood mobility on the full range of health and economic outcomes that were collected, and examine impacts for key baseline sub-samples.  2. To decompose the total effects of the intervention on these outcomes and identify the mechanisms through which the aggregate effects occurred.  3. To develop and test a structural model of neighborhood choice, which will be led by a new co-  investigator that we have added to the team just for this purpose - Petra Todd.  4. To create a public use file and two restricted-use versions of the long-term MTO dataset that would be archived with ICPSR to be made directly available to outside researchers for secondary analysis. The overarching goal is to better understand the effects of MTO and neighborhood mobility on adult long-term health and economic security as well as the processes by which these outcomes are affected. This study will help shed light on larger disparities in health and economic outcomes across race and class lines. NIA funding is essential to carry out the data preparation, and data archiving described here.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project examines whether disparities in health and other outcomes can be explained in part by the increased likelihood that low-income and minority adults live in high-poverty, highly- disadvantaged neighborhoods. It will draw on biomeasures, surveys and other data from a unique housing experiment known as Moving to Opportunity (MTO). The project will also create a data archive to provide a foundation for future neighborhood research by medical and social science researchers.              This project examines whether disparities in health and other outcomes can be explained in part by the increased likelihood that low-income and minority adults live in high-poverty, highly- disadvantaged neighborhoods.

"Neighborhood Socioeconomic Status and Alcohol Outcomes: Moderators and Mediators    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This grant application responds to the program announcements for the Secondary Analysis of Existing Epidemiology Data (PA-08-168) and for studies of Epidemiology and Prevention in Alcohol Research (PA-07-449) calling for exploratory and developmental research issued by the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism. The application proposes a secondary analysis of data from the 2000 and 2005 National Alcohol Surveys (conducted by the Alcohol Research Group) linked with data from the 2000 US Decennial Census to examine whether, for whom and how neighborhood socioeconomic status is associated with alcohol use and alcohol problems. First, the study will investigate whether there are direct effects of neighborhood SES on alcohol use, high-risk drinking and alcohol problems in a nationally-representative sample of US adults. To determine the groups for whom the neighborhood socioeconomic context matters, we will examine whether the associations between neighborhood SES and the outcomes vary by demographic group. Analyses using linear and logistic regression will examine the relevance of the neighborhood environment for residents of different races/ethnicities and socioeconomic backgrounds, as well as for young, midlife and senior adults. Additional analyses focusing on high-risk drinking and alcohol problems will examine whether early-life risk factors moderate the effects of exposure to neighborhood risk later in life. This innovative approach is informed by developmental psychopathology and a life-course perspective in examining alcohol use and alcohol problems among a general population sample of adults. The final analyses will address how the neighborhood socioeconomic context may impact behavior by ascertaining whether psychosocial mediating factors help explain the influence of neighborhood SES on the alcohol outcomes. The mediation analysis will involve preliminary linear and logistic regression to inform overall path analysis models.  The objectives of this project are directly relevant to the mission of the NIH to explain and reduce health disparities related to alcohol. This exploratory epidemiologic study will inform prevention science by permitting the identification of groups of neighborhood residents at increased risk for heavy alcohol use and alcohol problems. The study also will extend prior research by exploring the pathways through which neighborhoods contribute to alcohol outcomes. As noted in the program announcements, multi-level prevention initiatives are of great interest. This study identifies risk and protective factors at the individual, familial, and neighborhood levels and explores their interrelationships using a socioecological perspective. Future projects will be designed to help translate the study findings into community-focused, multi-level prevention interventions for at-risk individuals living in high-risk neighborhoods, including mental health support services for people most in need, targeted public education campaigns in affluent and disadvantaged neighborhoods, and environmental change to reduce the burden of alcohol problems in disadvantaged communities.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Our health and behavior are influenced by where we live. This study explores whether neighborhoods are related to alcohol use and alcohol problems. It focuses on neighborhood socioeconomic status (both affluence and disadvantage) and whether some groups (such as racial minority group members, people with low incomes, young adults, or formerly heavy drinkers) are more at risk if they live in disadvantaged neighborhoods. The study also examines how neighborhoods are related to expression of alcohol problems, such as by heavier drinking, depression or reasons for drinking. The results from this study will help develop prevention programs for people and neighborhoods at risk.           Relevance  Our health and behavior are influenced by where we live.

"Physical Frailty in Urban African-Americans    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This revised competitive renewal of ""Physical Frailty in Urban African Americans"" requests five years of funding (Y11-15) to enable additional data collection on and analysis of a representative cohort of community-dwelling African Americans living in St. Louis, known as the African American Health (AAH) project. The 998 enrolled AAH subjects were 49 to 65 years of age at baseline evaluation in 2000-2001, 463 from a very poor inner-city area and 535 from more affluent suburban conditions; 865 are alive and continue to participate. Five annual waves of high quality participation and data have already been collected by an experienced team that has made valuable contributions to the field. In the continuation, we propose to obtain telephone interviews (lasting 50 and 25 minutes, respectively) seven and eight years after baseline and a detailed in-home evaluation (120 minutes) nine years after baseline. We expand prior research themes by adding a comprehensive, innovative approach to examining contextual effects, extensive investigations of resilience, and cutting-edge analytic methods. With the combined eight waves of data over ten years, we will pursue two specific aims: (1) investigate the process of disablement in this cohort using individual-level data and (2) investigate the independent effect of adverse neighborhood conditions on the disablement process. We hypothesize that the disablement process can be viewed as an ordered progression in which the principal transitions for 25 tasks are from high functioning (HF), to subclinical status (SC; defined as no reported difficulty but change in either method or frequency of performance), from SC to difficulty (D), and from D to adverse health outcomes (e.g., falls, death). Primary analytic methods involve (a) multi-state transition models for individual tasks and (b) mixed effect models with both fixed and random intercepts and coefficients for three psychometrically-sound composite measures, examining the composite HF, SC, and D count trajectories both individually and simultaneously. For aim 2, our primary hypotheses are: (a) adverse neighborhood conditions (built environment less conducive to physical activity, lower availability of services, and increased area-level deprivation) are associated with disability outcomes, after adjusting for individual- level factors; (b) the negative effect of service availability operates at a different spatial scale than those of the built environment and deprivation; and, (c) adverse neighborhood conditions can be used to target future interventions to improve disability outcomes. Both aims examine recovery as well as deterioration and the effects of hypothesized risk (e.g., obesity) and protective (e.g., education) factors on disability outcomes. Analysis involves multilevel and novel geostatistical techniques. We have experience with all proposed assessment and analytic methods, which have adequate (> 80%) power to detect small to moderate effects for all hypotheses. Multiple secondary studies (e.g., fear of falling, life space mobility) will also be pursued.              ",Physical Frailty in Urban African-Americans,8064325,R01AG010436,"['Logistics ', ' frailty ', ' Validity and Reliability ', ' inner city ', ' Taxes ', ' Grips ', ' grasp ', ' Survival Analyses ', ' Survival Analysis ', ' Geographic Information Systems ', ' Destinations ', ' Telephone Interviews ', ' complement C2a fragment ', ' complement 2a ', ' C2a ', ' C 2a ', ' complement C2a ', ' early experience ', ' Lifting ', ' Books ', ' Intercept ', ' Seminal ', ' midlife ', ' middle aged ', ' mid-life ', ' mid life ', ' middle age ', ' Non-Trunk ', ' Limbs ', ' Extremities ', ' Limb structure ', ' fear of falling ', ' resilience ', ' Peak Expiratory Flow ', ' Censuses ', ' suburbia ', ' suburban ', ' suburb ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' healthcare service availability ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare access availability ', ' health services availability ', ' health care service availability ', ' health care service access ', ' health care availability ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Availability of Health Services ', ' Accessibility of health care ', ' Access to Healthcare ', ' Access to Health Care ', ' Access to Care ', ' multilevel modeling ', ' multilevel model ', ' methods to study multiple-level influences ', ' multilevel analysis ', ' Staging ', ' cognitive function ', ' LOINC Axis 2 Property ', ' Property ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Income ', ' Probability ', ' Phase ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' visual function ', ' Sight ', ' Vision ', ' Physical activity ', ' Hospitalization ', ' disability ', ' Risk ', ' Environment ', ' Modeling ', ' Interview ', ' Exposure to ', ' Cognitive ', ' preclinical ', ' pre-clinical ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Obesity ', ' Selection Bias ', ' Data Collection ', ' Baths ', ' Bathing ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' sound ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Comorbidity ', ' Recovery ', ' Smoking ', ' Population Study ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' muscular ', ' Muscle Tissue ', ' Muscle ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Procedures ', ' Visit ', ' Event ', ' emotional dependency ', ' Dependency ', ' Dependency (Psychology) ', ' Psychometrics ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Age-Years ', ' diabetes ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' treatment adverse effect ', ' therapy adverse effect ', ' side effect ', ' Treatment Side Effects ', ' Adverse effects ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Measures ', ' Reporting ', ' Translating ', ' falls ', ' Individual ', ' Communities ', ' pulmonary ', ' Lung Respiratory System ', ' Lung ', ' Principal Investigator ', ' Pattern ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' Home ', ' Home environment ', ' skeletal ', ' IADL ', ' instrumental activity of daily living ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Deterioration ', ' Care Givers ', ' Caregivers ', ' social support network ', ' Social support ', ' deprivation ', ' adverse consequence ', ' adverse outcome ', ' decline in function ', ' functional decline ', ' functional capacity ', ' functional ability ', ' daily living functionality ', ' Activities of everyday life ', ' Activities of Daily Living ', ' health related quality of life ', ' Membrum inferius ', ' Lower Limb ', ' Lower Extremity ', ' Social Functioning ', ' service utilization ', ' Evaluation ', ' insight ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' Area ', ' Sampling ', ' Outcome ', ' Age ', ' Participant ', ' data repository ', ' clinical data repository ', ' Electronic Database ', ' Electronic Databank ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Databases ', ' Life ', ' Investigation ', ' Testing ', ' nursing home ', ' Nursing Homes ', ' Research ', ' Future ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' programs ', ' Complex ', ' Techniques ', ' Location ', ' Health ', ' improved ', ' Mortality ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' base ', ' Frequency ', ' Frequencies (time pattern) ', ' cohort ', ' Persons ', ' Data ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' novel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Time ', ' Process ', ' Funding ', ' Work ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Methods ', ' ']",NIA,INDIANA UNIV-PURDUE UNIV AT INDIANAPOLIS,R01,2011,753623,0.07721465704928879
"Neighborhood Characteristics & Diabetes Incidence in Multiethnic Cohort Study    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Candidate. The overarching goal of this Mentored Career Development Award (K01) is to provide Dr. Sinclair with the skills and experience to establish an independent program of diabetes-related disparities research. This career development award is grounded in a multilevel population health conceptual framework that merges advanced didactic instruction with individualized one-on-one mentorship. The advanced research training will serve to catalyze Dr. Sinclair's work, which focuses on unexplored contextual factors that contribute to diabetes prevalence and incidence. This award will provide her with time and salary support to develop an educational foundation and research program that broadens her capabilities to carry out multilevel health disparities research. To build this foundation, the training program consists of three core components: 1) formal coursework in epidemiology, biostatistics, Geographic Information Systems (GIS) technology, spatial analysis, and health disparities research, 2) mentored research training in multilevel modeling and GIS, and 3) instruction in the responsible conduct of research. Dr. Sinclair brings together an interdisciplinary mentorship board that offers extensive research experience and support of her career development program. The K01 award will allow her to benefit from a rich, multidisciplinary mentorship and training environment, which includes experts in epidemiology, biostatistics, GIS, diabetes, and health disparities research. Research Project. Dr. Sinclair proposes to empirically examine the spatial patterning and distribution of diabetes risk factors, prevalence and incidence among the Multiethnic Cohort Study participants by combining individual- and area-level data. The Multiethnic Cohort Study includes a diverse population-based sample of more than 100,000 Hawaiian residents, identified in 1993-1996, who have been followed for more than 15 years. In the proposed project, Dr. Sinclair will geocode the residential addresses of study participants at the time of entry into the cohort. Neighborhood socioeconomic status will be defined from the 1990 U.S. Census. Similarly, measures of neighborhood resources for physical activity and access to healthy foods will be defined. Research aims are to: 1) determine the cross-sectional association between neighborhood characteristics and the prevalence of diabetes and individual-level risk factors for diabetes, including obesity, poor diet, and low levels of physical activity, 2) assess the longitudinal association between neighborhood characteristics and the incidence of diabetes after adjustment for individual-level diabetes risk factors, and 3) examine if the association between neighborhood characteristics and diabetes prevalence and incidence differs by race and ethnicity. The use of a multilevel perspective can help to identify factors associated with diabetes-related disparities, and is congruent with the NIH strategic plan to move the country toward health equity. Findings from this study will illuminate the larger social and economic forces that create differences in health between neighborhoods, and identify geographical areas where traditional and novel public health interventions may best be targeted. The K01 award is critical to Dr. Sinclair's future as a diabetes researcher and will provide her with the time, mentorship, research skills, analytical training, and practical research experience to develop into an independently funded investigator in diabetes prevention and control among health disparate populations. Environment. The University of Hawaii at Manoa is a major education and research facility that serves as the center for research and advanced graduate and professional studies. The UH School of Medicine houses the largest biomedical research facility in Hawaii, and is the most culturally and ethnically diverse medical school in the U.S. Housed within the medical school is the Department of Native Hawaiian Health where Dr. Sinclair is a member of the research faculty. Laurence N. Kolonel, MD, PhD, will serve as Dr. Sinclair's primary mentor. Dr. Kolonel is a Professor at the UH Cancer Research Center and Principal Investigator of the Multiethnic Cohort Study from which Dr. Sinclair will draw her research project. The Cancer Research Center is an NCI- designated cancer center and receives funding from a Cancer Center Support Grant. The Center's mission is to reduce the burden of cancer through research, education, and service with an emphasis on the unique ethnic, cultural, and environmental characteristics of Hawaii and the Pacific. There are currently three cohort studies in the Epidemiology Program, including the Multiethnic Cohort Study. A GIS workgroup, of which Dr. Sinclair is a member, was recently formed to examine contextual factors and cancer incidence. There are several shared resources of the Cancer Center including the Hawaii Tumor registry which is a member of NCI's SEER Program; biostatistics which provides support for study design and data analysis; nutrition support which provides expertise in dietary questionnaire development and maintains extensive food and supplement composition databases; an analytical laboratory capable of analyzing biospecimens and foods for a wide array of constituents; a genomics laboratory which supports studies of genetic susceptibilities and whole-genome expression; and a bioinformatics group which supports the management and analysis of large and complex datasets. While the research activities of the faculty are varied, they are thematically related to the focus on ethnic diversity. 2   PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The NIDDK Mentored Research Scientist Development Award will allow for additional training and mentorship that will position Dr. Sinclair to become an independent investigator. She will need protected time to acquire the comprehensive training in health disparities research and multilevel modeling. Dr. Sinclair's proposed research is may aid in efforts to understand and address the persistent problem of inequalities in health from a multilevel perspective. The proposed research has the potential to move our current understanding of contextual/environmental factors and diabetes forward.       Relevance.

"Adolescent Experiences and Adult Cardiovascular Health: Effects of the Social and    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Childhood socioeconomic status (SES) has been associated with adult cardiovascular disease, but the mechanisms of how this occurs have not been fully explored. Furthermore, low SES is associated with the co-occurrence of multiple social (i.e., increased violence exposure), physical (i.e., higher air pollution levels, poor access to recreational facilities and access to fresh fruits and vegetables) and behavioral (i.e., poor diet, low physical activity, tobacco use) risk factors associated with cardiovascular disease. However, exposures to these factors during childhood and adolescence have not been evaluated with respect to their role in the development of metabolic and cardiovascular risk profiles in a prospective study. Given the complexity of interactions (individual and neighborhood, social and physical) a life course framework may be a fruitful approach to exploring the individual exposures and social attributes of neighborhoods that contribute to the development of metabolic and cardiovascular risk profiles. This proposal aims to examine the contribution of social stressors and physical environment experienced at both the individual and neighborhood level during adolescence, and their interactions on the development of cardiovascular and metabolic risk profiles (i.e., blood pressure, CRP, Hemoglobin A1c, BMI, waist circumference, total cholesterol, triglycerides, LDL, HDL, non-HDL cholesterol). The research goals of this proposal will be achieved with two projects. First, using the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health), a longitudinal cohort of adolescents followed through adulthood, I will employ a life course approach to determine whether social stressors (i.e., interpersonal violence, school and community violence) and physical environment (i.e., access to food stores, proximity to parks and recreation) experienced in adolescence plays a role in the development of metabolic and cardiovascular risk profiles in adulthood. Interactive effects between social and physical environmental factors will also be examined. Second, I will develop a primary collection cross-sectional study of 100 adolescents to examine the mediating effect of diet (not available in Add Health) and the modifying effects of air pollutants (also not available in the Add Health study) on the stress-cardiovascular health relationship. I will dedicate no less than 75 percent of my time to a highly structured and intensely focused research experience over the next 5 years, which will extend my expertise in characterizing social and environmental determinants as stressors in relation to physiological outcomes in children and young adults. A career development plan is outlined to gain practical skills in research design and implementation, expertise in statistical models to predict air pollutant levels and structural equation models as well as knowledge in the mechanisms of cardiovascular and metabolic disorders. The career development plan includes: 1) formal graduate course work in survey design, latent statistical models, mechanisms of cardiovascular disease, 2) tutorial with project advisor to learn clinical aspects of cardiovascular and metabolic disorders in adolescents 3) tutorial with advisor to discuss air pollutant modeling strategies 4) interactions with mentoring team to discuss research and career goals and project progress. I will work closely with the mentoring team which collectively has extensive experience in mentoring new clinical investigators, disparities in psychosocial factors, life experiences and cardiovascular disease outcomes, effects of neighborhood environment and cardiovascular disease, and disparities in physical environmental factors. The proposed training, consisting of interactions with mentors and advisors, tutorials and coursework, complements my previous training and experience in social and environmental epidemiologic research and will allow me to develop the necessary transdisciplinary expertise to achieve my goal and successfully transition to independent investigator at the end of this award. The proposed project will focus on a major health problem in the U.S. - cardiovascular disease, particularly its onset during the adolescent years and explore new models of how individual and community factors, in this case exposure to violence and environmental toxins, impact health outcomes. Findings from these studies can inform clinical practice in chronic disease prevention so that providers and policymakers alike can tailor age appropriate interventions to adolescents and young adults that jointly address the individual as well as the environmental context to more effectively reduce cardiovascular disease risk.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Childhood socioeconomic status (SES) has been associated with adult cardiovascular disease, but the mechanisms of how this occurs have not been fully explored.

"Geographic and Multilevel Influences of Neighborhood and School Environments on t    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The increased prevalence of obesity in children is well-documented, and associated with increased risk of diabetes, adult obesity, cardiovascular disease, and psychosocial problems. The prevalence of obesity among Hispanic children is significantly greater, and has increased at a greater rate, as compared to non-Hispanic children. While the factors contributing to the increased prevalence of childhood obesity are complex, socio-ecological theory suggests that social, cultural, and built environmental features of schools and neighborhoods may underlie some of the obesity disparities observed in Hispanic and low-income populations. No studies to date have examined how these factors in combination affect child obesity rates using large, population-based samples of Hispanic children. The overall aim of this study is to examine geographic and multilevel influences of neighborhood and school environments on the development of obesity among 24,000 primarily Hispanic (80%), low-income school children (ages 6-9) in El Paso, TX, a metropolitan city on the US-Mexico border. The population data to be used in this study are from the El Paso Independent School District Fitnessgram(R) surveillance dataset (2006-2009), which includes objectively measured body mass index (BMI) and physical fitness assessment gathered on an annual basis by trained school officials for all elementary school children. Obesity will be assessed using body mass index (BMI) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) normed percentiles for gender and age [13]. Home residence, BMI, and other attribute information from students will be geocoded in ArcGIS(R) v. 9.3 (Redlands, CA), and combined with other spatial data layers on socio-demographic and built environment features at both the neighborhood (census tract) and school level. By using multilevel and Bayesian modeling, we will address the following specific aims: 1) describe the socio-demographic, physical fitness, and geographic patterns associated with the development of obesity in low-income, primarily Hispanic school children in a border community; and 2) determine the contextual contributions of neighborhood and school environments to the development of obesity and low levels of physical fitness in low, income, primarily Hispanic school children in a border community. The results obtained from this study will provide important insight on the modifiable factors within the neighborhood and school environment that contribute to obesity risk and development. These results will also be used to develop project proposals for multilevel interventions that address childhood obesity, particularly among Hispanic children within a border community context.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Childhood obesity is a significant public health concern, particularly in low-income Hispanic communities on the US-Mexico border. The results from this project will identify modifiable characteristics in the neighborhood and school environment that contribute to obesity risk and development. The identification of these modifiable characteristics is critical to developing interventions within schools and neighborhoods that can reduce the rise of obesity, particularly in vulnerable school children at the US-Mexico border.             Childhood obesity is a significant public health concern, particularly in low-income Hispanic communities on the US-Mexico border.

"Neighborhoods, Speech Patterns, and Schooling    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal requests funding to launch a research program to understand how and why speech patterns vary across neighborhoods, as well as the implications of speech for the schooling outcomes of disadvantaged children. Speech is socially constructed, and so neighborhood environments may have some effect on the use of dialects such as African-American Vernacular English (AAVE). Previous research suggests use of AAVE is negatively associated with academic achievement, which could occur if AAVE makes it more difficult to read and write standard American English (SAE), or because use of AAVE may engender discrimination from teachers. We have assembled a team of leading economists and socio-linguists to address these questions by exploiting unique new speech data collected using comparable speech measures as part of the HUD-funded Moving to Opportunity (MTO) randomized mobility experiment, and as part of a major population study, the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth, 1997 cohort (NLSY97). We request funding for the following main aims:  1. Transcribe speech samples from MTO and NLSY97, categorize speech through listener perceptions of  the speaker's race, as well as linguistic analysis, which will include measurement of phonological,  morphosyntactic, phonetic, and acoustic features;  2. Document the amount of across-neighborhood variation in speech that exists in the national NLSY97  sample, and determine how much of this variation is accounted for by family background;  3. Estimate the causal effects of neighborhood environments on the speech patterns of some of our  nation's most disadvantaged minority children by exploiting the experimental design of MTO;  4. Use the NLSY97 to establish where in the national speech distribution MTO youth fall as a way of  understanding the magnitude of speech impacts and the generalizability of the MTO results;  5. Exploit variation in MTO children's age at baseline to determine how the sensitivity of speech to  environmental conditions varies by age (which has been a major question in the socio-linguistics field);  6. Determine whether the speech patterns of male and female youth respond differently to neighborhood  social environments, as research in socio-linguistics suggests could be the case and which in turn  could potentially explain gender differences in MTO impacts on youth found in previous MTO research;  7. Estimate non-experimentally the association between speech and schooling outcomes in the MTO and  NLSY97 data, and whether speech mediates neighborhood effects on schooling;  8. Create versions of the MTO and NLSY97 datasets to be made available for secondary analysis. Successfully addressing these aims would generate new evidence about how and why speech varies across neighborhoods and the potential implications of this speech variation for schooling outcomes, and would also help motivate and guide future research that seeks to identify the causal speech-schooling link.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This proposal requests funding to launch a research program to understand how and why speech patterns vary across neighborhoods, as well as the implications of speech patterns for the schooling outcomes of children growing up in disadvantaged communities. Our research seeks to shed additional light on the out-of-school factors that contribute to disparities in schooling and related life outcomes across neighborhoods, which may help guide the design of new education and social policy interventions to remediate these disparities.              OTHER PROJECT INFORMATION - Project Narrative This proposal requests funding to launch a research program to understand how and why speech patterns vary across neighborhoods, as well as the implications of speech patterns for the schooling outcomes of children growing up in disadvantaged communities.

"Center for Integrative Approaches to Health Disparities(CIAHD)- Environmental Rev DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of the Center for Integrative Approaches to Health Disparities (CIAHD) at the University of Michigan is to investigate the multilevel determinants of health disparities in cardiovascular risk by integrating social and biologic factors. As part of this proposed revision we will add an environmental assessment core in order to enhance the environmental measures available in the Jackson Heart Study (JHS) and the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA). Existing evidence strongly suggests that environmental features are strongly patterned by neighborhood race/ethnic and socioeconomic composition. Cross-sectional data also suggest that the environmental features are associated with cardiovascular-related outcomes. However, important questions remain regarding whether these associations reflect causal processes. Two key requirements to improve causal inferences include (1) improving the measures of specific neighborhood features hypothesized to be linked to cardiovascular disease; and (2) incorporating these measures in longitudinal studies. We propose to build on prior work conducted as part of MESA and JHS in order to enhance the environmental measures available in both studies that can be used to better understand the contributions of neighborhood environments to cardiovascular risk and to health disparities. This work will enhance and build on our collaborations with JHS and with MESA, and will involve a partnership between the University of Michigan, the Jackson Heart Study, and Drexel University. The specific aims of the revision are (1) To enhance the neighborhood -level data available in MESA by adding novel data on food price and various built environment measures that can be better used to study the impact of neighborhoods on changes cardiovascular risk; (2) To create comparable time-varying measures of access to healthy foods, recreational facilities, and other price and built environment data for JHS (3) to promote analyses of neighborhood effects on cardiovascular risk that take advantage of the new environmental data in MESA and JHS. This revision will provide the infrastructure and datasets necessary for CIAHD investigators to pursue environmental health disparities research that is highly synergistic with and expands the scope of CIAHD.

"Neighborhood Characteristics and Childhood Weight Trajectories: An Agent Based Mo     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposed research project will lead to creation of an exploratory agent based model (ABM) which will link neighborhood characteristics (i.e. the physical and social environment) with physical activity behaviors in children. There is growing evidence that the physical and social environments exert a strong influence on levels of physical activity in children, an important determinant of childhood obesity. An increasing number of policy interventions targeting physical activity are therefore being proposed. The use of ABM has been recommended by a recent Institute of Medicine committee to help guide policy development targeting childhood obesity. Dr. Joyce Lee, a pediatric endocrinologist and pediatric health services researcher who has expertise in modeling and policy related to childhood obesity, will work with Dr. Ana Diez Roux, an internationally known epidemiologist who has published extensively on neighborhood health effects and the use of agent based models, to create an ABM that will enhance understanding scientific understanding of the ways in which the physical and social environment factors affect physical activity behaviors in children.  The specific aims of this study are the following: Aim 1: To perform a comprehensive literature review of: (1) studies which examine neighborhood (physical and social environment) characteristics and their influence on physical activity in childhood and (2) studies that examine the links between physical activity and energy expenditure, and energy expenditure and weight gain among children. Aim 2: To develop an exploratory agent based model which examines the role of neighborhood characteristics (physical and social environment) on physical activity behaviors in children. Aim 2a: To validate and calibrate the model using the data based on nationally representative data and studies from the literature. Aim 2b: To explore the role of spatial inequities in physical education and neighborhood safety on socioeconomic disparities in levels of childhood physical activity. Childhood obesity is a public health crisis, influenced by a complex interplay of factors, including biologic, behavioral, environmental, and social influences. The use of complex systems sciences methodologies (which includes agent based modeling) for enhancing scientific understanding of population health problems is an increasing focus of the National Institutes of Health, with a number of RFAs exclusively focused on this modeling approach. The initial exploratory model from this study will serve as the foundation for a future R01 application to create a comprehensive ABM of childhood obesity which will provide a valuable opportunity to understand how policies at the federal, state and school district levels may impact levels of childhood obesity.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This proposed research project will lead to creation of an exploratory agent based model (ABM) which will link neighborhood characteristics (i.e. the physical and social environment) with physical activity behaviors in children.

"Neighborhood Characteristics & Diabetes Incidence in Multiethnic Cohort Study    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Candidate. The overarching goal of this Mentored Career Development Award (K01) is to provide Dr. Sinclair with the skills and experience to establish an independent program of diabetes-related disparities research. This career development award is grounded in a multilevel population health conceptual framework that merges advanced didactic instruction with individualized one-on-one mentorship. The advanced research training will serve to catalyze Dr. Sinclair's work, which focuses on unexplored contextual factors that contribute to diabetes prevalence and incidence. This award will provide her with time and salary support to develop an educational foundation and research program that broadens her capabilities to carry out multilevel health disparities research. To build this foundation, the training program consists of three core components: 1) formal coursework in epidemiology, biostatistics, Geographic Information Systems (GIS) technology, spatial analysis, and health disparities research, 2) mentored research training in multilevel modeling and GIS, and 3) instruction in the responsible conduct of research. Dr. Sinclair brings together an interdisciplinary mentorship board that offers extensive research experience and support of her career development program. The K01 award will allow her to benefit from a rich, multidisciplinary mentorship and training environment, which includes experts in epidemiology, biostatistics, GIS, diabetes, and health disparities research. Research Project. Dr. Sinclair proposes to empirically examine the spatial patterning and distribution of diabetes risk factors, prevalence and incidence among the Multiethnic Cohort Study participants by combining individual- and area-level data. The Multiethnic Cohort Study includes a diverse population-based sample of more than 100,000 Hawaiian residents, identified in 1993-1996, who have been followed for more than 15 years. In the proposed project, Dr. Sinclair will geocode the residential addresses of study participants at the time of entry into the cohort. Neighborhood socioeconomic status will be defined from the 1990 U.S. Census. Similarly, measures of neighborhood resources for physical activity and access to healthy foods will be defined. Research aims are to: 1) determine the cross-sectional association between neighborhood characteristics and the prevalence of diabetes and individual-level risk factors for diabetes, including obesity, poor diet, and low levels of physical activity, 2) assess the longitudinal association between neighborhood characteristics and the incidence of diabetes after adjustment for individual-level diabetes risk factors, and 3) examine if the association between neighborhood characteristics and diabetes prevalence and incidence differs by race and ethnicity. The use of a multilevel perspective can help to identify factors associated with diabetes-related disparities, and is congruent with the NIH strategic plan to move the country toward health equity. Findings from this study will illuminate the larger social and economic forces that create differences in health between neighborhoods, and identify geographical areas where traditional and novel public health interventions may best be targeted. The K01 award is critical to Dr. Sinclair's future as a diabetes researcher and will provide her with the time, mentorship, research skills, analytical training, and practical research experience to develop into an independently funded investigator in diabetes prevention and control among health disparate populations. Environment. The University of Hawaii at Manoa is a major education and research facility that serves as the center for research and advanced graduate and professional studies. The UH School of Medicine houses the largest biomedical research facility in Hawaii, and is the most culturally and ethnically diverse medical school in the U.S. Housed within the medical school is the Department of Native Hawaiian Health where Dr. Sinclair is a member of the research faculty. Laurence N. Kolonel, MD, PhD, will serve as Dr. Sinclair's primary mentor. Dr. Kolonel is a Professor at the UH Cancer Research Center and Principal Investigator of the Multiethnic Cohort Study from which Dr. Sinclair will draw her research project. The Cancer Research Center is an NCI- designated cancer center and receives funding from a Cancer Center Support Grant. The Center's mission is to reduce the burden of cancer through research, education, and service with an emphasis on the unique ethnic, cultural, and environmental characteristics of Hawaii and the Pacific. There are currently three cohort studies in the Epidemiology Program, including the Multiethnic Cohort Study. A GIS workgroup, of which Dr. Sinclair is a member, was recently formed to examine contextual factors and cancer incidence. There are several shared resources of the Cancer Center including the Hawaii Tumor registry which is a member of NCI's SEER Program; biostatistics which provides support for study design and data analysis; nutrition support which provides expertise in dietary questionnaire development and maintains extensive food and supplement composition databases; an analytical laboratory capable of analyzing biospecimens and foods for a wide array of constituents; a genomics laboratory which supports studies of genetic susceptibilities and whole-genome expression; and a bioinformatics group which supports the management and analysis of large and complex datasets. While the research activities of the faculty are varied, they are thematically related to the focus on ethnic diversity. 2   PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The NIDDK Mentored Research Scientist Development Award will allow for additional training and mentorship that will position Dr. Sinclair to become an independent investigator. She will need protected time to acquire the comprehensive training in health disparities research and multilevel modeling. Dr. Sinclair's proposed research is may aid in efforts to understand and address the persistent problem of inequalities in health from a multilevel perspective.

"Health of Low-Income Adults in Subsidized Housing: Randomized Experiment, NY City DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): From a public health perspective, moving to subsidized housing, to less poor neighborhoods, to housing developments with low rates of crime, or to more mixed income settings might reduce health disparities through multiple pathways. The proposed experimental research will utilize the NYC Department of Housing Preservation and Development's lottery system to identify treatment and control households that fit our study criteria. Group assignment will include households who move to a subsidized apartment in one of ten newly constructed housing sites (treatment) and matched households who do not receive housing (control). We estimate that our experimental sample will be comprised of about 1,300 participating treatment households and 1,690 lottery- matched controls. This proposal's design improves and expands upon the design of earlier housing experiments in that it (a) compares the impact of moving to a new neighborhood versus staying in the same neighborhood among recipients of subsidized housing, (b) compares the impact of moving into mixed-income versus solely low- income buildings, (c) examines the impact of subsidized housing on near-poor families (rather than just families below the poverty threshold), (d) examines the effect of subsidized housing where the uptake of the offer is 90% (rather than less than one-half in previous demonstrations of subsidized housing), and (e) examines the effect of subsidized housing where the families are likely to stay in the subsidized housing (compared to studies of vouchers, where over half of those who did move ended up moving again, typically back to poor neighborhoods). Our proposed data collection strategy will include baseline data collection at time of application for housing using a self-administered questionnaire to be completed by a single adult household member and augmented by information obtained from the housing application itself. Follow-up telephone interviews will take place 12-18 months after move-in, or equivalent for non-movers. A variety of information on current health status and health behaviors will be collected at baseline and follow-up to enable assessment of within-household change as well as average change between comparison groups at follow-up. Experimental analyses will be used to quantify the impact of moving to subsidized housing in a new neighborhood relative to moving to subsidized housing in the same neighborhood of residence at time of application. Exploratory analysis will compare two types of treatment: moves to mixed-income housing and exclusively low-income housing developments. Relationships among household, housing, and neighborhood features will be examined as potential outcomes as well as mediators of individual-level health outcomes.    PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Experimental research has shown that moving to new housing in particular kinds of neighborhoods may improve the life chances of poor families; however, previous research confounded housing- and neighborhood mobility and did not investigate the benefits of mixed-income housing developments. Our randomized experiment will track about 1,300 households who receive city-subsidized housing and about 1,700 matched households who do not receive housing over the first 12-18 months after move-in to assess changes in physical and mental health, and health behaviors. In addition, we will explore changes in physical, economic, and social environments that may mediate the relationship between residential context and health and well-being of low-income residents.

In addition, we will  explore changes in physical, economic, and social environments that may mediate the  relationship between residential context and health and well-being of low-income  residents.","Health of Low-Income Adults in Subsidized Housing: Randomized Experiment, NY City",8308630,R01HD066223,"['adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Air ', ' Anxiety ', ' Bronchial Asthma ', ' Asthma ', ' Dorsum ', ' Back ', ' Behavior ', ' Cities ', ' Communities ', ' Crime ', ' Cues ', ' Data Collection ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' dietary ', ' Diet ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Economical Conditions ', ' Economic Conditions ', ' Economics ', ' Environment ', ' Family ', ' Family Sizes ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' Level of Health ', ' Health Status ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' Household ', ' Housing ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Income ', ' Telephone Interviews ', ' Lifestyle ', ' Life Style ', ' Marketing ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' New York City ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Obesity ', ' Perception ', ' well-being ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' Poverty ', ' preservation ', ' Biologic Preservation ', ' Biological Preservation ', ' Public Assistance ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Housing ', ' Questionnaires ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Safety ', ' Schools ', ' Self Assessment ', ' Self Assessment (Psychology) ', ' Societal Conditions ', ' Social Conditions ', ' socioenvironment ', ' social context ', ' social climate ', ' Social Environment ', ' social support network ', ' Social support ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Translations ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Relative ', ' Relative (related person) ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Mediating ', ' Caring ', ' Social Network ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' residence ', ' Individual ', ' Trust ', ' Policies ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' uptake ', ' healthy food ', ' Health Food ', ' liquor ', ' distilled alcoholic beverage ', ' Exposure to ', ' Shapes ', ' convenience food ', ' fast food ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Dimensions ', ' Source ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' Location ', ' physical health ', ' physical conditioning ', ' interest ', ' experience ', ' hazard ', ' cohort ', ' Proxy ', ' Participant ', ' member ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' research study ', ' Population Study ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' after-school program ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' voucher ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Institution ', ' Diameter ', ' Caliber ', ' Low income ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Preventive ', ' Data ', ' Improve Access ', ' Qualifying ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Randomized ', ' Self-Administered ', ' Characteristics ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' comparison group ', ' cost ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' diet and exercise ', ' community living ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Consumption ', ' federal poverty level ', ' comparative ', ' treatment site ', ' primary outcome ', ' population health ', ' ']",NICHD,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY TEACHERS COLLEGE,R01,2012,519948,0.0849589265187074
"Neighborhood Characteristics & Diabetes Incidence in Multiethnic Cohort Study Candidate. The overarching goal of this Mentored Career Development Award (K01) is to provide Dr. Sinclair with the skills and experience to establish an independent program of diabetes-related disparities research. This career development award is grounded in a multilevel population health conceptual framework that merges advanced didactic instruction with individualized one-on-one mentorship. The advanced research training will serve to catalyze Dr. Sinclair's work, which focuses on unexplored contextual factors that contribute to diabetes prevalence and incidence. This award will provide her with time and salary support to  develop an educational foundation and research program that broadens her capabilities to carry out multilevel health disparities research. To build this foundation, the training program consists of three core components: 1) formal coursework in epidemiology, biostatistics, Geographic Information Systems (GIS) technology, spatial analysis, and health disparities research, 2) mentored research training in multilevel modeling and GIS, and 3) instruction in the responsible conduct of research. Dr. Sinclair brings together an interdisciplinary mentorship board that offers extensive research experience and support of her career development program. The K01 award will allow her to benefit from a rich, multidisciplinary mentorship and training environment, which  includes experts in epidemiology, biostatistics, GIS, diabetes, and health disparities research.    Research Project. Dr. Sinclair proposes to empirically examine the spatial patterning and distribution of diabetes risk factors, prevalence and incidence among the Multiethnic Cohort Study participants by combining individual- and area-level data. The Multiethnic Cohort Study includes a diverse population-based sample of more than 100,000 Hawaiian residents, identified in 1993-1996, who have been followed for more than 15 years. In the proposed project, Dr. Sinclair will geocode the residential addresses of study participants at the time of entry into the cohort. Neighborhood socioeconomic status will be defined from the 1990 U.S. Census. Similarly, measures of neighborhood resources for physical activity and access to healthy foods will be defined. Research aims are to: 1) determine the cross-sectional association between neighborhood characteristics and the prevalence of diabetes and individual-level risk factors for diabetes, including obesity, poor diet, and low levels of physical activity, 2) assess the longitudinal association between neighborhood characteristics and the incidence of diabetes after adjustment for individual-level diabetes risk factors, and 3) examine if the association between neighborhood characteristics and diabetes prevalence and incidence differs by race and ethnicity. The use of a multilevel perspective can help to identify factors associated with diabetes-related disparities, and is congruent with the NIH strategic plan to move the country toward health equity. Findings from this study will illuminate the larger social and economic forces that create differences in health between neighborhoods, and identify geographical areas where traditional and novel public health interventions may best be targeted. The K01 award is critical to Dr. Sinclair's future as a diabetes researcher and will provide her with the time, mentorship, research skills, analytical training, and practical research experience to develop into an independently funded investigator in diabetes prevention and control among  health disparate populations.    Environment. The University of Hawaii at Mnoa is a major education and research facility that serves as the center for research and advanced graduate and professional studies. The UH School of Medicine houses the largest biomedical research facility in Hawaii, and is the most culturally and ethnically diverse medical school in the U.S. Housed within the medical school is the Department of Native Hawaiian Health where Dr. Sinclair is a member of the research faculty. Laurence N. Kolonel, MD, PhD, will serve as Dr. Sinclair's primary mentor. Dr. Kolonel is a Professor at the UH Cancer Research Center and Principal Investigator of the Multiethnic Cohort Study from which Dr. Sinclair will draw her research project. The Cancer Research Center is an NCI-designated cancer center and receives funding from a Cancer Center Support Grant. The Center's mission is to reduce the burden of cancer through research, education, and service with an emphasis on the unique ethnic, cultural, and environmental characteristics of Hawaii and the Pacific. There are currently three cohort studies in the Epidemiology Program, including the Multiethnic Cohort Study. A GIS workgroup, of which Dr. Sinclair is a member, was recently formed to examine contextual factors and cancer incidence. There are  several shared resources of the Cancer Center including the Hawaii Tumor registry which is a member of NCI's SEER Program; biostatistics which provides support for study design and data analysis; nutrition support which provides expertise in dietary questionnaire development and maintains extensive food and supplement composition databases; an analytical laboratory capable of analyzing biospecimens and foods for a wide array of constituents; a genomics laboratory which supports studies of genetic susceptibilities and whole-genome expression; and a bioinformatics group which supports the management and analysis of large and complex datasets. While the research activities of the faculty are varied, they are thematically related to the focus on  ethnic diversity. Relevance. The NIDDK Mentored Research Scientist Development Award will allow for additional training and mentorship that will position Dr. Sinclair to become an independent investigator. She will need protected time to acquire the comprehensive training in health disparities research and multilevel modeling. Dr. Sinclair's proposed research is may aid in efforts to understand and address the persistent problem of inequalities in health from a multilevel perspective. The proposed research has the potential to move our current understanding of contextual/environmental factors and diabetes forward.",Neighborhood Characteristics & Diabetes Incidence in Multiethnic

"Multilevel determinants of cardiovascular disease risk in African Americans    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death and disability in the United States (US). National data show that African Americans carry an undue burden of this chronic disease, indicating the presence of significant health disparities. Surveillance data also show extensive geographical disparities, wherein Southern states, where a majority of African Americans reside, have the highest age-adjusted rates of morbidity and mortality from heart disease. CVD, like most non-communicable diseases, is multifactorial in nature- determined by biologic, behavioral and environmental factors. While much recent research has focused on the influences of neighborhood characteristics on health and health-related behaviors, few studies have examined their role in predominantly high-risk minority populations like African Americans. And those that have show a lack of clarity and consistency on the role of neighborhood characteristics in health and health-related behaviors. Diet is a significant predictor of CVD and coronary heart disease (CHD) risk and recently, the study of dietary patterns has emerged as a promising area in nutrition research. Dietary interventions have also emphasized the role of dietary patterns in reducing the risk of CVD. However, for nutritional interventions to be effective, they must consider existing dietary patterns followed by their target population. Dietary intake patterns of Africans Americans are significantly different from the general US population. No studies that we are aware have examined the relationship between neighborhood characteristics and dietary patterns and CVD risk in large southern African American populations. In this study, we propose to address this significant gap, by conducting a study to: a) determine the associations between neighborhood characteristics and individual dietary patterns. Neighborhood characteristics examined include neighborhood socio-economic status, availability of and proximity to fast food restaurants, food stores, and parks and recreational facilities, while individual-level dietary patterns include a priori (2005-Healthy Eating Index) and a posteriori (factor analysis derived) dietary patterns; b) determine whether neighborhood characteristics and individual dietary patterns are associated with sub-clinical atherosclerosis; c) describe the relationships between neighborhood characteristics and individual dietary patterns, with: i) incident CHD, ii) hypertension, iii) dyslipidemia, and iv) abdominal subcutaneous and visceral adipose tissue in an NIH-supported, largest single-site, population- based, prospective, observational, all African American cohort, located in Jackson, Mississippi, the Jackson Heart Study. We plan to examine these relationships using neighborhood and dietary data that have been collected at baseline, and outcomes assessed at baseline, 4- and 5- y follow-up of the Jackson Heart Study. We believe that the results of the proposed study will fill a critical gap in knowledge and will help clinicians and policymakers design effective and targeted intervention programs and policy recommendations to prevent the onset and delay the progression of CVD in an under-studied, high-risk minority population.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in United States and affects African Americans disproportionately. It is therefore critical that we have a better understanding of the factors influencing cardiovascular disease risk in African Americans. Neighborhood characteristics and diet are examples of such potentially modifiable factors, and the study of these relationships is likely to guide the development of improved interventions and policy recommendations to ameliorate these health disparities.           Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in United States and affects African Americans disproportionately.

"Climate change and health: residential energy-efficiency for comfort and equity As the number and severity of extreme weather events increase with the advancement of global climate change, understanding the public health implications and prioritizing adaptation strategies for retrofitting urban infrastructure assumes greater urgency. Architects and urban planners in cold and temperate climates have long recognized the value of weatherizing residential structures to improve winter-time interior comfort and reduce utility costs. However, less understood is the contribution of weatherization efforts to additionally reduce the negative health effects of hot weather extremes and how these efforts might be targeted to lessen health disparities in urban environments. Our broad objective is to reduce temperature-related health disparities in U.S. communities. Using a trans-disciplinary approach, we propose to create new knowledge that will help guide health-enhancing residential energy conservation measures. This model will use data from three case-study communities- Detroit, Michigan, Cleveland, Ohio, and Washington, DC where important social disparities in temperature-related health outcomes have been documented. Specifically, we propose 1) to update and expand existing maps of vulnerability to extreme temperatures, based on a finer-scale neighborhood level analysis using structural, environmental, socio-economic, and demographic data, and evaluate potential for home weatherization to reduce these vulnerabilities; 2) to model how future climate scenarios and changes in neighborhood conditions might impact the distribution of vulnerability and the interior comfort conditions that residents will experience in these communities; and 3) to share and discuss research results with key stakeholders (e.g. installers, public health officials, community leaders, city officials) to inform urban planning, public health preparedness, community improvement and weatherization programming decisions relevant to vulnerable populations. The proposed study will combine existing data in a novel way to increase scientific understanding of the health benefits of residential weatherization now and in future climates. This research will provide a broadly applicable methodology for guiding local planning for built environment and neighborhood improvements, and climate change adaptation and mitigation programs. We will create maps and models for use by public health practitioners, weatherization program managers, city officials, urban planners and architects to reduce population health vulnerability to extreme temperatures.",Climate change and health: residential energy-efficiency for comfort and equity,8266671,R21ES020156,"['senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Elderly ', ' Aging ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Architecture ', ' Arizona ', ' Censuses ', ' Cities ', ' climatic ', ' Meteorological Climate ', ' Climate ', ' Communities ', ' Engineering ', ' Environment ', ' Environmental Health Science ', ' Environmental Health ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Heating ', ' Housing ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Method LOINC Axis 6 ', ' Methodology ', ' Michigan ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Ohio ', ' Plants ', ' Population Characteristics ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Research ', ' Savings ', ' statistics ', ' Temperature ', ' Time ', ' Trees ', ' Weather ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' case report ', ' Case Study ', ' Health Benefit ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Evaluation ', ' residence ', ' Policies ', ' Funding ', ' tool ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Severities ', ' Event ', ' Home ', ' Home environment ', ' Outcome Study ', ' experience ', ' Structure ', ' simulation ', ' novel ', ' Modeling ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Preparedness ', ' Readiness ', ' extreme temperature ', ' Low income ', ' Data ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Update ', ' Characteristics ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomic ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio economic ', ' socioeconomics ', ' NIEHS ', ' National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences ', ' cost ', ' greenhouse gases ', ' Minority ', ' global climate change ', ' climate change ', ' Outcome ', ' social disparities ', ' Population ', ' NCMHD ', ' National Center on Minority Health and Health Disparities ', ' prototype ', ' high risk ', ' population health ', ' ']",NIEHS,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R21,2012,227238,0.09392170240751135
"The role of social factors in cardiovascular risk behaviors disparities    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Socioeconomic disparities in cardiovascular (CV) disease are evidenced by a 2.5 times higher risk of cardiovascular mortality for low-income Americans, when compared to those in the highest income bracket. Despite well-documented awareness that social environments can influence CV disease risk, and the increasing attention given to disparities research, there is relatively little knowledge of the underlying social pathways contributing to socioeconomic disparities, and socioeconomic disparities in CV disease have only widened in the last three decades. Socioeconomic disparities exist for many CV risk behaviors, including smoking, lack of physical activity and insufficient fruit and vegetable intake, and these disparities contribute to socioeconomic gradients in CV disease. These behaviors are shaped by social environmental resource factors, including social support, loneliness and neighborhood social cohesion. These three social environmental resource measures are independently associated with CV morbidity, but their role in CV risk behaviors is not well understood. Also, interaction between social resources is likely to have a ""multiplier effect"", where the net effect is greater than the sum of the individual effects. However, few studies utilize an ecological framework to identify the magnitude of these effects simultaneously. Furthermore, these social resource measures are often correlated with socioeconomic position (SEP), indicating that the resources may represent a fundamental social inequality. The purpose of this study is to examine the relationships among SEP and three distinct, but related, measures of social resources - social support (both emotional and instrumental), loneliness and neighborhood social cohesion - with CV risk behavior outcomes (smoking, lack of physical activity, and insufficient fruit and vegetable intake). The aims of this study are: 1) To examine associations of social support, loneliness and neighborhood social cohesion with CV risk behaviors after controlling for confounders. 2) To explore the interactions of social support, loneliness and neighborhood social cohesion as they relate to CV risk behaviors. 3) To determine the contributions of social support, loneliness and neighborhood social cohesion to SEP gradients in CV risk behaviors. This study will use cross-sectional data obtained by the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis, a prospective cohort study of a diverse, population-based sample of 6814 adults without apparent CVD from six US sites. Multi-level statistical modeling techniques will be used to test the proposed inter-relationships of SEP and the three social resource measures, based on an ecological framework.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Results of this study will elucidate the pathways that contribute to socioeconomic CV risk behavior disparities, responding to a NINR research priority area, and this knowledge may inform future research into other health disparities. This knowledge also is important for the development of socially and contextually based behavioral interventions for clinicians and researchers, meeting a critical need in health behavior research. Moreover, these findings may be used to improve patient advocacy and shape policies to address health disparities at a societal level.

"Child and Family Health in Subsidized Housing: A Randomized Experiment in NY City DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): From a public health perspective, moving to subsidized housing, to less poor neighborhoods, to housing developments with low rates of crime, or to more mixed income settings might reduce health disparities between children and families who have low income and those who do not. Children and young adolescents may be particularly influenced by housing given that they spend a large proportion of their time in their home neighborhood where the accessibility and quality of local amenities and institutions matter, and because they are influenced by their parents' responses to residential location. Receipt of in-place subsidized housing, the focus of our proposal, may help to improve the health and developmental trajectories of at-risk youth through multiple pathways. The proposed experimental research will utilize the NYC Department of Housing Preservation and Development's lottery system to identify treatment and control households that fit our study criteria. Group assignment will include families with children who move to a subsidized apartment in one of eleven newly constructed housing sites (treatment) and matched families who do not receive housing (control). This proposal's design improves and expands upon the design of earlier housing experiments in that it (a) compares the impact of moving to a new neighborhood versus staying in the same neighborhood among recipients of subsidized housing, (b) compares the impact of moving into mixed-income versus solely low- income buildings, (c) examines the impact of subsidized housing on near-poor families (rather than just families below the poverty threshold), (d) examines the effect of subsidized housing where the uptake of the offer is 90% (rather than less than one-half in Moving to Opportunity), and (e) examines the effect of subsidized housing where the families are likely to stay in the subsidized housing (in Moving to Opportunity, over half of those who did move ended up moving again, typically back to poor neighborhoods). Our proposed data collection strategy will include baseline data collection at time of application for housing, using a self-administered questionnaire to be completed by the primary caregiver and augmented by information obtained from the housing application itself. Follow-up assessments will include in-person interviews with the primary caregiver and detailed information on up to two co-resident children for each participating household. Our follow-up information on children will be collected by proxy for children under age eight and in-person with children ages eight to eighteen. Experimental analyses will be used to quantify the impact of moving to subsidized housing and additional exploratory analyses will be conducted to investigate the potential benefits of housing relative to neighborhoods and assess evidence of differential impacts among those receiving particular types of subsidized housing. Relationships among household, housing, and neighborhood features will be examined as potential outcomes as well as mediators of individual-level health outcomes.

"Social Ecology of Maternal Substance Use    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Pregnancy is a key opportunity to affect the epidemiology and to enhance reduction of women's tobacco and problem alcohol use. The opportunities to provide pregnant women with tobacco and alcohol cessation resources appear to be strongest when integrated into community-based health services, with attention to generating support in mothers' networks of family and friends. Ecological models of maternal substance use to date have tended to examine a limited set of social processes or neighborhood structural characteristics but not both, to focus on smoking only, and to focus on infant outcomes, while studies of neighborhood effects on birth outcomes may fail to include maternal substance use. The limited development of contextual theory focused on maternal substance use as an outcome is part of the problem. The goal of the proposed research is to investigate the role of neighborhood structural aspects and social processes in association with maternal alcohol and tobacco use in the perinatal and early childhood parenting periods. Specifically, we will investigate the relationship between individual characteristics of mothers (in a nationally representative dataset) and the social ecology of neighborhoods as predictors of maternal alcohol and tobacco use patterns over time. The availability of a rich set of neighborhood social process variables in the Birth Cohort of the Early Childhood Longitudinal Survey dataset will be augmented by constructs of neighborhood socioeconomic status and material deprivation based on data from the 2000 Census, and neighborhood smoking prevalence estimates from the Current Population Survey-Tobacco Use Supplement 2000. Our proposed research will examine how neighborhood structural characteristics and social processes relate to each other and to individual characteristics that are the proximate determinants of maternal substance use from preconception through the early childhood parenting period. Diverging from most research to date, we will apply latent class analysis and growth mixture modeling to characterize profiles of mothers according to both their alcohol and tobacco use and individual trajectories of use over time. Individual and neighborhood measures will be examined for direct effects associated with these patterns and trajectories. Subsequently, we will apply latent variable pathway analyses to assess potential mediation of neighborhood latent variables by individual characteristics, and we will analyze whether results of pathway analyses apply to different subgroups of our sample (moderation analyses). The results will be applied toward further research in three directions: policy and interventions for mothers, the study of child health outcomes, and enhanced research in social processes, structural effects, and policy inputs during a critical period for women's and children's health.        Public health and clinical initiatives to protect maternal and child health by reducing alcohol and tobacco use during pregnancy work for some but not all women, and even women who reduce use during pregnancy tend to relapse after the birth of their child. It is essential to have a better understanding of the patterns of women's substance use from pre-conception through early childhood parenting, elucidating the social context that supports or hinders healthy behaviors. This research will inform clinical guidelines for prenatal and postnatal care (key intervention opportunities), particularly in terms of targeting specific subpopulations and reducing maternal and child health disparities.

"Harlem Community Academic Partnership: Influenza Immunizations    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Proposed is a community based participatory research project (CBPR) and evaluation for improving influenza immunizations in high risk populations within disadvantaged minority communities. The Harlem Community and Academic Partnership (HCAP)'s Board includes residents, community based organizations, academic partners and the local health department who meet monthly to plan, conduct and review neighborhood assessments, interventions and evaluation activities; topic-specific issues are addressed through formation of Intervention Work Groups (IWGs). The HCAP Board noted especially low rates of influenza immunizations in Harlem and formed the VIVA (Venue Intensive Vaccine for Adults) IWG. This IWG has conducted separate pilots including a survey on barriers to immunization, development of culturally informed intervention materials, a pilot of ""yellow jacket"" outreach workers to engage and educate hard-to reach populations, and provision of immunizations at non-traditional sites. The goal of this proposal is to assemble these components to formally scale up and test the intervention for adults in the Harlem communities. To achieve these aims, the HCAP VIVA IWG will plan, organize and implement an intervention; our primary partner, Palladia Inc, provides outreach educators and a service network of over 120 CBOs to educate and mobilize the community for immunization as well as coordinate congregating persons with traditional and new non-traditional venues for immunizations; the local Visiting Nurse Service has agreed to provide nurses and influenza vaccines at the selected venues gratis. This program does not replace, but rather supplements existing vaccination programs in the city by adding more relevant education and new ""non-traditional"" venues. We expect that this program will increase rates of immunizations overall including the hard-to-reach populations. To evaluate this program, we will compare annual rates of immunization between Harlem and communities similar to Harlem in NYC, with data available by neighborhood through the NYC annual ""Community Health Survey"" (modified BRFSS from CDC) which includes 10,000 adult NYC residents. We will also conduct two cross sectional street intercept surveys (n=800) before and after each annual intervention program between harlem and comparison community residents. These data combined with yearly inventories of CBOs, will provide measures of barriers, intervention experiences and outcomes to broaden input for continuous program improvement.

"Child and Family Health in Subsidized Housing: A Randomized Experiment in NY City DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): From a public health perspective, moving to subsidized housing, to less poor neighborhoods, to housing developments with low rates of crime, or to more mixed income settings might reduce health disparities between children and families who have low income and those who do not. Children and young adolescents may be particularly influenced by housing given that they spend a large proportion of their time in their home neighborhood where the accessibility and quality of local amenities and institutions matter, and because they are influenced by their parents' responses to residential location. Receipt of in-place subsidized housing, the focus of our proposal, may help to improve the health and developmental trajectories of at-risk youth through multiple pathways. The proposed experimental research will utilize the NYC Department of Housing Preservation and Development's lottery system to identify treatment and control households that fit our study criteria.

"Effects of a housing policy experiment on youth behavioral problems    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Adverse neighborhood contexts predict poor mental health and externalizing behavior among adolescents, and the vast racial inequalities in neighborhood environment may play an important role in creating and maintaining racial disparities in health. However, since most research has been observational rather than experimental, it is potentially biased. Neighborhood-health research typically models point-in-time exposures of neighborhoods, in lieu of understanding neighborhood exposure trajectories, and insufficient attention has been paid to the specific contexts navigated by minority, impoverished, adolescents. Our study proposes a secondary analysis of data from a social experiment of voluntary neighborhood relocation using Section 8 Housing Vouchers in 5 cities (the Moving to Opportunity, MTO, Study), to test how and why random assignment of an offer to move to a low-poverty neighborhood unexpectedly adversely affected behavioral problems for boys over a 4-7 year period, and to inform the program's opposite gender effects on mental health. We will complement the existing data with additional neighborhood-level data collection to enrich the dataset. MTO is the only available large- scale study that has randomly assigned individuals to receive different neighborhood contexts, to support strong causal inferences of how neighborhoods shape mental health. Yet prior MTO analyses have not integrated theoretical understanding of adolescent development to motivate empirical analyses. Nor have prior analyses probed why neighborhood context may increase behavioral problems of boys, whether certain subgroups are more likely to be affected than others by neighborhood relocation, or whether there are important developmentally-sensitive periods when exposure to neighborhood deprivation may be especially influential on youth mental health. Our project proposes 3 aims: Aim 1: To test whether effects of moving to a low-poverty neighborhood on behavioral problems for boys are mediated by neighborhood characteristics, family context, or substance use. Aim 2: To examine, separately among boys and girls, whether the effect of moving to a low-poverty neighborhood on behavioral problems is modified by baseline health status, family/adolescent vulnerability, or program site. Aim 3: To compare the importance of alternative timing or sequencing patterns of exposure to neighborhood poverty on behavioral problems among boys. The project will leverage an interdisciplinary team of investigators, including fields of social epidemiology, psychiatric epidemiology, developmental psychology, demography, public policy, statistics, medicine. This project will capitalize on an experimental design, will innovatively apply causal methods to understand mediation, and will model time-varying neighborhood exposures, which will inform relevant early life course developmental timing of neighborhood exposure periods for adolescent well-being. Because of the rigorous experimental design, this project can provide strong policy-relevant evidence on the mechanisms by which social policies like Section 8 housing vouchers may influence population health and mental health.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Neighborhood context may be an important cause of health disparities, especially taking into account risks which accumulate early in life. The results of this project, leveraging a social experiment of housing relocation, have the potential to inform the literature on why neighborhood context is a cause of behavioral problems among adolescents, including probing more specificity on when and for how long living in low-poverty neighborhoods may be most influential for affecting adolescent mental health. This knowledge will inform the next generation of interventions and policies to ensure that adolescents are not harmed by rental assistance policies; results from the experimental design will inform causal pathways and potential intervention points by which to reduce the population burden of mental health and subsequent health disparities.

Specific Aims Given the high residential segregation in the US1, neighborhood inequalities may play an important role in creating and maintaining racial disparities in health2,3. Adverse neighborhood contexts predict poor mental health and behavioral problems among adolescents4-22. Yet most neighborhood-health research is not experimental,11,23 and therefore potentially biased, providing an unreliable foundation for policy translation.23-25 Moving To Opportunity (MTO) is the only large-scale study that randomly assigned volunteer low-income families to exposure to different neighborhood contexts (using Section 8 housing vouchers). Girls and women who relocated to low-poverty neighborhoods in the MTO treatment group experienced strong beneficial effects on mental health, compared with controls remaining in public housing. But boys in the treatment group exhibited unexpectedly worse mental health than controls.4,5,26 It is especially crucial to understand these adverse effects because MTO incorporated major components of federal housing policy for poor urban populations27. Contexts (and reactions to context) navigated by low-income minority adolescents may be highly gender-specific (e.g. area-based social norms or masculinity shaped by male mentors).11,28 But neighborhoods research rarely examines gender explicitly. When it was launched, MTO was touted as one of the most promising policies to disrupt the toxic effects of neighborhood poverty for minority children and families. But health researchers have had limited access to these data, compromising the scientific payoff of the $70+ million investment26 for understanding how neighborhoods influence health and development. So it is not yet understood why MTO affected adolescent mental health,29 or whether other subgroups were affected by the program. We have obtained the MTO data, and propose new analyses, using novel applications of state-of- the-art causal methods. We will assess mediators, modifiers, and developmental specificity of the effects of randomly-assigned neighborhood context on adolescent behavioral problems over 4-7 years. We will compile additional neighborhood data, to inform MTO gender differences. While prior analyses of MTO focused on estimating average treatment effects and have not integrated theories of youth development to motivate empirical analyses,27,30,31 we will estimate the effects of time-varying neighborhood exposures, allowing for developmental-period-specific causal effects (using structural nested models), and leveraging the rigorous experimental design32,33 to inform causes of youth behavior. We focus on 3 research questions and aims:  Why did boys who moved to low-poverty neighborhoods in the MTO program exhibit worse mental health? Aim 1. To test whether effects of moving to a low-poverty neighborhood on boys' behavioral problems in the MTO study are mediated by neighborhood characteristics, family social context, or substance use. H 1.1. The MTO treatment changed neighborhood quality on dimensions relevant for behavior problems, including gender-specific stressors and adolescent-specific contexts. H1.2-1.4. The MTO behavior- problem treatment effects are partially mediated by neighborhood quality; by changes in family context (e.g. mother's or sibling's mental health, parenting style); and by substance use. H1.5. For variables that mediate adverse behavioral problem-treatment effects for boys, treatment did not influence such variables for girls.  Were some subgroups especially likely to be harmed by, or to benefit from, the MTO treatment of moving to a low-poverty neighborhood? Aim 2: To examine, separately among boys and girls, if the MTO intervention effect on adolescent behavioral problems was worse for children with pre-existing developmental vulnerability, from families with lower socioeconomic status, or in certain cities. H 2.1- 2.2. Experimental condition teens from families with a disabled family member, with history of childhood health or developmental problems, or with lower baseline maternal education or family income, experienced more adverse behavioral problems effects, compared to families with less vulnerability. H2.3: There was heterogeneity in treatment effects on behavioral problems by program site.  Are there developmental differences in the ""dose"" and/or timing of neighborhood poverty in the MTO study that are relevant for mental health of boys? Aim 3. To compare the importance of alterna- tive timing or sequencing patterns of exposures to neighborhood poverty on behavioral problems among boys, using cutting-edge causal methods that model time-varying exposures. H 3.1: Longer duration of residence in a low poverty neighborhood is associated with more behavioral problems among boys (cumulative effect). H 3.2: Current neighborhood-level poverty more strongly affects boys' behavioral problems than neighborhood-level poverty at prior times (pathway effect). H 3.3: Boys' behavioral problems are influenced by neighborhood-level poverty to which they are exposed during several specific adolescent developmental periods (sensitive periods). H 3.4: The true causal effect of low-poverty neighborhood residence will be harmful for boys' behavioral problems, and of larger magnitude when estimated with structural nested models that model time-varying exposures, compared to traditional ""static"" methods.  This innovative project integrates rigorous state-of-the-art causal methods with understanding of adolescent development, applied to a uniquely powerful and underused dataset.

"Linking dynamic environments with childhood obesity    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Proposed is a program of training and research using ongoing longitudinal studies to investigate the effects of dynamic environments on childhood obesity. Obesity and sedentary behavior are increasingly common threats to childhood health, likely reflecting changes to the physical activity opportunities, food environment, and social contexts experienced by children and their families. Characteristics of the built environment have been linked to health behaviors and weight of both children and adults, but the causal nature of the link is not clear. A key challenge is to distinguish between competing explanations for the observed associations: the effect of neighborhoods on individual physical activity and health versus the tendency for active and healthy individuals to select neighborhoods that support their lifestyle. The proposed research has the potential to corroborate or temper the conclusions of previous research on this topic. Whereas previous cross-sectional studies have largely assumed that residential environments are static, the proposed project will use data on residential mobility and dynamic environments to better establish the temporal sequence of purported environmental causes and health effects. Available social context measures will be leveraged to show how built environment associations compare to or interact with those of social context. I will select analytical approaches to take full advantage of these data and to assess competing causal hypotheses. I will analyze data on built environments, social context, physical activity, and weight from two longitudinal studies. The first is the Fragile Families Study of Childhood Wellbeing, a birth cohort study of 4,898 children in large US cities that oversampled single parent families and is currently collecting data at age 9. The second is the Healthy PLACES trial a natural experimental evaluation of a newly built Smart Growth development, with built environment characteristics expected to have beneficial effects on local social networks and physical activity from parent-child pairs. Analyses in these cohorts will address specific hypotheses focusing on the obesogenic effects of the built environment, social context, and their interaction. In addition to the use of longitudinal and natural experimental designs, I will explore a range of analytical strategies selected to test the causal nature of observed associations. In particular, I will examine sequencing, specificity, and selection through stratified analyses, structural equation modeling, latent trajectory analysis, directed acyclic graphs, propensity score matching, and instrumental variable analysis. The proposed research will be complemented by experiential and didactic training in (1) environmental approaches to decrease health disparities, (2) theory and measurement of social context and health, (3) trajectory analysis and lifecourse epidemiology, and (4) study designs and analytical approaches to inform causal inference. This research and training will enable me to launch a program of independent research on the urban built and social environments shaping childhood physical activity and health.        Promising strategies to promote health and prevent childhood obesity include creating new opportunities for physical activity and increasing availability of places to buy healthy foods. However, a focus on structural interventions to prevent childhood obesity may be ineffective if we do not understand how social context shapes the use of these resources. This project will use data collected on individuals over time, along with digital maps of the local environment, to evaluate which neighborhood food and fitness resources are associated with less childhood obesity and better health, and what social circumstances are necessary to see such a benefit.

"Reducing Health Disparities in Vulnerable African American Families and Communiti DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Over the next five years, the MSM will continue the CEHD research based on: 1) Its longstanding and passionate commitment to serving underserved families and communities, 2) a research agenda that advances minority health; 3) a track record of educating future minority scientists that will continue this legacy of leadership and 4) a strong push to continue to assist community based organization to become empowered as educated consumers of health information. The institution will pursue its strategic vision that emphasizes a community-centered approach to serving the health needs of underserved communities and a translational research portfolio that fosters community-based solutions to impacting health disparities. The proposed Program aligns with this shared vision of a CBPR model that integrates our intenvoven network of partnerships with academic institutions, civic organizations, government agencies, community-based organizations, schools, prisons, neighborhood clinics, health providers and policy makers. Specifically, (research project #1) is an intervention study that will assess incarcerated women returning from prison and  assess strategies for reintegration with their families and community life (research project #1). The CEHD will also study the neighborhood and parent determinants and consequences of secondhand smoke exposure on African American children through a cross-sectional design (research project #2). A developmental approach (research project #3) will evaluate a community-developed parenting curriculum, which assesses the extent to which quality parenting can reduce the negative impact of poverty on parental mental health and preschool child development and behavioral health. The overall evaluation of the work to be undertaken by the CEHD will document how genuine community engagement and participation in research can facilitate health promotion and disease prevention in African American facilities and communities. The work of the CEHD will be implemented through an Administrative Core, Research Core, Research Education and Training Core, and a Community Engagement Core interfacing with residents from Atlanta Neighborhood Planning Units V, X, Y and Z.  RELEVANCE (See instructions):  The lack of community and consumer involvement in health programs has a negative impact on citizen adoption of public health best practices.

"Cardiovascular Health: Effects of the Social and Physical Environment Childhood socioeconomic status (SES) has been associated with adult cardiovascular disease, but the mechanisms of how this occurs have not been fully explored. Furthermore, low SES is associated with the co-occurrence of multiple social (i.e., increased violence exposure), physical (i.e., higher air pollution levels, poor access to recreational facilities and access to fresh fruits and vegetables) and behavioral (i.e., poor diet, low physical activity, tobacco use) risk factors associated with cardiovascular disease. However, exposures to these factors during childhood and adolescence have not been evaluated with respect to their role in the development of metabolic and cardiovascular risk profiles in a prospective study. Given the complexity of interactions (individual and neighborhood, social and physical) a life course framework may be a fruitful approach to exploring the individual exposures and social attributes of neighborhoods that contribute to the development of metabolic and cardiovascular risk profiles. This proposal aims to examine the contribution of social stressors and physical environment experienced at both the individual and neighborhood level during adolescence, and their interactions on the development of cardiovascular and metabolic risk profiles (i.e., blood pressure, CRP, Hemoglobin A1c, BMI, waist circumference, total cholesterol, triglycerides, LDL, HDL, non-HDL cholesterol). The research goals of this proposal will be achieved with two projects. First, using the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health), a longitudinal cohort of adolescents followed through adulthood, I will employ a life course approach to determine whether social stressors (i.e., interpersonal violence, school and community violence) and physical environment (i.e., access to food stores, proximity to parks and recreation) experienced in adolescence plays a role in the development of metabolic and cardiovascular risk profiles in adulthood. Interactive effects between social and physical environmental factors will also be examined. Second, I will develop a primary collection cross-sectional study of 100 adolescents to examine the mediating effect of diet (not available in Add Health) and the modifying effects of air pollutants (also not available in the Add Health study) on the stress-cardiovascular health relationship. I will dedicate no less than 75 percent of my time to a highly structured and intensely focused research experience over the next 5 years, which will extend my expertise in characterizing social and environmental determinants as stressors in relation to physiological outcomes in children and young adults. A career development plan is outlined to gain practical skills in research design and implementation, expertise in statistical models to predict air pollutant levels and structural equation models as well as knowledge in the mechanisms of cardiovascular and metabolic disorders. The career development plan includes: 1) formal graduate course work in survey design, latent statistical models, mechanisms of cardiovascular disease, 2) tutorial with project advisor to learn clinical aspects of cardiovascular and metabolic disorders in adolescents 3) tutorial with advisor to discuss air pollutant modeling strategies 4) interactions with mentoring team to discuss research and career goals and project progress. I will work closely with the mentoring team which collectively has extensive experience in mentoring new clinical investigators, disparities in psychosocial factors, life experiences and cardiovascular disease outcomes, effects of neighborhood environment and cardiovascular disease, and disparities in physical environmental factors. The proposed training, consisting of interactions with mentors and advisors, tutorials and coursework, complements my previous training and experience in social and environmental epidemiologic research and will allow me to develop the necessary transdisciplinary expertise to achieve my goal and successfully transition to independent investigator at the end of this award. The proposed project will focus on a major health problem in the U.S. - cardiovascular disease, particularly its onset during the adolescent years and explore new models of how individual and community factors, in this case exposure to violence and environmental toxins, impact health outcomes. Findings from these studies can inform clinical practice in chronic disease prevention so that providers and policymakers alike can tailor age appropriate interventions to adolescents and young adults that jointly address the individual as well as the environmental context to more effectively reduce cardiovascular disease risk.

"Multilevel Influences of Neighborhood and School Environments on Obesity     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The increased prevalence of obesity in children is well-documented, and associated with increased risk of diabetes, adult obesity, cardiovascular disease, and psychosocial problems. The prevalence of obesity among Hispanic children is significantly greater, and has increased at a greater rate, as compared to non-Hispanic children. While the factors contributing to the increased prevalence of childhood obesity are complex, socio-ecological theory suggests that social, cultural, and built environmental features of schools and neighborhoods may underlie some of the obesity disparities observed in Hispanic and low-income populations. No studies to date have examined how these factors in combination affect child obesity rates using large, population-based samples of Hispanic children. The overall aim of this study is to examine geographic and multilevel influences of neighborhood and school environments on the development of obesity among 24,000 primarily Hispanic (80%), low-income school children (ages 6-9) in El Paso, TX, a metropolitan city on the US-Mexico border. The population data to be used in this study are from the El Paso Independent School District Fitnessgram(R) surveillance dataset (2006-2009), which includes objectively measured body mass index (BMI) and physical fitness assessment gathered on an annual basis by trained school officials for all elementary school children. Obesity will be assessed using body mass index (BMI) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) normed percentiles for gender and age [13]. Home residence, BMI, and other attribute information from students will be geocoded in ArcGIS(R) v. 9.3 (Redlands, CA), and combined with other spatial data layers on socio-demographic and built environment features at both the neighborhood (census tract) and school level. By using multilevel and Bayesian modeling, we will address the following specific aims: 1) describe the socio-demographic, physical fitness, and geographic patterns associated with the development of obesity in low-income, primarily Hispanic school children in a border community; and 2) determine the contextual contributions of neighborhood and school environments to the development of obesity and low levels of physical fitness in low, income, primarily Hispanic school children in a border community. The results obtained from this study will provide important insight on the modifiable factors within the neighborhood and school environment that contribute to obesity risk and development. These results will also be used to develop project proposals for multilevel interventions that address childhood obesity, particularly among Hispanic children within a border community context.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Childhood obesity is a significant public health concern, particularly in low-income Hispanic communities on the US-Mexico border. The results from this project will identify modifiable characteristics in the neighborhood and school environment that contribute to obesity risk and development. The identification of these modifiable characteristics is critical to developing interventions within schools and neighborhoods that can reduce the rise of obesity, particularly in vulnerable school children at the US-Mexico border.

"Neighborhood Poverty, Health and Economic Security Over the Adult Lifespan    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Does living in a distressed neighborhood affect the long-term health and economic security of low-income adults over the life course, and if so, what types of policy responses can remediate these ""neighborhood effects"" on health and well-being? We seek funding to answer these questions by analyzing data collected as part of the long-term follow-up (10-15 years) of low-income middle and older-aged adults participating in a unique randomized neighborhood mobility experiment known as Moving to Opportunity (MTO). The MTO demonstration used a randomized lottery to offer some public housing residents but not others the chance to relocate to less disadvantaged neighborhoods using a rental housing subsidy. MTO experimentally generated large differences in neighborhood characteristics for otherwise comparable groups of low-income, dispropor- tionately minority families. From 2008-10 in-person survey data and biomarkers were collected by our team from 3,215 female adults in MTO (mean age 45.6). The effective response rate to our surveys was 89 percent, and was quite similar across randomly-assigned MTO groups. Preliminary intention-to-treat analyses suggest that neighborhood environments may play an important role in determining some outcomes for low-income aging adults in the U.S., which in turn suggests the importance for science and policy of fully understanding these impacts and the nature of their determinants and underlying mechanisms. The specific aims of the present application are as follows:  1. To estimate the long-term effects of MTO-induced neighborhood mobility on the full range of health and economic outcomes that were collected, and examine impacts for key baseline sub-samples.  2. To decompose the total effects of the intervention on these outcomes and identify the mechanisms through which the aggregate effects occurred.  3. To develop and test a structural model of neighborhood choice, which will be led by a new co-  investigator that we have added to the team just for this purpose - Petra Todd.  4. To create a public use file and two restricted-use versions of the long-term MTO dataset that would be archived with ICPSR to be made directly available to outside researchers for secondary analysis. The overarching goal is to better understand the effects of MTO and neighborhood mobility on adult long-term health and economic security as well as the processes by which these outcomes are affected. This study will help shed light on larger disparities in health and economic outcomes across race and class lines. NIA funding is essential to carry out the data preparation, and data archiving described here.        This project examines whether disparities in health and other outcomes can be explained in part by the increased likelihood that low-income and minority adults live in high-poverty, highly- disadvantaged neighborhoods. It will draw on biomeasures, surveys and other data from a unique housing experiment known as Moving to Opportunity (MTO).

"Neighborhoods and Cardiovascular Risk in a Multiethnic Cohort  Project Summary There has been much recent interest in how features of residential environments (the built environment as well as social features of neighborhoods) affect the prevalence and development of cardiovascular disease and its risk factors, including obesity, diabetes, and hypertension. Identifying modifiable features of neighborhoods that contribute to cardiovascular risk would have important implications for the development of interventions and strategies to prevent cardiovascular disease and reduce social inequalities and race/ethnic differences in cardiovascular risk. Although randomized trials and/or evaluation of quasi experiments or natural experiments will ultimately be needed to determine the effectiveness of specific neighborhood-level interventions, rigorous observational work is still needed to determine what the most promising areas for intervention may be. However, very few observational studies have the type of detailed neighborhood and individual- level data necessary for this work. This competing renewal proposal builds on prior work conducted under R01 HL071759. As part of the prior funding cycle we created a unique and rich dataset with a multiplicity of rigorous objective and survey-based measures of residential environments linked to the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA), a state-of-the art, longitudinal, population-based, multi-site and multi-ethnic epidemiologic study of cardiovascular disease. In this renewal we propose to enhance and update the neighborhood-level environmental measures to allow for methodologically rigorous longitudinal analyses that build on key findings of cross-sectional analyses conducted as part of the prior cycle. The Specific Aims of the project are: (1) To examine associations of specific neighborhood characteristics (including measures of access to healthy foods, walkability and urban design, access to recreational resources, and neighborhood stressors) with changes in diet, physical activity, and body weight over time; (2) To examine associations of neighborhood characteristics with incident diabetes and hypertension as well as with changes over time in continuous measures of insulin resistance and blood pressure (3) To examine associations of neighborhood characteristics with incident fatal and non fatal cardiovascular events; and (4)To investigate the contribution of neighborhood environments to race/ethnic and socioeconomic differences in longitudinal changes in risk factors and incident disease. In addition, the creation and maintenance of a rich data set on environmental features for MESA participants over time will generate a unique resource to be used in gene-environment interaction studies as MESA genotyping proceeds.  Relevance If features of neighborhoods are shown to be important in the development of cardiovascular disease and its risk factors, strategies to prevent cardiovascular disease may need to focus on environments as well as individuals. Identifying the specific neighborhood features that are most important is key to the development and future testing of these interventions.",Neighborhoods and Cardiovascular Risk in a Multiethnic Cohort,8282793,R01HL071759,"['Affect ', ' epidemiologic investigation ', ' Epidemiology Research ', ' Epidemiological Studies ', ' Epidemiologic Research ', ' Epidemiologic Studies ', ' atherosclerotic vascular disease ', ' atheromatosis ', ' Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease ', ' Atheroscleroses ', ' Atherosclerosis ', ' Blood Pressure ', ' Body Weight ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' circulatory system ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' Cardiovascular system (all sites) ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' Disease Frequency Surveys ', ' Cross-Sectional Survey ', ' Cross-Sectional Analyses ', ' Cross Sectional Analysis ', ' Cross-Sectional Studies ', ' diabetes ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' dietary ', ' Diet ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Environment ', ' Environmental Exposure ', ' Food ', ' Future ', ' Genotype ', ' Goals ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' high blood pressure ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Hypertension ', ' Incidence ', ' insulin resistant ', ' Insulin Resistance ', ' Maintenance ', ' Persons ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Obesity ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' socioenvironment ', ' social context ', ' social climate ', ' Social Environment ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' base ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Link ', ' Evaluation ', ' Physical activity ', ' Individual ', ' Funding ', ' healthy food ', ' Health Food ', ' Life ', ' Event ', ' interest ', ' Physical environment ', ' experience ', ' environment effect on gene ', ' gene environment interaction ', ' stressor ', ' cohesion ', ' cohort ', ' Participant ', ' social inequality ', ' ethnic difference ', ' social ', ' cardiovascular risk ', ' cardiovascular risk factor ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Effectiveness ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Quetelet index ', ' BMI z-score ', ' BMI percentile ', ' Body mass index ', ' Data ', ' Observational Study ', ' Update ', ' Characteristics ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomic ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio economic ', ' socioeconomics ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Prevalence ', ' Natural experiment ', ' Quasi-experiment ', ' nondiabetic ', ' non-diabetic ', ' population based ', ' longitudinal database ', ' neighborhood association ', ' randomized trial ', ' ']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2012,614892,0.17866890538428537
"School environments and adolescents weight status and physical activity patterns Child/adolescent obesity is one of the most pressing public health problems today; it disproportionately affects Hispanic and Black children/adolescents as well as those living in poverty. Lack of physical activity and poor diet are well- documented contributors to child/adolescent obesity and reflect these same disparities. Environmental contexts may provide new answers to the origins of these disparities. Though recent studies have begun to elucidate the influence of neighborhoods on child/adolescent weight and weight related behaviors, schools remain an understudiedenvironmental context. My long-range goal is to increase understanding of the impact of schools on the health of children/adolescents and their potential contributionto racial/ethnic and/or socioeconomic disparities. Coupled with this goal is my desire to build relationships between clinicians, researchers, and policy makers so that empirical findings can be translated into effective interventions. My career development plan proposes additional training and mentorship in three areas critical to my development as an independent researcher: (1) population health sciences, including the social determinants of health (social epidemiology), demographic theory and methods, sociology (urban sociology, neighborhood influences, and social stratification), and economics; (2) advanced methods needed to analyze contextual influences on health (multi-level analysis, multi-equation models, sociometric analysis), as well as methods to address causal inference;and (3) substantive understanding of the role of macrosocial forces, such as educational opportunities, on health. My research plan includes 3 aims: (1) To determine the extent to which school factors contribute to racial/ethnic differences in individual dietary intake; (2) To determine the extent to which school factors contribute toracial/ethnic and/or socioeconomic differences in individual physical activity and weight trajectories from adolescence to adulthood; and (3) To simultaneously examine the influenceof school context and two other portentially influentialcontexts-peer networks and neighborhood environments-on physical activity and weight gain trajectories. The career development plan will provide the training necessary to support an R01 application toward the end of this proposed award period and the research proposed will lay the ground work for identifying school-based interventions that can reverse the obesity epidemic and eliminatedisparities.

"Neighborhood Effects on Weight Change and Diabetes Risk Factors    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Diabetes is increasing at an alarming rate. Between 1980 and 2004, as obesity increased, the number of Americans with diabetes more than doubled. Individuals from minority, low-income and low education populations are disproportionately affected by diabetes (and by complication of diabetes), and these socioeconomic disparities may be growing. Health disparities are often attributed to differences in medical care or self-care, but data suggest that these individual level factors explain few of the existing disparities. Neighborhood environments are increasingly recognized as exerting influence on diet, on physical activity and on outcomes of chronic disease. The present proposal is based on the theory that the immediate neighborhood environment of a person living with diabetes may influence decisions and actions related to food procurement, weight status, diabetes self-care behaviors and cardiometabolic markers and, ultimately, on incidence of complications of diabetes. The proposed research project will assess neighborhood-level influences on health such as accessibility to supermarkets, the ratio of fast food and convenience store to supermarkets and produce vendors, and household food security, by collecting a broad range of data on participants' communities in an ongoing study of ethnic disparities in diabetes outcomes. Neighborhood- level data will be collected and linked to a vast array of detailed individual-level socio-demographic, behavioral, cardiometabolic and complications data existing on this cohort. The project's specific aims are: 1) to create a longitudinal database of neighborhood characteristics; 2) to assess the effect of the neighborhood food environement on cardiometabolic markers of risk among persons with diabetes; and, 3) to determine individual- and neighborhood-level factors on the causal pathway between the neighborhood food environment and cardiometabolic markers of risk among persons with diabetes. This study involves data collection and analysis of compositional (e.g., census), contextual (e.g., food resources), and spatially derived data (e.g., access to food resource) on health behaviors and cardiometabolic risk factors among persons with diabetes. Accomplishing the aims of this proposal will expand current understanding of the neighborhood food, physical activity and social environments that contribute to good health, and will inform further study of alternative strategies for measurement and analysis of environmental influences on health. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed study aims to assess neighborhood-level factors that are associated with weight status, diabetes self-care behaviors and cardiometabolic risk factors in a cohort of adult diabetics. We will add neighborhood data, such as neighborhood socioeconomic status, location of supermarkets, fast food restaurants, alcohol outlets, and parks, to the ongoing Kaiser Permanente Division of Research ""Distance Study"". We will model the influence of neighborhood factors on weight status, diet, physical activity, glycemic control, lipid levels and blood pressure. We will identify modifiable individual- and neighborhood-level factors that may have public health program and policy implications.

"Trajectories of Physical & Cognitive Functioning in the Neighborhood Environment  Project Summary/Abstract Prevalence of physical and cognitive functioning problems increases dramatically with age. These conditions are associated with mobility challenges, decline in quality of life, increase in falls and bone fractures, loss of independence and increased healthcare costs. Important disparities in these outcomes by socioeconomic status (SES) and race/ethnicity exist. This application seeks to improve knowledge about physical and cognitive functioning and their decline over time in the context of the neighborhood environment, with special emphasis on social and physical aspects of neighborhoods. Additionally, this proposal seeks to further understand how neighborhood environments contribute to race/ethnic and SES disparities in function. This proposed study involves separate secondary analyses of two datasets, including the ongoing MESA (Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis) study of 6,000 mid-aged and older men and women nationwide, and SWAN (Study of Women's Health Across the Nation), an ongoing annual study of 3,302 multi-ethnic midlife women. We hypothesize that neighborhoods with lower SES, fewer resources for physical engagement, fewer resources for intellectual engagement and less favorable social environments (fewer resources for social engagement and higher stress levels) will predispose to poorer physical and cognitive function. Aim 1 proposes cross-sectional investigation of how the neighborhood environment is associated with physical and cognitive function after adjusting for individual-level factors, and how neighborhood factors contribute to cross-sectional health disparities in function. Aim 2 will investigate whether neighborhood factors and changes in neighborhood factors are related to changes in physical and cognitive function over time as well as the contribution of neighborhoods to differential changes in function over time by SES and race/ethnicity. A variety of analytical methods will be used to address the causal inference challenges present in neighborhood health effects research. The analyses are embedded in a training and mentoring plan including training in substantive areas related to cognition, function, and aging as well as methodologic training in longitudinal data analyses, propensity scores, econometric techniques and causal inference generally. This application will provide preliminary data and the mentoring necessary to establish the applicant as an independent investigator and promote the development of a successful R01 application.  Project Narrative  Prevalence of physical and cognitive functioning problems increases dramatically with age, and gender and health disparities highlight the vulnerable status of minorities and women. There is substantial public health relevance in extending our understanding of how aspects of the neighborhood environment may impact physical and cognitive function because all three factors are modifiable.

"PS11-003 Minority AIDS Research Initiative    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The etiology of health disparities involves a complex web of factors that interact to produce detrimental health outcomes for particular segments of society. In the United States, the current landscape of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) continues to be shaped by disparities in case distribution, as African Americans (AA) account for more new HIV cases and HIV related deaths than any other racial/ethnic group. Importantly, there were more new HIV infections (52%) among young AA men who have sex with men (MSM; aged 13-29 years) than any other racial/ethnic-sexual orientation/behavior group. Recent studies have found that geographical and neighborhood environments (with environment broadly understood to encompass both physical and social attributes) are associated with sexual behavior and HIV prevalence and incidence. Although the possible role of geographic and neighborhood contexts in HIV has often been emphasized, rigorous investigations of environmental factors are rare. This is due, in part, to the sensitive nature of residential address information of HIV-infected persons and difficulties in identifying and characterizing the relevant social and physical environments.  The overall aim of the Geographic and Neighborhood Study of HIV (GANSH) is to examine the associations between geospatial and neighborhood environmental characteristics and psychosocial factors and prevalent HIV/STI among AA MSM in the Jackson, MS metropolitan statistical area (Jackson MSA). The proposed study uses a cross-sectional, multi- level design to examine these associations. Non-linear (i.e., a dichotomized outcome variables) relationships between geographic and neighborhood characteristics and measures of HIV/STI status will be examined using multi-level models with a random neighborhood intercept and random covariate effects. Empirical Bayes and Geographic Information Systems (GIS) methods will be used to estimate and map the area-specific relative risk of HIV as well as the spatial distribution of the associations between behavioral and psychosocial factors and HIV/STI status.  To our knowledge, this is the first study to examine the associations between geospatial and neighborhood characteristics and psychosocial factors and prevalent HIV/STI in AA MSM. The proposed research will provide answers to a wide range of questions of public health importance with direct implications for disease prevention. Moreover, results from the proposed study may change the methodological/theoretical concepts of existing HIV/STI interventions and/or prevention research.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: HIV/STI research has traditionally focused on individual-level risk factors such as behaviors, and more recently, socio-cultural factors. The conceptual framework for the Geographic and Neighborhood Effects on HIV Study is based on the socio-ecological model, which integrates the complex interaction between individual, relationship, community, and society-level factors and allows for the consideration of factors at multiple levels in an individual's risk for experiencing or increasing HIV/STI risk. Results from this study will provide critical information in the understanding of HIV/STI risk among AA MSM and identification of high-risk areas to target for disease prevention.           HIV/STI research has traditionally focused on individual-level risk factors such as behaviors, and more recently, socio-cultural factors.

"Multilevel determinants of cardiovascular disease risk in African Americans    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death and disability in the United States (US). National data show that African Americans carry an undue burden of this chronic disease, indicating the presence of significant health disparities. Surveillance data also show extensive geographical disparities, wherein Southern states, where a majority of African Americans reside, have the highest age-adjusted rates of morbidity and mortality from heart disease. CVD, like most non-communicable diseases, is multifactorial in nature- determined by biologic, behavioral and environmental factors. While much recent research has focused on the influences of neighborhood characteristics on health and health-related behaviors, few studies have examined their role in predominantly high-risk minority populations like African Americans. And those that have show a lack of clarity and consistency on the role of neighborhood characteristics in health and health-related behaviors. Diet is a significant predictor of CVD and coronary heart disease (CHD) risk and recently, the study of dietary patterns has emerged as a promising area in nutrition research. Dietary interventions have also emphasized the role of dietary patterns in reducing the risk of CVD. However, for nutritional interventions to be effective, they must consider existing dietary patterns followed by their target population. Dietary intake patterns of Africans Americans are significantly different from the general US population. No studies that we are aware have examined the relationship between neighborhood characteristics and dietary patterns and CVD risk in large southern African American populations. In this study, we propose to address this significant gap, by conducting a study to: a) determine the associations between neighborhood characteristics and individual dietary patterns. Neighborhood characteristics examined include neighborhood socio-economic status, availability of and proximity to fast food restaurants, food stores, and parks and recreational facilities, while individual-level dietary patterns include a priori (2005-Healthy Eating Index) and a posteriori (factor analysis derived) dietary patterns; b) determine whether neighborhood characteristics and individual dietary patterns are associated with sub-clinical atherosclerosis; c) describe the relationships between neighborhood characteristics and individual dietary patterns, with: i) incident CHD, ii) hypertension, iii) dyslipidemia, and iv) abdominal subcutaneous and visceral adipose tissue in an NIH-supported, largest single-site, population- based, prospective, observational, all African American cohort, located in Jackson, Mississippi, the Jackson Heart Study. We plan to examine these relationships using neighborhood and dietary data that have been collected at baseline, and outcomes assessed at baseline, 4- and 5- y follow-up of the Jackson Heart Study. We believe that the results of the proposed study will fill a critical gap in knowledge and will help clinicians and policymakers design effective and targeted intervention programs and policy recommendations to prevent the onset and delay the progression of CVD in an under-studied, high-risk minority population.        Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in United States and affects African Americans disproportionately. It is therefore critical that we have a better understanding of the factors influencing cardiovascular disease risk in African Americans. Neighborhood characteristics and diet are examples of such potentially modifiable factors, and the study of these relationships is likely to guide the development of improved interventions and policy recommendations to ameliorate these health disparities.

"Neighborhood Built and Social Environment and Physical Activity and Weight Status    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Overweight and obesity are risk factors for a range of health problems. The prevalence of overweight and obesity has been steadily rising among every segment of the U.S. population. In searching for factors driving the obesity epidemic, the overweight/obesity research is now focused on the balance between diet and physical activity (PA). To address the obesity epidemic, researchers have begun to explore the wider contextual determinants of obesity-related outcomes in hope of identifying new approaches to promoting PA and curbing the rising tide of obesity. This study attempts to contribute to the literature by examining the extent to which neighborhood built environments and socio-demographic contexts influence individual PA and weight status in the United States. To guide this investigation, we employ the social cognitive theory and ecological models and use multiple data sources including the 2000 Census data, GIS-based data from various sources, other place-based aggregate data, and continuous NHANES from 1999 to 2008. We ask: 1) How do contextual built environmental and socio-demographic factors affect objectively and subjectively measured PA and weight status over and above individual characteristics? 2) What are the interacting and mediating effects among contextual built environmental and socio-demographic factors in their impacts on PA and weight status? Are these observed contextual effects partly mediated by individual psychosocial pathways? 3) How do neighborhood factors interact with individual factors to impact PA and weight status? 4) How are the above relationships sensitive to geographic aggregation methods of local neighborhoods? 5) How does spatial dependency among local neighborhoods affect the observed patterns produced from the above analysis? This project goes beyond current research in five ways. First, it examines a wider range of place-based contextual features at both tract- and county-levels. Second, it is a national study covering the entire U.S. Third, it examines both self-reports and objective assessments of PA and weight status. Fourth, it provides a unique opportunity to examine interactions across a number of levels (e.g., individual- neighborhood, neighborhood-county). Fifth, it tests under-studied hypotheses in this literature such as the Modifiable Areal Unit Problem and the spatial dependency issues. This project combines perspectives from sociology, urban planning, geography, and spatial epidemiology; it bridges these disciplines to formulate research that addresses a set of questions vital to research on environmental determinants of PA and weight status.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This study examines how geographic and contextual factors at census tract level and county level are associated with individual-level physical activity and body weight in a national sample. Both the built environments and socio-demographic contexts will be considered. Given the rising tide of the obesity epidemic in the United States, research, strategies and programs for weight maintenance and weight reduction have become a high public health priority in the recent decade.

"Do Departments of Parks and Recreation Foster or Alleviate Health Disparities?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Because prior research suggests that resource allocation among parks varies by neighborhood SES, we propose to undertake a national longitudinal study of the existence of disparities in park management practices in 25 representative US cities and 200 parks. In order to advance the state of science on the influence of park management practices on physical activity and park use and to shape public policy on health promotion at the population level, we propose an investigation with the following specific aims: 1) To determine whether there are systematic differences in park resources, programming, management practices, and park use depending upon the socioeconomic status of park neighborhoods in a representative sample of American cities, 2) To determine whether changes in resource allocation among parks in these cities are distributed equally among high and low income parks, or whether allocation changes attempt to address health disparities among potential park users. We will also determine whether changes in resource allocation are accompanied by changes in park-based physical activity, and 3) To make recommendations to the Departments of Parks and Recreation in each city that will support greater use of park facilities among populations who may experience health disparities that can be ameliorated by physical activity.  To accomplish the aims of this investigation, we will train a cadre of park professionals and members of community-based organizations that support neighborhood parks to act as ""citizen scientists"" and collect objective data. Engaging these citizen-scientists in the research process is intended to increase local capacity to reliably measure park management practices, park characteristics, park use, and physical activity. Citizen-scientists are an asset that will endure long after the proposed research (if funded) is completed and could form the basis for research in which future interventions to promote physical activity can be rigorously evaluated. We will also interview key stakeholders to assess other factors that may impact local park use.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  We propose to study park management practices in 200 parks in 25 representative US cities in order to determine whether there are differences in park management practices between high and low-income neighborhoods.

"PS11-003 Minority AIDS Research Initiative  Project Summary/Abstract The etiology of health disparities involves a complex web of factors that interact to produce detrimental health outcomes for particular segments of society. In the United States, the current landscape of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) continues to be shaped by disparities in case distribution, as African Americans (AA) account for more new HIV cases and HIV related deaths than any other racial/ethnic group. Importantly, there were more new HIV infections (52%) among young AA men who have sex with men (MSM; aged 13-29 years) than any other racial/ethnic-sexual orientation/behavior group. Recent studies have found that geographical and neighborhood environments (with environment broadly understood to encompass both physical and social attributes) are associated with sexual behavior and HIV prevalence and incidence. Although the possible role of geographic and neighborhood contexts in HIV has often been emphasized, rigorous investigations of environmental factors are rare. This is due, in part, to the sensitive nature of residential address information of HIV-infected persons and difficulties in identifying and characterizing the relevant social and physical environments.  The overall aim of the Geographic and Neighborhood Study of HIV (GANSH) is to examine the associations between geospatial and neighborhood environmental characteristics and psychosocial factors and prevalent HIV/STI among AA MSM in the Jackson, MS metropolitan statistical area (Jackson MSA). The proposed study uses a cross-sectional, multi- level design to examine these associations. Non-linear (i.e., a dichotomized outcome variables) relationships between geographic and neighborhood characteristics and measures of HIV/STI status will be examined using multi-level models with a random neighborhood intercept and random covariate effects. Empirical Bayes and Geographic Information Systems (GIS) methods will be used to estimate and map the area-specific relative risk of HIV as well as the spatial distribution of the associations between behavioral and psychosocial factors and HIV/STI status.  To our knowledge, this is the first study to examine the associations between geospatial and neighborhood characteristics and psychosocial factors and prevalent HIV/STI in AA MSM. The proposed research will provide answers to a wide range of questions of public health importance with direct implications for disease prevention. Moreover, results from the proposed study may change the methodological/theoretical concepts of existing HIV/STI interventions and/or prevention research.  Project Narrative HIV/STI research has traditionally focused on individual-level risk factors such as behaviors, and more recently, socio-cultural factors. The conceptual framework for the Geographic and Neighborhood Effects on HIV Study is based on the socio-ecological model, which integrates the complex interaction between individual, relationship, community, and society-level factors and allows for the consideration of factors at multiple levels in an individual's risk for experiencing or increasing HIV/STI risk. Results from this study will provide critical information in the understanding of HIV/STI risk among AA MSM and identification of high-risk areas to target for disease prevention.",PS11-003 Minority AIDS Research Initiative,8403468,U01PS003315,[''],NCHHSTP,"MY BROTHER'S KEEPER, INC.",U01,2013,285000,0.07016804710293452
"Neighborhood Effects on Weight Change and Diabetes Risk Factors    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Diabetes is increasing at an alarming rate. Between 1980 and 2004, as obesity increased, the number of Americans with diabetes more than doubled. Individuals from minority, low-income and low education populations are disproportionately affected by diabetes (and by complication of diabetes), and these socioeconomic disparities may be growing. Health disparities are often attributed to differences in medical care or self-care, but data suggest that these individual level factors explain few of the existing disparities. Neighborhood environments are increasingly recognized as exerting influence on diet, on physical activity and on outcomes of chronic disease. The present proposal is based on the theory that the immediate neighborhood environment of a person living with diabetes may influence decisions and actions related to food procurement, weight status, diabetes self-care behaviors and cardiometabolic markers and, ultimately, on incidence of complications of diabetes. The proposed research project will assess neighborhood-level influences on health such as accessibility to supermarkets, the ratio of fast food and convenience store to supermarkets and produce vendors, and household food security, by collecting a broad range of data on participants' communities in an ongoing study of ethnic disparities in diabetes outcomes. Neighborhood- level data will be collected and linked to a vast array of detailed individual-level socio-demographic, behavioral, cardiometabolic and complications data existing on this cohort. The project's specific aims are: 1) to create a longitudinal database of neighborhood characteristics; 2) to assess the effect of the neighborhood food environement on cardiometabolic markers of risk among persons with diabetes; and, 3) to determine individual- and neighborhood-level factors on the causal pathway between the neighborhood food environment and cardiometabolic markers of risk among persons with diabetes. This study involves data collection and analysis of compositional (e.g., census), contextual (e.g., food resources), and spatially derived data (e.g., access to food resource) on health behaviors and cardiometabolic risk factors among persons with diabetes. Accomplishing the aims of this proposal will expand current understanding of the neighborhood food, physical activity and social environments that contribute to good health, and will inform further study of alternative strategies for measurement and analysis of environmental influences on health. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed study aims to assess neighborhood-level factors that are associated with weight status, diabetes self-care behaviors and cardiometabolic risk factors in a cohort of adult diabetics. We will add neighborhood data, such as neighborhood socioeconomic status, location of supermarkets, fast food restaurants, alcohol outlets, and parks, to the ongoing Kaiser Permanente Division of Research ""Distance Study"". We will model the influence of neighborhood factors on weight status, diet, physical activity, glycemic control, lipid levels and blood pressure. We will identify modifiable individual- and neighborhood-level factors that may have public health program and policy implications.

"Neighborhoods and Cardiovascular Risk in a Multiethnic Cohort  Project Summary There has been much recent interest in how features of residential environments (the built environment as well as social features of neighborhoods) affect the prevalence and development of cardiovascular disease and its risk factors, including obesity, diabetes, and hypertension. Identifying modifiable features of neighborhoods that contribute to cardiovascular risk would have important implications for the development of interventions and strategies to prevent cardiovascular disease and reduce social inequalities and race/ethnic differences in cardiovascular risk. Although randomized trials and/or evaluation of quasi experiments or natural experiments will ultimately be needed to determine the effectiveness of specific neighborhood-level interventions, rigorous observational work is still needed to determine what the most promising areas for intervention may be. However, very few observational studies have the type of detailed neighborhood and individual- level data necessary for this work. This competing renewal proposal builds on prior work conducted under R01 HL071759. As part of the prior funding cycle we created a unique and rich dataset with a multiplicity of rigorous objective and survey-based measures of residential environments linked to the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA), a state-of-the art, longitudinal, population-based, multi-site and multi-ethnic epidemiologic study of cardiovascular disease. In this renewal we propose to enhance and update the neighborhood-level environmental measures to allow for methodologically rigorous longitudinal analyses that build on key findings of cross-sectional analyses conducted as part of the prior cycle. The Specific Aims of the project are: (1) To examine associations of specific neighborhood characteristics (including measures of access to healthy foods, walkability and urban design, access to recreational resources, and neighborhood stressors) with changes in diet, physical activity, and body weight over time; (2) To examine associations of neighborhood characteristics with incident diabetes and hypertension as well as with changes over time in continuous measures of insulin resistance and blood pressure (3) To examine associations of neighborhood characteristics with incident fatal and non fatal cardiovascular events; and (4)To investigate the contribution of neighborhood environments to race/ethnic and socioeconomic differences in longitudinal changes in risk factors and incident disease. In addition, the creation and maintenance of a rich data set on environmental features for MESA participants over time will generate a unique resource to be used in gene-environment interaction studies as MESA genotyping proceeds.  Relevance If features of neighborhoods are shown to be important in the development of cardiovascular disease and its risk factors, strategies to prevent cardiovascular disease may need to focus on environments as well as individuals. Identifying the specific neighborhood features that are most important is key to the development and future testing of these interventions.",Neighborhoods and Cardiovascular Risk in a Multiethnic Cohort,8666874,R01HL071759,"['Affect ', ' epidemiologic investigation ', ' Epidemiology Research ', ' Epidemiological Studies ', ' Epidemiologic Research ', ' Epidemiologic Studies ', ' atherosclerotic vascular disease ', ' atheromatosis ', ' Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease ', ' Atheroscleroses ', ' Atherosclerosis ', ' Blood Pressure ', ' Body Weight ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' circulatory system ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' Cardiovascular system (all sites) ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' Disease Frequency Surveys ', ' Cross-Sectional Survey ', ' Cross-Sectional Analyses ', ' Cross Sectional Analysis ', ' Cross-Sectional Studies ', ' diabetes ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' dietary ', ' Diet ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Environment ', ' Environmental Exposure ', ' Food ', ' Future ', ' Genotype ', ' Goals ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' high blood pressure ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Hypertension ', ' Incidence ', ' insulin resistant ', ' Insulin Resistance ', ' Maintenance ', ' Persons ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Obesity ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' socioenvironment ', ' social context ', ' social climate ', ' Social Environment ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' base ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Link ', ' Evaluation ', ' Physical activity ', ' Individual ', ' Funding ', ' healthy food ', ' Health Food ', ' Life ', ' Event ', ' interest ', ' Physical environment ', ' experience ', ' environment effect on gene ', ' gene environment interaction ', ' stressor ', ' cohesion ', ' cohort ', ' Participant ', ' social inequality ', ' ethnic difference ', ' social ', ' cardiovascular risk ', ' cardiovascular risk factor ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Effectiveness ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Quetelet index ', ' BMI z-score ', ' BMI percentile ', ' Body mass index ', ' Data ', ' Observational Study ', ' Update ', ' Characteristics ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomic ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio economic ', ' socioeconomics ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Prevalence ', ' Natural experiment ', ' Quasi-experiment ', ' nondiabetic ', ' non-diabetic ', ' population based ', ' longitudinal database ', ' neighborhood association ', ' randomized trial ', ' ']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2013,58163,0.17866890538428537
"Cardiovascular Health: Effects of the Social and Physical Environment Childhood socioeconomic status (SES) has been associated with adult cardiovascular disease, but the mechanisms of how this occurs have not been fully explored. Furthermore, low SES is associated with the co-occurrence of multiple social (i.e., increased violence exposure), physical (i.e., higher air pollution levels, poor access to recreational facilities and access to fresh fruits and vegetables) and behavioral (i.e., poor diet, low physical activity, tobacco use) risk factors associated with cardiovascular disease. However, exposures to these factors during childhood and adolescence have not been evaluated with respect to their role in the development of metabolic and cardiovascular risk profiles in a prospective study. Given the complexity of interactions (individual and neighborhood, social and physical) a life course framework may be a fruitful approach to exploring the individual exposures and social attributes of neighborhoods that contribute to the development of metabolic and cardiovascular risk profiles. This proposal aims to examine the contribution of social stressors and physical environment experienced at both the individual and neighborhood level during adolescence, and their interactions on the development of cardiovascular and metabolic risk profiles (i.e., blood pressure, CRP, Hemoglobin A1c, BMI, waist circumference, total cholesterol, triglycerides, LDL, HDL, non-HDL cholesterol). The research goals of this proposal will be achieved with two projects. First, using the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health), a longitudinal cohort of adolescents followed through adulthood, I will employ a life course approach to determine whether social stressors (i.e., interpersonal violence, school and community violence) and physical environment (i.e., access to food stores, proximity to parks and recreation) experienced in adolescence plays a role in the development of metabolic and cardiovascular risk profiles in adulthood. Interactive effects between social and physical environmental factors will also be examined. Second, I will develop a primary collection cross-sectional study of 100 adolescents to examine the mediating effect of diet (not available in Add Health) and the modifying effects of air pollutants (also not available in the Add Health study) on the stress-cardiovascular health relationship. I will dedicate no less than 75 percent of my time to a highly structured and intensely focused research experience over the next 5 years, which will extend my expertise in characterizing social and environmental determinants as stressors in relation to physiological outcomes in children and young adults. A career development plan is outlined to gain practical skills in research design and implementation, expertise in statistical models to predict air pollutant levels and structural equation models as well as knowledge in the mechanisms of cardiovascular and metabolic disorders. The career development plan includes: 1) formal graduate course work in survey design, latent statistical models, mechanisms of cardiovascular disease, 2) tutorial with project advisor to learn clinical aspects of cardiovascular and metabolic disorders in adolescents 3) tutorial with advisor to discuss air pollutant modeling strategies 4) interactions with mentoring team to discuss research and career goals and project progress. I will work closely with the mentoring team which collectively has extensive experience in mentoring new clinical investigators, disparities in psychosocial factors, life experiences and cardiovascular disease outcomes, effects of neighborhood environment and cardiovascular disease, and disparities in physical environmental factors. The proposed training, consisting of interactions with mentors and advisors, tutorials and coursework, complements my previous training and experience in social and environmental epidemiologic research and will allow me to develop the necessary transdisciplinary expertise to achieve my goal and successfully transition to independent investigator at the end of this award. The proposed project will focus on a major health problem in the U.S. - cardiovascular disease, particularly its onset during the adolescent years and explore new models of how individual and community factors, in this case exposure to violence and environmental toxins, impact health outcomes. Findings from these studies can inform clinical practice in chronic disease prevention so that providers and policymakers alike can tailor age appropriate interventions to adolescents and young adults that jointly address the individual as well as the environmental context to more effectively reduce cardiovascular disease risk. Project Narrative  Childhood socioeconomic status (SES) has been associated with adult cardiovascular disease, but the mechanisms of how this occurs have not been fully explored. Furthermore, low SES is associated with the co-occurrence of multiple social (i.e., increased violence exposure), environmental (i.e., higher air pollution exposure, poor access to recreational facilities or food stores) and behavioral (i.e., poor diet, low physical activity, tobacco use) risk factors associated with cardiovascular disease. However, exposures to these factors during childhood and adolescence have not been evaluated with respect to their role in the development of metabolic and cardiovascular risk profiles in a prospective study. Given the complexity of interactions (individual and neighborhood, social and physical) a life course framework may be a fruitful approach to exploring the individual exposures and social attributes of neighborhoods that contribute to the development of metabolic and cardiovascular risk profiles. This proposal aims to examine the contribution of social stressors and physical environment experienced at both the individual and neighborhood level during adolescence, and their interactions on the development of cardiovascular and metabolic risk profiles (i.e., blood pressure, CRP, Hemoglobin A1c, BMI, waist circumference, total cholesterol, triglycerides, LDL, HDL, non-HDL cholesterol).",Cardiovascular Health: Effects of the Social and Physical Environment,8461284,K01HL103199,"['Academy ', ' teenage ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' Adolescence ', '

"Health of Low-Income Adults in Subsidized Housing: Randomized Experiment, NY City DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): From a public health perspective, moving to subsidized housing, to less poor neighborhoods, to housing developments with low rates of crime, or to more mixed income settings might reduce health disparities through multiple pathways. The proposed experimental research will utilize the NYC Department of Housing Preservation and Development's lottery system to identify treatment and control households that fit our study criteria. Group assignment will include households who move to a subsidized apartment in one of ten newly constructed housing sites (treatment) and matched households who do not receive housing (control). We estimate that our experimental sample will be comprised of about 1,300 participating treatment households and 1,690 lottery- matched controls. This proposal's design improves and expands upon the design of earlier housing experiments in that it (a) compares the impact of moving to a new neighborhood versus staying in the same neighborhood among recipients of subsidized housing, (b) compares the impact of moving into mixed-income versus solely low- income buildings, (c) examines the impact of subsidized housing on near-poor families (rather than just families below the poverty threshold), (d) examines the effect of subsidized housing where the uptake of the offer is 90% (rather than less than one-half in previous demonstrations of subsidized housing), and (e) examines the effect of subsidized housing where the families are likely to stay in the subsidized housing (compared to studies of vouchers, where over half of those who did move ended up moving again, typically back to poor neighborhoods). Our proposed data collection strategy will include baseline data collection at time of application for housing using a self-administered questionnaire to be completed by a single adult household member and augmented by information obtained from the housing application itself. Follow-up telephone interviews will take place 12-18 months after move-in, or equivalent for non-movers. A variety of information on current health status and health behaviors will be collected at baseline and follow-up to enable assessment of within-household change as well as average change between comparison groups at follow-up. Experimental analyses will be used to quantify the impact of moving to subsidized housing in a new neighborhood relative to moving to subsidized housing in the same neighborhood of residence at time of application. Exploratory analysis will compare two types of treatment: moves to mixed-income housing and exclusively low-income housing developments. Relationships among household, housing, and neighborhood features will be examined as potential outcomes as well as mediators of individual-level health outcomes.     PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Experimental research has shown that moving to new housing in particular kinds of neighborhoods may improve the life chances of poor families; however, previous research confounded housing- and neighborhood mobility and did not investigate the benefits of mixed-income housing developments. Our randomized experiment will track about 1,300 households who receive city-subsidized housing and about 1,700 matched households who do not receive housing over the first 12-18 months after move-in to assess changes in physical and mental health, and health behaviors. In addition, we will explore changes in physical, economic, and social environments that may mediate the relationship between residential context and health and well-being of low-income residents.","Health of Low-Income Adults in Subsidized Housing: Randomized Experiment, NY City",8509742,R01HD066223,"['adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Air ', ' Anxiety ', ' Bronchial Asthma ', ' Asthma ', ' Dorsum ', ' Back ', ' Behavior ', ' Cities ', ' Communities ', ' Crime ', ' Cues ', ' Data Collection ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' dietary ', ' Diet ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Economical Conditions ', ' Economic Conditions ', ' Economics ', ' Environment ', ' Family ', ' Family Sizes ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' Level of Health ', ' Health Status ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' Household ', ' Housing ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Income ', ' Telephone Interviews ', ' Lifestyle ', ' Life Style ', ' Marketing ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' New York City ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Obesity ', ' Perception ', ' well-being ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' Poverty ', ' preservation ', ' Biologic Preservation ', ' Biological Preservation ', ' Public Assistance ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Housing ', ' Questionnaires ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Safety ', ' Schools ', ' Self Assessment ', ' Self Assessment (Psychology) ', ' Societal Conditions ', ' Social Conditions ', ' socioenvironment ', ' social context ', ' social climate ', ' Social Environment ', ' social support network ', ' Social support ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Translations ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Relative ', ' Relative (related person) ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Mediating ', ' Caring ', ' Social Network ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' residence ', ' Individual ', ' social norm ', ' Trust ', ' Policies ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' uptake ', ' healthy food ', ' Health Food ', ' liquor ', ' distilled alcoholic beverage ', ' Exposure to ', ' Shapes ', ' convenience food ', ' fast food ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Dimensions ', ' Source ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' Location ', ' physical health ', ' physical conditioning ', ' interest ', ' experience ', ' hazard ', ' cohort ', ' Proxy ', ' Participant ', ' member ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' research study ', ' Population Study ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' after-school program ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' voucher ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Institution ', ' Diameter ', ' Caliber ', ' Low income ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Preventive ', ' Data ', ' Improve Access ', ' Qualifying ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Randomized ', ' Self-Administered ', ' Characteristics ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' comparison group ', ' cost ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' diet and exercise ', ' community living ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Consumption ', ' federal poverty level ', ' comparative ', ' treatment site ', ' public health relevance ', ' primary outcome ', ' population health ', ' ']",NICHD,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY TEACHERS COLLEGE,R01,2013,369141,0.08392188568469557
"Neighborhood Change and Violence in Adolescence and Emerging Adulthood     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Teenagers continue to be responsible for a significant portion of all violence in the United States - six in ten youths admitted to state prisons were there for violent offenses, and teens are twice as likely as adults to be admitted for violent offenses (Snyder & Sickmund, 2006). At the same time, exposure to violence is increasingly normative. In 2008 more than 60% of children ages 17 and younger were exposed (directly or indirectly) to violence and more than one quarter had witnessed a violent act in the past year (Finkelhor et al., 2009). The current study integrates two major approaches to the study of violence: longitudinal studies of violence in the life course, and contextual research on violence within disadvantaged neighborhoods. The project has four specific aims: (1) To examine patterns of change in violent behavior in the transition from adolescence to young adulthood; (2) To document levels of stability and change in neighborhood contexts during the transition from adolescence to emerging adulthood; and (3) To investigate associations between stability and change in neighborhood social contexts and individual violent trajectories. To address these aims, the project uses data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health and its Wave III Contextual Database (which was compiled by the PI). These data allow us to examine trajectories of change in violence across the first three waves of data collection, as well as changes within the neighborhoods in which respondents were living. We will also examine how changes in violence and neighborhoods are related to residential moves (as opposed to changes in neighborhoods themselves) and to other transitions in family, education, and work during the increasingly diverse and uncertain transition to adulthood. The results of this project will inform prevention and intervention efforts targeting at-risk and violent youth, and will contribute directly to the goals of the Child Development & Behavior Branch (CDBB), as well as those of the Demographic and Behavioral Services Branch (DBSB). By disentangling changes in neighborhoods due to moves from those due to changes in neighborhoods themselves, it may also contribute to a better understanding of the mixed results of the Moving to Opportunity Experiment, as well as research on migration and residential instability. Further, the findings wil speak to recent debates on the relationship between immigration and crime by examining changes in neighborhood racial, ethnic, and immigrant compositions. Finally, the project involves extensive exposure and involvement of both undergraduate and graduate students to the research process.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: With respect to public health, this study focuses on changes in youth violence, with an emphasis on factors that promote desistance from violence over time. It focuses on the role of changing neighborhood contexts, including changes in neighborhood socioeconomic status, racial and ethnic heterogeneity, and exposure to community violence. It examines these changes within the context of the transition to adulthood, when youth are making multiple transitions in the areas of education, work, and households and families. As opposed to previous studies of institutionalized youth, the study's use of a recent and nationally representative sample allows for an analysis of a more diverse set of youth experiences.                ",Neighborhood Change and Violence in Adolescence and Emerging Adulthood,8497167,R15HD070098,"['Accounting ', ' teenage ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' Adolescence ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Age ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Child Behavior ', ' Infant and Child Development ', ' Child Development ', ' Communities ', ' Crime ', ' Data Collection ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Employment ', ' Family ', ' Household and Family ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Immigrations ', ' In-Migration ', ' life course ', ' Life Cycle ', ' Life Cycle Stages ', ' Literature ', ' long-term study ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' male ', ' Marriage ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Parents ', ' Prisons ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Research ', ' Residential Mobility ', ' Risk ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' socioenvironment ', ' social context ', ' social climate ', ' Social Environment ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' violent behavior ', ' violent ', ' Violence ', ' Work ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Youth ', ' Area ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Adolescent ', ' Individual ', ' young adulthood ', ' adult youth ', ' young adult ', ' data repository ', ' clinical data repository ', ' Electronic Database ', ' Electronic Databank ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Databases ', ' Inequality ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Respondent ', ' Immigrant ', ' Exposure to ', ' Nature ', ' Life ', ' Home ', ' Home environment ', ' Pattern ', ' collegiate ', ' college ', ' Services ', ' experience ', ' cohort ', ' Second World War ', ' 2nd World War ', ' World War II ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' research study ', ' graduate student ', ' social ', ' Sampling ', ' Portraits ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' teen years ', ' Teen ', ' Teenagers ', ' Process ', ' Behavioral ', ' teen violence ', ' youth violence ', ' Outcome ', ' migration ', ' racial/ethnic ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' high risk ', ' public health relevance ', ' emerging adulthood ', ' undergraduate student ', ' ']",NICHD,BOWLING GREEN STATE UNIVERSITY,R15,2013,417000,0.08742484125182048
"Trajectories of Physical & Cognitive Functioning in the Neighborhood Environment  Project Summary/Abstract Prevalence of physical and cognitive functioning problems increases dramatically with age. These conditions are associated with mobility challenges, decline in quality of life, increase in falls and bone fractures, loss of independence and increased healthcare costs. Important disparities in these outcomes by socioeconomic status (SES) and race/ethnicity exist. This application seeks to improve knowledge about physical and cognitive functioning and their decline over time in the context of the neighborhood environment, with special emphasis on social and physical aspects of neighborhoods. Additionally, this proposal seeks to further understand how neighborhood environments contribute to race/ethnic and SES disparities in function. This proposed study involves separate secondary analyses of two datasets, including the ongoing MESA (Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis) study of 6,000 mid-aged and older men and women nationwide, and SWAN (Study of Women's Health Across the Nation), an ongoing annual study of 3,302 multi-ethnic midlife women. We hypothesize that neighborhoods with lower SES, fewer resources for physical engagement, fewer resources for intellectual engagement and less favorable social environments (fewer resources for social engagement and higher stress levels) will predispose to poorer physical and cognitive function. Aim 1 proposes cross-sectional investigation of how the neighborhood environment is associated with physical and cognitive function after adjusting for individual-level factors, and how neighborhood factors contribute to cross-sectional health disparities in function. Aim 2 will investigate whether neighborhood factors and changes in neighborhood factors are related to changes in physical and cognitive function over time as well as the contribution of neighborhoods to differential changes in function over time by SES and race/ethnicity. A variety of analytical methods will be used to address the causal inference challenges present in neighborhood health effects research. The analyses are embedded in a training and mentoring plan including training in substantive areas related to cognition, function, and aging as well as methodologic training in longitudinal data analyses, propensity scores, econometric techniques and causal inference generally. This application will provide preliminary data and the mentoring necessary to establish the applicant as an independent investigator and promote the development of a successful R01 application.  Project Narrative  Prevalence of physical and cognitive functioning problems increases dramatically with age, and gender and health disparities highlight the vulnerable status of minorities and women. There is substantial public health relevance in extending our understanding of how aspects of the neighborhood environment may impact physical and cognitive function because all three factors are modifiable. Deepening our understanding of the role that neighborhoods play in health disparities in functioning will provide valuable information in addressing these disparities.",Trajectories of Physical & Cognitive Functioning in the Neighborhood Environment,8530137,K01AG039554,"['abstracting ', ' Age ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Elderly ', ' Aging ', ' atherosclerotic vascular disease ', ' atheromatosis ', ' Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease ', ' Atheroscleroses ', ' Atherosclerosis ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' Cognition ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Communities ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Complement ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Environment ', ' bone fracture ', ' Fracture ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' high blood pressure ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Hypertension ', ' Locales ', ' Mentors ', ' midlife ', ' middle aged ', ' mid-life ', ' mid life ', ' middle age ', ' Persons ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Play ', ' Poverty ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' QOL ', ' Quality of life ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' socioenvironment ', ' social context ', ' social climate ', ' Social Environment ', ' social support network ', ' Social support ', ' Stress ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Time ', ' Travel ', ' Woman ', ' County ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', ' Female Health ', "" Women's Health "", ' Healthcare Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' falls ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' analytical method ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Chronic ', ' Training ', ' Physical activity ', ' Individual ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Exposure to ', ' Shapes ', ' cognitively impaired ', ' cognitive loss ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' Knowledge ', ' cognitive function ', ' Investigation ', ' Techniques ', ' Physical Function ', ' psychosocial ', ' Physical environment ', ' American ', ' cohort ', ' Preventive strategy ', ' Prevention strategy ', ' social ', ' Sampling ', ' deprivation ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' low socioeconomic position ', ' low socio-economic status ', ' low socio-economic position ', ' low socioeconomic status ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Cognitive ', ' Process ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomic ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio economic ', ' socioeconomics ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' age dependent ', ' age related ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' Prevalence ', ' aged ', ' prospective ', ' older women ', ' older men ', ' public health relevance ', ' neighborhood association ', ' ']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,K01,2013,116928,0.13577425553440492
"Multilevel Influences of Neighborhood and School Environments on Obesity     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The increased prevalence of obesity in children is well-documented, and associated with increased risk of diabetes, adult obesity, cardiovascular disease, and psychosocial problems. The prevalence of obesity among Hispanic children is significantly greater, and has increased at a greater rate, as compared to non-Hispanic children. While the factors contributing to the increased prevalence of childhood obesity are complex, socio-ecological theory suggests that social, cultural, and built environmental features of schools and neighborhoods may underlie some of the obesity disparities observed in Hispanic and low-income populations. No studies to date have examined how these factors in combination affect child obesity rates using large, population-based samples of Hispanic children. The overall aim of this study is to examine geographic and multilevel influences of neighborhood and school environments on the development of obesity among 24,000 primarily Hispanic (80%), low-income school children (ages 6-9) in El Paso, TX, a metropolitan city on the US-Mexico border. The population data to be used in this study are from the El Paso Independent School District Fitnessgram(R) surveillance dataset (2006-2009), which includes objectively measured body mass index (BMI) and physical fitness assessment gathered on an annual basis by trained school officials for all elementary school children. Obesity will be assessed using body mass index (BMI) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) normed percentiles for gender and age [13]. Home residence, BMI, and other attribute information from students will be geocoded in ArcGIS(R) v. 9.3 (Redlands, CA), and combined with other spatial data layers on socio-demographic and built environment features at both the neighborhood (census tract) and school level. By using multilevel and Bayesian modeling, we will address the following specific aims: 1) describe the socio-demographic, physical fitness, and geographic patterns associated with the development of obesity in low-income, primarily Hispanic school children in a border community; and 2) determine the contextual contributions of neighborhood and school environments to the development of obesity and low levels of physical fitness in low, income, primarily Hispanic school children in a border community. The results obtained from this study will provide important insight on the modifiable factors within the neighborhood and school environment that contribute to obesity risk and development. These results will also be used to develop project proposals for multilevel interventions that address childhood obesity, particularly among Hispanic children within a border community context.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Childhood obesity is a significant public health concern, particularly in low-income Hispanic communities on the US-Mexico border. The results from this project will identify modifiable characteristics in the neighborhood and school environment that contribute to obesity risk and development. The identification of these modifiable characteristics is critical to developing interventions within schools and neighborhoods that can reduce the rise of obesity, particularly in vulnerable school children at the US-Mexico border.

"Neighborhood Characteristics and Childhood Weight Trajectories: An Agent Based Mo     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposed research project will lead to creation of an exploratory agent based model (ABM) which will link neighborhood characteristics (i.e. the physical and social environment) with physical activity behaviors in children. There is growing evidence that the physical and social environments exert a strong influence on levels of physical activity in children, an important determinant of childhood obesity. An increasing number of policy interventions targeting physical activity are therefore being proposed. The use of ABM has been recommended by a recent Institute of Medicine committee to help guide policy development targeting childhood obesity. Dr. Joyce Lee, a pediatric endocrinologist and pediatric health services researcher who has expertise in modeling and policy related to childhood obesity, will work with Dr. Ana Diez Roux, an internationally known epidemiologist who has published extensively on neighborhood health effects and the use of agent based models, to create an ABM that will enhance understanding scientific understanding of the ways in which the physical and social environment factors affect physical activity behaviors in children.  The specific aims of this study are the following: Aim 1: To perform a comprehensive literature review of: (1) studies which examine neighborhood (physical and social environment) characteristics and their influence on physical activity in childhood and (2) studies that examine the links between physical activity and energy expenditure, and energy expenditure and weight gain among children. Aim 2: To develop an exploratory agent based model which examines the role of neighborhood characteristics (physical and social environment) on physical activity behaviors in children. Aim 2a: To validate and calibrate the model using the data based on nationally representative data and studies from the literature. Aim 2b: To explore the role of spatial inequities in physical education and neighborhood safety on socioeconomic disparities in levels of childhood physical activity. Childhood obesity is a public health crisis, influenced by a complex interplay of factors, including biologic, behavioral, environmental, and social influences. The use of complex systems sciences methodologies (which includes agent based modeling) for enhancing scientific understanding of population health problems is an increasing focus of the National Institutes of Health, with a number of RFAs exclusively focused on this modeling approach. The initial exploratory model from this study will serve as the foundation for a future R01 application to create a comprehensive ABM of childhood obesity which will provide a valuable opportunity to understand how policies at the federal, state and school district levels may impact levels of childhood obesity.          This proposed research project will lead to creation of an exploratory agent based model (ABM) which will link neighborhood characteristics (i.e. the physical and social environment) with physical activity behaviors in children. The model from this study will serve as the foundation for a future R01 application to create a comprehensive ABM of childhood obesity, which will provide valuable information about the potential downstream impacts of childhood obesity policies.

"Neighborhood Characteristics & Diabetes Incidence in Multiethnic Cohort Study Candidate. The overarching goal of this Mentored Career Development Award (K01) is to provide Dr. Sinclair with the skills and experience to establish an independent program of diabetes-related disparities research. This career development award is grounded in a multilevel population health conceptual framework that merges advanced didactic instruction with individualized one-on-one mentorship. The advanced research training will serve to catalyze Dr. Sinclair's work, which focuses on unexplored contextual factors that contribute to diabetes prevalence and incidence. This award will provide her with time and salary support to  develop an educational foundation and research program that broadens her capabilities to carry out multilevel health disparities research. To build this foundation, the training program consists of three core components: 1) formal coursework in epidemiology, biostatistics, Geographic Information Systems (GIS) technology, spatial analysis, and health disparities research, 2) mentored research training in multilevel modeling and GIS, and 3) instruction in the responsible conduct of research. Dr. Sinclair brings together an interdisciplinary mentorship board that offers extensive research experience and support of her career development program. The K01 award will allow her to benefit from a rich, multidisciplinary mentorship and training environment, which  includes experts in epidemiology, biostatistics, GIS, diabetes, and health disparities research.    Research Project. Dr. Sinclair proposes to empirically examine the spatial patterning and distribution of diabetes risk factors, prevalence and incidence among the Multiethnic Cohort Study participants by combining individual- and area-level data. The Multiethnic Cohort Study includes a diverse population-based sample of more than 100,000 Hawaiian residents, identified in 1993-1996, who have been followed for more than 15 years. In the proposed project, Dr. Sinclair will geocode the residential addresses of study participants at the time of entry into the cohort. Neighborhood socioeconomic status will be defined from the 1990 U.S. Census. Similarly, measures of neighborhood resources for physical activity and access to healthy foods will be defined. Research aims are to: 1) determine the cross-sectional association between neighborhood characteristics and the prevalence of diabetes and individual-level risk factors for diabetes, including obesity, poor diet, and low levels of physical activity, 2) assess the longitudinal association between neighborhood characteristics and the incidence of diabetes after adjustment for individual-level diabetes risk factors, and 3) examine if the association between neighborhood characteristics and diabetes prevalence and incidence differs by race and ethnicity. The use of a multilevel perspective can help to identify factors associated with diabetes-related disparities, and is congruent with the NIH strategic plan to move the country toward health equity. Findings from this study will illuminate the larger social and economic forces that create differences in health between neighborhoods, and identify geographical areas where traditional and novel public health interventions may best be targeted. The K01 award is critical to Dr. Sinclair's future as a diabetes researcher and will provide her with the time, mentorship, research skills, analytical training, and practical research experience to develop into an independently funded investigator in diabetes prevention and control among  health disparate populations.    Environment. The University of Hawaii at Mnoa is a major education and research facility that serves as the center for research and advanced graduate and professional studies. The UH School of Medicine houses the largest biomedical research facility in Hawaii, and is the most culturally and ethnically diverse medical school in the U.S. Housed within the medical school is the Department of Native Hawaiian Health where Dr. Sinclair is a member of the research faculty. Laurence N. Kolonel, MD, PhD, will serve as Dr. Sinclair's primary mentor. Dr. Kolonel is a Professor at the UH Cancer Research Center and Principal Investigator of the Multiethnic Cohort Study from which Dr. Sinclair will draw her research project. The Cancer Research Center is an NCI-designated cancer center and receives funding from a Cancer Center Support Grant. The Center's mission is to reduce the burden of cancer through research, education, and service with an emphasis on the unique ethnic, cultural, and environmental characteristics of Hawaii and the Pacific. There are currently three cohort studies in the Epidemiology Program, including the Multiethnic Cohort Study. A GIS workgroup, of which Dr. Sinclair is a member, was recently formed to examine contextual factors and cancer incidence. There are  several shared resources of the Cancer Center including the Hawaii Tumor registry which is a member of NCI's SEER Program; biostatistics which provides support for study design and data analysis; nutrition support which provides expertise in dietary questionnaire development and maintains extensive food and supplement composition databases; an analytical laboratory capable of analyzing biospecimens and foods for a wide array of constituents; a genomics laboratory which supports studies of genetic susceptibilities and whole-genome expression; and a bioinformatics group which supports the management and analysis of large and complex datasets. While the research activities of the faculty are varied, they are thematically related to the focus on  ethnic diversity. Relevance. The NIDDK Mentored Research Scientist Development Award will allow for additional training and mentorship that will position Dr. Sinclair to become an independent investigator. She will need protected time to acquire the comprehensive training in health disparities research and multilevel modeling. Dr. Sinclair's proposed research is may aid in efforts to understand and address the persistent problem of inequalities in health from a multilevel perspective. The proposed research has the potential to move our current understanding of contextual/environmental factors and diabetes forward.",Neighborhood Characteristics & Diabetes Incidence in Multiethnic

"Linking dynamic environments with childhood obesity    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Proposed is a program of training and research using ongoing longitudinal studies to investigate the effects of dynamic environments on childhood obesity. Obesity and sedentary behavior are increasingly common threats to childhood health, likely reflecting changes to the physical activity opportunities, food environment, and social contexts experienced by children and their families. Characteristics of the built environment have been linked to health behaviors and weight of both children and adults, but the causal nature of the link is not clear. A key challenge is to distinguish between competing explanations for the observed associations: the effect of neighborhoods on individual physical activity and health versus the tendency for active and healthy individuals to select neighborhoods that support their lifestyle. The proposed research has the potential to corroborate or temper the conclusions of previous research on this topic. Whereas previous cross-sectional studies have largely assumed that residential environments are static, the proposed project will use data on residential mobility and dynamic environments to better establish the temporal sequence of purported environmental causes and health effects. Available social context measures will be leveraged to show how built environment associations compare to or interact with those of social context. I will select analytical approaches to take full advantage of these data and to assess competing causal hypotheses. I will analyze data on built environments, social context, physical activity, and weight from two longitudinal studies. The first is the Fragile Families Study of Childhood Wellbeing, a birth cohort study of 4,898 children in large US cities that oversampled single parent families and is currently collecting data at age 9. The second is the Healthy PLACES trial a natural experimental evaluation of a newly built Smart Growth development, with built environment characteristics expected to have beneficial effects on local social networks and physical activity from parent-child pairs. Analyses in these cohorts will address specific hypotheses focusing on the obesogenic effects of the built environment, social context, and their interaction. In addition to the use of longitudinal and natural experimental designs, I will explore a range of analytical strategies selected to test the causal nature of observed associations. In particular, I will examine sequencing, specificity, and selection through stratified analyses, structural equation modeling, latent trajectory analysis, directed acyclic graphs, propensity score matching, and instrumental variable analysis. The proposed research will be complemented by experiential and didactic training in (1) environmental approaches to decrease health disparities, (2) theory and measurement of social context and health, (3) trajectory analysis and lifecourse epidemiology, and (4) study designs and analytical approaches to inform causal inference. This research and training will enable me to launch a program of independent research on the urban built and social environments shaping childhood physical activity and health.        Promising strategies to promote health and prevent childhood obesity include creating new opportunities for physical activity and increasing availability of places to buy healthy foods. However, a focus on structural interventions to prevent childhood obesity may be ineffective if we do not understand how social context shapes the use of these resources. This project will use data collected on individuals over time, along with digital maps of the local environment, to evaluate which neighborhood food and fitness resources are associated with less childhood obesity and better health, and what social circumstances are necessary to see such a benefit.

"Neighborhoods and Cardiovascular Risk in a Multiethnic Cohort  Project Summary There has been much recent interest in how features of residential environments (the built environment as well as social features of neighborhoods) affect the prevalence and development of cardiovascular disease and its risk factors, including obesity, diabetes, and hypertension. Identifying modifiable features of neighborhoods that contribute to cardiovascular risk would have important implications for the development of interventions and strategies to prevent cardiovascular disease and reduce social inequalities and race/ethnic differences in cardiovascular risk. Although randomized trials and/or evaluation of quasi experiments or natural experiments will ultimately be needed to determine the effectiveness of specific neighborhood-level interventions, rigorous observational work is still needed to determine what the most promising areas for intervention may be. However, very few observational studies have the type of detailed neighborhood and individual- level data necessary for this work. This competing renewal proposal builds on prior work conducted under R01 HL071759. As part of the prior funding cycle we created a unique and rich dataset with a multiplicity of rigorous objective and survey-based measures of residential environments linked to the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA), a state-of-the art, longitudinal, population-based, multi-site and multi-ethnic epidemiologic study of cardiovascular disease. In this renewal we propose to enhance and update the neighborhood-level environmental measures to allow for methodologically rigorous longitudinal analyses that build on key findings of cross-sectional analyses conducted as part of the prior cycle. The Specific Aims of the project are: (1) To examine associations of specific neighborhood characteristics (including measures of access to healthy foods, walkability and urban design, access to recreational resources, and neighborhood stressors) with changes in diet, physical activity, and body weight over time; (2) To examine associations of neighborhood characteristics with incident diabetes and hypertension as well as with changes over time in continuous measures of insulin resistance and blood pressure (3) To examine associations of neighborhood characteristics with incident fatal and non fatal cardiovascular events; and (4)To investigate the contribution of neighborhood environments to race/ethnic and socioeconomic differences in longitudinal changes in risk factors and incident disease. In addition, the creation and maintenance of a rich data set on environmental features for MESA participants over time will generate a unique resource to be used in gene-environment interaction studies as MESA genotyping proceeds.  Relevance If features of neighborhoods are shown to be important in the development of cardiovascular disease and its risk factors, strategies to prevent cardiovascular disease may need to focus on environments as well as individuals. Identifying the specific neighborhood features that are most important is key to the development and future testing of these interventions.",Neighborhoods and Cardiovascular Risk in a Multiethnic Cohort,8471156,R01HL071759,"['Affect ', ' epidemiologic investigation ', ' Epidemiology Research ', ' Epidemiological Studies ', ' Epidemiologic Research ', ' Epidemiologic Studies ', ' atherosclerotic vascular disease ', ' atheromatosis ', ' Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease ', ' Atheroscleroses ', ' Atherosclerosis ', ' Blood Pressure ', ' Body Weight ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' circulatory system ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' Cardiovascular system (all sites) ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' Disease Frequency Surveys ', ' Cross-Sectional Survey ', ' Cross-Sectional Analyses ', ' Cross Sectional Analysis ', ' Cross-Sectional Studies ', ' diabetes ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' dietary ', ' Diet ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Environment ', ' Environmental Exposure ', ' Food ', ' Future ', ' Genotype ', ' Goals ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' high blood pressure ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Hypertension ', ' Incidence ', ' insulin resistant ', ' Insulin Resistance ', ' Maintenance ', ' Persons ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Obesity ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' socioenvironment ', ' social context ', ' social climate ', ' Social Environment ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' base ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Link ', ' Evaluation ', ' Physical activity ', ' Individual ', ' Funding ', ' healthy food ', ' Health Food ', ' Life ', ' Event ', ' interest ', ' Physical environment ', ' experience ', ' environment effect on gene ', ' gene environment interaction ', ' stressor ', ' cohesion ', ' cohort ', ' Participant ', ' social inequality ', ' ethnic difference ', ' social ', ' cardiovascular risk ', ' cardiovascular risk factor ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Effectiveness ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Quetelet index ', ' BMI z-score ', ' BMI percentile ', ' Body mass index ', ' Data ', ' Observational Study ', ' Update ', ' Characteristics ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomic ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio economic ', ' socioeconomics ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Prevalence ', ' Natural experiment ', ' Quasi-experiment ', ' nondiabetic ', ' non-diabetic ', ' population based ', ' longitudinal database ', ' neighborhood association ', ' randomized trial ', ' ']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2013,592445,0.17866890538428537
"Climate change and health: residential energy-efficiency for comfort and equity As the number and severity of extreme weather events increase with the advancement of global climate change, understanding the public health implications and prioritizing adaptation strategies for retrofitting urban infrastructure assumes greater urgency. Architects and urban planners in cold and temperate climates have long recognized the value of weatherizing residential structures to improve winter-time interior comfort and reduce utility costs. However, less understood is the contribution of weatherization efforts to additionally reduce the negative health effects of hot weather extremes and how these efforts might be targeted to lessen health disparities in urban environments. Our broad objective is to reduce temperature-related health disparities in U.S. communities. Using a trans-disciplinary approach, we propose to create new knowledge that will help guide health-enhancing residential energy conservation measures. This model will use data from three case-study communities- Detroit, Michigan, Cleveland, Ohio, and Washington, DC where important social disparities in temperature-related health outcomes have been documented. Specifically, we propose 1) to update and expand existing maps of vulnerability to extreme temperatures, based on a finer-scale neighborhood level analysis using structural, environmental, socio-economic, and demographic data, and evaluate potential for home weatherization to reduce these vulnerabilities; 2) to model how future climate scenarios and changes in neighborhood conditions might impact the distribution of vulnerability and the interior comfort conditions that residents will experience in these communities; and 3) to share and discuss research results with key stakeholders (e.g. installers, public health officials, community leaders, city officials) to inform urban planning, public health preparedness, community improvement and weatherization programming decisions relevant to vulnerable populations. The proposed study will combine existing data in a novel way to increase scientific understanding of the health benefits of residential weatherization now and in future climates. This research will provide a broadly applicable methodology for guiding local planning for built environment and neighborhood improvements, and climate change adaptation and mitigation programs. We will create maps and models for use by public health practitioners, weatherization program managers, city officials, urban planners and architects to reduce population health vulnerability to extreme temperatures.",Climate change and health: residential energy-efficiency for comfort and equity,8470647,R21ES020156,"['senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Elderly ', ' Aging ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Architecture ', ' Censuses ', ' Cities ', ' climatic ', ' Meteorological Climate ', ' Climate ', ' Communities ', ' DC Washington ', ' D.C.

"Neighborhood interventions in alcohol-related homicide: a systems approach     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Blacks and Hispanics are more likely to die from alcohol-related homicides than non-Hispanic Whites (NHWs), despite being less likely to drink heavily compared to NHWs. Little epidemiologic research has been conducted to determine what can be done to reduce such disparities. We propose that the disproportionate risk for alcohol-related homicide among racial/ethnic minorities may be related to the systematic residential segregation of racial/ethnic minorities into economically disadvantaged neighborhoods with high alcohol outlet density and reduced quality health care access. We propose to use agent-based models (ABM) to simulate experiences of alcohol use, violent perpetration and victimization in agents embedded in neighborhoods, and to examine whether interventions on neighborhood alcohol outlet density and health care access could reduce racial disparities in alcohol-related homicide. By allowing us to simulate counterfactual situations, ABMs overcome the limitations that individual selection of NHWs, Hispanics and Blacks into non-comparable neighborhoods place on causal inference in observational neighborhood studies. In examining and testing these interventions, we will also incorporate information on social ties, as the patterns of street and bar consumption associated with concentration of alcohol outlets may encourage the formation of social ties with high-risk drinkers who also exhibit violent behavior. Specifically, we will examine whether the breadth and strength of social ties influences the efficacy of neighborhood interventions in reducing racial/ethnic disparities in alcohol-related homicides. The ABM will include agents matched to the demographic composition of New York City and arranged in a grid divided into neighborhoods, informed by more than 20 empirically-based parameters assessing a complex network of social ties, neighborhood characteristics, alcohol use and misuse, and victimization and perpetration. The present project focuses on simulating NYC neighborhoods; this project will inform the preparation of an NIH R01 proposal to use complex systems approaches to investigate national racial/ethnic disparities in different forms of alcohol-related injury.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Reducing racial/ethnic disparities in alcohol-related violent death is a critical public health initiative. Little research is addressing how interventions to improve neighborhoods may differentially improve the alcohol- related homicide outcomes of Black and Hispanic individuals in the U.S. The proposed project will inform public health stakeholders by using computer simulation modeling to estimate estimating the efficacy of two hypothetical neighborhood interventions to reduce alcohol- related homicide using novel and empirically-informed agent-based modeling techniques.                     ",Neighborhood interventions in alcohol-related homicide: a systems

"Demographic Vulnerability, Neighborhood Pollution, and Racial Health Disparities     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposed project focuses on the ways in which social and economic conditions at the individual-, family-, and neighborhood-levels interact with neighborhood concentrations of environmental pollution to affect racial disparities in health and mortality. We will develop comprehensive measures of neighborhood pollution using data from the Environmental Protection Agency and several other sources, and attach these neighborhood- pollution estimates, along with information on other neighborhood characteristics, to longitudinal data for a diverse group of individuals in the Panel Study of Income Dynamics. The resulting multilevel data will provide a unique opportunity to assess long-term effects of neighborhood pollution on mortality, self-rated health, physical limitations, and diagnoses of cancer, cardiovascular disease, asthma, and other specific medical conditions for a national sample of adults. We will assess the efficacy of these data by comparing them to estimates of health-outcome prevalence and cross-sectional associations between neighborhood pollution and health derived from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. Analyses of our unique longitudinal, multilevel data will focus on the extent to which vulnerability to the health effects of neighborhood pollution is heightened by exposure to stressful conditions in the household or economic and social distress in the neighborhood of residence. Central to the project is the assessment of the role of group differences in exposure to neighborhood pollution, and differences in susceptibility to the effects of pollution, in explaining persistent racial and ethnic differences in health.          PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The project focuses directly on the effects of neighborhood pollution on several health outcomes. Identifying how the health effects of exposure to pollution vary across individual circumstances and neighborhood context has potentially important public health implications, as does understanding the role of pollution exposure in creating persistent racial and ethnic disparities in health.            ","Demographic Vulnerability, Neighborhood Pollution, and Racial Health Disparities",8761547,R01HD078501,"['Accounting ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Affect ', ' Air Pollution ', ' Bronchial Asthma ', ' Asthma ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' Censuses ', ' Disease Frequency Surveys ', ' Cross-Sectional Survey ', ' Cross-Sectional Analyses ', ' Cross Sectional Analysis ', ' Cross-Sectional Studies ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Economical Conditions ', ' Economic Conditions ', ' Economics ', ' Employment ', ' environmental contamination ', ' environmental contaminant ', ' Environmental Pollution ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Family ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Household ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Income ', ' Longterm Effects ', ' Long-Term Effects ', ' Mortality ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Research ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Societal Conditions ', ' Social Conditions ', ' Stress ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Environmental Protection Agency ', ' United States Environmental Protection Agency ', ' Measures ', ' stress', ' reaction ', ' stress response ', ' reaction', ' crisis ', ' biological adaptation to stress ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' racial/ethnic difference ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' Medical ', ' Link ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Predisposition ', ' Distress ', ' residence ', ' Individual ', ' Inequality ', ' Reliance ', ' Exposure to ', ' National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey ', ' NHANES ', ' Life ', ' Pollution ', ' Source ', ' Location ', ' physical health ', ' physical conditioning ', ' Best Practice Analysis ', ' Benchmarking ', ' experience ', ' stressor ', ' member ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' race differences ', ' racial difference ', ' General Public ', ' General Population ', ' social ', ' land use ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' cancer diagnosis ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Data ', ' Characteristics ', ' Outcome ', ' Prevalence ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' public health relevance ', ' longitudinal analysis ', ' ']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2014,248484,0.21147943888212856
"Reducing Health Disparities in Vulnerable African American Families and Communiti DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Over the next five years, the MSM will continue the CEHD research based on: 1) Its longstanding and passionate commitment to serving underserved families and communities, 2) a research agenda that advances minority health; 3) a track record of educating future minority scientists that will continue this legacy of leadership and 4) a strong push to continue to assist community based organization to become empowered as educated consumers of health information. The institution will pursue its strategic vision that emphasizes a community-centered approach to serving the health needs of underserved communities and a translational research portfolio that fosters community-based solutions to impacting health disparities. The proposed Program aligns with this shared vision of a CBPR model that integrates our intenvoven network of partnerships with academic institutions, civic organizations, government agencies, community-based organizations, schools, prisons, neighborhood clinics, health providers and policy makers. Specifically, (research project #1) is an intervention study that will assess incarcerated women returning from prison and  assess strategies for reintegration with their families and community life (research project #1). The CEHD will also study the neighborhood and parent determinants and consequences of secondhand smoke exposure on African American children through a cross-sectional design (research project #2). A developmental approach (research project #3) will evaluate a community-developed parenting curriculum, which assesses the extent to which quality parenting can reduce the negative impact of poverty on parental mental health and preschool child development and behavioral health. The overall evaluation of the work to be undertaken by the CEHD will document how genuine community engagement and participation in research can facilitate health promotion and disease prevention in African American facilities and communities. The work of the CEHD will be implemented through an Administrative Core, Research Core, Research Education and Training Core, and a Community Engagement Core interfacing with residents from Atlanta Neighborhood Planning Units V, X, Y and Z.

"Residential trajectories and adolescent health: results from a randomized trial  This project aims to understand the role of neighborhood residential trajectories for causing adolescent mental health and substance use problems, to inform potential prevention strategies early in life. Since most adulthood substance use and mental disorders originate early in life, it is imperative to focus on childhood exposures. Although evidence links adverse neighborhood contexts to impaired development, most studies are observational and cross sectional, limiting causal inference and policy translation. We propose a rigorous secondary data analysis using data from an experimental study of housing vouchers that may inform neighborhood context as a cause of health problems among low income minority populations: the Moving to Opportunity (MTO) study. MTO allows strong causal inferences, and though it was a promising policy to disrupt the toxic effects of neighborhood poverty, health researchers have had limited access to the data. It is necessary to unpack this expensive, ambitious housing experiment to understand the mechanisms by which non-health policies may promote, or indeed harm, health. We propose new analyses to answer significant questions for the design of rental assistance policy, and for the etiology of neighborhood health effects. We will leverage MTO's experimental design to understand how households select and remain in neighborhoods, how residential trajectories across time are influenced by health, and how these residential trajectories, in turn, influence health. To operationalize high opportunity neighborhoods, we apply a Geography of Opportunity framework - a policy-relevant analytic tool that emphasizes regional context and the continuing significance of social inequality for constraining residential choice, and for influencing residential preferences. We will model the dynamic nature of neighborhoods as well as the spatial, temporal moves of low-income families. To do so, we will construct residential trajectories by merging over 46,000 MTO geocoded address spells with a mosaic of retail, survey, and administrative neighborhood data to operationalize high opportunity neighborhoods across time. We will test for factors that influence household residential trajectories using growth curves and latent class analysis. We will then apply causal mediation methods, including novel semiparametric weight- based techniques, to test whether and when residential trajectories mediate MTO effects on adolescent health, to inform life course timing and mechanisms of neighborhood exposures for health effects. This project builds on a productive ongoing interdisciplinary collaboration, and leverages team expertise in mental health and substance use, neighborhood effects, adolescent development, life course and causal methods. Answers to our research questions may inform residential selection bias, which may, in turn, inform how to design more rigorous observational neighborhood studies. Further, since housing choice vouchers constitute a large portion of federal affordable housing dollars, our results can inform policy, e.g., to tailor housing mobility programs to address client health problems, and help low income families sustain moves to high opportunity areas. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We propose a secondary data analysis of the effects of a housing voucher experiment on adolescent health. Its strong design and analytic techniques will inform the role of neighborhood and residential trajectories for the etiology of mental health and substance use problems, as well as inform the next generation of affordable housing policies, for example, to tailor housing mobility and rental assistance programs to address health needs of low-income youth, and ultimately help low-income families move to and remain in high opportunity neighborhoods.            ",Residential trajectories and adolescent health: results from a randomized trial,8752017,R03HD080848,"['adolescent girl ', ' Female Adolescents ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Elderly ', ' Alcohol Chemical Class ', ' Alcohols ', ' Dorsum ', ' Back ', ' psychological disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Censuses ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Infant and Child Development ', ' Child Development ', ' Client ', ' Crime ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Exhibits ', ' Experimental Designs ', ' Family ', ' Geography ', ' Goals ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Growth ', ' Health ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' Household ', ' Housing ', ' life course ', ' Life Cycle ', ' Life Cycle Stages ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Methods ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Risk Ratio ', ' Relative Odds ', ' Cross-Product Ratio ', ' Odds Ratio ', ' Poverty ', ' Public Housing ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Residential Mobility ', ' Residential Selections ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Selection Bias ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Tobacco ', ' Translations ', ' violent behavior ', ' violent ', ' Violence ', ' Weight ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', ' Mediating ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Youth ', ' base ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Adolescent ', ' Link ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' using substances ', ' substance use ', ' AOD use ', ' Alcohol or Other Drugs use ', ' Policies ', ' Inequality ', ' drug use ', ' Drug usage ', ' Collaborations ', ' Exposure to ', ' tool ', ' Nature ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Victimization ', ' Dimensions ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' spelling ', ' preference ', ' experience ', ' transdisciplinary collaboration ', ' interdisciplinary collaboration ', ' Toxicities ', ' Toxic effect ', ' novel ', ' Preventive strategy ', ' Prevention strategy ', ' social inequality ', ' Negotiation ', ' Negotiating ', ' Mediation ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' research study ', ' Modeling ', ' Adolescent Development ', ' boys ', ' voucher ', ' disease causation ', ' causation ', ' Causality ', ' Etiology ', ' Low income ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Randomized ', ' Sum ', ' Observational research ', ' Observation study ', ' Observation research ', ' Observational Study ', ' Characteristics ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' next generation ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' imprint ', ' volunteer ', ' public health relevance ', ' randomized trial ', ' ']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA,R03,2014,89743,0.11673720023941264
"Geospatial Research on HIV Treatment in San Francisco     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): To maximize ""HIV treatment as prevention"" efforts in San Francisco, we propose a three-year study that uses geospatial methods to map and analyze the distribution of HIV treatment outcomes at the neighborhood level. Since the publication of the HPTN 052 clinical trial findings in 2011, global HIV prevention efforts have heralded the use of early antiretroviral therapy (ART) as a key strategy to disrupt transmission events and end the HIV/AIDS epidemic in subsequent generations. A growing body of research is focused on the identification of interventions at the individual level that improve engagement in HIV care and reduce community viral load. However, few studies have investigated the neighborhood as a unit of analysis to determine characteristics and resources that facilitate entry into HIV treatment. Attention to the neighborhoods in which HIV positive individuals live, including availability of health care, housing, and public transportation services, is necessary to maximize the use of HIV treatment as prevention of new infections. Geospatial methods offer an innovative and underutilized approach to studying these issues. Aim 1. To examine spatial relationships between neighborhood characteristics and HIV treatment outcomes in San Francisco through the use of geographic information systems (GIS) software. Aim 2. To identify locations of resources which facilitate engagement in HIV treatment by utilizing methods of public participatory GIS (PPGIS) with HIV positive individuals. Aim 3. To create an online mapping platform for the dissemination of thematic maps showing gaps in HIV treatment outcomes and resources using data collected in Aims 1 and 2. We will achieve these aims through a mixed-methods study that is guided by Gardner's model of six stages of engagement in HIV care: 1) awareness of serostatus, 2) linkage to care, 3) retention in care, 4) access to ART, 5) adherence to ART, and 6) suppression of viral load. For Aim 1, data will be collected from secondary sources (SFDPH AIDS Office and the US Census), mapped using GIS software, and analyzed using spatial statistics. This information will help us identify gaps in engagement in care at the neighborhood level and determine predictors of optimal and suboptimal treatment outcomes. For Aim 2, we will conduct PPGIS focus groups with HIV positive individuals in selected neighborhoods. This information will help us identify HIV treatment-related resources at each stage of engagement in care. For Aim 3 we will create an online mapping platform to facilitate the dissemination of maps and findings to SFDPH, neighborhood health clinics, and HIV focused community based organizations. The methods and maps we develop through this study will facilitate the use of spatially-targeted programmatic and policy efforts to reduce community viral load by identifying gaps in treatment at the neighborhood level. The study is led by a new Early Stage Investigator (PI Dr. Alexis Martinez) and will support the goals of the R15 mechanism by providing a rich environment for students at a state university to learn about all aspects of the research process from an interdisciplinary team of investigators with a successful history of collaboration in both teaching and research institutions.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We propose a three-year study that uses geospatial methods to map and analyze the distribution of HIV treatment outcomes at the neighborhood level in San Francisco. Attention to the neighborhoods in which HIV positive individuals live, including availability of health care services, housing, and public transportation, is necessary to maximize the use of HIV treatment as prevention of new infections.

"Neighborhood interventions in alcohol-related homicide: a systems approach     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Blacks and Hispanics are more likely to die from alcohol-related homicides than non-Hispanic Whites (NHWs), despite being less likely to drink heavily compared to NHWs. Little epidemiologic research has been conducted to determine what can be done to reduce such disparities. We propose that the disproportionate risk for alcohol-related homicide among racial/ethnic minorities may be related to the systematic residential segregation of racial/ethnic minorities into economically disadvantaged neighborhoods with high alcohol outlet density, low collective efficacy, and reduced quality health care access. We propose to use agent-based models (ABM) to conduct computer simulations of alcohol use, violent perpetration and victimization in neighborhoods, and to simulate the potential impact that changes in neighborhood alcohol outlet density and health care access could have on racial disparities in alcohol-related homicide. By allowing us to simulate counterfactual situations, ABMs overcome the limitations that individual selection of NHWs, Hispanics and Blacks into non-comparable neighborhoods place on causal inference in observational neighborhood studies. In examining and testing these hypothetical simulated interventions, we will also incorporate information on social networks, as the patterns of street and bar consumption associated with concentration of alcohol outlets may encourage the formation of social ties with high-risk drinkers who also exhibit violent behavior. Specifically, w will examine whether the breadth and strength of social ties influences the efficacy of simulated neighborhood interventions in reducing racial/ethnic disparities in alcohol-related homicides. The ABM will include agents matched to the demographic composition of New York City and arranged in a grid divided into neighborhoods, informed by empirically-based parameters assessing a complex network of social ties, neighborhood characteristics, alcohol use and misuse, and victimization and perpetration. The project focuses on simulating NYC neighborhoods; it will inform an NIH R01 proposal to use complex systems approaches.          PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Reducing racial/ethnic disparities in alcohol-related violent death is a critical public health initiative. Little research is addressing how interventions to improve neighborhoods may differentially improve the alcohol- related homicide outcomes of Black and Hispanic individuals in the U.S. The proposed project will inform public health stakeholders by using computer simulation modeling to estimate estimating the efficacy of two hypothetical neighborhood interventions to reduce alcohol- related

"PS11-003 Minority AIDS Research Initiative  Project Summary/Abstract The etiology of health disparities involves a complex web of factors that interact to produce detrimental health outcomes for particular segments of society. In the United States, the current landscape of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) continues to be shaped by disparities in case distribution, as African Americans (AA) account for more new HIV cases and HIV related deaths than any other racial/ethnic group. Importantly, there were more new HIV infections (52%) among young AA men who have sex with men (MSM; aged 13-29 years) than any other racial/ethnic-sexual orientation/behavior group. Recent studies have found that geographical and neighborhood environments (with environment broadly understood to encompass both physical and social attributes) are associated with sexual behavior and HIV prevalence and incidence. Although the possible role of geographic and neighborhood contexts in HIV has often been emphasized, rigorous investigations of environmental factors are rare. This is due, in part, to the sensitive nature of residential address information of HIV-infected persons and difficulties in identifying and characterizing the relevant social and physical environments.  The overall aim of the Geographic and Neighborhood Study of HIV (GANSH) is to examine the associations between geospatial and neighborhood environmental characteristics and psychosocial factors and prevalent HIV/STI among AA MSM in the Jackson, MS metropolitan statistical area (Jackson MSA). The proposed study uses a cross-sectional, multi- level design to examine these associations. Non-linear (i.e., a dichotomized outcome variables) relationships between geographic and neighborhood characteristics and measures of HIV/STI status will be examined using multi-level models with a random neighborhood intercept and random covariate effects. Empirical Bayes and Geographic Information Systems (GIS) methods will be used to estimate and map the area-specific relative risk of HIV as well as the spatial distribution of the associations between behavioral and psychosocial factors and HIV/STI status.  To our knowledge, this is the first study to examine the associations between geospatial and neighborhood characteristics and psychosocial factors and prevalent HIV/STI in AA MSM. The proposed research will provide answers to a wide range of questions of public health importance with direct implications for disease prevention. Moreover, results from the proposed study may change the methodological/theoretical concepts of existing HIV/STI interventions and/or prevention research.  Project Narrative HIV/STI research has traditionally focused on individual-level risk factors such as behaviors, and more recently, socio-cultural factors. The conceptual framework for the Geographic and Neighborhood Effects on HIV Study is based on the socio-ecological model, which integrates the complex interaction between individual, relationship, community, and society-level factors and allows for the consideration of factors at multiple levels in an individual's risk for experiencing or increasing HIV/STI risk. Results from this study will provide critical information in the understanding of HIV/STI risk among AA MSM and identification of high-risk areas to target for disease prevention.",PS11-003 Minority AIDS Research Initiative,8597296,U01PS003315,[''],NCHHSTP,"MY BROTHER'S KEEPER, INC.",U01,2014,283629,0.07016804710293452
"Developing Neighborhood Archetypes for Understanding Disparities in Cancer  PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Disparities in cancer survival continue to persist by race/ethnicity, socioeconomic status (SES) and nativity. Neighborhood factors are critical pathways through which disparities are shaped and perpetuated. However, the literature has shown mixed results and neighborhood-based interventions have had limited success. To advance research on neighborhoods and health, new approaches need to reflect the fact that neighborhood effects on health arise through complex and dynamic processes, underscoring the importance of studying not only the individual effects of neighborhood features on health outcomes, but also their synergistic effects. A promising approach is to encompass multiple dimensions within a single classification system, archetypes, that capture meaningful distinctions across neighborhoods (e.g., Low SES, rural; Poor, urban minority; Middle-class suburban/exurban families). The archetype approach is an efficient way to maximally integrate multiple sources of available information on neighborhood characteristics and has the potential to identify improved opportunities for intervening and reducing health disparities. Leveraging a comprehensive database of small- area level data on social and built neighborhood environments and applying novel statistical approaches, this application proposes to develop neighborhood archetypes around two time periods, 2000 and 2010, for the large, diverse state of California. The central hypotheses are that 1) multiple neighborhood factors can be combined together to form neighborhood archetypes; and 2) that cancer mortality among breast and prostate cancer patients will vary by these neighborhood archetypes, and these associations will vary by race/ethnicity and nativity. The specific aims of this study are to: 1) Investigate the utility of the archetypes approach to characterize distinct neighborhoods across California. Specifically, we will extend to the census block group level previously developed census tract neighborhood archetypes using confirmatory latent class analysis (LCA). We will also expand, with additional built and social environment features, prior neighborhood archetypes using exploratory LCA. 2) Examine the associations between neighborhood archetypes and survival among a population-based, racially/ethnically diverse set of breast and prostate cancer patients. Specifically, we will test whether neighborhood archetypes are associated with all cause and cancer- specific mortality and whether this association is moderated by race/ethnicity. We will also test whether nativity moderates the neighborhood archetype associations among Hispanics and Asian Americans. The resulting neighborhood archetypes will provide an innovative resource for future research. Applying the archetypes to investigate breast and prostate cancer survival among California's diverse population, this research will yield insights into how neighborhood characteristics work synergistically with each other and interact with individual characteristics to influence health. This research has the potential to contribute to a broader, more fundamental understanding of place effects on health, with applications to both population health and health disparities research. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Increasingly, neighborhood characteristics (e.g., food environment, socioeconomic status, walkability) are being studied to better understand how they influence health; however, capturing these complex and dynamic features that are likely to interact in shaping health is challenging. The proposed research is relevant to public health because it will develop neighborhood archetypes that will account for physical and social characteristics of the environment, and test its association with breast and prostate cancer mortality to identify which features are health promoting or detrimental to survival among a racially/ethnically diverse, population-based sample of African American, Asian/Pacific Islander, Hispanic and non-Hispanic white cancer patients. This research is relevant to the missions of the NIH and NCI as it may identify neighborhood characteristics that are critical for addressing health disparities in the US.                ",Developing Neighborhood Archetypes for Understanding Disparities in Cancer,8604276,R21CA174469,"['Accounting ', ' Affect ', ' Asian Americans ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' California ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Censuses ', ' Systematics ', ' Classification ', ' Communities ', ' Data Sources ', ' Diagnosis ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Environment ', ' Family ', ' Food ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' healthcare policy ', ' health care policy ', ' Health Policy ', ' Household ', ' Literature ', ' Mission ', ' Mortality ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Research ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Safety ', ' Social Characteristics ', ' socioenvironment ', ' social context ', ' social climate ', ' Social Environment ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' oriental ', ' Asians ', ' Measures ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' Community Health Care ', ' Community Healthcare ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Hispanics ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' diverse populations ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' base ', ' suburbia ', ' suburban ', ' suburb ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Link ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Rural ', ' Pacific Islander American ', ' Pacific Islander ', ' Pacific Island Americans ', ' data repository ', ' clinical data repository ', ' Electronic Database ', ' Electronic Databank ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Databases ', ' Policies ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Critical Paths ', ' Critical Pathways ', ' Shapes ', ' Prostatic Cancer ', ' Prostate Cancer ', ' Prostate CA ', ' Malignant prostatic tumor ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Prostate ', ' Malignant neoplasm of prostate ', ' Dimensions ', ' Complex ', ' Home ', ' Home environment ', ' Source ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' success ', ' novel ', ' social ', ' cancer registry ', ' neoplasm registry ', ' Sampling ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' low socioeconomic position ', ' low socio-economic status ', ' low socio-economic position ', ' low socioeconomic status ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Population Research ', ' Cancer Cause ', ' Cancer Etiology ', ' Cancer Patient ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' Minority ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel approaches ', ' new approaches ', ' novel strategies ', ' Outcome ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' public health relevance ', ' patient population ', ' population based ', ' population health ', ' food environment ', ' ']",NCI,CANCER PREVENTION INSTIT OF CALIFORNIA,R21,2014,162038,0.17533000346364913
"Cardiovascular Health: Effects of the Social and Physical Environment Childhood socioeconomic status (SES) has been associated with adult cardiovascular disease, but the mechanisms of how this occurs have not been fully explored. Furthermore, low SES is associated with the co-occurrence of multiple social (i.e., increased violence exposure), physical (i.e., higher air pollution levels, poor access to recreational facilities and access to fresh fruits and vegetables) and behavioral (i.e., poor diet, low physical activity, tobacco use) risk factors associated with cardiovascular disease. However, exposures to these factors during childhood and adolescence have not been evaluated with respect to their role in the development of metabolic and cardiovascular risk profiles in a prospective study. Given the complexity of interactions (individual and neighborhood, social and physical) a life course framework may be a fruitful approach to exploring the individual exposures and social attributes of neighborhoods that contribute to the development of metabolic and cardiovascular risk profiles. This proposal aims to examine the contribution of social stressors and physical environment experienced at both the individual and neighborhood level during adolescence, and their interactions on the development of cardiovascular and metabolic risk profiles (i.e., blood pressure, CRP, Hemoglobin A1c, BMI, waist circumference, total cholesterol, triglycerides, LDL, HDL, non-HDL cholesterol). The research goals of this proposal will be achieved with two projects. First, using the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health), a longitudinal cohort of adolescents followed through adulthood, I will employ a life course approach to determine whether social stressors (i.e., interpersonal violence, school and community violence) and physical environment (i.e., access to food stores, proximity to parks and recreation) experienced in adolescence plays a role in the development of metabolic and cardiovascular risk profiles in adulthood. Interactive effects between social and physical environmental factors will also be examined. Second, I will develop a primary collection cross-sectional study of 100 adolescents to examine the mediating effect of diet (not available in Add Health) and the modifying effects of air pollutants (also not available in the Add Health study) on the stress-cardiovascular health relationship. I will dedicate no less than 75 percent of my time to a highly structured and intensely focused research experience over the next 5 years, which will extend my expertise in characterizing social and environmental determinants as stressors in relation to physiological outcomes in children and young adults. A career development plan is outlined to gain practical skills in research design and implementation, expertise in statistical models to predict air pollutant levels and structural equation models as well as knowledge in the mechanisms of cardiovascular and metabolic disorders. The career development plan includes: 1) formal graduate course work in survey design, latent statistical models, mechanisms of cardiovascular disease, 2) tutorial with project advisor to learn clinical aspects of cardiovascular and metabolic disorders in adolescents 3) tutorial with advisor to discuss air pollutant modeling strategies 4) interactions with mentoring team to discuss research and career goals and project progress. I will work closely with the mentoring team which collectively has extensive experience in mentoring new clinical investigators, disparities in psychosocial factors, life experiences and cardiovascular disease outcomes, effects of neighborhood environment and cardiovascular disease, and disparities in physical environmental factors. The proposed training, consisting of interactions with mentors and advisors, tutorials and coursework, complements my previous training and experience in social and environmental epidemiologic research and will allow me to develop the necessary transdisciplinary expertise to achieve my goal and successfully transition to independent investigator at the end of this award. The proposed project will focus on a major health problem in the U.S. - cardiovascular disease, particularly its onset during the adolescent years and explore new models of how individual and community factors, in this case exposure to violence and environmental toxins, impact health outcomes. Findings from these studies can inform clinical practice in chronic disease prevention so that providers and policymakers alike can tailor age appropriate interventions to adolescents and young adults that jointly address the individual as well as the environmental context to more effectively reduce cardiovascular disease risk. Project Narrative  Childhood socioeconomic status (SES) has been associated with adult cardiovascular disease, but the mechanisms of how this occurs have not been fully explored.

"Trajectories of Physical & Cognitive Functioning in the Neighborhood Environment  Project Summary/Abstract Prevalence of physical and cognitive functioning problems increases dramatically with age. These conditions are associated with mobility challenges, decline in quality of life, increase in falls and bone fractures, loss of independence and increased healthcare costs. Important disparities in these outcomes by socioeconomic status (SES) and race/ethnicity exist. This application seeks to improve knowledge about physical and cognitive functioning and their decline over time in the context of the neighborhood environment, with special emphasis on social and physical aspects of neighborhoods. Additionally, this proposal seeks to further understand how neighborhood environments contribute to race/ethnic and SES disparities in function. This proposed study involves separate secondary analyses of two datasets, including the ongoing MESA (Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis) study of 6,000 mid-aged and older men and women nationwide, and SWAN (Study of Women's Health Across the Nation), an ongoing annual study of 3,302 multi-ethnic midlife women. We hypothesize that neighborhoods with lower SES, fewer resources for physical engagement, fewer resources for intellectual engagement and less favorable social environments (fewer resources for social engagement and higher stress levels) will predispose to poorer physical and cognitive function. Aim 1 proposes cross-sectional investigation of how the neighborhood environment is associated with physical and cognitive function after adjusting for individual-level factors, and how neighborhood factors contribute to cross-sectional health disparities in function. Aim 2 will investigate whether neighborhood factors and changes in neighborhood factors are related to changes in physical and cognitive function over time as well as the contribution of neighborhoods to differential changes in function over time by SES and race/ethnicity. A variety of analytical methods will be used to address the causal inference challenges present in neighborhood health effects research. The analyses are embedded in a training and mentoring plan including training in substantive areas related to cognition, function, and aging as well as methodologic training in longitudinal data analyses, propensity scores, econometric techniques and causal inference generally. This application will provide preliminary data and the mentoring necessary to establish the applicant as an independent investigator and promote the development of a successful R01 application. Project Narrative  Prevalence of physical and cognitive functioning problems increases dramatically with age, and gender and health disparities highlight the vulnerable status of minorities and women. There is substantial public health relevance in extending our understanding of how aspects of the neighborhood environment may impact physical and cognitive function because all three factors are modifiable. Deepening our understanding of the role that neighborhoods play in health disparities in functioning will provide valuable information in addressing these disparities.",Trajectories of Physical & Cognitive Functioning in the Neighborhood Environment,8716628,K01AG039554,"['abstracting ', ' Age ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Elderly ', ' Aging ', ' atherosclerotic vascular disease ', ' atheromatosis ', ' Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease ', ' Atheroscleroses ', ' Atherosclerosis ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' Cognition ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Communities ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Complement ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Environment ', ' bone fracture ', ' Fracture ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' high blood pressure ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Hypertension ', ' Locales ', ' Mentors ', ' midlife ', ' middle aged ', ' mid-life ', ' mid life ', ' middle age ', ' Persons ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Play ', ' Poverty ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' QOL ', ' Quality of life ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' socioenvironment ', ' social context ', ' social climate ', ' Social Environment ', ' social support network ', ' Social support ', ' Stress ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Time ', ' Travel ', ' Woman ', ' County ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', ' Female Health ', "" Women's Health "", ' Healthcare Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' falls ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' analytical method ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Chronic ', ' Training ', ' Physical activity ', ' Individual ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Exposure to ', ' Shapes ', ' cognitively impaired ', ' cognitive loss ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' Knowledge ', ' cognitive function ', ' Investigation ', ' Techniques ', ' Physical Function ', ' psychosocial ', ' Physical environment ', ' American ', ' cohort ', ' Preventive strategy ', ' Prevention strategy ', ' social ', ' Sampling ', ' deprivation ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' low socioeconomic position ', ' low socio-economic status ', ' low socio-economic position ', ' low socioeconomic status ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Cognitive ', ' Process ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomic ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio economic ', ' socioeconomics ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' age dependent ', ' age related ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' Prevalence ', ' aged ', ' prospective ', ' older women ', ' older men ', ' public health relevance ', ' neighborhood association ', ' ']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,K01,2014,109579,0.13577425553440492
"Linking dynamic environments with childhood obesity    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Proposed is a program of training and research using ongoing longitudinal studies to investigate the effects of dynamic environments on childhood obesity. Obesity and sedentary behavior are increasingly common threats to childhood health, likely reflecting changes to the physical activity opportunities, food environment, and social contexts experienced by children and their families. Characteristics of the built environment have been linked to health behaviors and weight of both children and adults, but the causal nature of the link is not clear. A key challenge is to distinguish between competing explanations for the observed associations: the effect of neighborhoods on individual physical activity and health versus the tendency for active and healthy individuals to select neighborhoods that support their lifestyle. The proposed research has the potential to corroborate or temper the conclusions of previous research on this topic. Whereas previous cross-sectional studies have largely assumed that residential environments are static, the proposed project will use data on residential mobility and dynamic environments to better establish the temporal sequence of purported environmental causes and health effects. Available social context measures will be leveraged to show how built environment associations compare to or interact with those of social context. I will select analytical approaches to take full advantage of these data and to assess competing causal hypotheses. I will analyze data on built environments, social context, physical activity, and weight from two longitudinal studies. The first is the Fragile Families Study of Childhood Wellbeing, a birth cohort study of 4,898 children in large US cities that oversampled single parent families and is currently collecting data at age 9. The second is the Healthy PLACES trial a natural experimental evaluation of a newly built Smart Growth development, with built environment characteristics expected to have beneficial effects on local social networks and physical activity from parent-child pairs. Analyses in these cohorts will address specific hypotheses focusing on the obesogenic effects of the built environment, social context, and their interaction. In addition to the use of longitudinal and natural experimental designs, I will explore a range of analytical strategies selected to test the causal nature of observed associations. In particular, I will examine sequencing, specificity, and selection through stratified analyses, structural equation modeling, latent trajectory analysis, directed acyclic graphs, propensity score matching, and instrumental variable analysis. The proposed research will be complemented by experiential and didactic training in (1) environmental approaches to decrease health disparities, (2) theory and measurement of social context and health, (3) trajectory analysis and lifecourse epidemiology, and (4) study designs and analytical approaches to inform causal inference. This research and training will enable me to launch a program of independent research on the urban built and social environments shaping childhood physical activity and health.        Promising strategies to promote health and prevent childhood obesity include creating new opportunities for physical activity and increasing availability of places to buy healthy foods. However, a focus on structural interventions to prevent childhood obesity may be ineffective if we do not understand how social context shapes the use of these resources. This project will use data collected on individuals over time, along with digital maps of the local environment, to evaluate which neighborhood food and fitness resources are associated with less childhood obesity and better health, and what social circumstances are necessary to see such a benefit.

"Neighborhood Built and Social Environment and Physical Activity and Weight Status    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Overweight and obesity are risk factors for a range of health problems. The prevalence of overweight and obesity has been steadily rising among every segment of the U.S. population. In searching for factors driving the obesity epidemic, the overweight/obesity research is now focused on the balance between diet and physical activity (PA). To address the obesity epidemic, researchers have begun to explore the wider contextual determinants of obesity-related outcomes in hope of identifying new approaches to promoting PA and curbing the rising tide of obesity. This study attempts to contribute to the literature by examining the extent to which neighborhood built environments and socio-demographic contexts influence individual PA and weight status in the United States. To guide this investigation, we employ the social cognitive theory and ecological models and use multiple data sources including the 2000 Census data, GIS-based data from various sources, other place-based aggregate data, and continuous NHANES from 1999 to 2008. We ask: 1) How do contextual built environmental and socio-demographic factors affect objectively and subjectively measured PA and weight status over and above individual characteristics? 2) What are the interacting and mediating effects among contextual built environmental and socio-demographic factors in their impacts on PA and weight status? Are these observed contextual effects partly mediated by individual psychosocial pathways? 3) How do neighborhood factors interact with individual factors to impact PA and weight status? 4) How are the above relationships sensitive to geographic aggregation methods of local neighborhoods? 5) How does spatial dependency among local neighborhoods affect the observed patterns produced from the above analysis? This project goes beyond current research in five ways. First, it examines a wider range of place-based contextual features at both tract- and county-levels. Second, it is a national study covering the entire U.S. Third, it examines both self-reports and objective assessments of PA and weight status. Fourth, it provides a unique opportunity to examine interactions across a number of levels (e.g., individual- neighborhood, neighborhood-county). Fifth, it tests under-studied hypotheses in this literature such as the Modifiable Areal Unit Problem and the spatial dependency issues. This project combines perspectives from sociology, urban planning, geography, and spatial epidemiology; it bridges these disciplines to formulate research that addresses a set of questions vital to research on environmental determinants of PA and weight status.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This study examines how geographic and contextual factors at census tract level and county level are associated with individual-level physical activity and body weight in a national sample. Both the built environments and socio-demographic contexts will be considered.

"Sustainable Solutions to Metal Air Pollution in Disadvantaged Neighborhoods     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project uses a community-based participatory approach to 1) Conduct formative research; 2) Develop an intervention; and 3) Evaluate intervention effects regarding possible health related exposures from metal recycling. Metal recycling is a robust, growing industry in the nation. The benefits of metal recycling over the use of raw materials include energy savings, the conservation of resources, the generation of jobs and the positive impact on trade of significant U.S. exports world-wide. The metal recycling industry in the U.S. generated over $64 billion in 2010. Metal recycling is a growing industry in Houston as well, with over 170 metal recycling facilities in operation. Because of no zoning, many of these sites operate ""next-door"" to neighborhoods that are predominantly poor and communities of color. During the last five years, the City of Houston Department of Health and Human Services (HDHHS) received nearly 200 air quality complaints from residents across the city about recycling activities, with the predominant concern being smoke and dust. To the extent that resources were available, the HDHHS Bureau of Pollution Control and Prevention conducted limited ambient air monitoring at 25 recycling facilities. Our preliminary results suggested possible environmental health risks, but there are insufficient data to draw definitive conclusions about the health risks of emissions from these facilities. A partnership arose among the HDHHS, the University of Texas School of Public Health, Rice University and Air Alliance Houston to work together with neighborhood residents and metal recyclers to address this potentially serious environmental health issue. Also, the HDHHS has been working since January 2013 with the metal recyclers' task force consisting of the Recycling Council of Texas and Gulf Coast and National Institute of Scrap Recycling Industries, Inc. (ISRI), and in response one metal recycler voluntarily upgraded their facility resulting in reduced aerosol emissions. We propose to conduct extensive air monitoring of metals in particulate matter in affected neighborhoods that will, in turn, inform a risk assessment associated with air emissions from metal recyclers in the community. Based on the risk assessment findings and additional community input, we will use a systematic health promotion planning method to implement and evaluate a multilevel, evidence and behavioral science theory-based public health action plan. The public health action plan will include recommendations for best practices for adoption by metal recyclers and targeted educational campaigns for neighborhood residents, metal recyclers and policy makers and we will re-evaluate emissions and risks following implementation of the plan. Affected neighborhood residents and metal recyclers have a critical role to play in this project to insure that we represent the full range of community concerns in designing and conducting the study, interpreting and disseminating study results and developing and evaluating a public health action plan. The ultimate goal of the project is to improve the health of Houston's communities that border metal recycling facilities.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Owing to nearly 200 air quality complaints from residents whose neighborhoods border metal recycling activities (many of which are predominantly poor and largely Hispanic or African- American), the City of Houston Department of Health and Human Services (HDHHS) conducted limited ambient air monitoring with results that are suggestive of possible environmental health risks. In light of these findings and heightened community concerns due to recent media exposure, the HDHHS partnered with the University of Texas School of Public Health, Rice University and Air Alliance Houston to conduct extensive air monitoring in affected neighborhoods that will, in turn, inform a risk assessment associated with air emissions from metal recyclers in the community. Based on our risk assessment findings and with additional community input from two key stakeholder groups (metal recyclers and neighborhood residents), we further propose to implement and evaluate a multi-level public health action plan that will improve the overall health of Houston's communities that border metal recycling facilities.            ",Sustainable Solutions to Metal Air Pollution in Disadvantaged Neighborhoods,8759030,R01ES023563,"['Adoption ', ' Aerosols ', ' Affect ', ' Air ', ' Air Pollution ', ' inspiration ', ' Respiratory Inspiration ', ' Respiratory Aspiration ', ' Inhaling ', ' Inhalation ', ' Breathing ', ' Awareness ', ' Behavioral Sciences ', ' Cities ', ' Color ', ' Communities ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Dust ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Environmental Health Science ', ' Environmental Health ', ' environmental contamination ', ' environmental contaminant ', ' Environmental Pollution ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' Health Promotion ', ' Industry ', ' Institutes ', ' Interview ', ' Leadership ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Light ', ' Metals ', ' Methods ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Newspapers ', ' Professional Positions ', ' Jobs ', ' Occupations ', ' Plants ', ' Play ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Questionnaires ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Rice ', ' Risk ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Savings ', ' Public Health Schools ', ' Smoke ', ' Solutions ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Texas ', ' Training Programs ', ' Translating ', ' United States Department of Health and Human Services ', ' Department of Health and Human Services ', ' United States Dept. of Health and Human Services ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Generations ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' Businesses ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Hispanics ', ' Risk Assessment ', ' Task Forces ', ' Advisory Committees ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Series ', ' Link ', ' Chemicals ', ' Evaluation ', ' Policy Maker ', ' Workshop ', ' Educational workshop ', ' Fostering ', ' Measurement ', ' Recycling ', ' Exposure to ', ' air contaminant ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Pollution ', ' Source ', ' Location ', ' experience ', ' particle ', ' pollutant ', ' Toxicities ', ' Toxic effect ', ' economic impact ', ' Program Announcement ', ' NIH Program Announcements ', ' Prevention ', ' response ', ' theories ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' air monitoring ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Diameter ', ' Caliber ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Monitor ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' informant ', ' Particulate Matter ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' toxic metal ', ' Population ', ' exposure to metal ', ' Metal exposure ', ' gulf coast ', ' public health relevance ', ' intervention effect ', ' longitudinal design ', ' operation ', ' screening ', ' ']",NIEHS,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS HLTH SCI CTR HOUSTON,R01,2014,543016,0.101031348522972
"Assessing the Impact of Clean Heat Policy Intervention in New York City     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This study will investigate the impacts of timely and progressive Clean Heat regulations that have a short implementation cycle ending to be fully executed by 2015. The proposed project will examine the variance in residential exposure to black carbon (BC) before and after implementation and analyze the policy process. BC is produced by any incomplete combustion process and is a surrogate tracer of different combustion sources. In NYC, major sources of BC include space heating and high density vehicle traffic (especially trucks).1,9-19 A significant contributor to the city's current BC emissions are buildings that burn residual oil (No. 4 and No. 6) for heating.14,18-19 Previous research has demonstrated that residual oil represents a significant environmental and public health threat. These environmental hazards are linked to a variety of health problems including cardiovascular disease, respiratory illness and lung cancer. A recent policy measure issued by the New York City Department of Environmental Protection mandates conversion from No. 6 fuel to cleaner burning fuel sources including lower sulfur No. 2 fuel, biodiesel or natural gas. This public health law is intended to address widespread air pollution by reducing fine particulate matter (PM2.5) emissions that produce soot and black carbon in NYC. As NYC is the most populated city in the United States, this new regulation marks one of the largest and most comprehensive pieces of environmental, energy and public health policy in the nation in the past decade.  This study will substantially improve the evidence base for the efficacy of environmental and public health policies. We will measure residential indoor/outdoor air quality prior to heating fuel conversion in the 2013-2014 heating season and one-year post-conversion in the 2014-2015 heating season (Aim 1). We will also use the NYC Clean Heat policy intervention as a case study and identify the contextual and process-level factors involved in the effective passage and implementation of these laws (Aim 2). Together the mixed method approaches in Aims 1 and 2 will yield contextualized results to demonstrate changes in domestic and neighborhood levels of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) associated with BC generated in buildings that burn residual oil (i.e., No. 6), but by legal mandate are obligated to convert to cleaner burning fuel sources before the 2014/2015 heating season. The proposed study will document changes associated with the Clean Heat regulations in a neighborhood context beset by asthma and other adverse health effects linked to BC exposure to address issues related to health disparities. If successful our innovative study design will advance our scientific knowledge about residential exposure changes to BC in the aftermath of this policy intervention and the impact on vulnerable populations. Responsive to NIEHS' ""Strategic Themes,"" the proposed study focuses on exposure research and health, the translation of science to public policy, health disparities, interdisciplinary approaches to environmental health, diversity and the broad dissemination of research findings.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed study capitalizes on a unique and time-sensitive policy intervention that seeks to reduce airborne black carbon (BC) in NYC. Together the mixed method approaches in Aims 1 and 2 will yield contextualized results to demonstrate changes in domestic and neighborhood levels of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) associated with BC generated in buildings that burn residual oil (i.e., No. 6), but by legal mandate are obligated to convert to cleaner burning fuel sources before the 2014/2015 heating season.

"Do Departments of Parks and Recreation Foster or Alleviate Health Disparities?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Because prior research suggests that resource allocation among parks varies by neighborhood SES, we propose to undertake a national longitudinal study of the existence of disparities in park management practices in 25 representative US cities and 200 parks. In order to advance the state of science on the influence of park management practices on physical activity and park use and to shape public policy on health promotion at the population level, we propose an investigation with the following specific aims: 1) To determine whether there are systematic differences in park resources, programming, management practices, and park use depending upon the socioeconomic status of park neighborhoods in a representative sample of American cities, 2) To determine whether changes in resource allocation among parks in these cities are distributed equally among high and low income parks, or whether allocation changes attempt to address health disparities among potential park users. We will also determine whether changes in resource allocation are accompanied by changes in park-based physical activity, and 3) To make recommendations to the Departments of Parks and Recreation in each city that will support greater use of park facilities among populations who may experience health disparities that can be ameliorated by physical activity.  To accomplish the aims of this investigation, we will train a cadre of park professionals and members of community-based organizations that support neighborhood parks to act as ""citizen scientists"" and collect objective data. Engaging these citizen-scientists in the research process is intended to increase local capacity to reliably measure park management practices, park characteristics, park use, and physical activity. Citizen-scientists are an asset that will endure long after the proposed research (if funded) is completed and could form the basis for research in which future interventions to promote physical activity can be rigorously evaluated. We will also interview key stakeholders to assess other factors that may impact local park use.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  We propose to study park management practices in 200 parks in 25 representative US cities in order to determine whether there are differences in park management practices between high and low-income neighborhoods.

"Residential trajectories and adolescent health: results from a randomized trial DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project aims to understand the role of neighborhood residential trajectories for causing adolescent mental health and substance use problems, to inform potential prevention strategies early in life. Since most adulthood substance use and mental disorders originate early in life, it is imperative to focus on childhood exposures. Although evidence links adverse neighborhood contexts to impaired development, most studies are observational and cross sectional, limiting causal inference and policy translation. We propose a rigorous secondary data analysis using data from an experimental study of housing vouchers that may inform neighborhood context as a cause of health problems among low income minority populations: the Moving to Opportunity (MTO) study. MTO allows strong causal inferences, and though it was a promising policy to disrupt the toxic effects of neighborhood poverty, health researchers have had limited access to the data. It is necessary to unpack this expensive, ambitious housing experiment to understand the mechanisms by which non-health policies may promote, or indeed harm, health. We propose new analyses to answer significant questions for the design of rental assistance policy, and for the etiology of neighborhood health effects. We will leverage MTO's experimental design to understand how households select and remain in neighborhoods, how residential trajectories across time are influenced by health, and how these residential trajectories, in turn, influence health. To operationalize high opportunity neighborhoods, we apply a Geography of Opportunity framework - a policy-relevant analytic tool that emphasizes regional context and the continuing significance of social inequality for constraining residential choice, and for influencing residential preferences. We will model the dynamic nature of neighborhoods as well as the spatial, temporal moves of low-income families. To do so, we will construct residential trajectories by merging over 46,000 MTO geocoded address spells with a mosaic of retail, survey, and administrative neighborhood data to operationalize high opportunity neighborhoods across time. We will test for factors that influence household residential trajectories using growth curves and latent class analysis. We will then apply causal mediation methods, including novel semiparametric weight- based techniques, to test whether and when residential trajectories mediate MTO effects on adolescent health, to inform life course timing and mechanisms of neighborhood exposures for health effects. This project builds on a productive ongoing interdisciplinary collaboration, and leverages team expertise in mental health and substance use, neighborhood effects, adolescent development, life course and causal methods. Answers to our research questions may inform residential selection bias, which may, in turn, inform how to design more rigorous observational neighborhood studies. Further, since housing choice vouchers constitute a large portion of federal affordable housing dollars, our results can inform policy, e.g., to tailor housing mobility programs to address client health problems, and help low income families sustain moves to high opportunity areas. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We propose a secondary data analysis of the effects of a housing voucher experiment on adolescent health. Its strong design and analytic techniques will inform the role of neighborhood and residential trajectories for the etiology of mental health and substance use problems, as well as inform the next generation of affordable housing policies, for example, to tailor housing mobility and rental assistance programs to address health needs of low-income youth, and ultimately help low-income families move to and remain in high opportunity neighborhoods.",Residential trajectories and adolescent health: results from a randomized trial,8912528,R03HD080848,"['adolescent girl ', ' Female Adolescents ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Elderly ', ' Alcohol Chemical Class ', ' Alcohols ', ' Dorsum ', ' Back ', ' psychological disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Censuses ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Infant and Child Development ', ' Child Development ', ' Client ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Exhibits ', ' Experimental Designs ', ' Family ', ' Geography ', ' Goals ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Growth ', ' Health ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' Household ', ' Housing ', ' life course ', ' Life Cycle ', ' Life Cycle Stages ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Methods ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Risk Ratio ', ' Relative Odds ', ' Cross-Product Ratio ', ' Odds Ratio ', ' Poverty ', ' Public Housing ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Residential Mobility ', ' Residential Selections ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Selection Bias ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Tobacco ', ' Translations ', ' Weight ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', ' Mediating ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Youth ', ' base ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Adolescent ', ' Link ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' using substances ', ' substance use ', ' AOD use ', ' Alcohol or Other Drugs use ', ' Policies ', ' Inequality ', ' drug use ', ' Drug usage ', ' Collaborations ', ' Exposure to ', ' tool ', ' Nature ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Victimization ', ' Dimensions ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' spelling ', ' preference ', ' experience ', ' transdisciplinary collaboration ', ' interdisciplinary collaboration ', ' Toxicities ', ' Toxic effect ', ' novel ', ' Preventive strategy ', ' Prevention strategy ', ' social inequality ', ' Negotiation ', ' Negotiating ', ' Mediation ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' research study ', ' Modeling ', ' Adolescent Development ', ' boys ', ' voucher ', ' disease causation ', ' causation ', ' Causality ', ' Etiology ', ' Low income ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Randomized ', ' Sum ', ' Observational research ', ' Observation study ', ' Observation research ', ' Observational Study ', ' Characteristics ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' next generation ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' imprint ', ' volunteer ', ' randomized trial ', ' ']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA,R03,2015,74403,0.11673720023941264

"Limited English Proficiency, Health, and Healthcare among Older Immigrants     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Limited English proficiency (LEP) is a unique vulnerability of older immigrants that poses a significant risk to health and healthcare. Given tha social and environmental contexts play a critical role in the lives of persons with LEP, this application investigates how social connectedness and neighborhood/community characteristics (e.g., ethnic density, health service environments in the neighborhood) influence the link between LEP and health/healthcare. We used Korean American elders as the target group. Our selection was based on the fact that they are members of a rapidly expanding LEP population (i.e., Korean is ranked 4th in the languages spoken by LEP individuals in the U.S.) and that they manifest marked disparities in health and healthcare. The project aims to explore the direct and interactive roles of social connectedness and neighborhood characteristics (1) in the relation between LEP and health and (2) in the relation between LEP and healthcare. The negative impact of LEP on health/healthcare is expected to be greater when individuals lack social connections and/or when they live in areas lack ethnically oriented resources and services. The project employs an innovative and synergistic mix of Social Network Analysis (SNA) and Geographic Information Systems (GIS). To capture the heterogeneity of the population, we will use 3 sites that combine to represent a continuum of Korean American population density: New York (high), Texas (intermediate) and Florida (low). Following focus groups with Community Advisory Boards, direct assessments of ethnic communities will be conducted. At each site, a master list of ethnically oriented services (including health services) will be generated, and each identified service will be geo-coded. Subsequently, 900 Korean Americans (aged e 65, 300 at each site) will be surveyed using a probability sampling procedure. In addition to the traditional survey measures, name-generator approaches will be used to explore participants' social network members and places for healthcare. Using SNA, information from the name generators (names and addresses of people and places) will be indexed to represent (1) social connectedness and (2) engagement with health services at the community. Using GIS, the survey data will be linked to a file combining the 2010 Census and the area resource map derived from the direct community assessment. The combined file will include variables such as proportions of Koreans in the neighborhood and general as well as ethnically-oriented area health services. Multi-Level Models (MLM) will be used to explore the research questions and hypotheses. The results will not only enhance our understanding of the mechanisms underlying LEP vulnerability but also identify individual- and community-level factors (both in people and places) that could be used in health planning and interventions.

"PS11-003 Minority AIDS Research Initiative  Project Summary/Abstract The etiology of health disparities involves a complex web of factors that interact to produce detrimental health outcomes for particular segments of society. In the United States, the current landscape of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) continues to be shaped by disparities in case distribution, as African Americans (AA) account for more new HIV cases and HIV related deaths than any other racial/ethnic group. Importantly, there were more new HIV infections (52%) among young AA men who have sex with men (MSM; aged 13-29 years) than any other racial/ethnic-sexual orientation/behavior group. Recent studies have found that geographical and neighborhood environments (with environment broadly understood to encompass both physical and social attributes) are associated with sexual behavior and HIV prevalence and incidence. Although the possible role of geographic and neighborhood contexts in HIV has often been emphasized, rigorous investigations of environmental factors are rare. This is due, in part, to the sensitive nature of residential address information of HIV-infected persons and difficulties in identifying and characterizing the relevant social and physical environments.  The overall aim of the Geographic and Neighborhood Study of HIV (GANSH) is to examine the associations between geospatial and neighborhood environmental characteristics and psychosocial factors and prevalent HIV/STI among AA MSM in the Jackson, MS metropolitan statistical area (Jackson MSA). The proposed study uses a cross-sectional, multi- level design to examine these associations. Non-linear (i.e., a dichotomized outcome variables) relationships between geographic and neighborhood characteristics and measures of HIV/STI status will be examined using multi-level models with a random neighborhood intercept and random covariate effects. Empirical Bayes and Geographic Information Systems (GIS) methods will be used to estimate and map the area-specific relative risk of HIV as well as the spatial distribution of the associations between behavioral and psychosocial factors and HIV/STI status.  To our knowledge, this is the first study to examine the associations between geospatial and neighborhood characteristics and psychosocial factors and prevalent HIV/STI in AA MSM. The proposed research will provide answers to a wide range of questions of public health importance with direct implications for disease prevention. Moreover, results from the proposed study may change the methodological/theoretical concepts of existing HIV/STI interventions and/or prevention research.  Project Narrative HIV/STI research has traditionally focused on individual-level risk factors such as behaviors, and more recently, socio-cultural factors. The conceptual framework for the Geographic and Neighborhood Effects on HIV Study is based on the socio-ecological model, which integrates the complex interaction between individual, relationship, community, and society-level factors and allows for the consideration of factors at multiple levels in an individual's risk for experiencing or increasing HIV/STI risk. Results from this study will provide critical information in the understanding of HIV/STI risk among AA MSM and identification of high-risk areas to target for disease prevention.",PS11-003 Minority AIDS Research Initiative,8784075,U01PS003315,[''],NCHHSTP,"MY BROTHER'S KEEPER, INC.",U01,2015,283629,0.07016804710293452
"Assessing the Impact of Clean Heat Policy Intervention in New York City DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This study will investigate the impacts of timely and progressive Clean Heat regulations that have a short implementation cycle ending to be fully executed by 2015. The proposed project will examine the variance in residential exposure to black carbon (BC) before and after implementation and analyze the policy process. BC is produced by any incomplete combustion process and is a surrogate tracer of different combustion sources. In NYC, major sources of BC include space heating and high density vehicle traffic (especially trucks).1,9-19 A significant contributor to the city's current BC emissions are buildings that burn residual oil (No. 4 and No. 6) for heating.14,18-19 Previous research has demonstrated that residual oil represents a significant environmental and public health threat. These environmental hazards are linked to a variety of health problems including cardiovascular disease, respiratory illness and lung cancer. A recent policy measure issued by the New York City Department of Environmental Protection mandates conversion from No. 6 fuel to cleaner burning fuel sources including lower sulfur No. 2 fuel, biodiesel or natural gas. This public health law is intended to address widespread air pollution by reducing fine particulate matter (PM2.5) emissions that produce soot and black carbon in NYC. As NYC is the most populated city in the United States, this new regulation marks one of the largest and most comprehensive pieces of environmental, energy and public health policy in the nation in the past decade.  This study will substantially improve the evidence base for the efficacy of environmental and public health policies. We will measure residential indoor/outdoor air quality prior to heating fuel conversion in the 2013-2014 heating season and one-year post-conversion in the 2014-2015 heating season (Aim 1). We will also use the NYC Clean Heat policy intervention as a case study and identify the contextual and process-level factors involved in the effective passage and implementation of these laws (Aim 2). Together the mixed method approaches in Aims 1 and 2 will yield contextualized results to demonstrate changes in domestic and neighborhood levels of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) associated with BC generated in buildings that burn residual oil (i.e., No. 6), but by legal mandate are obligated to convert to cleaner burning fuel sources before the 2014/2015 heating season. The proposed study will document changes associated with the Clean Heat regulations in a neighborhood context beset by asthma and other adverse health effects linked to BC exposure to address issues related to health disparities. If successful our innovative study design will advance our scientific knowledge about residential exposure changes to BC in the aftermath of this policy intervention and the impact on vulnerable populations. Responsive to NIEHS' ""Strategic Themes,"" the proposed study focuses on exposure research and health, the translation of science to public policy, health disparities, interdisciplinary approaches to environmental health, diversity and the broad dissemination of research findings. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed study capitalizes on a unique and time-sensitive policy intervention that seeks to reduce airborne black carbon (BC) in NYC. Together the mixed method approaches in Aims 1 and 2 will yield contextualized results to demonstrate changes in domestic and neighborhood levels of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) associated with BC generated in buildings that burn residual oil (i.e., No. 6), but by legal mandate are obligated to convert to cleaner burning fuel sources before the 2014/2015 heating season.

"Reducing Health Disparities in Vulnerable African American Families and Communiti DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Over the next five years, the MSM will continue the CEHD research based on: 1) Its longstanding and passionate commitment to serving underserved families and communities, 2) a research agenda that advances minority health; 3) a track record of educating future minority scientists that will continue this legacy of leadership and 4) a strong push to continue to assist community based organization to become empowered as educated consumers of health information. The institution will pursue its strategic vision that emphasizes a community-centered approach to serving the health needs of underserved communities and a translational research portfolio that fosters community-based solutions to impacting health disparities. The proposed Program aligns with this shared vision of a CBPR model that integrates our intenvoven network of partnerships with academic institutions, civic organizations, government agencies, community-based organizations, schools, prisons, neighborhood clinics, health providers and policy makers. Specifically, (research project #1) is an intervention study that will assess incarcerated women returning from prison and  assess strategies for reintegration with their families and community life (research project #1). The CEHD will also study the neighborhood and parent determinants and consequences of secondhand smoke exposure on African American children through a cross-sectional design (research project #2). A developmental approach (research project #3) will evaluate a community-developed parenting curriculum, which assesses the extent to which quality parenting can reduce the negative impact of poverty on parental mental health and preschool child development and behavioral health. The overall evaluation of the work to be undertaken by the CEHD will document how genuine community engagement and participation in research can facilitate health promotion and disease prevention in African American facilities and communities. The work of the CEHD will be implemented through an Administrative Core, Research Core, Research Education and Training Core, and a Community Engagement Core interfacing with residents from Atlanta Neighborhood Planning Units V, X, Y and Z.  RELEVANCE (See instructions):  The lack of community and consumer involvement in health programs has a negative impact on citizen adoption of public health best practices.

"Sustainable Solutions to Metal Air Pollution in Disadvantaged Neighborhoods DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project uses a community-based participatory approach to 1) Conduct formative research; 2) Develop an intervention; and 3) Evaluate intervention effects regarding possible health related exposures from metal recycling. Metal recycling is a robust, growing industry in the nation. The benefits of metal recycling over the use of raw materials include energy savings, the conservation of resources, the generation of jobs and the positive impact on trade of significant U.S. exports world-wide. The metal recycling industry in the U.S. generated over $64 billion in 2010. Metal recycling is a growing industry in Houston as well, with over 170 metal recycling facilities in operation. Because of no zoning, many of these sites operate ""next-door"" to neighborhoods that are predominantly poor and communities of color. During the last five years, the City of Houston Department of Health and Human Services (HDHHS) received nearly 200 air quality complaints from residents across the city about recycling activities, with the predominant concern being smoke and dust. To the extent that resources were available, the HDHHS Bureau of Pollution Control and Prevention conducted limited ambient air monitoring at 25 recycling facilities. Our preliminary results suggested possible environmental health risks, but there are insufficient data to draw definitive conclusions about the health risks of emissions from these facilities. A partnership arose among the HDHHS, the University of Texas School of Public Health, Rice University and Air Alliance Houston to work together with neighborhood residents and metal recyclers to address this potentially serious environmental health issue. Also, the HDHHS has been working since January 2013 with the metal recyclers' task force consisting of the Recycling Council of Texas and Gulf Coast and National Institute of Scrap Recycling Industries, Inc. (ISRI), and in response one metal recycler voluntarily upgraded their facility resulting in reduced aerosol emissions. We propose to conduct extensive air monitoring of metals in particulate matter in affected neighborhoods that will, in turn, inform a risk assessment associated with air emissions from metal recyclers in the community. Based on the risk assessment findings and additional community input, we will use a systematic health promotion planning method to implement and evaluate a multilevel, evidence and behavioral science theory-based public health action plan. The public health action plan will include recommendations for best practices for adoption by metal recyclers and targeted educational campaigns for neighborhood residents, metal recyclers and policy makers and we will re-evaluate emissions and risks following implementation of the plan. Affected neighborhood residents and metal recyclers have a critical role to play in this project to insure that we represent the full range of community concerns in designing and conducting the study, interpreting and disseminating study results and developing and evaluating a public health action plan. The ultimate goal of the project is to improve the health of Houston's communities that border metal recycling facilities. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Owing to nearly 200 air quality complaints from residents whose neighborhoods border metal recycling activities (many of which are predominantly poor and largely Hispanic or African- American), the City of Houston Department of Health and Human Services (HDHHS) conducted limited ambient air monitoring with results that are suggestive of possible environmental health risks. In light of these findings and heightened community concerns due to recent media exposure, the HDHHS partnered with the University of Texas School of Public Health, Rice University and Air Alliance Houston to conduct extensive air monitoring in affected neighborhoods that will, in turn, inform a risk assessment associated with air emissions from metal recyclers in the community. Based on our risk assessment findings and with additional community input from two key stakeholder groups (metal recyclers and neighborhood residents), we further propose to implement and evaluate a multi-level public health action plan that will improve the overall health of Houston's communities that border metal recycling facilities.",Sustainable Solutions to Metal Air Pollution in Disadvantaged Neighborhoods,8910702,R01ES023563,"['Adoption ', ' Aerosols ', ' Affect ', ' Air ', ' Air Pollution ', ' inspiration ', ' Respiratory Inspiration ', ' Respiratory Aspiration ', ' Inhaling ', ' Inhalation ', ' Breathing ', ' Awareness ', ' Behavioral Sciences ', ' Cities ', ' Color ', ' Communities ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Dust ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Environmental Health Science ', ' Environmental Health ', ' environmental contamination ', ' environmental contaminant ', ' Environmental Pollution ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' Health Promotion ', ' Industry ', ' Institutes ', ' Interview ', ' Leadership ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Light ', ' Metals ', ' Methods ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Newspapers ', ' Professional Positions ', ' Jobs ', ' Occupations ', ' Plants ', ' Play ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Questionnaires ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Rice ', ' Risk ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Savings ', ' Public Health Schools ', ' Smoke ', ' Solutions ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Texas ', ' Training Programs ', ' Translating ', ' United States Department of Health and Human Services ', ' Department of Health and Human Services ', ' United States Dept. of Health and Human Services ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Generations ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' Businesses ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Hispanics ', ' Risk Assessment ', ' Task Forces ', ' Advisory Committees ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Series ', ' Link ', ' Chemicals ', ' Evaluation ', ' Policy Maker ', ' Workshop ', ' Educational workshop ', ' Fostering ', ' Measurement ', ' Recycling ', ' Exposure to ', ' air contaminant ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Pollution ', ' Source ', ' Location ', ' experience ', ' particle ', ' pollutant ', ' Toxicities ', ' Toxic effect ', ' economic impact ', ' Program Announcement ', ' NIH Program Announcements ', ' Prevention ', ' response ', ' theories ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' air monitoring ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Diameter ', ' Caliber ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Monitor ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' informant ', ' Particulate Matter ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' toxic metal ', ' Population ', ' exposure to metal ', ' Metal exposure ', ' gulf coast ', ' intervention effect ', ' longitudinal design ', ' operation ', ' screening ', ' ']",NIEHS,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS HLTH SCI CTR HOUSTON,R01,2015,512494,0.101031348522972
"Residential Environment and Preterm Delivery among African American Women  7. Project Summary/Abstract Large, persistent racial disparities in preterm delivery (PTD) exist, with African Americans (AAs) having higher rates than Non-Hispanic whites. Since traditional risk factors do not fully account for this disparity, other explanations must be identified. Residential environment may be an important risk factor for adverse birth outcomes, given the strikingly different neighborhoods in which AA and white women reside, and the resulting racial disparity in exposures to social determinants of health. Some aspects of residential environment have been linked to adverse birth outcomes, including PTD, however the existing studies have only defined neighborhood exposures using aggregate data from the US Census, which is unable to identify aspects of residential environment may be detrimental. Recent evidence suggests that subjective assessments of neighborhoods from residents may be able to provide unique contextual information not available in Census data, including social environment. Therefore, the current study seeks to examine the links between objective and perceived physical and social residential environment and PTD among AA women from the Life-course Influences on Fetal Environments (LIFE) study, with the following specific aims: (1) to examine measurement of subjective neighborhood constructs, including methodological properties of subjective assessments, (2) to determine the associations between perceived social and physical environment and prevalence of PTD, and (3) to examine the links between objective physical environment and PTD using multilevel modeling. This research will extend the current knowledge of neighborhood effects on PTD in several critical ways: (1) by comparing objective and subjective measures of residential environment, (2) by determining whether objective neighborhood measures affect perceptions of neighborhood, and (3) by conducting research in a cohort comprised entirely of AA women, a group known to suffer disproportionately from PTD. If aspects of the physical and social residential environment are associated with PTD among AAs, this knowledge can inform future intervention studies as well as policy efforts focused on eliminating adverse features of neighborhoods. The proposed fellowship will provide the rigorous training necessary for the applicant to become an independent investigator who will devote her career to identifying causes of the enduring racial disparities in PTD, with a particular focus on neighborhoods. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The persistent racial disparities in preterm delivery are not explained by traditional individual- level risk factors. Residential social and physical environmen may be important in explaining the disproportionate burden of PTD experienced by African American women. Using data from the Life-course Influences on Fetal Environments Study, the proposed fellowship will develop an outstanding postdoctoral research fellow into an independent social epidemiologist and extend the current knowledge of neighborhoods and preterm delivery among African American women.             ",Residential Environment and Preterm Delivery among African American Women,8994667,F32HD080338,"['Accounting ', ' Affect ', ' Parturition ', ' Birth ', ' Censuses ', ' Aggregated Data ', ' Data Aggregation ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' Environment ', ' Faculty ', ' Fellowship ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Level of Health ', ' Health Status ', ' interventions research ', ' interventional study ', ' interventional research ', ' intervention research ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' life course ', ' Life Cycle ', ' Life Cycle Stages ', ' Methods ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Perception ', ' Poverty ', ' psychosocial variables ', ' Psychosocial Factor ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Risk Factors ', ' socioenvironment ', ' social context ', ' social climate ', ' Social Environment ', ' Stress ', ' Woman ', ' Measures ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' conference ', ' symposium ', ' Mediating ', ' preterm delivery ', ' premature delivery ', ' premature childbirth ', ' Preterm Birth ', ' Premature Birth ', ' career ', ' Perinatal ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Workshop ', ' Educational workshop ', ' Policies ', ' Measurement ', ' Exposure to ', ' tool ', ' Knowledge ', ' fetal ', ' meetings ', ' Physical environment ', ' experience ', ' cohort ', ' skills ', ' Negotiation ', ' Negotiating ', ' Mediation ', ' social ', ' multilevel modeling ', ' multilevel model ', ' methods to study multiple-level influences ', ' multilevel analysis ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' geospatial information system ', ' Geographic Information Systems ', ' LOINC Axis 2 Property ', ' Property ', ' Data ', ' Epidemiologist ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' Behavioral ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' Prevalence ', ' public health relevance ', ' social health determinants ', ' ']",NICHD,WAYNE STATE UNIVERSITY,F32,2015,20307,0.07732367969423407
"Linking dynamic environments with childhood obesity DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Proposed is a program of training and research using ongoing longitudinal studies to investigate the effects of dynamic environments on childhood obesity. Obesity and sedentary behavior are increasingly common threats to childhood health, likely reflecting changes to the physical activity opportunities, food environment, and social contexts experienced by children and their families. Characteristics of the built environment have been linked to health behaviors and weight of both children and adults, but the causal nature of the link is not clear. A key challenge is to distinguish between competing explanations for the observed associations: the effect of neighborhoods on individual physical activity and health versus the tendency for active and healthy individuals to select neighborhoods that support their lifestyle. The proposed research has the potential to corroborate or temper the conclusions of previous research on this topic. Whereas previous cross-sectional studies have largely assumed that residential environments are static, the proposed project will use data on residential mobility and dynamic environments to better establish the temporal sequence of purported environmental causes and health effects. Available social context measures will be leveraged to show how built environment associations compare to or interact with those of social context. I will select analytical approaches to take full advantage of these data and to assess competing causal hypotheses. I will analyze data on built environments, social context, physical activity, and weight from two longitudinal studies. The first is the Fragile Families Study of Childhood Wellbeing, a birth cohort study of 4,898 children in large US cities that oversampled single parent families and is currently collecting data at age 9. The second is the Healthy PLACES trial a natural experimental evaluation of a newly built Smart Growth development, with built environment characteristics expected to have beneficial effects on local social networks and physical activity from parent-child pairs. Analyses in these cohorts will address specific hypotheses focusing on the obesogenic effects of the built environment, social context, and their interaction. In addition to the use of longitudinal and natural experimental designs, I will explore a range of analytical strategies selected to test the causal nature of observed associations. In particular, I will examine sequencing, specificity, and selection through stratified analyses, structural equation modeling, latent trajectory analysis, directed acyclic graphs, propensity score matching, and instrumental variable analysis. The proposed research will be complemented by experiential and didactic training in (1) environmental approaches to decrease health disparities, (2) theory and measurement of social context and health, (3) trajectory analysis and lifecourse epidemiology, and (4) study designs and analytical approaches to inform causal inference. This research and training will enable me to launch a program of independent research on the urban built and social environments shaping childhood physical activity and health. Promising strategies to promote health and prevent childhood obesity include creating new opportunities for physical activity and increasing availability of places to buy healthy foods. However, a focus on structural interventions to prevent childhood obesity may be ineffective if we do not understand how social context shapes the use of these resources. This project will use data collected on individuals over time, along with digital maps of the local environment, to evaluate which neighborhood food and fitness resources are associated with less childhood obesity and better health, and what social circumstances are necessary to see such a benefit.",Linking dynamic environments with childhood obesity,8902866,K01HD067390,"['adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Age ', ' Behavior ', ' Parturition ', ' Birth ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Cities ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Communities ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Complement ', ' Control Groups ', ' Disease Frequency Surveys ', ' Cross-Sectional Survey ', ' Cross-Sectional Analyses ', ' Cross Sectional Analysis ', ' Cross-Sectional Studies ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Collection ', ' Data Sources ', ' Elements ', ' Environment ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' Exhibits ', ' Experimental Designs ', ' Family ', ' Food ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Growth ', ' Growth and Development ', ' Growth and Development function ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' Household ', ' Hybrids ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Income ', ' life course ', ' Life Cycle ', ' Life Cycle Stages ', ' Lifestyle ', ' Life Style ', ' Literature ', ' long-term study ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' Maps ', ' Mentorship ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Obesity ', ' Parents ', ' Perception ', ' Research ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Research Design ', ' Residential Mobility ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Single-Parent Family ', ' socioenvironment ', ' social context ', ' social climate ', ' Social Environment ', ' social support network ', ' Social support ', ' Specificity ', ' Stress ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Training Programs ', ' Transportation ', ' Weight ', ' Child Support ', ' Measures ', ' conference ', ' symposium ', ' Schedule ', ' Social Network ', ' base ', ' density ', ' improved ', ' Family Study ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' sedentary ', ' Link ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Physical activity ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' Individual ', ' Workshop ', ' Educational workshop ', ' Measurement ', ' Sample Size ', ' healthy food ', ' Health Food ', ' Genetic ', ' Shapes ', ' Nature ', ' programs ', ' Adopted ', ' Source ', ' Pattern ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' Over weight ', ' Overweight ', ' physical health ', ' physical conditioning ', ' Equation ', ' Physical environment ', ' experience ', ' cohort ', ' Graph ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' research study ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' geospatial information system ', ' Geographic Information Systems ', ' Modeling ', ' theories ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Low income ', ' Address ', ' fitness ', ' Data ', ' dietary pattern ', ' Dietary Practices ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Randomized ', ' Research Training ', ' Ancillary Study ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' obese children ', ' childhood obesity ', ' obesity in children ', ' digital ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' prospective ', ' food environment ', ' ']",NICHD,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,K01,2015,133309,0.019703555993309172
"Demographic Vulnerability, Neighborhood Pollution, and Racial Health Disparities DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposed project focuses on the ways in which social and economic conditions at the individual-, family-, and neighborhood-levels interact with neighborhood concentrations of environmental pollution to affect racial disparities in health and mortality. We will develop comprehensive measures of neighborhood pollution using data from the Environmental Protection Agency and several other sources, and attach these neighborhood- pollution estimates, along with information on other neighborhood characteristics, to longitudinal data for a diverse group of individuals in the Panel Study of Income Dynamics. The resulting multilevel data will provide a unique opportunity to assess long-term effects of neighborhood pollution on mortality, self-rated health, physical limitations, and diagnoses of cancer, cardiovascular disease, asthma, and other specific medical conditions for a national sample of adults. We will assess the efficacy of these data by comparing them to estimates of health-outcome prevalence and cross-sectional associations between neighborhood pollution and health derived from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. Analyses of our unique longitudinal, multilevel data will focus on the extent to which vulnerability to the health effects of neighborhood pollution is heightened by exposure to stressful conditions in the household or economic and social distress in the neighborhood of residence. Central to the project is the assessment of the role of group differences in exposure to neighborhood pollution, and differences in susceptibility to the effects of pollution, in explaining persistent racial and ethnic differences in health. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The project focuses directly on the effects of neighborhood pollution on several health outcomes. Identifying how the health effects of exposure to pollution vary across individual circumstances and neighborhood context has potentially important public health implications, as does understanding the role of pollution exposure in creating persistent racial and ethnic disparities in health.","Demographic Vulnerability, Neighborhood Pollution, and Racial Health Disparities",8916170,R01HD078501,"['Accounting ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Affect ', ' Air Pollution ', ' Bronchial Asthma ', ' Asthma ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' Censuses ', ' Disease Frequency Surveys ', ' Cross-Sectional Survey ', ' Cross-Sectional Analyses ', ' Cross Sectional Analysis ', ' Cross-Sectional Studies ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Economical Conditions ', ' Economic Conditions ', ' Economics ', ' Employment ', ' environmental contamination ', ' environmental contaminant ', ' Environmental Pollution ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Family ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Household ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Income ', ' Longterm Effects ', ' Long-Term Effects ', ' Mortality ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Research ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Societal Conditions ', ' Social Conditions ', ' Stress ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Environmental Protection Agency ', ' United States Environmental Protection Agency ', ' Measures ', ' stress', ' reaction ', ' stress response ', ' reaction', ' crisis ', ' biological adaptation to stress ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' racial/ethnic difference ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' Medical ', ' Link ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Predisposition ', ' Distress ', ' residence ', ' Individual ', ' Inequality ', ' Exposure to ', ' National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey ', ' NHANES ', ' Life ', ' Pollution ', ' Source ', ' Location ', ' physical health ', ' physical conditioning ', ' Best Practice Analysis ', ' Benchmarking ', ' experience ', ' stressor ', ' member ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' race differences ', ' racial difference ', ' General Public ', ' General Population ', ' social ', ' land use ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' cancer diagnosis ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Data ', ' Characteristics ', ' Outcome ', ' Prevalence ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' longitudinal analysis ', ' ']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2015,304240,0.21147943888212856
"Neighborhood Change: Impact on Sleep and Obesity-Related Health Disparities     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Individuals living in socioeconomically disadvantaged neighborhoods have disproportionately high rates of obesity and obesity-related morbidity, including increased risk for physical role limitations and cardiovascular diseases (CVD). Studies of potential mechanisms linking neighborhood disadvantage with health outcomes have primarily focused on daytime health behaviors, including diet or physical activity. However, sleep is a critical health behavior that is associated with neighborhood disadvantage, and may play a causal role in explaining the links between neighborhood disadvantage and health. However, the extant research on neighborhood disadvantage and sleep is based exclusively on cross-sectional data, using self-reports of sleep and neighborhood characteristics. Building on the existing research infrastructure developed by our team's previously funded, ongoing studies, we have a unique and important opportunity to study whether changes in the built and social environment, stimulated by substantial economic investment improves sleep, and in turn, reduces obesity-related health disparities. The study cohort includes a randomly selected cohort of 1100 low- income, African American adults, from two urban neighborhoods, one of which is undergoing a dramatic revitalization over the next 5 years (i.e., the intervention neighborhood), and the other (the sociodemographically-matched control neighborhood) is not undergoing any such changes. We will add longitudinal assessments of sleep using actigraphy, self-reports, and in a subsample of 300, objective, in-home monitoring of obstructive sleep apnea, to provide a rich characterization of sleep profiles before, during, and, after neighborhood changes. Evidence gained from this study would have substantial scientific and policy implications for identifying novel individual-level and neighborhood level factors that contribute to striking and pervasive racial and socioeconomic disparities in health.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Individuals living in socioeconomically disadvantaged neighborhoods have significantly higher rates of obesity and obesity-related health problems, including physical role limitations and cardiovascular diseases (CVD). Sleep is a critical health behavior that is associated with neighborhood disadvantage and health consequences. Therefore, sleep may serve as an important pathway linking neighborhood disadvantage with obesity and physical role limitations. Our study represents a unique opportunity to evaluate whether improvements in neighborhood conditions, spurred by substantial economic revitalization, improves sleep and in turn, mitigates obesity-related health disparities in a high-risk adult population. Findings from this longitudinal study would provide a stronger test of the causal relationships between neighborhood disadvantage, sleep, and health.                ",Neighborhood Change: Impact on Sleep and Obesity-Related Health Disparities,8817924,R01HL122460,"['adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Affect ', ' Behavior ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' Systematics ', ' Classification ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Communities ', ' Control Groups ', ' Crime ', ' dietary ', ' Diet ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Economics ', ' Esthetics ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' Investments ', ' Literature ', ' long-term study ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Mortality ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Obesity ', ' Perception ', ' Play ', ' Public Housing ', ' Research ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Research Design ', ' Risk ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Safety ', ' Sleep ', ' Sleep disturbances ', ' socioenvironment ', ' social context ', ' social climate ', ' Social Environment ', ' Stress ', ' Strikes ', ' Employee Strikes ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Measures ', ' Relative ', ' Relative (related person) ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' Businesses ', ' Mediating ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Solid ', ' Link ', ' Physical activity ', ' Individual ', ' Populations at Risk ', ' Policies ', ' Funding ', ' Staging ', ' Life ', ' Home ', ' Home environment ', ' Syndrome, Sleep Apnea, Obstructive ', ' Obstructive Sleep Apnea ', ' Supermarket ', ' Services ', ' experience ', ' cohesion ', ' cohort ', ' novel ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' social ', ' sleep problem ', ' Sleep Disorders ', ' Modeling ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' actigraphy ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Low income ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Data ', ' Measurable ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Strategic Planning ', ' Monitor ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomic ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio economic ', ' socioeconomics ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Natural experiment ', ' community safety ', ' neighborhood safety ', ' high risk ', ' public health relevance ', ' group intervention ', ' policy implication ', ' Healthy People 2020 ', ' screening ', ' ']",NHLBI,RAND CORPORATION,R01,2015,869128,0.14098618614639608
"Neighborhood Socioeconomic Disadvantage and Medicare's 30-Day Rehospitalization Policy: Eliminating Rehospitalization Disparities by Informing Policy Design and Implementation ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Thirty-day re-hospitalizations disproportionately impact African American patients and those from socioeconomically disadvantaged neighborhoods. Hospitals that primarily serve disadvantaged populations bear a disproportionate burden of Medicare's hospital-based financial re-hospitalization penalties (mandated by S. 3025, Affordable Care Act). As these penalties continue to increase in coming years, penalized hospitals have stated that they will need to cut services to maintain financial solvency, which may further worsen disparities. This may be a potential unintended negative consequence of Medicare's policy decision to not adjust for socioeconomic factors in the re-hospitalization metrics to which the penalties are tied. At this decision's core is a debate on whether observed disparities result from confounding by cluster (i.e., disadvantaged populations primarily receiving care from 'bad' hospitals) or whether socioeconomic disadvantage outside the hospital has a greater influence on re-hospitalization than is currently recognized by Medicare. A statistical decomposition of the within- and between- hospital effects is needed to help disentangle whether the hospital or non-hospital socioeconomics play the greater role in re-hospitalization, but until recently few national-scale indictors of disadvantage were available for this purpose. (Individual-level indicators of disadvantage are neither widely available nor reliabl enough for either resolving this debate or for use in metric adjustment.) The Area Deprivation Index (ADI) is a validated measure of US disadvantage, based upon similar measures employed abroad for health policy development. The ADI uses US Census poverty, education, and housing and employment indicators to characterize regions, such as neighborhoods. Recently, we demonstrated that living in a severely disadvantaged US neighborhood (per a year 2000 Census-based ADI) predicts re-hospitalization as powerfully as the presence of illnesses, such as chronic pulmonary disease. However, to answer the critical policy debate above and to understand if the ADI is suitable for use as a metric adjuster, the ADI must be updated to the 2010 Census, its geographic stability (i.e., how the distribution of disadvantaged US neighborhoods has changed since 2000) and association consistency (i.e., whether the association of neighborhood disadvantage and re-hospitalization remains in 2010) determined, within- and between-hospital effects assessed (i.e., informing the hospital vs. neighborhood socioeconomics debate), and resilient hospitals (i.e., hospitals which primarily serve highly disadvantaged neighborhoods yet have lower than expected re-hospitalization rates) studied in comparison to less-resilient/non-resilient hospitals, especially in terms of patient, caregiver and clinician perspectives on the underlying reasons for this resilience. The potential policy impact o metric adjustment must also be understood. We propose to accomplish all of these steps, with an overarching goal of eliminating re-hospitalization disparities by informing policy and practice. This proposed project has the potential to immediately change re-hospitalization policy and inform metric revision.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Thirty-day re-hospitalizations disproportionately impact African American patients and those from socioeconomically disadvantaged neighborhoods; hospitals that primarily serve disadvantaged populations bear a disproportionate burden of the financial re-hospitalization penalties mandated by Section 3025 of the Affordable Care Act. As these penalties continue to increase in coming years, penalized hospitals have stated that they will need to cut services to maintain financial solvency, which may further worsen disparities--a potential unintended negative consequence of Medicare's policy decision to not adjust for socioeconomic factors in the re-hospitalization metrics to which the penalties are tied. To inform Medicare policy design and implementation, this proposal examines a novel method by which such an adjustment could be achieved, evaluates its suitability as an adjustment metric, and assesses the potential implications of adjustment.                ",Neighborhood Socioeconomic Disadvantage and Medicare's 30-Day Rehospitalization Policy: Eliminating Rehospitalization Disparities by Informing Policy Design and Implementation,8996354,R01MD010243,"['Affect ', ' bear ', ' Ursidae ', ' Bears ', ' Ursidae Family ', ' Censuses ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Employment ', ' Food ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' health insurance for disabled ', ' Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Disabled Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Aged and Disabled, Title 18 ', ' Medicare ', ' healthcare policy ', ' health care policy ', ' Health Policy ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Hospitals ', ' Housing ', ' indexing ', ' Internal Medicine ', ' pulmonary ', ' Lung Respiratory System ', ' Lung ', ' lung disorder ', ' Respiratory System Disorder ', ' Respiratory System Disease ', ' Respiratory Disease ', ' Pulmonary Disorder ', ' Pulmonary Diseases ', ' Lung diseases ', ' Methods ', ' Theoretic Models ', ' Theoretical model ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Patients ', ' Perception ', ' Play ', ' Poverty ', ' Risk ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Socioeconomic Factors ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Care Givers ', ' Caregivers ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Chronic ', ' Link ', ' Individual ', ' Policy Developments ', ' Policies ', ' tool ', ' Life ', ' Services ', ' novel ', ' payment ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Sampling ', ' deprivation ', ' Address ', ' Qualitative Methods ', ' Data ', ' Update ', ' Characteristics ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomic ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio economic ', ' socioeconomics ', ' cost ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' resilience ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' therapy design ', ' public health relevance ', ' neighborhood association ', ' ']",NIMHD,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,R01,2015,531525,0.0728301558436926
"Developing Neighborhood Archetypes for Understanding Disparities in Cancer DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Disparities in cancer survival continue to persist by race/ethnicity, socioeconomic status (SES) and nativity. Neighborhood factors are critical pathways through which disparities are shaped and perpetuated. However, the literature has shown mixed results and neighborhood-based interventions have had limited success. To advance research on neighborhoods and health, new approaches need to reflect the fact that neighborhood effects on health arise through complex and dynamic processes, underscoring the importance of studying not only the individual effects of neighborhood features on health outcomes, but also their synergistic effects. A promising approach is to encompass multiple dimensions within a single classification system, archetypes, that capture meaningful distinctions across neighborhoods (e.g., Low SES, rural; Poor, urban minority; Middle-class suburban/exurban families). The archetype approach is an efficient way to maximally integrate multiple sources of available information on neighborhood characteristics and has the potential to identify improved opportunities for intervening and reducing health disparities. Leveraging a comprehensive database of small- area level data on social and built neighborhood environments and applying novel statistical approaches, this application proposes to develop neighborhood archetypes around two time periods, 2000 and 2010, for the large, diverse state of California. The central hypotheses are that 1) multiple neighborhood factors can be combined together to form neighborhood archetypes; and 2) that cancer mortality among breast and prostate cancer patients will vary by these neighborhood archetypes, and these associations will vary by race/ethnicity and nativity. The specific aims of this study are to: 1) Investigate the utiity of the archetypes approach to characterize distinct neighborhoods across California. Specifically, we will extend to the census block group level previously developed census tract neighborhood archetypes using confirmatory latent class analysis (LCA). We will also expand, with additional built and social environment features, prior neighborhood archetypes using exploratory LCA. 2) Examine the associations between neighborhood archetypes and survival among a population-based, racially/ethnically diverse set of breast and prostate cancer patients. Specifically, we will test whether neighborhood archetypes are associated with all cause and cancer- specific mortality and whether this association is moderated by race/ethnicity. We will also test whether nativity moderates the neighborhood archetype associations among Hispanics and Asian Americans. The resulting neighborhood archetypes will provide an innovative resource for future research. Applying the archetypes to investigate breast and prostate cancer survival among California's diverse population, this research will yield insights into how neighborhood characteristics work synergistically with each other and interact with individual characteristics to influence health. This research has the potential to contribute to a broader, more fundamental understanding of place effects on health, with applications to both population health and health disparities research. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Increasingly, neighborhood characteristics (e.g., food environment, socioeconomic status, walkability) are being studied to better understand how they influence health; however, capturing these complex and dynamic features that are likely to interact in shaping health is challenging. The proposed research is relevant to public health because it will develop neighborhood archetypes that will account for physical and social characteristics of the environment, and test its association with breast and prostate cancer mortality to identify which features are health promoting or detrimental to survival among a racially/ethnically diverse, population-based sample of African American, Asian/Pacific Islander, Hispanic and non-Hispanic white cancer patients.

"Social Disparities in NICU Care ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Racial/ethnic disparities in the quality of care provided in neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) to very low- birth-weight (VLBW; 1500g) result directly in avoidable death and morbidity. National health policy recommendations underscore that a comprehensive understanding of the multi-level factors that influence NICU quality, including mother and infant clinical, hospital, sociodemographic, and neighborhood factors, is needed to re- duce disparities. To date, research examining disparities of NICU quality suffers from considerable limitations. First, sociodemographic and neighborhood factors are rarely available for studies of NICU quality so their in- dependent and joint contributions are not well understood. Second, a lack of multi-level adjustment under- mines the validity of comparative assessments of quality by penalizing NICUs that care for vulnerable populations. Third, studies of neighborhood factors have narrowly focused on mortality, yet the majority of infants survive their birth hospitalization. To address these limitations and significantly advance the understanding of disparities in NICU quality, we will undertake a comprehensive appraisal of the multi-level factors associated with NICU quality; promote fairer comparisons by making sociodemographic and neighborhood influences explicit; and assess key areas of quality beyond mortality, including processes and outcomes of care that modulate long-term neu- rodevelopmental outcomes. Innovative methods include leveraging our vanguard efforts in developing and linking unique multi-level data sources to provide comprehensive assessments of NICU quality with unprecedented granularity, assessing NICU quality via key individual and composite measures, and using a mixed-methods approach to pro- vide unique insights into the mechanisms by which sociodemographic and neighborhood factors optimize or degrade NICU quality. This study is designed to achieve 3 specific aims: 1) Test the association of multi-level risk factors with NICU quality, 2) Evaluate the effect of multi-level risk adjustment on comparative ratings of NICU quality; and 3) Understand the drivers of disparities in NICU quality. An exceptional strength of our proposal is our ability to leverage the unique infrastructure of the California Per- inatal Quality Care Collaborative and its national counterpar the Vermont Oxford Network. Building on our pri- or work in linking complimentary high-quality clinical, administrative, and survey-based data sets containing multi-level factors, we will study  large population-scale sample of >30,000 VLBW infants in >130 NICUs in California between 2008-16. Results of this proposal are expected to have an immediate positive impact be- because they are designed to identify pragmatic areas where NICUs and communities can improve.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Unequal treatment may contribute to the differences in outcomes of vulnerable premature babies born to minorities or the poor.

"PS11-003 Minority AIDS Research Initiative Project Summary/Abstract The etiology of health disparities involves a complex web of factors that interact to produce detrimental health outcomes for particular segments of society. In the United States, the current landscape of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) continues to be shaped by disparities in case distribution, as African Americans (AA) account for more new HIV cases and HIV related deaths than any other racial/ethnic group. Importantly, there were more new HIV infections (52%) among young AA men who have sex with men (MSM; aged 13-29 years) than any other racial/ethnic-sexual orientation/behavior group. Recent studies have found that geographical and neighborhood environments (with environment broadly understood to encompass both physical and social attributes) are associated with sexual behavior and HIV prevalence and incidence. Although the possible role of geographic and neighborhood contexts in HIV has often been emphasized, rigorous investigations of environmental factors are rare. This is due, in part, to the sensitive nature of residential address information of HIV-infected persons and difficulties in identifying and characterizing the relevant social and physical environments.  The overall aim of the Geographic and Neighborhood Study of HIV (GANSH) is to examine the associations between geospatial and neighborhood environmental characteristics and psychosocial factors and prevalent HIV/STI among AA MSM in the Jackson, MS metropolitan statistical area (Jackson MSA). The proposed study uses a cross-sectional, multi- level design to examine these associations. Non-linear (i.e., a dichotomized outcome variables) relationships between geographic and neighborhood characteristics and measures of HIV/STI status will be examined using multi-level models with a random neighborhood intercept and random covariate effects. Empirical Bayes and Geographic Information Systems (GIS) methods will be used to estimate and map the area-specific relative risk of HIV as well as the spatial distribution of the associations between behavioral and psychosocial factors and HIV/STI status.  To our knowledge, this is the first study to examine the associations between geospatial and neighborhood characteristics and psychosocial factors and prevalent HIV/STI in AA MSM. The proposed research will provide answers to a wide range of questions of public health importance with direct implications for disease prevention. Moreover, results from the proposed study may change the methodological/theoretical concepts of existing HIV/STI interventions and/or prevention research. Project Narrative HIV/STI research has traditionally focused on individual-level risk factors such as behaviors, and more recently, socio-cultural factors. The conceptual framework for the Geographic and Neighborhood Effects on HIV Study is based on the socio-ecological model, which integrates the complex interaction between individual, relationship, community, and society-level factors and allows for the consideration of factors at multiple levels in an individual's risk for experiencing or increasing HIV/STI risk. Results from this study will provide critical information in the understanding of HIV/STI risk among AA MSM and identification of high-risk areas to target for disease prevention.",PS11-003 Minority AIDS Research Initiative,9209889,U01PS003315,[''],NCHHSTP,"MY BROTHER'S KEEPER, INC.",U01,2016,65655,0.07016804710293452

"Demographic Vulnerability, Neighborhood Pollution, and Racial Health Disparities DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposed project focuses on the ways in which social and economic conditions at the individual-, family-, and neighborhood-levels interact with neighborhood concentrations of environmental pollution to affect racial disparities in health and mortality. We will develop comprehensive measures of neighborhood pollution using data from the Environmental Protection Agency and several other sources, and attach these neighborhood- pollution estimates, along with information on other neighborhood characteristics, to longitudinal data for a diverse group of individuals in the Panel Study of Income Dynamics. The resulting multilevel data will provide a unique opportunity to assess long-term effects of neighborhood pollution on mortality, self-rated health, physical limitations, and diagnoses of cancer, cardiovascular disease, asthma, and other specific medical conditions for a national sample of adults. We will assess the efficacy of these data by comparing them to estimates of health-outcome prevalence and cross-sectional associations between neighborhood pollution and health derived from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. Analyses of our unique longitudinal, multilevel data will focus on the extent to which vulnerability to the health effects of neighborhood pollution is heightened by exposure to stressful conditions in the household or economic and social distress in the neighborhood of residence. Central to the project is the assessment of the role of group differences in exposure to neighborhood pollution, and differences in susceptibility to the effects of pollution, in explaining persistent racial and ethnic differences in health. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The project focuses directly on the effects of neighborhood pollution on several health outcomes. Identifying how the health effects of exposure to pollution vary across individual circumstances and neighborhood context has potentially important public health implications, as does understanding the role of pollution exposure in creating persistent racial and ethnic disparities in health.","Demographic Vulnerability, Neighborhood Pollution, and Racial Health Disparities",9085325,R01HD078501,"['Accounting ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Affect ', ' Air Pollution ', ' Bronchial Asthma ', ' Asthma ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' Censuses ', ' Disease Frequency Surveys ', ' Cross-Sectional Survey ', ' Cross-Sectional Analyses ', ' Cross Sectional Analysis ', ' Cross-Sectional Studies ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Economical Conditions ', ' Economic Conditions ', ' Economics ', ' Employment ', ' environmental contamination ', ' environmental contaminant ', ' Environmental Pollution ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Family ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Household ', ' Longterm Effects ', ' Long-Term Effects ', ' mortality ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Public Health ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Research ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Societal Conditions ', ' Social Conditions ', ' Stress ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' United States Environmental Protection Agency ', ' Environmental Protection Agency ', ' Measures ', ' biological adaptation to stress ', ' stress', ' reaction ', ' stress response ', ' reaction', ' crisis ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' Medical ', ' Link ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Predisposition ', ' Distress ', ' residential site ', ' residence ', ' Individual ', ' Inequality ', ' Exposure to ', ' National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey ', ' NHANES ', ' Life ', ' Pollution ', ' Source ', ' Location ', ' physical health ', ' physical conditioning ', ' Best Practice Analysis ', ' Benchmarking ', ' experience ', ' stressor ', ' member ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' race differences ', ' racial difference ', ' ethnicity difference ', ' ethnic difference ', ' General Public ', ' General Population ', ' social ', ' land use ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' cancer diagnosis ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Data ', ' Characteristics ', ' Outcome ', ' Prevalence ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' longitudinal analysis ', ' racial health disparity ', ' racial disparities in health ', ' panel study of income dynamics ', ' neighborhood disadvantage ', ' health difference ', ' differences in health ', ' ']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2016,308076,0.21147943888212856
"Social factors influencing pregnancy outcome disparities ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Latina paradox is robust, but not uniformly protective against adverse pregnancy outcomes. Latinas are at risk for poor birth outcomes like inappropriate weight gain, pregnancy-induced hypertension / eclampsia, and inappropriate gestational weight gain. Despite work indicating the importance of country of origin (nativity) for Latina health, minimal work has explored the role of nativity. Documentation status- another source of social stress- also differs across subgroups with implications for POs. Further, Latinas, particularly undocumented women, tend to reside in under-resourced neighborhoods, which puts them at risk for higher rates of food insecurity and increased risk of adverse POs. Our long-term goal is to develop successful interventions to promote the reproductive health of Latina women and their children over the life-course. The objective of this study is to identify how nativity and documentation status shape adverse PO (inappropriate maternal weight gain, pregnancy-induced hypertension (PIH)/eclampsia, PTB, term BW, small for gestational age (SGA)) and how the residential context exacerbates risk for adverse health. To accomplish this objective, we are partnering with Multnomah County Health Department (MCHD) to analyze data from the Citizen Alien Waived Emergent Medical (CAWEM) Plus program. It provides prenatal care to Medicaid-ineligible women including undocumented Latinas. Linking CAWEMPlus undocumented status with geocoded MCHD birth records (2009- 2014), we will undertake the following specific aims: Aim 1: Identify associations between nativity, documentation status and POs (inappropriate weight gain, PIH/eclampsia, PTB, term BW, SGA) among Latinas. The working hypotheses are that (a) foreign-born Latinas will have better POs than native-born; and (b) among the foreign-born, documented Latinas will have the most positive POs. Aim 2: Characterize the residential context (poverty level, food access) of documented versus undocumented Latina women. The working hypothesis is that undocumented Latina women live in higher poverty neighborhoods characterized by an unhealthy food environment (more fast food, fewer grocery stores). Aim 3: Identify joint effects of nativity, documentation status and neighborhood context on POs among Latina women. The working hypothesis is that among Latinas, neighborhood context mediates the relationship between nativity and immigration status and MCH outcomes. Summary: Aim 1 will allow us to disentangle the independent effects of nativity and immigration status on MCH outcomes; Aim 2 will help clarify the role of neighborhood context in shaping risk for adverse Latina outcomes; and Aim 3 will specify differential area-induced vulnerabilities by nativity and documentation status. Impact: The results from the completion of this community-based participatory research project will inform program and policy interventions designed to improve Latina health. Further, disentangling the effects of nativity from documentation status can refine our intervention efforts to target the most vulnerable women to reduce maternal and child health disparities.            PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The Latina paradox is robust, but not uniformly protective against adverse pregnancy outcomes. Specifically, pregnancy outcomes may differ by nativity and exposure to social stressors, including documentation status and unhealthy neighborhood food environments. Using a unique database, the Citizen Alien Waived Emergent Medical Plus program, and geocoded county birth records, this community-based participatory research project identifies how nativity and documentation status shape adverse pregnancy outcomes among Latinas in Multnomah County, Oregon and how neighborhood context exacerbates their risk for adverse health.            ",Social factors influencing pregnancy outcome disparities,9089435,R21HD087734,"['Alien ', ' Birth Records ', ' Parturition ', ' Birth ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Sources ', ' Eclampsia ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Food or Food Product ', ' Food ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Immigrations ', ' In-Migration ', ' Postneonatal Mortality ', ' Infant Mortality Total ', ' Infant Mortality ', ' low birthweight ', ' low birth weight infant human ', ' low birth weight ', ' Low Birth Weight Infant ', ' small for gestational age ', ' Small for Gestational Age Infant ', ' Insurance ', ' Articulation ', ' Joints ', ' life course ', ' Life Cycle ', ' Life Cycle Stages ', ' Medicaid ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Oregon ', ' Poverty ', ' Pregnancy Outcome ', ' pregnancy care ', ' Prenatal care ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Risk ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Social Service ', ' Social Work ', ' Weight Gain ', ' wt gain ', ' body weight increase ', ' body weight gain ', ' Weight Increase ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' County ', ' Native-Born ', ' Native People ', ' Indigenous Population ', "" Women's Health "", ' Female Health ', ' Mediating ', ' Outcomes Research ', ' Premature Birth ', ' preterm delivery ', ' premature delivery ', ' premature childbirth ', ' Preterm Birth ', ' Pre-term birth ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Specified ', ' Specific qualifier value ', ' Medical ', ' Link ', ' data repository ', ' clinical data repository ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Databases ', ' Policies ', ' Reproductive Health ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Exposure to ', ' Shapes ', ' convenience food ', ' fast food ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Source ', ' Country ', ' Pregnancy Associated Hypertension ', ' Hypertension-Associated Pregnancy Disorder ', ' Hypertension induced by pregnancy ', ' Gestational Hypertension ', ' pregnancy hypertension ', ' experience ', ' stressor ', ' social ', ' social stress ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Documentation ', ' Latinas ', ' Latina ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Maternal and Child Health ', ' Subgroup ', ' Food Access ', ' Outcome ', ' community based participatory research ', ' participatory action research ', ' community based research ', ' community based design ', ' therapy design ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' high risk ', ' public health relevance ', ' successful intervention ', ' adverse outcome ', ' adverse consequence ', ' food environment ', ' gestational weight gain ', ' adverse pregnancy outcome ', ' ']",NICHD,PORTLAND STATE UNIVERSITY,R21,2016,202192,0.005290642910311268
"Impact of social and built environments on health-related quality of life for cancer survivors ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Neighborhoods have been shown to be a critical foundation for shaping individuals' opportunities for achieving optimal health. As the number of cancer survivors continues to increase, with over 13 million in the U.S. currently, understanding factors that improve health-related quality of life (HRQOL) after cancer diagnosis is critical. Unless we identify and address the relevant contextual factors, interventions that only target individual factors are likely to have limited effectiveness. However, only three studies have considered neighborhood factors, despite that neighborhoods have been shown to influence health outcomes through a number of pathways--environmental exposures, material deprivation, psychosocial mechanisms, health behaviors, and access to resources. Therefore, we propose to leverage and pool individual-level data on sociodemographic, clinical, social, and behavioral factors from three existing cancer survivorship studies and merge them with neighborhood data. Specifically, we aim to (1) examine the associations between a comprehensive suite of social and built environment features and HRQOL, (a) adjusting for important covariates (e.g., clinical, demographic, social and behavioral factors) and (b) evaluating whether these associations vary by race/ethnicity, age, or gender, and (2) assess racial/ethnic disparities in HRQOL and evaluate whether these disparities are explained by clinical, demographic, social and behavioral factors, neighborhood factors, or a combination of them. To achieve these aims, with harmonized data across three California population-based studies (n=2,563, 46% minority)-Assessment of Patients' Experience of Cancer Care (APECC), Experiences of Care and Health Outcomes of survivors of Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma (ECHOS-NHL), and Follow-up Care Use among Survivors (FOCUS)-we will geocode address at interview and merge the individual-level data with our social (e.g., socioeconomic, racial/ethnic composition, immigration) and built (e.g., population density, street connectivity, commuting, amenities, food environment) environment data. The main HRQOL outcomes will include physical and mental component summary scores. Linear regression models will be used to estimate unadjusted and adjusted associations between neighborhood features and the two HRQOL outcomes. Further, we will document racial/ethnic disparities in HRQOL and evaluate whether neighborhood features explain these disparities. This efficient study will be powered to detect significant neighborhoods effects across all of the cancer sites, as well as for 5 specific sites -breast, colorectal, gynecologic, NHL, and prostate. Our findings will provide the preliminary evidence for associations between the built and social environment and HRQOL and contribute significantly to our understanding of which neighborhood features influence HRQOL. Our collaboration with the Shanti Project will ensure that our study will meaningfully inform the design of multilevel interventions that not only account for individual factors that contribute to HRQOL, but also the context through which those individual factors are shaped.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  With over 13 million cancer survivors currently in the U.S. and growing, understanding factors that improve their quality of life after cancer diagnosis is critical. Most studies have focused on individual factors such as personal characteristics, clinica factors, and behaviors, with only three studies focused on how neighborhood socioeconomic status and segregation shape quality of life among cancer survivors. Therefore, we propose to study how neighborhood characteristics including resources, amenities, food environment, walkability and population characteristics impact quality of life so that future interventions coul be optimally designed to improve health for all cancer survivors.                ",Impact of social and built environments on health-related quality of life for cancer survivors,9024189,R03CA202192,"['Accounting ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' Behavior ', ' Breast ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' California ', ' Censuses ', ' Cities ', ' Communities ', ' Commuting ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Comorbidity ', ' Critical Care ', ' dietary ', ' Diet ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Employment ', ' Environment ', ' Environmental Exposure ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' Housing ', ' Immigrations ', ' In-Migration ', ' Information Technology Systems ', ' IT Systems ', ' Data Systems ', ' Information Systems ', ' Interview ', ' Linear Regressions ', ' non-Hodgkins lymphoma ', ' non-Hodgkins disease ', ' Nonhodgkins Lymphoma ', "" Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma "", ' Marketing ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Obesity ', ' Patients ', ' Population Characteristics ', ' Population Density ', ' Poverty ', ' Prostatic Gland ', ' Prostate Gland ', ' Prostate ', ' Psychosocial Deprivation ', ' QOL ', ' Quality of life ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Registries ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' San Francisco ', ' Smoking ', ' socioenvironment ', ' social context ', ' social climate ', ' Social Environment ', ' social support network ', ' Social support ', ' Stress ', ' survivorship ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' Transportation ', ' Wellness Program ', ' Work ', ' County ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', ' segregation ', ' Racial Segregation ', ' Businesses ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Caring ', ' Social Network ', ' base ', ' density ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Gynecologic ', ' Survivors ', ' Link ', ' Ensure ', ' Evaluation ', ' Physical activity ', ' farmer ', ' mental ', ' Psyche structure ', ' Individual ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Collaborations ', ' healthy food ', ' Health Food ', ' Shapes ', ' Prostatic Cancer ', ' Prostate Cancer ', ' Prostate CA ', ' Malignant prostatic tumor ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Prostate ', ' Malignant neoplasm of prostate ', ' Life ', ' Over weight ', ' Overweight ', ' physical health ', ' physical conditioning ', ' psychosocial ', ' Application Context ', ' contextual factors ', ' colorectum ', ' colo-rectal ', ' Colon or Rectum ', ' Colorectal ', ' Services ', ' experience ', ' cohesion ', ' cohort ', ' trafficking ', ' social ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Modeling ', ' deprivation ', ' cancer location ', ' cancer site ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Meta-Analyses ', ' Data Pooling ', ' Clinical Trial Overviews ', ' Meta-Analysis ', ' cancer care ', ' cancer diagnosis ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Effectiveness ', ' low socioeconomic position ', ' low socio-economic status ', ' low socio-economic position ', ' low socioeconomic status ', ' Low income ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Multiple Cancer Sites ', ' Prognostic/Survival Factor ', ' General Prognostic Factor ', ' Prognostic Factor ', ' Stress and Coping ', ' Cancer Patient ', ' survive cancer ', ' Cancer Survivor ', ' Cancer Survivorship ', ' SF-12 ', ' SF-36 ', ' Characteristics ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socio-economically ', ' socio-economic ', ' socioeconomics ', ' Behavioral ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' cost ', ' health related quality of life ', ' Social Functioning ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' man ', "" man's "", ' racial and ethnic ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' public health relevance ', ' population based ', ' food environment ', ' Breast Cancer Patient ', ' Breast Tumor Patient ', ' built environment ', ' walkability ', ' walkable ', ' improved outcome ', ' ethnic diversity ', ' ethnically diverse ', ' Healthy Eating ', ' ']",NCI,CANCER PREVENTION INSTIT OF CALIFORNIA,R03,2016,72530,0.1351340490275811
"Neighborhood Socioeconomic Disadvantage and Medicare's 30-Day Rehospitalization Policy: Eliminating Rehospitalization Disparities by Informing Policy Design and Implementation ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Thirty-day re-hospitalizations disproportionately impact African American patients and those from socioeconomically disadvantaged neighborhoods. Hospitals that primarily serve disadvantaged populations bear a disproportionate burden of Medicare's hospital-based financial re-hospitalization penalties (mandated by S. 3025, Affordable Care Act). As these penalties continue to increase in coming years, penalized hospitals have stated that they will need to cut services to maintain financial solvency, which may further worsen disparities. This may be a potential unintended negative consequence of Medicare's policy decision to not adjust for socioeconomic factors in the re-hospitalization metrics to which the penalties are tied. At this decision's core is a debate on whether observed disparities result from confounding by cluster (i.e., disadvantaged populations primarily receiving care from 'bad' hospitals) or whether socioeconomic disadvantage outside the hospital has a greater influence on re-hospitalization than is currently recognized by Medicare. A statistical decomposition of the within- and between- hospital effects is needed to help disentangle whether the hospital or non-hospital socioeconomics play the greater role in re-hospitalization, but until recently few national-scale indictors of disadvantage were available for this purpose. (Individual-level indicators of disadvantage are neither widely available nor reliabl enough for either resolving this debate or for use in metric adjustment.) The Area Deprivation Index (ADI) is a validated measure of US disadvantage, based upon similar measures employed abroad for health policy development. The ADI uses US Census poverty, education, and housing and employment indicators to characterize regions, such as neighborhoods. Recently, we demonstrated that living in a severely disadvantaged US neighborhood (per a year 2000 Census-based ADI) predicts re-hospitalization as powerfully as the presence of illnesses, such as chronic pulmonary disease. However, to answer the critical policy debate above and to understand if the ADI is suitable for use as a metric adjuster, the ADI must be updated to the 2010 Census, its geographic stability (i.e., how the distribution of disadvantaged US neighborhoods has changed since 2000) and association consistency (i.e., whether the association of neighborhood disadvantage and re-hospitalization remains in 2010) determined, within- and between-hospital effects assessed (i.e., informing the hospital vs. neighborhood socioeconomics debate), and resilient hospitals (i.e., hospitals which primarily serve highly disadvantaged neighborhoods yet have lower than expected re-hospitalization rates) studied in comparison to less-resilient/non-resilient hospitals, especially in terms of patient, caregiver and clinician perspectives on the underlying reasons for this resilience. The potential policy impact o metric adjustment must also be understood. We propose to accomplish all of these steps, with an overarching goal of eliminating re-hospitalization disparities by informing policy and practice. This proposed project has the potential to immediately change re-hospitalization policy and inform metric revision. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Thirty-day re-hospitalizations disproportionately impact African American patients and those from socioeconomically disadvantaged neighborhoods; hospitals that primarily serve disadvantaged populations bear a disproportionate burden of the financial re-hospitalization penalties mandated by Section 3025 of the Affordable Care Act. As these penalties continue to increase in coming years, penalized hospitals have stated that they will need to cut services to maintain financial solvency, which may further worsen disparities--a potential unintended negative consequence of Medicare's policy decision to not adjust for socioeconomic factors in the re-hospitalization metrics to which the penalties are tied. To inform Medicare policy design and implementation, this proposal examines a novel method by which such an adjustment could be achieved, evaluates its suitability as an adjustment metric, and assesses the potential implications of adjustment.",Neighborhood Socioeconomic Disadvantage and Medicare's 30-Day Rehospitalization Policy: Eliminating Rehospitalization Disparities by Informing Policy Design and Implementation,9148196,R01MD010243,"['Affect ', ' bear ', ' Ursidae ', ' Bears ', ' Ursidae Family ', ' Censuses ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Employment ', ' Food or Food Product ', ' Food ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' health insurance for disabled ', ' Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Disabled Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Aged and Disabled, Title 18 ', ' Medicare ', ' healthcare policy ', ' health care policy ', ' Health Policy ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Hospitals ', ' Housing ', ' indexing ', ' Internal Medicine ', ' pulmonary ', ' Lung Respiratory System ', ' Lung ', ' lung disorder ', ' Respiratory System Disorder ', ' Respiratory System Disease ', ' Respiratory Disease ', ' Pulmonary Disorder ', ' Pulmonary Diseases ', ' Lung diseases ', ' Methods ', ' Theoretic Models ', ' Theoretical model ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Patients ', ' Perception ', ' Play ', ' Poverty ', ' Risk ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Socioeconomic Factors ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Caregivers ', ' Care Givers ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Chronic ', ' Link ', ' Individual ', ' Policy Developments ', ' Policies ', ' tool ', ' Life ', ' Services ', ' novel ', ' payment ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Sampling ', ' deprivation ', ' Address ', ' qualitative reasoning ', ' Qualitative Methods ', ' Data ', ' Update ', ' Characteristics ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socio-economically ', ' socio-economic ', ' socioeconomics ', ' cost ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' resilience ', ' Outcome ', ' Prevalence ', ' therapy design ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' socioeconomic disadvantage ', ' socioeconomically underprivileged ', ' Socioeconomically disadvantaged ', ' neighborhood disadvantage ', ' disadvantaged population ', ' Affordable Care Act ', ' Obamacare ', ' ']",NIMHD,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,R01,2016,532348,0.0728301558436926
"Geography of opportunity: Neighborhood dynamics and child cognitive development DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Prenatal and early life exposures and environments are fundamental to life course health and prosperity and are increasingly recognized as such in national and international public health priorities. Fetal and early childhood environments affect children's cognitive and non-cognitive development, abilities, and performance in elementary school and, as a result, significantly affect subsequent educational trajectories, adult health, wealth, and social status. However opportunities for optimal development for children in the U.S. are not uniform, but rather are socially and spatially patterned from before birth-in the form of fetal programming and birth outcomes-through adolescence and into adulthood. It is therefore a pressing public health challenge to better understand the family and neighborhood environmental determinants of early childhood development in order to identify opportunities for child, family, and community interventions which improve children's health outcomes. Meeting this challenge requires linking the micro and macro demographic processes by which families and neighborhoods affect early child development with the conceptual, methodological, and statistical perspectives of spatial demography and population geography. With this career development award I will gain critical inter-disciplinary skills necessary to pursue a novel research agenda that: a) integrates population science theory and methods necessary to study residential context, segregation and mobility, b) describes the role of spatially and temporally dynamic residential context in early life course development of U.S. children, c) prepares me to compete successfully for R01-level research funding by year 5, and d) establishes me as an independent investigator at the intersection of spatial and social demography, life course demography / epidemiology, and public health. The research aims of this study are to: 1) develop and evaluate a geo-informatics data model for studying spatiotemporal population patterns including residential segregation, neighborhood deprivation and residential stability and mobility; 2) test the association of spatiotemporal neighborhood exposures with early childhood cognitive development and school readiness using Early Childhood Longitudinal Study (ECLS) Birth and Kindergarten cohort data; and 3) construct spatial, agent- based models to explore dynamics of the place-child development relationship. Residential environments are a source of social capital and collective efficacy for residents and could affect child development through the distribution of educational and recreational resources, through the effects of stress or support from varying crime, economic, and social characteristics of neighborhoods, or through local norms and role models for both parents and children. These factors will be measured using census, crime, and other population-based data sources to describe the spatial patterns of residential segregation; residential mobility, housing tenure, and stability; and neighborhood social environment including poverty, affluence, crime and family structure. Associations between spatial residential environments and childhood development will be tested using the ECLS birth and kindergarten cohorts using spatial regression, and econometric approaches which can test hypotheses of spatial externalities, clustering, and heterogeneity. The multilevel use of large, population-based longitudinal data with spatially-explicit environmental measures and hypotheses can shed light on both the magnitude of associations as well as the possible pathways through which environments strengthen or undermine optimal child development. The execution of these research aims will be intertwined with a comprehensive training and career mentoring plan carried out at Emory University and Penn State University Population Research Institute. Training goals include study of spatial, social and family demography, geo-informatics, and advanced statistical approaches to frequentist and Bayesian spatial analysis. Mentoring will support research productivity in the form of publications, collaboration with public health and population science scholars, and successful submission of R03 and R01 grants during the training period. Overall this proposal will allow me to become a uniquely skilled, independent researcher bridging spatial demography and social epidemiology. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Children's fetal and early life environments set them on a trajectory of cognitive and non-cognitive development and academic achievements which has far reaching consequences for adult health and wellbeing. In addition to family environment, children's neighborhood environments in these critical early years may foster or inhibit optimal development.

"Natural Experiment of Neighborhood Revitalization and Cardiometabolic Health ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Individuals living in socioeconomically disadvantaged neighborhoods have disproportionately high rates of obesity and related morbidity, including increased risk for diabetes and cardiovascular diseases (CVD). Although previous research has made significant contributions to our understanding of the health consequences associated with neighborhood disadvantage, causal relationships have been difficult to establish due to a reliance on cross-sectional designs, selection biases and limited data on potential mechanisms. Building on the existing research infrastructure developed by our team's previously funded, ongoing natural experiment studies, we have a unique opportunity to study whether changes to the built and social environment, stimulated by substantial ($160 million) economic investment in housing development and neighborhood revitalization, improves cardio-metabolic outcomes in the ""intervention"" neighborhood relative to the matched ""control"" neighborhood which is not undergoing such changes. The study includes a randomly selected cohort of 732 low-income, African American adults, from two urban neighborhoods (intervention and control communities). Our study will be the first natural experiment to examine the impact of a place-based natural experiment strategy (rather than residential mobility strategy) on clinically relevant cardio-metabolic outcomes (BMI, HbA1c, blood pressure, and lipids) in a high-risk, though understudied, African American population. We will leverage existing data from our previously funded studies on potential mediators, including measures of the built and social environment, and health behaviors including diet, physical activity and sleep (objective and subjective measures). In this proposal, we will add measured cardio-metabolic outcomes, including blood pressure, HbA1c, and lipids. The next stage of economic revitalization of the intervention neighborhood is focused on redevelopment of housing. Thus, in addition, the proposed study is optimally timed to add survey measures of perceptions of housing conditions, neighborhood-level audits of housing conditions, and compilation of secondary data from publically available resources on housing sales, vacancy rates, etc.,             before and after the housing changes occur. Understanding the impact and pattern of neighborhood revitalization as it unfolds over time is critical in the arsenal of policies to mitigte pervasive racial/ ethnic and socioeconomic disparities in obesity and cardio-metabolic health.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Individuals living in socioeconomically disadvantaged neighborhoods have significantly higher rates of obesity and obesity-related health problems, including cardiovascular diseases (CVD) and diabetes. Our study is the first of its kind to evaluate whether improvements in neighborhood conditions, spurred by substantial neighborhood-level revitalization in a predominantly African American (AA) neighborhood improves residents' cardio-metabolic risk factors (obesity, glycated hemoglobin, cholesterol, and, blood pressure) relative to a comparison neighborhood that is not undergoing such changes. Prior studies of similar redevelopment initiatives lack the comparative research design, and none, to our knowledge, have measured cardio-metabolic risk factors in a high-risk, yet understudied African American resident base. Findings from this longitudinal study would provide critical evidence concerning the causal impact of a major policy initiative to redevelop high-poverty neighborhoods on the cardiovascular health of the community.        ",Natural Experiment of Neighborhood Revitalization and Cardiometabolic Health,9075838,R01HL131531,"['adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Affect ', ' Blood Pressure ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' Cholesterol ', ' Cities ', ' Communities ', ' Control Groups ', ' diabetes ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' dietary ', ' Diet ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Economics ', ' Environment ', ' Esthetics ', ' Experimental Designs ', ' Glycated Hemoglobins ', ' Glycosylated Hemoglobin ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' Level of Health ', ' Health Status ', ' hemoglobin A1c ', ' Hemoglobin A(1) ', ' HbA1c ', ' HbA1 ', ' Hb A1c ', ' Hb A1a+b ', ' Hb A1 ', ' Glycohemoglobin A ', ' Glycosylated hemoglobin A ', ' Housing ', ' Investments ', ' Lipids ', ' long-term study ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' mortality ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Obesity ', ' Perception ', ' well-being ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' Poverty ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Research Design ', ' Residential Mobility ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Safety ', ' Sales ', ' Selection Bias ', ' Sleep ', ' Societal Conditions ', ' Social Conditions ', ' socioenvironment ', ' social context ', ' social climate ', ' Social Environment ', ' Stress ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' brain attack ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Apoplexy ', ' stroke ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Businesses ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Physical activity ', ' Distress ', ' Individual ', ' Policies ', ' Funding ', ' Metabolic ', ' Staging ', ' Shapes ', ' Life ', ' Pattern ', ' Physical environment ', ' Supermarket ', ' Services ', ' experience ', ' cohesion ', ' cohort ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' disease risk ', ' disorder risk ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' social ', ' Sampling ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' diabetes risk ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Low income ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Data ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' lifestyle factors ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socio-economically ', ' socio-economic ', ' socioeconomics ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' years of life lost to disease ', ' years of life lost to disability ', ' disease burden ', ' burden of disease ', ' burden of illness ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' cost efficient ', ' Population ', ' Natural experiment ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' clinically relevant ', ' clinical relevance ', ' comparative ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' high risk ', ' public health relevance ', ' secondary outcome ', ' population health ', ' longitudinal design ', ' stress disorder ', ' socioeconomic disparity ', ' socioeconomic disadvantage ', ' socioeconomically underprivileged ', ' Socioeconomically disadvantaged ', ' cardiovascular health ', ' cardiometabolic risk ', ' cardio-metabolic risk ', ' built environment ', ' Green space ', ' greenspace ', ' walkability ', ' walkable ', ' neighborhood disadvantage ', ' disadvantaged population ', ' ']",NHLBI,RAND CORPORATION,R01,2016,715371,0.17657681073724985
"Sustainable Solutions to Metal Air Pollution in Disadvantaged Neighborhoods DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project uses a community-based participatory approach to 1) Conduct formative research; 2) Develop an intervention; and 3) Evaluate intervention effects regarding possible health related exposures from metal recycling. Metal recycling is a robust, growing industry in the nation. The benefits of metal recycling over the use of raw materials include energy savings, the conservation of resources, the generation of jobs and the positive impact on trade of significant U.S. exports world-wide. The metal recycling industry in the U.S. generated over $64 billion in 2010. Metal recycling is a growing industry in Houston as well, with over 170 metal recycling facilities in operation. Because of no zoning, many of these sites operate ""next-door"" to neighborhoods that are predominantly poor and communities of color. During the last five years, the City of Houston Department of Health and Human Services (HDHHS) received nearly 200 air quality complaints from residents across the city about recycling activities, with the predominant concern being smoke and dust. To the extent that resources were available, the HDHHS Bureau of Pollution Control and Prevention conducted limited ambient air monitoring at 25 recycling facilities. Our preliminary results suggested possible environmental health risks, but there are insufficient data to draw definitive conclusions about the health risks of emissions from these facilities. A partnership arose among the HDHHS, the University of Texas School of Public Health, Rice University and Air Alliance Houston to work together with neighborhood residents and metal recyclers to address this potentially serious environmental health issue. Also, the HDHHS has been working since January 2013 with the metal recyclers' task force consisting of the Recycling Council of Texas and Gulf Coast and National Institute of Scrap Recycling Industries, Inc. (ISRI), and in response one metal recycler voluntarily upgraded their facility resulting in reduced aerosol emissions. We propose to conduct extensive air monitoring of metals in particulate matter in affected neighborhoods that will, in turn, inform a risk assessment associated with air emissions from metal recyclers in the community. Based on the risk assessment findings and additional community input, we will use a systematic health promotion planning method to implement and evaluate a multilevel, evidence and behavioral science theory-based public health action plan. The public health action plan will include recommendations for best practices for adoption by metal recyclers and targeted educational campaigns for neighborhood residents, metal recyclers and policy makers and we will re-evaluate emissions and risks following implementation of the plan. Affected neighborhood residents and metal recyclers have a critical role to play in this project to insure that we represent the full range of community concerns in designing and conducting the study, interpreting and disseminating study results and developing and evaluating a public health action plan. The ultimate goal of the project is to improve the health of Houston's communities that border metal recycling facilities. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Owing to nearly 200 air quality complaints from residents whose neighborhoods border metal recycling activities (many of which are predominantly poor and largely Hispanic or African- American), the City of Houston Department of Health and Human Services (HDHHS) conducted limited ambient air monitoring with results that are suggestive of possible environmental health risks. In light of these findings and heightened community concerns due to recent media exposure, the HDHHS partnered with the University of Texas School of Public Health, Rice University and Air Alliance Houston to conduct extensive air monitoring in affected neighborhoods that will, in turn, inform a risk assessment associated with air emissions from metal recyclers in the community. Based on our risk assessment findings and with additional community input from two key stakeholder groups (metal recyclers and neighborhood residents), we further propose to implement and evaluate a multi-level public health action plan that will improve the overall health of Houston's communities that border metal recycling facilities.",Sustainable Solutions to Metal Air Pollution in Disadvantaged Neighborhoods,9059084,R01ES023563,"['Adoption ', ' Aerosols ', ' Affect ', ' Air ', ' Air Pollution ', ' inspiration ', ' Respiratory Inspiration ', ' Respiratory Aspiration ', ' Inhaling ', ' Inhalation ', ' Breathing ', ' Awareness ', ' Behavioral Sciences ', ' Cities ', ' Color ', ' Communities ', ' Dust ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Environmental Health Science ', ' Environmental Health ', ' environmental contamination ', ' environmental contaminant ', ' Environmental Pollution ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' Health Promotion ', ' Industry ', ' Institutes ', ' Interview ', ' Leadership ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Light ', ' Metals ', ' Methods ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Newspapers ', ' Professional Positions ', ' Jobs ', ' Occupations ', ' Plants ', ' Play ', ' Public Health ', ' Questionnaires ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Rice ', ' Risk ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Savings ', ' Public Health Schools ', ' Smoke ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Texas ', ' Training Programs ', ' Translating ', ' United States Dept. of Health and Human Services ', ' United States Department of Health and Human Services ', ' Department of Health and Human Services ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Generations ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Businesses ', ' Hispanics ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Risk Assessment ', ' Advisory Committees ', ' advisory team ', ' Task Forces ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Series ', ' Link ', ' Chemicals ', ' Evaluation ', ' Policy Maker ', ' Workshop ', ' Educational workshop ', ' Fostering ', ' Measurement ', ' Recycling ', ' Exposure to ', ' air contaminant ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Pollution ', ' Source ', ' Location ', ' experience ', ' particle ', ' pollutant ', ' Toxicities ', ' Toxic effect ', ' economic impact ', ' Program Announcement ', ' NIH Program Announcements ', ' Prevention ', ' response ', ' theories ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' air monitoring ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Diameter ', ' Caliber ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Monitor ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' informant ', ' Particulate Matter ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' toxic metal ', ' Metal exposure ', ' exposure to metal ', ' gulf coast ', ' intervention effect ', ' industry partner ', ' industry partnership ', ' industrial partnership ', ' longitudinal design ', ' operation ', ' screening ', ' neighborhood disadvantage ', ' disadvantaged population ', ' ']",NIEHS,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS HLTH SCI CTR HOUSTON,R01,2016,475313,0.101031348522972
"At-Risk Neighborhoods and Health Outcomes ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): It is our contention that gangland residence may have a unique effect on population health that is not reducible to crime, even if we were able to objectively and accurately measure crime. The nature of gang activities and violence remains a plausibly unique contributor to population health-a factor that has been largely unexplored despite its potential effect on population health and health disparities. We further argue that birh outcomes are a relevant barometer for population health, given the responsiveness of this outcome to changing social conditions and due to the fact that we are able to assess birth outcomes with a large sample in highly diverse neighborhood settings, over a long period of time. Our project goals for this exploratory/developmental (R21) research proposal are simple, we want to assess whether gangland residence is associated with population health and health disparities. Given the pervasiveness of gangs in Los Angeles County, the large variation in neighborhood types, and the responsiveness of birth outcomes to dynamic social conditions-this project has the capability to shed light on an under-researched social determinant of health. Our aims are as follows:  Aim 1. To determine if gangland residence has an independent effect on adverse birth outcomes, net of neighborhood crime and socio-demographics such as poverty and economic and racial/ethnic composition.  Aim 2. To determine if gangland residence compounds the effect of neighborhood-level crime.  Aim 3. To determine whether gang injunctions are efficacious for improving population health.  Aim 4. To assess whether gangland residence accounts for adverse birth outcome disparities.  This project is an attempt to uncover independent effects of gangland residence on population health and if successful, will provide a baseline for future gangland community health research. We believe the project's innovation will assuage any fears of it being a relatively risky endeavor and that is why we feel that an R21 is the perfect mechanism for such an approach.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This exploratory/developmental proposal seeks to study a previously unexplored social dynamic, co-residence with gang members and it effect on population health and health disparities. Given the recent spread of gangs, beyond traditional gang-addled communities in LA, NY, and Chicago, for example, the effects of gangland residence may have important health implications for the entire nation, given the unique impact that gangs have on crime and social conditions within a community. The potential mechanisms affecting health seem apparent: increased a greater likelihood of directly experiencing violence, increased risk of being exposed to crime and violence, fear of crime, stress, and reduced social interaction; gangland co-residence may be associated with each of these factors, although its potential effects may not be reducible solely to crime.        ",At-Risk Neighborhoods and Health Outcomes,9127768,R21HD088066,"['Accounting ', ' Affect ', ' Parturition ', ' Birth ', ' California ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Chicago ', ' Communities ', ' Conflict ', ' Conflict (Psychology) ', ' Crime ', ' Crowding ', ' Economics ', ' Emigrations ', ' Epidemic ', ' Exercise ', ' Fear ', ' Fright ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Hand ', ' Health ', ' sound perception ', ' hearing perception ', ' Hearing ', ' Homicide ', ' Latin America ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Light ', ' Los Angeles ', ' mortality ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Yersinia pestis disease ', ' Plague ', ' Poverty ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Research Proposals ', ' Risk ', ' Societal Conditions ', ' Social Conditions ', ' Social Interaction ', ' Stress ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Violence ', ' violent behavior ', ' violent ', ' War ', ' County ', ' Measures ', ' segregation ', ' Racial Segregation ', ' Walking ', ' Injury ', ' suburbia ', ' suburban ', ' suburb ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Adolescent ', ' residential site ', ' residence ', ' Exposure to ', ' Nature ', ' Life ', ' Home ', ' Home environment ', ' Country ', ' experience ', ' social space ', ' member ', ' gang ', ' social ', ' Sampling ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Data ', ' Collection ', ' Community Health ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' gang violence ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' aged ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' 19 year old ', ' nineteen year old ', ' age 19 years ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' demographics ', ' public health relevance ', ' population health ', ' social health determinants ', ' violent crime ', ' ']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,R21,2016,247500,0.04890796171245605
"Do Departments of Parks and Recreation Foster or Alleviate Health Disparities? DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Because prior research suggests that resource allocation among parks varies by neighborhood SES, we propose to undertake a national longitudinal study of the existence of disparities in park management practices in 25 representative US cities and 200 parks. In order to advance the state of science on the influence of park management practices on physical activity and park use and to shape public policy on health promotion at the population level, we propose an investigation with the following specific aims: 1) To determine whether there are systematic differences in park resources, programming, management practices, and park use depending upon the socioeconomic status of park neighborhoods in a representative sample of American cities, 2) To determine whether changes in resource allocation among parks in these cities are distributed equally among high and low income parks, or whether allocation changes attempt to address health disparities among potential park users. We will also determine whether changes in resource allocation are accompanied by changes in park-based physical activity, and 3) To make recommendations to the Departments of Parks and Recreation in each city that will support greater use of park facilities among populations who may experience health disparities that can be ameliorated by physical activity.  To accomplish the aims of this investigation, we will train a cadre of park professionals and members of community-based organizations that support neighborhood parks to act as ""citizen scientists"" and collect objective data. Engaging these citizen-scientists in the research process is intended to increase local capacity to reliably measure park management practices, park characteristics, park use, and physical activity. Citizen-scientists are an asset that will endure long after the proposed research (if funded) is completed and could form the basis for research in which future interventions to promote physical activity can be rigorously evaluated. We will also interview key stakeholders to assess other factors that may impact local park use. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  We propose to study park management practices in 200 parks in 25 representative US cities in order to determine whether there are differences in park management practices between high and low-income neighborhoods. We will also study whether changes in park resource allocation over time differ by neighborhood socio-economic status and how the impact of such changes might differentially influence park use and physical activity.",Do Departments of Parks and Recreation Foster or Alleviate Health Disparities?,9105397,R01HL114432,"['Accounting ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' Cities ', ' Communities ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' diabetes ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Exercise ', ' Future ', ' Health ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' Health Promotion ', ' Incidence ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Income ', ' Interview ', ' lifespan ', ' life span ', ' Length of Life ', ' Longevity ', ' long-term study ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' Los Angeles ', ' Marketing ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Ohio ', ' Parking Facilities ', ' Philadelphia ', ' Population Density ', ' Population Sizes ', ' Poverty ', ' Public Policy ', ' Recommendation ', ' Recreation ', ' Research ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Science ', ' Time ', ' Measures ', ' Walking ', ' Resource Allocation ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' base ', ' Area ', ' Training ', ' Physical activity ', ' Fostering ', ' Funding ', ' Shapes ', ' programs ', ' Investigation ', ' Frequencies ', ' Pattern ', ' American ', ' behavioral/social science ', ' experience ', ' Practice Management ', ' member ', ' Reporting ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Low income ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' obesity prevention ', ' functional status decline ', ' decline in functional status ', ' decline in function ', ' functional decline ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' social science research ', ' citizen science ', ' scientific citizenship ', ' crowd-sourced science ', ' crowd science ', ' civic science ', ' citizen scientists ', ' amateur scientists ', ' amateur science ', ' moderate-to-vigorous physical activity ', ' ']",NHLBI,RAND CORPORATION,R01,2016,791086,0.10480543795744958
"Reducing Health Disparities in Vulnerable African American Families and Communiti DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Over the next five years, the MSM will continue the CEHD research based on: 1) Its longstanding and passionate commitment to serving underserved families and communities, 2) a research agenda that advances minority health; 3) a track record of educating future minority scientists that will continue this legacy of leadership and 4) a strong push to continue to assist community based organization to become empowered as educated consumers of health information. The institution will pursue its strategic vision that emphasizes a community-centered approach to serving the health needs of underserved communities and a translational research portfolio that fosters community-based solutions to impacting health disparities. The proposed Program aligns with this shared vision of a CBPR model that integrates our intenvoven network of partnerships with academic institutions, civic organizations, government agencies, community-based organizations, schools, prisons, neighborhood clinics, health providers and policy makers. Specifically, (research project #1) is an intervention study that will assess incarcerated women returning from prison and  assess strategies for reintegration with their families and community life (research project #1). The CEHD will also study the neighborhood and parent determinants and consequences of secondhand smoke exposure on African American children through a cross-sectional design (research project #2). A developmental approach (research project #3) will evaluate a community-developed parenting curriculum, which assesses the extent to which quality parenting can reduce the negative impact of poverty on parental mental health and preschool child development and behavioral health. The overall evaluation of the work to be undertaken by the CEHD will document how genuine community engagement and participation in research can facilitate health promotion and disease prevention in African American facilities and communities. The work of the CEHD will be implemented through an Administrative Core, Research Core, Research Education and Training Core, and a Community Engagement Core interfacing with residents from Atlanta Neighborhood Planning Units V, X, Y and Z.

"Impact of the Built Environment on Child Body Mass Index Project Summary The last several years have witnessed growing interest in the potential contribution of the “built environment” to the epidemic increase in obesity rates in the United States. This includes both the large structural aspects of the neighborhood and physical characteristics of homes and schools at the very micro level (the interiors and associated grounds of these buildings). The structural aspects of the neighborhood that surround the home and school includes urban design features such as streets and highways, land use mix, street connectivity, public transportation infrastructure (i.e., subway stations), park land, and recreational infrastructure, all of which could affect both physical activity and the accessibility of food and other resources. The physical characteristics of the home or school—including building size, the presence of elevators, stairs, spaces for physical activity, and related factors—could determine opportunities for physical activity and amount of activity needed to navigate the space. Thus far not established is how each of these factors contributes to childhood BMI in a distinct and interconnected way and/or how changes in such factors could influence obesity rates in a causal manner. This gap in knowledge is particularly troubling given the high cost of changing the built environment as well as the longevity of investments once made. Our research promises to provide insight critical to policymakers planning urban infrastructure investment. Particularly important to consider are disparities, and whether differences in the built environment could explain differences in obesity rates in key demographic groups, including income and race/ethnicity. We propose to combine New York City Department of Education FITNESSGRAM data, which includes BMI, school and residential locations, for all New York City public school children from 2005 onward, with detailed data on the built environment surrounding each child’s home and school as well as within their home and school. Then, we will use a variety of enhanced methodological techniques to estimate a less-biased, more causal relationship between the built environment and obesity. The methodological enhancements we utilize over past work are:  • A large, detailed dataset, including data on over 1 million NYC public school children.  • Examining longitudinally the same children over time, using both child, school and census tract level  fixed effects, among other methods, to determine casualty.  • Examining fine-grained differences in the built environment.

"Impact of Park Renovations on Physical Activity and Community Health in NYC ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The built environment plays a critical role in promoting physical activity and health. The association between parks, as a key attribute of the built environment, and physical activity, however, remains inconclusive. This project employs a natural experiment design to assess the impact of the Community Parks Initiative (CPI), a New York City Department of Parks and Recreation (NYC Parks) park redesign and renovation initiative, on physical activity, park usage, psychosocial and mental health, and community wellbeing. The project will use a longitudinal design with matched controls. NYC Parks has identified 134 parks with extreme capital needs in high-priority neighborhoods and will begin renovating parks in waves. In late 2016, the first wave of 35 parks across 55 neighborhoods will close for renovations; these parks will reopen in late 2017. From this initial wave, 20 interventio parks have been selected for inclusion in this study. Intervention park neighborhoods have been matched to a control group of 20 socio-economically similar park neighborhoods that will not be renovated during the study. The study will address two aims. In Aim 1, investigators will compare total volume of PA and other health outcomes among residents in the intervention vs. control park neighborhoods (defined as .25 mile radius around each park) from baseline to 2.5 years post-renovation. We hypothesize that improvements will be observed in PA and health levels in intervention but not control neighborhoods. In Aim 2, an additional 10 park neighborhoods receiving renovation in 2018 and reopening in 2019 will be used to monitor replicability of intervention effects at 1.5 years post-renovation. This combined design enhances our ability to infer causality in a natural experiment. We aim to recruit and retain 40 study participants per park neighborhood, after attrition, for a total of 1600 participants in Aim 1 and 400 in Aim 2. Study participants will represent two distinct sociodemographic strata in each neighborhood: low-income housing and community- engaged residents. Measures include direct park observations and program checklists, park quality, self- reported and GPS-tracked park usage, accelerometry-based physical activity, self-reported psychosocial health, and perceived community wellbeing. The largest natural experiment of its kind to date, this study represents a rare opportunity to provide robust evidence to further our understanding of the complex relationship between parks and physical activity, psychosocial and mental health, and community wellbeing. The findings will inform future investments in health-oriented urban design policies and offer evidence for addressing health disparities through built environment strategies.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    The project will evaluate the long-term effects of a citywide public park redesign and renovation initiative on residents' physical activity, psychosocial and mental health, and community wellbeing.

"Using Geographically Targeted and Community-Based Methods to Identify Factors Associated with Micro-Level Disparities in Diabetic Outcomes and Enhance Monitoring of Glycemic Control Among Black Men Project Summary / Abstract  This mentored patient-oriented research career development award (K23) will support Dr. David Lee’s training and research to use geographically targeted and community-based methods to identify factors associated with micro-level disparities in diabetic outcomes and enhance monitoring of glycemic control among Black men. Though the prevalence of diabetes is increasing nationally, current diabetes surveillance methods are unable to identify hot spots of poor diabetic outcomes at a community level. However, studies based on a novel geographic method of diabetes surveillance have found that the increase in diabetes burden has been focused in specific communities, especially among Black neighborhoods. For Black adults, poor diabetes control has been associated with fewer primary care visits, less frequent HbA1c testing, and higher rates of emergency department use and hospitalizations, especially among diabetic Black men. Given this infrequent interaction with a usual source of healthcare, community-based settings may provide the advantages of pre- existing trust and engagement to optimize health outcomes for high-risk populations living in neighborhoods that are hot spots of diabetic complications. Thus, the specific aims of this proposal are 1) to use geospatial and quantitative methods to identify which micro-contextual factors account for local disparities in diabetic outcomes among Black communities, 2) to use geographically-targeted qualitative interviews to identify neighborhood-level factors that explain poor diabetic outcomes in certain Black communities, and 3) to perform community-based HbA1c testing and diabetes self-care surveys among Black men living in neighborhoods with a high prevalence of diabetic complications. This community-based research will leverage existing partnerships within a network of local Black-owned barbershops in New York City. Barbershops have become increasingly effective sites for promoting health and measuring health outcomes among Black men, a population which has high rates of mortality and morbidity from diabetes. The results of this research will inform future R-series applications to expand this approach to other high-risk subgroups in Black neighborhoods and other racial and ethnic communities with extremely poor diabetic outcomes. Dr. Lee’s training goals closely parallel his research aims and will further enhance his understanding of: 1) advanced quantitative analysis, 2) qualitative and mixed methods, 3) social and behavioral science, and 4) diabetes education and management. The proposed research and training will be conducted at the New York University School of Medicine and leverage resources of the other professional schools at NYU, which offer outstanding opportunities for collaboration, learning, and multidisciplinary research. This environment, in addition to his research and training plan will provide Dr. Lee with a strong foundation from which he can accelerate his career towards his goal of becoming a fully independent clinical investigator dedicated to reducing disparities in diabetes burden and improving health outcomes in communities that are overwhelmed by diabetic complications. PROJECT NARRATIVE  The overall burden of diabetes is increasing nationally, but specific neighborhoods, especially in Black communities, have experienced a disproportionately higher prevalence of diabetes and its complications such as kidney failure and lower extremity amputations. The goal of the proposed research is to use a mix of quantitative and qualitative methods to identify the micro-contextual factors that account for local disparities in diabetic outcomes among Black communities with a high versus low prevalence of diabetic complications and to enhance the monitoring of glycemic control in neighborhoods with especially poor diabetic outcomes. This K23 career development award will foster Dr. David Lee’s transition to becoming a fully-independent investigator capable of conducting high-impact research to enhance our understanding of local disparities in diabetic outcomes among communities with overwhelming diabetes burden.",Using Geographically Targeted and Community-Based Methods to Identify Factors Associated with Micro-Level Disparities in Diabetic Outcomes and Enhance Monitoring of Glycemic Control Among Black Men,9162541,K23DK110316,"['abstracting ', ' Accounting ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Outpatient Care ', ' Ambulatory Care ', ' Amputation ', ' Clinical Investigator ', ' Communities ', ' diabetes ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Emergencies ', ' Emergency Situation ', ' Environment ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Level of Health ', ' Health Status ', ' hemoglobin A1c ', ' Hemoglobin A(1) ', ' HbA1c ', ' HbA1 ', ' Hb A1c ', ' Hb A1a+b ', ' Hb A1 ', ' Glycohemoglobin A ', ' Glycosylated hemoglobin A ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Interview ', ' Learning ', ' Membrum inferius ', ' Lower Limb ', ' Lower Extremity ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' mortality ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' New York ', ' New York City ', ' Play ', ' Poverty ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Primary Care ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Renal Insufficiency ', ' Renal Failure ', ' Kidney Insufficiency ', ' Kidney Failure ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Schools ', ' school of medicine ', ' medical college ', ' medical schools ', ' personal care ', ' Self Care ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' Measures ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Self Management ', ' base ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Series ', ' Training ', ' social norm ', ' Trust ', ' diabetic ', ' Fostering ', ' Multidisciplinary Research ', ' Multidisciplinary Collaboration ', ' Interdisciplinary Research ', ' Interdisciplinary Study ', ' Collaborations ', ' Spottings ', ' Diabetic Complications ', ' Diabetes-Related Complications ', ' Diabetes Complications ', ' Complications of Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Life ', ' Source ', ' Application Context ', ' contextual factors ', ' Visit ', ' Emergency room ', ' Emergency Department ', ' Accident and Emergency department ', ' behavioral/social science ', ' diabetes education ', ' experience ', ' knowledgebase ', ' knowledge base ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' social ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Address ', ' qualitative reasoning ', ' Qualitative Methods ', ' Data ', ' High Prevalence ', ' Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award (K23) ', ' K23 Program ', ' K23 Mechanism ', ' K23 Award ', ' Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award ', ' Research Career Program ', ' K-Awards ', ' Career Development Programs K-Series ', ' Career Development Awards and Programs ', ' Career Development Awards ', ' K-Series Research Career Programs ', ' Research Training ', ' Subgroup ', ' Surveillance Methods ', ' Low Prevalence ', ' Monitor ', ' Hot Spot ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socio-economically ', ' socio-economic ', ' socioeconomics ', ' point of care ', ' Behavioral ', ' diabetic management ', ' diabetes management ', ' glycemic control ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' community based participatory research ', ' participatory action research ', ' community based research ', ' community based design ', ' high risk ', ' diabetes control ', ' limb amputation ', ' amputated limb ', ' food environment ', ' racial disparity ', ' race disparity ', ' disparities in race ', ' disparity reduction ', ' reduce disparity ', ' health care availability ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare access ', ' health care service availability ', ' health care service access ', ' accessibility to healthcare ', ' accessibility to health care ', ' accessibility of health care ', ' access to healthcare ', ' access to health care ', ' healthcare community ', ' health care community ', ' ']",NIDDK,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,K23,2016,188154,0.07579936405432622
"Neighborhood Change: Impact on Sleep and Obesity-Related Health Disparities DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Individuals living in socioeconomically disadvantaged neighborhoods have disproportionately high rates of obesity and obesity-related morbidity, including increased risk for physical role limitations and cardiovascular diseases (CVD). Studies of potential mechanisms linking neighborhood disadvantage with health outcomes have primarily focused on daytime health behaviors, including diet or physical activity. However, sleep is a critical health behavior that is associated with neighborhood disadvantage, and may play a causal role in explaining the links between neighborhood disadvantage and health. However, the extant research on neighborhood disadvantage and sleep is based exclusively on cross-sectional data, using self-reports of sleep and neighborhood characteristics. Building on the existing research infrastructure developed by our team's previously funded, ongoing studies, we have a unique and important opportunity to study whether changes in the built and social environment, stimulated by substantial economic investment improves sleep, and in turn, reduces obesity-related health disparities. The study cohort includes a randomly selected cohort of 1100 low- income, African American adults, from two urban neighborhoods, one of which is undergoing a dramatic revitalization over the next 5 years (i.e., the intervention neighborhood), and the other (the sociodemographically-matched control neighborhood) is not undergoing any such changes. We will add longitudinal assessments of sleep using actigraphy, self-reports, and in a subsample of 300, objective, in-home monitoring of obstructive sleep apnea, to provide a rich characterization of sleep profiles before, during, and, after neighborhood changes. Evidence gained from this study would have substantial scientific and policy implications for identifying novel individual-level and neighborhood level factors that contribute to striking and pervasive racial and socioeconomic disparities in health. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Individuals living in socioeconomically disadvantaged neighborhoods have significantly higher rates of obesity and obesity-related health problems, including physical role limitations and cardiovascular diseases (CVD). Sleep is a critical health behavior that is associated with neighborhood disadvantage and health consequences. Therefore, sleep may serve as an important pathway linking neighborhood disadvantage with obesity and physical role limitations. Our study represents a unique opportunity to evaluate whether improvements in neighborhood conditions, spurred by substantial economic revitalization, improves sleep and in turn, mitigates obesity-related health disparities in a high-risk adult population.

"Limited English Proficiency, Health, and Healthcare among Older Immigrants DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Limited English proficiency (LEP) is a unique vulnerability of older immigrants that poses a significant risk to health and healthcare. Given tha social and environmental contexts play a critical role in the lives of persons with LEP, this application investigates how social connectedness and neighborhood/community characteristics (e.g., ethnic density, health service environments in the neighborhood) influence the link between LEP and health/healthcare. We used Korean American elders as the target group. Our selection was based on the fact that they are members of a rapidly expanding LEP population (i.e., Korean is ranked 4th in the languages spoken by LEP individuals in the U.S.) and that they manifest marked disparities in health and healthcare. The project aims to explore the direct and interactive roles of social connectedness and neighborhood characteristics (1) in the relation between LEP and health and (2) in the relation between LEP and healthcare. The negative impact of LEP on health/healthcare is expected to be greater when individuals lack social connections and/or when they live in areas lack ethnically oriented resources and services. The project employs an innovative and synergistic mix of Social Network Analysis (SNA) and Geographic Information Systems (GIS). To capture the heterogeneity of the population, we will use 3 sites that combine to represent a continuum of Korean American population density: New York (high), Texas (intermediate) and Florida (low). Following focus groups with Community Advisory Boards, direct assessments of ethnic communities will be conducted. At each site, a master list of ethnically oriented services (including health services) will be generated, and each identified service will be geo-coded. Subsequently, 900 Korean Americans (aged e 65, 300 at each site) will be surveyed using a probability sampling procedure. In addition to the traditional survey measures, name-generator approaches will be used to explore participants' social network members and places for healthcare. Using SNA, information from the name generators (names and addresses of people and places) will be indexed to represent (1) social connectedness and (2) engagement with health services at the community. Using GIS, the survey data will be linked to a file combining the 2010 Census and the area resource map derived from the direct community assessment. The combined file will include variables such as proportions of Koreans in the neighborhood and general as well as ethnically-oriented area health services. Multi-Level Models (MLM) will be used to explore the research questions and hypotheses. The results will not only enhance our understanding of the mechanisms underlying LEP vulnerability but also identify individual- and community-level factors (both in people and places) that could be used in health planning and interventions. The overall approach and findings will inform how to develop effective interventions to reduce language barriers and ensure access to appropriate health services for diverse LEP populations. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The application is in response to the NIA's interests in social, behavioral, cultural, and environmental context in addressing racial/ethnic health disparities, and the outcomes will inform how to effectively address health inequities. Results will enhance interventions directed at the 47 million Americans with linguistic barriers.","Limited English Proficiency, Health, and Healthcare among Older Immigrants",9065467,R01AG047106,"['senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Elderly ', ' Reactive Site ', ' Combining Site ', ' Binding Sites ', ' Health Service Area ', ' Catchment Area (Health) ', ' Censuses ', ' Communities ', ' Environment ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' Florida ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Health ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Planning ', ' Health Services ', ' Level of Health ', ' Health Status ', ' indexing ', ' In element ', ' Indium ', ' Language ', ' Linguistic ', ' Linguistics ', ' Maps ', ' Persons ', ' Names ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' New York ', ' Play ', ' Population Density ', ' Probability Samples ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Stress ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Testing ', ' Texas ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' population diversity ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' diverse populations ', ' Social Network ', ' base ', ' density ', ' Procedures ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Link ', ' Ensure ', ' Individual ', ' Immigrant ', ' Koreans ', ' Life ', ' Complex ', ' interest ', ' Services ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' Korean American ', ' Participant ', ' member ', ' social ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Rho12 ', ' RHOH12 ', ' RHOA ', ' H12 ', ' ARH12 ', ' RHOA gene ', ' geospatial information system ', ' Geographic Information Systems ', ' Network Analysis ', ' Pathway Analysis ', ' Modeling ', ' behavioral health ', ' response ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Subgroup ', ' Characteristics ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' aged ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' community based participatory research ', ' participatory action research ', ' community based research ', ' community based design ', ' effective intervention ', ' Limited English Proficiency ', ' community partnership ', ' ethnic health disparity ', ' health service use ', ' health service utilization ', ' ']",NIA,"UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS, AUSTIN",R01,2016,261914,0.048588164574924056
"The Impacts of Early Neighborhoods on Racial Disparities in Adult Health Outcomes ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  We have come to understand that racial disparities in adult health outcomes are affected by exposures and experiences over the life span. Early life exposures and experiences 1) affect later health outcomes 2) accumulate over time and 3) vary tremendously by racial group. Life course research has focused primarily on specific aspects of childhood family contexts that demonstrate the ""long arm"" of childhood exposures on adult health. Meanwhile, there is recognition that neighborhood context may contribute to racial disparities in health over the life course. Studies demonstrate that childhood neighborhood context is associated with child health, and adulthood neighborhood context is associated with adult health. However, these primarily cross-sectional studies demonstrate nonexistent or only modest associations between neighborhood context and health. Notably, few studies examine how neighborhood context in childhood affects racial disparities in adult health, or how racial disparities in childhood neighborhood context may contribute to racial disparities in adult health. Previous work has been hampered by lack of access to appropriate longitudinal data, and methodological limitations.  This project extends prior research by using two complementary longitudinal datasets and novel methods to examine the long reach of contextual exposures in childhood on racial disparities in adult health outcomes. We have two specific aims: (1) Calculate upper bound estimates of the plausible total impact of all childhood contextual factors on black/white disparities in adult health outcomes. Borrowing economic and demographic methods used in educational research, we examine correlations between geographically close and geographically distant individuals to evaluate the extent to which the totality of childhood contextual factors affect adult cardiovascular, metabolic, mental, and self-rated status health outcomes and compare these correlations by racial group. (2) Estimate the contribution of long-term exposure to neighborhood disadvantage during childhood on black/white racial disparities in adult health outcomes. While Aim 1 establishes plausible upper bounds for childhood contextual effects on a variety of adult health outcomes, it does not address duration of exposure and remains agnostic about the specific nature of relevant exposures. Aim 2 extends Aim 1 by using information on neighborhood exposures over time-up to two decades--and using new bio statistical methods to examine the effects of cumulative neighborhood disadvantage across the life course on racial disparities in adult health. The aim both examines the contribution of racial disparities in childhood cumulative neighborhood disadvantage on racial disparities in adult health and examines whether the impacts of cumulative neighborhood disadvantage differ between black and white individuals.  Our analyses allow explicit comparisons of earlier contextual effects across health domains to ask which domains of racial health disparities appear most or least affected by childhood cumulative contextual factors. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  This project uses two complementary longitudinal datasets and multiple novel methods to examine the childhood contextual determinants of racial disparities in a variety of health outcomes in adulthood. We first provide upper bound estimates of the plausible total impact of all childhood contextual factors on racial disparities in adult cardiovascular, metabolic, mental, and self-rated status health outcomes. We then examine the extent to which racial differences in exposure to childhood neighborhood disadvantage explain racial disparities in adult health as well as examine whether the impacts of the duration of exposure to childhood neighborhood disadvantage vary by race.",The Impacts of Early Neighborhoods on Racial Disparities in Adult Health Outcomes,9346999,R56AG052513,"['adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Biometrics ', ' Biometry ', ' circulatory system ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Cardio-vascular ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' Child Health ', ' Child health care ', ' Disease Frequency Surveys ', ' Cross-Sectional Survey ', ' Cross-Sectional Analyses ', ' Cross Sectional Analysis ', ' Cross-Sectional Studies ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Economics ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Environment ', ' Family ', ' Future ', ' Health ', ' Level of Health ', ' Health Status ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' life course ', ' Life Cycle ', ' Life Cycle Stages ', ' Literature ', ' lifespan ', ' life span ', ' Length of Life ', ' Longevity ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Methods ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Obesity ', ' Public Health ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Research ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Schools ', ' Social Sciences ', ' Sociology ', ' Time ', ' Caucasians ', ' white race ', ' Occidental ', ' Caucasoid Race ', ' Caucasoid ', ' Caucasian Race ', ' Caucasian ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' mental ', ' Psyche structure ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' Discipline ', ' Individual ', ' young adulthood ', ' adult youth ', ' young adult ', ' Inequality ', ' root ', ' Plant Roots ', ' Metabolic ', ' Exposure to ', ' Nature ', ' Knowledge ', ' Source ', ' physical health ', ' physical conditioning ', ' Application Context ', ' contextual factors ', ' experience ', ' novel ', ' peer ', ' race differences ', ' racial difference ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' cardiovascular risk ', ' cardiovascular risk factor ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' theories ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' Binding ', ' Address ', ' Length ', ' Biostatistical Methods ', ' Data ', ' Effectiveness of Interventions ', ' Process ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' prospective ', ' comparative ', ' stem ', ' geographically distant ', ' early life exposure ', ' arm ', ' racial disparity ', ' race disparity ', ' disparities in race ', ' racial health disparity ', ' racial disparities in health ', ' black/white disparity ', ' neighborhood disadvantage ', ' ']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,R56,2016,300000,0.12434169699017188
"Natural Experiment of Neighborhood Revitalization and Cardiometabolic Health ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Individuals living in socioeconomically disadvantaged neighborhoods have disproportionately high rates of obesity and related morbidity, including increased risk for diabetes and cardiovascular diseases (CVD). Although previous research has made significant contributions to our understanding of the health consequences associated with neighborhood disadvantage, causal relationships have been difficult to establish due to a reliance on cross-sectional designs, selection biases and limited data on potential mechanisms. Building on the existing research infrastructure developed by our team's previously funded, ongoing natural experiment studies, we have a unique opportunity to study whether changes to the built and social environment, stimulated by substantial ($160 million) economic investment in housing development and neighborhood revitalization, improves cardio-metabolic outcomes in the ""intervention"" neighborhood relative to the matched ""control"" neighborhood which is not undergoing such changes. The study includes a randomly selected cohort of 732 low-income, African American adults, from two urban neighborhoods (intervention and control communities). Our study will be the first natural experiment to examine the impact of a place-based natural experiment strategy (rather than residential mobility strategy) on clinically relevant cardio-metabolic outcomes (BMI, HbA1c, blood pressure, and lipids) in a high-risk, though understudied, African American population. We will leverage existing data from our previously funded studies on potential mediators, including measures of the built and social environment, and health behaviors including diet, physical activity and sleep (objective and subjective measures). In this proposal, we will add measured cardio-metabolic outcomes, including blood pressure, HbA1c, and lipids. The next stage of economic revitalization of the intervention neighborhood is focused on redevelopment of housing. Thus, in addition, the proposed study is optimally timed to add survey measures of perceptions of housing conditions, neighborhood-level audits of housing conditions, and compilation of secondary data from publically available resources on housing sales, vacancy rates, etc.,             before and after the housing changes occur. Understanding the impact and pattern of neighborhood revitalization as it unfolds over time is critical in the arsenal of policies to mitigte pervasive racial/ ethnic and socioeconomic disparities in obesity and cardio-metabolic health.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Individuals living in socioeconomically disadvantaged neighborhoods have significantly higher rates of obesity and obesity-related health problems, including cardiovascular diseases (CVD) and diabetes. Our study is the first of its kind to evaluate whether improvements in neighborhood conditions, spurred by substantial neighborhood-level revitalization in a predominantly African American (AA) neighborhood improves residents' cardio-metabolic risk factors (obesity, glycated hemoglobin, cholesterol, and, blood pressure) relative to a comparison neighborhood that is not undergoing such changes. Prior studies of similar redevelopment initiatives lack the comparative research design, and none, to our knowledge, have measured cardio-metabolic risk factors in a high-risk, yet understudied African American resident base. Findings from this longitudinal study would provide critical evidence concerning the causal impact of a major policy initiative to redevelop high-poverty neighborhoods on the cardiovascular health of the community.        ",Natural Experiment of Neighborhood Revitalization and Cardiometabolic Health,9252297,R01HL131531,"['adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Affect ', ' Blood Pressure ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' Cholesterol ', ' Cities ', ' Communities ', ' Control Groups ', ' diabetes ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' dietary ', ' Diet ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Economics ', ' Environment ', ' Esthetics ', ' Experimental Designs ', ' Glycated Hemoglobins ', ' Glycosylated Hemoglobin ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' Level of Health ', ' Health Status ', ' hemoglobin A1c ', ' Hemoglobin A(1) ', ' HbA1c ', ' HbA1 ', ' Hb A1c ', ' Hb A1a+b ', ' Hb A1 ', ' Glycohemoglobin A ', ' Glycosylated hemoglobin A ', ' Housing ', ' Investments ', ' Lipids ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Obesity ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Perception ', ' Poverty ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Research Design ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Residential Mobility ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Safety ', ' Sales ', ' Selection Bias ', ' Sleep ', ' Social Conditions ', ' Societal Conditions ', ' Social Environment ', ' socioenvironment ', ' social context ', ' social climate ', ' Stress ', ' stroke ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' brain attack ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Apoplexy ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' Businesses ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Physical activity ', ' Distress ', ' Individual ', ' Policies ', ' Multidisciplinary Research ', ' Multidisciplinary Collaboration ', ' Interdisciplinary Research ', ' Interdisciplinary Study ', ' Funding ', ' Metabolic ', ' Shapes ', ' Pattern ', ' Physical environment ', ' Supermarket ', ' Services ', ' experience ', ' cohesion ', ' cohort ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Self-Report ', ' disorder risk ', ' disease risk ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' social ', ' Sampling ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' cardiovascular disorder risk ', ' cardiovascular disease risk ', ' diabetes risk ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Low income ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Data ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Infrastructure ', ' lifestyle factors ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' Community Health ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socio-economically ', ' socio-economic ', ' socioeconomics ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' years of life lost to disease ', ' years of life lost to disability ', ' disease burden ', ' burden of disease ', ' burden of illness ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' cost efficient ', ' Population ', ' Natural experiment ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' clinically relevant ', ' clinical relevance ', ' comparative ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' high risk ', ' public health relevance ', ' secondary outcome ', ' population health ', ' longitudinal design ', ' socioeconomic disparity ', ' socioeconomic disadvantage ', ' socioeconomically underprivileged ', ' Socioeconomically disadvantaged ', ' cardiovascular health ', ' cardiometabolic risk ', ' cardio-metabolic risk ', ' built environment ', ' Green space ', ' greenspace ', ' walkability ', ' walkable ', ' neighborhood disadvantage ', ' disadvantaged population ', ' ']",NHLBI,RAND CORPORATION,R01,2017,569757,0.17657681073724985
"At-Risk Neighborhoods and Health Outcomes ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): It is our contention that gangland residence may have a unique effect on population health that is not reducible to crime, even if we were able to objectively and accurately measure crime. The nature of gang activities and violence remains a plausibly unique contributor to population health-a factor that has been largely unexplored despite its potential effect on population health and health disparities. We further argue that birh outcomes are a relevant barometer for population health, given the responsiveness of this outcome to changing social conditions and due to the fact that we are able to assess birth outcomes with a large sample in highly diverse neighborhood settings, over a long period of time. Our project goals for this exploratory/developmental (R21) research proposal are simple, we want to assess whether gangland residence is associated with population health and health disparities. Given the pervasiveness of gangs in Los Angeles County, the large variation in neighborhood types, and the responsiveness of birth outcomes to dynamic social conditions-this project has the capability to shed light on an under-researched social determinant of health. Our aims are as follows:  Aim 1. To determine if gangland residence has an independent effect on adverse birth outcomes, net of neighborhood crime and socio-demographics such as poverty and economic and racial/ethnic composition.  Aim 2. To determine if gangland residence compounds the effect of neighborhood-level crime.  Aim 3. To determine whether gang injunctions are efficacious for improving population health.  Aim 4. To assess whether gangland residence accounts for adverse birth outcome disparities.  This project is an attempt to uncover independent effects of gangland residence on population health and if successful, will provide a baseline for future gangland community health research. We believe the project's innovation will assuage any fears of it being a relatively risky endeavor and that is why we feel that an R21 is the perfect mechanism for such an approach. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This exploratory/developmental proposal seeks to study a previously unexplored social dynamic, co-residence with gang members and it effect on population health and health disparities. Given the recent spread of gangs, beyond traditional gang-addled communities in LA, NY, and Chicago, for example, the effects of gangland residence may have important health implications for the entire nation, given the unique impact that gangs have on crime and social conditions within a community. The potential mechanisms affecting health seem apparent: increased a greater likelihood of directly experiencing violence, increased risk of being exposed to crime and violence, fear of crime, stress, and reduced social interaction; gangland co-residence may be associated with each of these factors, although its potential effects may not be reducible solely to crime.",At-Risk Neighborhoods and Health Outcomes,9242040,R21HD088066,"['Affect ', ' Parturition ', ' Birth ', ' California ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Chicago ', ' Communities ', ' Conflict ', ' Conflict (Psychology) ', ' Crime ', ' Crowding ', ' Economics ', ' Emigrations ', ' Epidemic ', ' Exercise ', ' Fear ', ' Fright ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Hand ', ' Health ', ' sound perception ', ' hearing perception ', ' Hearing ', ' Homicide ', ' Latin America ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Los Angeles ', ' mortality ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Plague ', ' Yersinia pestis disease ', ' Poverty ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Research Proposals ', ' Risk ', ' Social Change ', ' Social transformation ', ' Social modification ', ' Social Conditions ', ' Societal Conditions ', ' Social Interaction ', ' Socialization ', ' Stress ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' violent behavior ', ' violent ', ' Violence ', ' War ', ' County ', ' Measures ', ' Racial Segregation ', ' segregation ', ' Walking ', ' Injury ', ' suburbia ', ' suburban ', ' suburb ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Adolescent ', ' residential site ', ' residence ', ' Exposure to ', ' Nature ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' Country ', ' experience ', ' social space ', ' member ', ' gang ', ' social ', ' Sampling ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Data ', ' Collection ', ' Community Health ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' gang violence ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' aged ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' 19 year old ', ' nineteen years old ', ' nineteen year old ', ' age 19 years ', ' 19 years of age ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' demographics ', ' public health relevance ', ' population health ', ' social health determinants ', ' violent crime ', ' ']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,R21,2017,206250,0.04890796171245605
"Impact of the Built Environment on Child Body Mass Index Project Summary The last several years have witnessed growing interest in the potential contribution of the “built environment” to the epidemic increase in obesity rates in the United States. This includes both the large structural aspects of the neighborhood and physical characteristics of homes and schools at the very micro level (the interiors and associated grounds of these buildings). The structural aspects of the neighborhood that surround the home and school includes urban design features such as streets and highways, land use mix, street connectivity, public transportation infrastructure (i.e., subway stations), park land, and recreational infrastructure, all of which could affect both physical activity and the accessibility of food and other resources. The physical characteristics of the home or school—including building size, the presence of elevators, stairs, spaces for physical activity, and related factors—could determine opportunities for physical activity and amount of activity needed to navigate the space. Thus far not established is how each of these factors contributes to childhood BMI in a distinct and interconnected way and/or how changes in such factors could influence obesity rates in a causal manner. This gap in knowledge is particularly troubling given the high cost of changing the built environment as well as the longevity of investments once made. Our research promises to provide insight critical to policymakers planning urban infrastructure investment. Particularly important to consider are disparities, and whether differences in the built environment could explain differences in obesity rates in key demographic groups, including income and race/ethnicity. We propose to combine New York City Department of Education FITNESSGRAM data, which includes BMI, school and residential locations, for all New York City public school children from 2005 onward, with detailed data on the built environment surrounding each child’s home and school as well as within their home and school. Then, we will use a variety of enhanced methodological techniques to estimate a less-biased, more causal relationship between the built environment and obesity. The methodological enhancements we utilize over past work are:  • A large, detailed dataset, including data on over 1 million NYC public school children.  • Examining longitudinally the same children over time, using both child, school and census tract level  fixed effects, among other methods, to determine casualty.  • Examining fine-grained differences in the built environment. For example, the relative influence of  living within 500 feet of a park or other built environment resources  • Data on both the home and school built environment, both inside the building and in the  neighborhood, modeled together. With these enhancements, we will be able to provide improved estimates on the influence of the built environment on child BMI, substantially answering key health and policy-related questions.

"Using Geographically Targeted and Community-Based Methods to Identify Factors Associated with Micro-Level Disparities in Diabetic Outcomes and Enhance Monitoring of Glycemic Control Among Black Men Project Summary / Abstract  This mentored patient-oriented research career development award (K23) will support Dr. David Lee’s training and research to use geographically targeted and community-based methods to identify factors associated with micro-level disparities in diabetic outcomes and enhance monitoring of glycemic control among Black men. Though the prevalence of diabetes is increasing nationally, current diabetes surveillance methods are unable to identify hot spots of poor diabetic outcomes at a community level. However, studies based on a novel geographic method of diabetes surveillance have found that the increase in diabetes burden has been focused in specific communities, especially among Black neighborhoods. For Black adults, poor diabetes control has been associated with fewer primary care visits, less frequent HbA1c testing, and higher rates of emergency department use and hospitalizations, especially among diabetic Black men. Given this infrequent interaction with a usual source of healthcare, community-based settings may provide the advantages of pre- existing trust and engagement to optimize health outcomes for high-risk populations living in neighborhoods that are hot spots of diabetic complications. Thus, the specific aims of this proposal are 1) to use geospatial and quantitative methods to identify which micro-contextual factors account for local disparities in diabetic outcomes among Black communities, 2) to use geographically-targeted qualitative interviews to identify neighborhood-level factors that explain poor diabetic outcomes in certain Black communities, and 3) to perform community-based HbA1c testing and diabetes self-care surveys among Black men living in neighborhoods with a high prevalence of diabetic complications. This community-based research will leverage existing partnerships within a network of local Black-owned barbershops in New York City. Barbershops have become increasingly effective sites for promoting health and measuring health outcomes among Black men, a population which has high rates of mortality and morbidity from diabetes. The results of this research will inform future R-series applications to expand this approach to other high-risk subgroups in Black neighborhoods and other racial and ethnic communities with extremely poor diabetic outcomes. Dr. Lee’s training goals closely parallel his research aims and will further enhance his understanding of: 1) advanced quantitative analysis, 2) qualitative and mixed methods, 3) social and behavioral science, and 4) diabetes education and management. The proposed research and training will be conducted at the New York University School of Medicine and leverage resources of the other professional schools at NYU, which offer outstanding opportunities for collaboration, learning, and multidisciplinary research. This environment, in addition to his research and training plan will provide Dr. Lee with a strong foundation from which he can accelerate his career towards his goal of becoming a fully independent clinical investigator dedicated to reducing disparities in diabetes burden and improving health outcomes in communities that are overwhelmed by diabetic complications. PROJECT NARRATIVE  The overall burden of diabetes is increasing nationally, but specific neighborhoods, especially in Black communities, have experienced a disproportionately higher prevalence of diabetes and its complications such as kidney failure and lower extremity amputations. The goal of the proposed research is to use a mix of quantitative and qualitative methods to identify the micro-contextual factors that account for local disparities in diabetic outcomes among Black communities with a high versus low prevalence of diabetic complications and to enhance the monitoring of glycemic control in neighborhoods with especially poor diabetic outcomes. This K23 career development award will foster Dr. David Lee’s transition to becoming a fully-independent investigator capable of conducting high-impact research to enhance our understanding of local disparities in diabetic outcomes among communities with overwhelming diabetes burden.",Using Geographically Targeted and Community-Based Methods to Identify Factors Associated with Micro-Level Disparities in Diabetic Outcomes and Enhance Monitoring of Glycemic Control Among Black Men,9332387,K23DK110316,"['adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Outpatient Care ', ' Ambulatory Care ', ' Amputation ', ' Behavioral Sciences ', ' Clinical Investigator ', ' Communities ', ' diabetes ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Emergencies ', ' Emergency Situation ', ' Environment ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Geography ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Level of Health ', ' Health Status ', ' hemoglobin A1c ', ' Hemoglobin A(1) ', ' HbA1c ', ' HbA1 ', ' Hb A1c ', ' Hb A1a+b ', ' Hb A1 ', ' Glycohemoglobin A ', ' Glycosylated hemoglobin A ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Interview ', ' Learning ', ' Lower Extremity ', ' Membrum inferius ', ' Lower Limb ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' New York ', ' New York City ', ' Play ', ' Poverty ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Primary Care ', ' Kidney Failure ', ' Renal Insufficiency ', ' Renal Failure ', ' Kidney Insufficiency ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Schools ', ' medical schools ', ' school of medicine ', ' medical college ', ' Self Care ', ' personal care ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' Measures ', ' Self Management ', ' base ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Series ', ' Training ', ' social norm ', ' Trust ', ' diabetic ', ' Fostering ', ' Multidisciplinary Research ', ' Multidisciplinary Collaboration ', ' Interdisciplinary Research ', ' Interdisciplinary Study ', ' Collaborations ', ' Spottings ', ' Complications of Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Diabetic Complications ', ' Diabetes-Related Complications ', ' Diabetes Complications ', ' Source ', ' contextual factors ', ' Application Context ', ' Visit ', ' Accident and Emergency department ', ' Emergency room ', ' Emergency Department ', ' behavioral/social science ', ' diabetes education ', ' experience ', ' knowledge base ', ' knowledgebase ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' social ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' Address ', ' Qualitative Methods ', ' qualitative reasoning ', ' Data ', ' High Prevalence ', ' Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award ', ' Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award (K23) ', ' K23 Program ', ' K23 Mechanism ', ' K23 Award ', ' K-Series Research Career Programs ', ' Research Career Program ', ' K-Awards ', ' Career Development Programs K-Series ', ' Career Development Awards and Programs ', ' Career Development Awards ', ' Research Training ', ' Subgroup ', ' Surveillance Methods ', ' Low Prevalence ', ' Monitor ', ' Hot Spot ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socio-economically ', ' socio-economic ', ' socioeconomics ', ' point of care ', ' Behavioral ', ' diabetic management ', ' diabetes management ', ' glycemic control ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' community based participatory research ', ' participatory action research ', ' community based research ', ' community based design ', ' high risk ', ' diabetes control ', ' limb amputation ', ' amputated limb ', ' food environment ', ' racial disparity ', ' race disparity ', ' disparities in race ', ' disparity reduction ', ' reduce disparity ', ' health care availability ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare access ', ' health care service availability ', ' health care service access ', ' accessibility to healthcare ', ' accessibility to health care ', ' accessibility of health care ', ' access to healthcare ', ' access to health care ', ' healthcare community ', ' health care community ', ' high risk population ', ' high risk group ', ' ']",NIDDK,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,K23,2017,199611,0.07579936405432622
"The Effects of Education on Mortality: Evidence from a Large Representative  Sample of American Twins PROJECT SUMMARY Does education change people’s lives in a way that delays mortality? Or is education merely a proxy for unobserved endowments that promote longevity? Most scholars conclude that the former is true, but new evidence by Behrman et al.—who compare the mortality outcomes of Danish twins who differ on educational attainment—calls this conclusion into question. Unfortunately, Behrman et al.’s potentially field-changing finding—that obtaining additional schooling has no independent effect on survival net of other hard-to-observe characteristics—has not yet been subject to replication in the United States or other non-Scandinavian countries. Nor is there a strong scholarly consensus regarding the use of twin data to identify the causal effect of education on mortality in the general population. To address these and other concerns, we will produce the first U.S.-based estimates of the effects of education on mortality (and any variation in those effects that exists across sub-groups and/or birth cohorts), using a large and representative panel of twins drawn from linked complete-count Census records. For comparison purposes, and to shed additional light on the specific roles that neighborhood, family, and genetic factors play in confounding associations between education and mortality, we will also produce parallel estimates of the education-mortality relationship using data on (1) non-twin pairs who lived in different neighborhoods during childhood; (2) non-twin pairs who shared the same neighborhood growing up; and (3) non-twin siblings who shared the same family environment but whose genetic endowments vary to a greater degree. Findings from this research will have major implications for our understanding of educational gradients in mortality and should provide a useful foundation for future work examining the etiology of human survival. NARRATIVE Understanding and reducing socioeconomic disparities in health and mortality has long been a high priority on America’s research and public health agenda. Educational gradients in mortality are well documented, but recent twin-based research outside of the U.S. raises important questions about whether education can be effectively used as a policy lever to reduce inequalities in longevity. Our research will transform our assessment of the causal effect of education on mortality and of how that effect varies across population subgroups.",The Effects of Education on Mortality: Evidence from a Large Representative  Sample of American Twins,9387037,R21AG054824,"['Affect ', ' Americas ', ' Parturition ', ' Birth ', ' Censuses ', ' Death Records ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Endowment ', ' Environment ', ' Family ', ' Feasibility Studies ', ' Female ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Hand ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Infant ', ' Investments ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Longevity ', ' lifespan ', ' life span ', ' Length of Life ', ' male ', ' Methodology ', ' mortality ', ' Names ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Play ', ' Public Health ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Records ', ' Research ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Schools ', ' Siblings ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Twins ', ' Twin Multiple Birth ', ' United States ', ' Weight ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Longitudinal Surveys ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' base ', ' Procedures ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Link ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' Individual ', ' young adulthood ', ' adult youth ', ' young adult ', ' Policies ', ' Inequality ', ' Funding ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Genetic ', ' Consensus ', ' American ', ' cohort ', ' family genetics ', ' Proxy ', ' General Population ', ' General Public ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' boys ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Etiology ', ' disease causation ', ' causation ', ' Causality ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Subgroup ', ' Characteristics ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socio-economically ', ' socio-economic ', ' socioeconomics ', ' cost ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' prospective ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' socioeconomic disparity ', ' longitudinal dataset ', ' longitudinal data set ', ' data resource ', ' ']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA,R21,2017,233550,0.06443548004002916
"Healthy Life Expectancy Among Older Hispanics:  Individual and Neighborhood Influences Project Summary As life expectancy increases, questions arise about the quality of the additional years of life. Data consistently shows a Hispanic mortality advantage, especially among older adults. However, despite comparatively longer life expectancy, Hispanic elders are also at high risk of disease and disability. Therefore, the first goal of the proposed research is to analyze two NIH-funded datasets to identify changes in healthy life expectancy among very old Mexican-Americans as compared to otherwise similar non- Hispanic whites. Increases in proportion of life spent without disability would be evidence of compression of morbidity, whereas decreases in proportion of life spent without disability would be evidence of expansion of morbidity. Studies show that morbidity and disability trajectories (and hence healthy life expectancy) differs significantly across sub-populations (e.g. immigrants) and are also influenced by the neighborhood context. Therefore, the second aim of this study is to do sub-group analyses. This includes analyses by specific diseases, by demographic and SES groups, and by neighborhood variables. These goals will be accomplished using data on Mexican American elders from the Hispanic Established Populations for the Epidemiologic Study of the Elderly (H-EPESE). Non-Hispanic white elders will be sampled from the Health and Retirement Study (HRS) as the comparison group. Sullivan method will be used to calculate the life expectancy of each cross-sectional cohort, and multi-level modeling will be used to determine the relative influence of individual and neighborhood level characteristics. Results from the data would allow for measurement of population health over time for a growing and vulnerable population of elders. At the same time, results would allow for targeted interventions at both individual as well as neighborhood level variables. Understanding trends in healthy life expectancy is particularly important in a country with an already overburdened health services system5 since interventions that are targeted at particularly vulnerable groups may be more effective than those aimed at the general population34. Public Health Relevance Statements From both an individual and a societal level, living longer lives in good health is desirable. Recent research suggests that healthy life expectancy among very old Mexican Americans (compared to the general older population) may be on the decline. This is a growing and vulnerable population, and information about healthy life expectancy will be essential to guide public health officials as they allocate limited resources.",Healthy Life Expectancy Among Older Hispanics:  Individual and Neighborhood Influences,9282179,R03MD011390,"['adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Elderly ', ' Parturition ', ' Birth ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' CDC ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' Data Collection ', ' type II DM ', ' type 2 DM ', ' maturity onset diabetes ', ' ketosis resistant diabetes ', ' adult onset diabetes ', ' Type II diabetes ', ' Type II Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Type 2 diabetes ', ' Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus ', ' T2DM ', ' T2D ', ' T2 DM ', ' Stable Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Slow-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Noninsulin Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Non-Insulin Dependent Diabetes ', ' NIDDM ', ' Maturity-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' MODY ', ' Ketosis-Resistant Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Adult-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Family ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health Services ', ' Immigration ', ' Life Expectancy ', ' Life Tables ', ' Literature ', ' Long-Term Care ', ' extended care ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Mexican Americans ', ' Chicanos ', ' Chicanas ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Obesity ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Public Health ', ' Publishing ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Societies ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Hispanics ', ' Uninsured ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Chronic ', ' disability ', ' Individual ', ' Measurement ', ' Funding ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Immigrant ', ' Life ', ' Country ', ' American ', ' cohort ', ' disorder prevention ', ' disease prevention ', ' disorder risk ', ' disease risk ', ' epidemiology study ', ' epidemiologic investigation ', ' Epidemiology Research ', ' Epidemiological Studies ', ' Epidemiologic Studies ', ' Epidemiologic Research ', ' multilevel analysis ', ' multilevel modeling ', ' multilevel model ', ' methods to study multiple-level influences ', ' Sampling ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' vulnerable group ', ' low socioeconomic status ', ' low socioeconomic position ', ' low socio-economic status ', ' low socio-economic position ', ' low SES ', ' Data ', ' Subgroup ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' Older Population ', ' trend ', ' Characteristics ', ' comparison group ', ' years of life lost to disease ', ' years of life lost to disability ', ' disease burden ', ' burden of disease ', ' burden of illness ', ' Minority ', ' Population ', ' aged ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' disability burden ', ' comparative ', ' loss of function ', ' high risk ', ' public health relevance ', ' population health ', ' racial disparity ', ' race disparity ', ' disparities in race ', ' built environment ', ' Health and Retirement Study ', ' ']",NIMHD,UNIVERSITY OF GEORGIA,R03,2017,75000,0.03650970051515711
"Limited English Proficiency, Health, and Healthcare among Older Immigrants DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Limited English proficiency (LEP) is a unique vulnerability of older immigrants that poses a significant risk to health and healthcare. Given tha social and environmental contexts play a critical role in the lives of persons with LEP, this application investigates how social connectedness and neighborhood/community characteristics (e.g., ethnic density, health service environments in the neighborhood) influence the link between LEP and health/healthcare. We used Korean American elders as the target group. Our selection was based on the fact that they are members of a rapidly expanding LEP population (i.e., Korean is ranked 4th in the languages spoken by LEP individuals in the U.S.) and that they manifest marked disparities in health and healthcare. The project aims to explore the direct and interactive roles of social connectedness and neighborhood characteristics (1) in the relation between LEP and health and (2) in the relation between LEP and healthcare. The negative impact of LEP on health/healthcare is expected to be greater when individuals lack social connections and/or when they live in areas lack ethnically oriented resources and services. The project employs an innovative and synergistic mix of Social Network Analysis (SNA) and Geographic Information Systems (GIS). To capture the heterogeneity of the population, we will use 3 sites that combine to represent a continuum of Korean American population density: New York (high), Texas (intermediate) and Florida (low). Following focus groups with Community Advisory Boards, direct assessments of ethnic communities will be conducted. At each site, a master list of ethnically oriented services (including health services) will be generated, and each identified service will be geo-coded. Subsequently, 900 Korean Americans (aged e 65, 300 at each site) will be surveyed using a probability sampling procedure. In addition to the traditional survey measures, name-generator approaches will be used to explore participants' social network members and places for healthcare. Using SNA, information from the name generators (names and addresses of people and places) will be indexed to represent (1) social connectedness and (2) engagement with health services at the community. Using GIS, the survey data will be linked to a file combining the 2010 Census and the area resource map derived from the direct community assessment. The combined file will include variables such as proportions of Koreans in the neighborhood and general as well as ethnically-oriented area health services. Multi-Level Models (MLM) will be used to explore the research questions and hypotheses. The results will not only enhance our understanding of the mechanisms underlying LEP vulnerability but also identify individual- and community-level factors (both in people and places) that could be used in health planning and interventions. The overall approach and findings will inform how to develop effective interventions to reduce language barriers and ensure access to appropriate health services for diverse LEP populations. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The application is in response to the NIA's interests in social, behavioral, cultural, and environmental context in addressing racial/ethnic health disparities, and the outcomes will inform how to effectively address health inequities.

"Social factors influencing pregnancy outcome disparities ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Latina paradox is robust, but not uniformly protective against adverse pregnancy outcomes. Latinas are at risk for poor birth outcomes like inappropriate weight gain, pregnancy-induced hypertension / eclampsia, and inappropriate gestational weight gain. Despite work indicating the importance of country of origin (nativity) for Latina health, minimal work has explored the role of nativity. Documentation status- another source of social stress- also differs across subgroups with implications for POs. Further, Latinas, particularly undocumented women, tend to reside in under-resourced neighborhoods, which puts them at risk for higher rates of food insecurity and increased risk of adverse POs. Our long-term goal is to develop successful interventions to promote the reproductive health of Latina women and their children over the life-course. The objective of this study is to identify how nativity and documentation status shape adverse PO (inappropriate maternal weight gain, pregnancy-induced hypertension (PIH)/eclampsia, PTB, term BW, small for gestational age (SGA)) and how the residential context exacerbates risk for adverse health. To accomplish this objective, we are partnering with Multnomah County Health Department (MCHD) to analyze data from the Citizen Alien Waived Emergent Medical (CAWEM) Plus program. It provides prenatal care to Medicaid-ineligible women including undocumented Latinas. Linking CAWEMPlus undocumented status with geocoded MCHD birth records (2009- 2014), we will undertake the following specific aims: Aim 1: Identify associations between nativity, documentation status and POs (inappropriate weight gain, PIH/eclampsia, PTB, term BW, SGA) among Latinas. The working hypotheses are that (a) foreign-born Latinas will have better POs than native-born; and (b) among the foreign-born, documented Latinas will have the most positive POs. Aim 2: Characterize the residential context (poverty level, food access) of documented versus undocumented Latina women. The working hypothesis is that undocumented Latina women live in higher poverty neighborhoods characterized by an unhealthy food environment (more fast food, fewer grocery stores). Aim 3: Identify joint effects of nativity, documentation status and neighborhood context on POs among Latina women. The working hypothesis is that among Latinas, neighborhood context mediates the relationship between nativity and immigration status and MCH outcomes. Summary: Aim 1 will allow us to disentangle the independent effects of nativity and immigration status on MCH outcomes; Aim 2 will help clarify the role of neighborhood context in shaping risk for adverse Latina outcomes; and Aim 3 will specify differential area-induced vulnerabilities by nativity and documentation status. Impact: The results from the completion of this community-based participatory research project will inform program and policy interventions designed to improve Latina health. Further, disentangling the effects of nativity from documentation status can refine our intervention efforts to target the most vulnerable women to reduce maternal and child health disparities. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The Latina paradox is robust, but not uniformly protective against adverse pregnancy outcomes. Specifically, pregnancy outcomes may differ by nativity and exposure to social stressors, including documentation status and unhealthy neighborhood food environments. Using a unique database, the Citizen Alien Waived Emergent Medical Plus program, and geocoded county birth records, this community-based participatory research project identifies how nativity and documentation status shape adverse pregnancy outcomes among Latinas in Multnomah County, Oregon and how neighborhood context exacerbates their risk for adverse health.",Social factors influencing pregnancy outcome disparities,9270562,R21HD087734,"['Alien ', ' Birth Records ', ' Parturition ', ' Birth ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Data Sources ', ' Eclampsia ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Food or Food Product ', ' Food ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Immigration ', ' Infant Mortality ', ' Postneonatal Mortality ', ' Infant Mortality Total ', ' Low Birth Weight Infant ', ' low birthweight ', ' low birth weight infant human ', ' low birth weight ', ' Small for Gestational Age Infant ', ' small for gestational age ', ' Insurance ', ' Joints ', ' Life Cycle Stages ', ' life course ', ' Life Cycle ', ' Medicaid ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Oregon ', ' Poverty ', ' Pregnancy Outcome ', ' Prenatal care ', ' pregnancy care ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Social Work ', ' Social Service ', ' wt gain ', ' body weight increase ', ' body weight gain ', ' Weight Increase ', ' Weight Gain ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' County ', ' Native People ', ' Indigenous Population ', ' Native-Born ', ' Female Health ', "" Women's Health "", ' Mediating ', ' Outcomes Research ', ' preterm delivery ', ' premature delivery ', ' premature childbirth ', ' Preterm Birth ', ' Prematurely delivering ', ' Pre-term birth ', ' Premature Birth ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Specified ', ' Specific qualifier value ', ' Medical ', ' Link ', ' data repository ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Databases ', ' Policies ', ' Reproductive Health ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Exposure to ', ' Shapes ', ' fast food ', ' convenience food ', ' programs ', ' Source ', ' Country ', ' pregnancy hypertension ', ' Pregnancy Associated Hypertension ', ' Hypertension-Associated Pregnancy Disorder ', ' Hypertension induced by pregnancy ', ' Gestational Hypertension ', ' experience ', ' stressor ', ' social ', ' social stress ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Documentation ', ' Latina ', ' Latinas ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Data ', ' Maternal and Child Health ', ' Subgroup ', ' Food Access ', ' Outcome ', ' community based participatory research ', ' participatory action research ', ' community based research ', ' community based design ', ' therapy design ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' high risk ', ' public health relevance ', ' successful intervention ', ' adverse outcome ', ' adverse consequence ', ' food environment ', ' gestational weight gain ', ' adverse pregnancy outcome ', ' maternal weight ', ' ']",NICHD,PORTLAND STATE UNIVERSITY,R21,2017,166773,0.005290642910311268
"Cognitive Resilience and Community Context: Examining the role of Neighborhood Built and Social Environments for Slowing the Progression of Dementia among older Americans PROJECT SUMMARY Previous research has identified multiple biological, genetic, and behavioral factors that are associated with cognitive impairment and decline. Recently, a parallel literature has looked beyond individual-level factors to consider the role of the social and built environment. Findings suggest that residence in socioeconomically advantaged neighborhoods may promote cognitive function and/or buffer cognitive decline in part through their greater density of physical resources (recreational centers, gyms, parks, walking paths, healthy food stores) as well as social and institutional resources (libraries, bookstores, community centers, social clubs) that promote physical activity and facilitate mental stimulation (e.g. social interaction) that may buffer cognitive decline with age. However, these relationships have not been empirically tested with national population-based data. This study will examine the moderating role of neighborhood built and social environments on trajectories of cognitive function in a national, racially-diverse sample of Americans followed since 2003. We will identify how features of the social and built environment are related to rates of decline in cognitive function among participants in the Reasons for Geographic and Racial Differences in Stroke (REGARDS) study. REGARDS is a national longitudinal cohort study of over 30,0000 black and white individuals age 45+ ongoing since 2003. In addition to being a longitudinal study collecting prospective data on cognitive function at annual intervals, the study also tracks residential locations through geographic coordinates that will be linked to secondary sources to characterize the surrounding social and built environment. The aims of this 4-year project are to i) characterize the built and social environment for respondents in the REGARDS study with respect to the physical and social resources that could mitigate cognitive decline; ii) use longitudinal data to examine the relationship between neighborhood resources and rates of cognitive decline over time; and iii) determine the extent to which built and social environments explain racial disparities in cognitive function. By augmenting this existing NIH-funded longitudinal cohort study with neighborhood characteristics, this study will provide a critical opportunity to examine the role of neighborhood built and social environments for preventing cognitive decline in Americans as they age.

"Urban Revitalization and Long-Term Effects on Diet, Economic, and Health Outcomes Project Abstract Improving access to healthful foods such as fruits, vegetables, and whole grains has been an important policy strategy, intended to improve diet and reduce obesity among vulnerable populations. In our parent grant (Does a New Supermarket Improve Dietary Behaviors of Low-income African Americans? R01CA149105), our team capitalized on a natural experiment in which a Healthy Food Financing Initiative (HFFI)-supported full-service supermarket (FSS) was opened in an underserved area. In 2011, we enrolled a cohort (N=1,372) of randomly selected households from an intervention neighborhood (that received the new FSS) and a similar comparison neighborhood and followed the cohort from prior to the FSS’s opening through one year post-opening. We found that intervention neighborhood residents had some dietary improvements – lower added sugars, calories, and saturated fats, alcohols and added sugars (SoFAAS). However, use of the new FSS, the hypothesized mediator, was not associated with dietary changes. The proposed renewal grant seeks to examine whether the socioeconomic impact that the new FSS or anticipation of it and other developments among investors, had on the neighborhood might be responsible for the dietary improvements we observed. It also taps into a new opportunity to examine the effect of much larger ongoing and impending revitalization of the intervention neighborhood on neighborhood socioeconomic conditions and diet. Addressing these research questions will help us to better understand and to replicate the dietary improvements of placing an FSS in a food desert. Results will speak to the substantial literature linking neighborhood socioeconomic conditions, diet, and weight, largely limited to cross-sectional studies. We will also examine the extent to which the dietary improvements we observed in our parent study are maintained, and the pathways by which neighborhood socioeconomic conditions may impact diet. To achieve this, we will obtain and merge secondary retrospective and prospective data concerning neighborhood socioeconomic conditions (NSEC) of the intervention and control neighborhoods with existing survey data and neighborhood audits, and collect two additional waves of survey and audit data capturing the impending major neighborhood revitalization projects that are underway or in development. Data will be analyzed using difference in difference and structural modeling approaches to test the impact of these natural experiments and the hypothesized causal pathway from neighborhood change to dietary improvement. Thus, the proposed renewal will capitalize on our existing data, cohort, and research infrastructure to address critically important follow-on questions and will be the first study, to our knowledge, to test whether SES improvements at the neighborhood and individual level are associated with improved diet and weight status. Project Narrative Improving access to healthful foods such as fruits, vegetables, and whole grains has been a highly touted policy strategy, intending to improve diet and reduce obesity among vulnerable populations. Our parent study documented some improvements in diet among residents after the opening of a full-service supermarket in a low-income, predominantly African American neighborhood in Pittsburgh, PA. However, we found no association between use of the new supermarket and the dietary improvements. Our proposed study will continue to follow the randomly selected cohort to examine whether dietary changes are maintained, and to what degree a very large additional investment in the neighborhood results in dietary improvements. It is possible that the opening of the new supermarket created a neighborhood-level shift in socioeconomic conditions and, although much literature exists around neighborhood socioeconomic status (SES) and its association with diet and weight status, we know of no studies that have linked shifts in SES to changes in diet or weight. Should neighborhood SES improvement underlie dietary improvements, neighborhood investments other than increased access to healthful food might serve the same function and should be considered.","Urban Revitalization and Long-Term Effects on Diet, Economic, and Health Outcomes",9403184,R01CA149105,"['Alcohol Chemical Class ', ' Alcohols ', ' Behavior ', ' caloric dietary content ', ' Caloric Intake ', ' Energy Intake ', ' Crime ', ' Disease Frequency Surveys ', ' Cross-Sectional Survey ', ' Cross-Sectional Analyses ', ' Cross Sectional Analysis ', ' Cross-Sectional Studies ', ' dietary ', ' Diet ', ' whole grain ', ' Dietary Fiber ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Economics ', ' Food or Food Product ', ' Food ', ' Future ', ' geographic site ', ' Geographical Location ', ' Geographic Region ', ' Geographic Area ', ' Geographic Locations ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' Household ', ' Incentives ', ' Income ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Investments ', ' Literature ', ' Long-Term Effects ', ' Longterm Effects ', ' Structural Models ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Obesity ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Parents ', ' Play ', ' Poverty ', ' Research ', ' Stress ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Testing ', ' Weight ', ' Measures ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' Mediating ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' hopelessness ', ' No hope for the future ', ' Negative about the future ', ' Loss of hope for the future ', ' Feels there is no future ', ' Cannot see a future ', ' Feeling hopeless ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Link ', ' Individual ', ' sugar ', ' Policies ', ' healthy food ', ' Health Food ', ' Calories ', ' Supermarket ', ' Services ', ' saturated fat ', ' saturated lipid ', ' saturated dietary lipid ', ' saturated dietary fat ', ' cohort ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' response ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Dietary intake ', ' Low income ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Improve Access ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Infrastructure ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Process ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socio-economically ', ' socio-economic ', ' socioeconomics ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' Food Access ', ' Outcome ', ' prospective ', ' Natural experiment ', ' fruits and vegetables ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' parent grant ', ' secondary analysis ', ' ']",NCI,RAND CORPORATION,R01,2017,805895,0.08183715879133904
"The Role of Neighborhood Stress in Cognitive Function among Racially and Ethnically Diverse Adults PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  The proposed research aims to evaluate the association between neighborhood context and cognitive function among racially and ethnically diverse middle-aged adults. The United States’ population is aging at unprecedented rates and it is also becoming diverse with racial and ethnic minority adults suffering a greater incidence of Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias compared to non-Hispanic white adults. Psychological and biological markers of chronic stress are important predictors of cognitive function and the neighborhood contexts in which individuals live, or have previously lived in, comprise an important backdrop for linking the effects of chronic stress to cognitive function. Neighborhood characteristics and race and ethnicity are interrelated and studying the effects of neighborhood contexts on cognitive function will inform on relevant determinants of cognitive health disparities. Further, because cognitive decline may begin long before old age, understanding its antecedents requires mapping changes that manifest in early and middle adulthood. In order to develop a more nuanced understanding of the link between neighborhoods and cognitive function, it is imperative to 1) determine the extent to which neighborhood stress is associated with cognitive function across racial and ethnic groups; 2) examine which specific facets of cognitive functioning are affected by neighborhood stress; and 3) evaluate the interplay between neighborhood context and genetic influences on cognitive function. The PI aims to address these aims by leveraging the strengths of three studies of middle- aged adults, CATSLife, ESCAPE, and MIDUS II to comprehensively assess the associations between neighborhood stress and cognitive function. The proposed research will make a timely contribution to our understanding of contextual influences on cognitive function.  Moreover, the research and training plan proposed under this award will advance the PI’s scientific and career development in several ways. With her sponsors’ mentorship and training activities, the PI will achieve three career goals: 1) learn and apply new skills on integrative data analysis and neighborhood coding techniques; 2) broaden conceptual understanding and gain advanced analytical experience in behavioral genetics; 3) develop the skills needed to design and implement studies that incorporate environmental and genetic perspectives to the study of context and cognitive function and aging. Achievement of these goals will position the PI to launch an independent line of research that will inform theoretical and empirical understanding on the influence of social/contextual sources of stress on cognitive health in adulthood, with a focus on elucidating common and/or differential associations across racial and ethnic groups. PROJECT NARRATIVE The neighborhood context in which individuals develop plays an important role in determining function in old age and may aid in understanding racial and ethnic disparities in cognitive impairment, Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias. This investigation will coordinate analyses across three studies of middle-aged adults to comprehensively assess the nature of the association between neighborhood contexts and cognitive function. Findings will increase understanding on the effect of neighborhood context characteristics on cognitive functioning and inform the tailoring of prevention and intervention efforts aimed at reducing the burden of cognitive impairment in older adults.",The Role of Neighborhood Stress in Cognitive Function among Racially and Ethnically Diverse Adults,9327458,F32AG056134,"['Accounting ', ' Achievement Attainment ', ' Achievement ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Affect ', ' ages ', ' Age ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Elderly ', ' Aging ', ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Alzheimers Dementia ', "" Alzheimer's "", ' Alzheimer syndrome ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' Attention ', ' Award ', ' Cognition ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Environment ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Genes ', ' behavior genetics ', ' Genetic Determinants of Behavior ', ' Behavioral Genetics ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Spanish Americans ', ' Hispanic Americans ', ' Incidence ', ' Inflammation ', ' Intelligence ', ' Learning ', ' Mentorship ', ' middle age ', ' midlife ', ' middle aged ', ' mid-life ', ' mid life ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Play ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Specificity ', ' Stress ', ' Task Performances ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' training module ', ' Training Activity ', ' United States ', ' Measures ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' career ', ' psychological ', ' psychologic ', ' Link ', ' Individual ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Genetic ', ' Exposure to ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' cognitively impaired ', ' cognitive loss ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Nature ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' cognitive function ', ' Investigation ', ' Source ', ' Techniques ', ' Country ', ' Dementia ', ' Amentia ', ' environmental stressor ', ' experience ', ' gene environment interaction ', ' environment effect on gene ', ' GxE interaction ', ' Gene x Environment Interaction ', ' Performance ', ' skills ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Self-Report ', ' racial difference ', ' race differences ', ' ethnic difference ', ' ethnicity difference ', ' social ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' Code ', ' Coding System ', ' career development ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' low socioeconomic status ', ' low socioeconomic position ', ' low socio-economic status ', ' low socio-economic position ', ' low SES ', ' Address ', ' Chronic stress ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Preventative intervention ', ' Research Training ', ' Cognitive ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' Risk Marker ', ' Characteristics ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' pathological aging ', ' Population ', ' Cognitive aging ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' Biological Markers ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' cognitive performance ', ' genetic approach ', ' cognitive task ', ' cognitive ability ', ' attentional control ', ' ethnic diversity ', ' ethnically diverse ', ' racial diversity ', ' racially diverse ', ' racial minority ', ' ']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA RIVERSIDE,F32,2017,57066,0.009981556389783439
"Sustainable Solutions to Metal Air Pollution in Disadvantaged Neighborhoods DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project uses a community-based participatory approach to 1) Conduct formative research; 2) Develop an intervention; and 3) Evaluate intervention effects regarding possible health related exposures from metal recycling. Metal recycling is a robust, growing industry in the nation. The benefits of metal recycling over the use of raw materials include energy savings, the conservation of resources, the generation of jobs and the positive impact on trade of significant U.S. exports world-wide. The metal recycling industry in the U.S. generated over $64 billion in 2010. Metal recycling is a growing industry in Houston as well, with over 170 metal recycling facilities in operation. Because of no zoning, many of these sites operate ""next-door"" to neighborhoods that are predominantly poor and communities of color. During the last five years, the City of Houston Department of Health and Human Services (HDHHS) received nearly 200 air quality complaints from residents across the city about recycling activities, with the predominant concern being smoke and dust. To the extent that resources were available, the HDHHS Bureau of Pollution Control and Prevention conducted limited ambient air monitoring at 25 recycling facilities. Our preliminary results suggested possible environmental health risks, but there are insufficient data to draw definitive conclusions about the health risks of emissions from these facilities. A partnership arose among the HDHHS, the University of Texas School of Public Health, Rice University and Air Alliance Houston to work together with neighborhood residents and metal recyclers to address this potentially serious environmental health issue. Also, the HDHHS has been working since January 2013 with the metal recyclers' task force consisting of the Recycling Council of Texas and Gulf Coast and National Institute of Scrap Recycling Industries, Inc. (ISRI), and in response one metal recycler voluntarily upgraded their facility resulting in reduced aerosol emissions. We propose to conduct extensive air monitoring of metals in particulate matter in affected neighborhoods that will, in turn, inform a risk assessment associated with air emissions from metal recyclers in the community. Based on the risk assessment findings and additional community input, we will use a systematic health promotion planning method to implement and evaluate a multilevel, evidence and behavioral science theory-based public health action plan. The public health action plan will include recommendations for best practices for adoption by metal recyclers and targeted educational campaigns for neighborhood residents, metal recyclers and policy makers and we will re-evaluate emissions and risks following implementation of the plan. Affected neighborhood residents and metal recyclers have a critical role to play in this project to insure that we represent the full range of community concerns in designing and conducting the study, interpreting and disseminating study results and developing and evaluating a public health action plan. The ultimate goal of the project is to improve the health of Houston's communities that border metal recycling facilities. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Owing to nearly 200 air quality complaints from residents whose neighborhoods border metal recycling activities (many of which are predominantly poor and largely Hispanic or African- American), the City of Houston Department of Health and Human Services (HDHHS) conducted limited ambient air monitoring with results that are suggestive of possible environmental health risks. In light of these findings and heightened community concerns due to recent media exposure, the HDHHS partnered with the University of Texas School of Public Health, Rice University and Air Alliance Houston to conduct extensive air monitoring in affected neighborhoods that will, in turn, inform a risk assessment associated with air emissions from metal recyclers in the community. Based on our risk assessment findings and with additional community input from two key stakeholder groups (metal recyclers and neighborhood residents), we further propose to implement and evaluate a multi-level public health action plan that will improve the overall health of Houston's communities that border metal recycling facilities.",Sustainable Solutions to Metal Air Pollution in Disadvantaged Neighborhoods,9268014,R01ES023563,"['Adoption ', ' Aerosols ', ' Affect ', ' Air ', ' Air Pollution ', ' inspiration ', ' Respiratory Inspiration ', ' Respiratory Aspiration ', ' Inhaling ', ' Inhalation ', ' Breathing ', ' Awareness ', ' Behavioral Sciences ', ' Cities ', ' Color ', ' Communities ', ' Dust ', ' Environmental Health Science ', ' Environmental Health ', ' environmental contamination ', ' environmental contaminant ', ' Environmental Pollution ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' Health Promotion ', ' Industrialization ', ' Industry ', ' Institutes ', ' Interview ', ' Leadership ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Metals ', ' Methods ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Newspapers ', ' Occupations ', ' Professional Positions ', ' Jobs ', ' Plants ', ' Play ', ' Public Health ', ' Questionnaires ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Rice ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Savings ', ' Public Health Schools ', ' Smoke ', ' Suggestion ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Texas ', ' Training Programs ', ' Translating ', ' United States Department of Health and Human Services ', ' Department of Health and Human Services ', ' United States Dept. of Health and Human Services ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Generations ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' Businesses ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Hispanics ', ' Risk Assessment ', ' advisory team ', ' Task Forces ', ' Advisory Committees ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Series ', ' Link ', ' Chemicals ', ' Evaluation ', ' Policy Maker ', ' Workshop ', ' Educational workshop ', ' Fostering ', ' Measurement ', ' Recycling ', ' Exposure to ', ' air contaminant ', ' Knowledge ', ' Pollution ', ' Source ', ' Location ', ' Training and Education ', ' Education and Training ', ' experience ', ' particle ', ' pollutant ', ' Toxic effect ', ' Toxicities ', ' economic impact ', ' NIH Program Announcements ', ' Program Announcement ', ' Prevention ', ' carcinogenicity ', ' response ', ' theories ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' air monitoring ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Caliber ', ' Diameter ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Monitor ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' informant ', ' Particulate Matter ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' toxic metal ', ' Metal exposure ', ' exposure to metal ', ' gulf coast ', ' public health relevance ', ' intervention effect ', ' industry partner ', ' industry partnership ', ' industrial partnership ', ' longitudinal design ', ' operation ', ' screening ', ' metallicity ', ' neighborhood disadvantage ', ' disadvantaged population ', ' fine particles ', ' fine particulate matter ', ' PM2.5 ', ' coarse particles ', ' coarse particulate matter ', ' PM10 ', ' ']",NIEHS,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS HLTH SCI CTR HOUSTON,R01,2017,517813,0.101031348522972
"Impact of social and built environments on health-related quality of life for cancer survivors ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Neighborhoods have been shown to be a critical foundation for shaping individuals' opportunities for achieving optimal health. As the number of cancer survivors continues to increase, with over 13 million in the U.S. currently, understanding factors that improve health-related quality of life (HRQOL) after cancer diagnosis is critical. Unless we identify and address the relevant contextual factors, interventions that only target individual factors are likely to have limited effectiveness. However, only three studies have considered neighborhood factors, despite that neighborhoods have been shown to influence health outcomes through a number of pathways--environmental exposures, material deprivation, psychosocial mechanisms, health behaviors, and access to resources. Therefore, we propose to leverage and pool individual-level data on sociodemographic, clinical, social, and behavioral factors from three existing cancer survivorship studies and merge them with neighborhood data. Specifically, we aim to (1) examine the associations between a comprehensive suite of social and built environment features and HRQOL, (a) adjusting for important covariates (e.g., clinical, demographic, social and behavioral factors) and (b) evaluating whether these associations vary by race/ethnicity, age, or gender, and (2) assess racial/ethnic disparities in HRQOL and evaluate whether these disparities are explained by clinical, demographic, social and behavioral factors, neighborhood factors, or a combination of them. To achieve these aims, with harmonized data across three California population-based studies (n=2,563, 46% minority)-Assessment of Patients' Experience of Cancer Care (APECC), Experiences of Care and Health Outcomes of survivors of Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma (ECHOS-NHL), and Follow-up Care Use among Survivors (FOCUS)-we will geocode address at interview and merge the individual-level data with our social (e.g., socioeconomic, racial/ethnic composition, immigration) and built (e.g., population density, street connectivity, commuting, amenities, food environment) environment data. The main HRQOL outcomes will include physical and mental component summary scores. Linear regression models will be used to estimate unadjusted and adjusted associations between neighborhood features and the two HRQOL outcomes. Further, we will document racial/ethnic disparities in HRQOL and evaluate whether neighborhood features explain these disparities. This efficient study will be powered to detect significant neighborhoods effects across all of the cancer sites, as well as for 5 specific sites -breast, colorectal, gynecologic, NHL, and prostate. Our findings will provide the preliminary evidence for associations between the built and social environment and HRQOL and contribute significantly to our understanding of which neighborhood features influence HRQOL. Our collaboration with the Shanti Project will ensure that our study will meaningfully inform the design of multilevel interventions that not only account for individual factors that contribute to HRQOL, but also the context through which those individual factors are shaped. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  With over 13 million cancer survivors currently in the U.S. and growing, understanding factors that improve their quality of life after cancer diagnosis is critical. Most studies have focused on individual factors such as personal characteristics, clinica factors, and behaviors, with only three studies focused on how neighborhood socioeconomic status and segregation shape quality of life among cancer survivors. Therefore, we propose to study how neighborhood characteristics including resources, amenities, food environment, walkability and population characteristics impact quality of life so that future interventions coul be optimally designed to improve health for all cancer survivors.",Impact of social and built environments on health-related quality of life for cancer survivors,9210071,R03CA202192,"['Affect ', ' ages ', ' Age ', ' Behavior ', ' Breast ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' California ', ' Censuses ', ' Cities ', ' Communities ', ' Commuting ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Comorbidity ', ' Critical Care ', ' dietary ', ' Diet ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Employment ', ' Environment ', ' Environmental Exposure ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Grant ', ' Gynecology ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' Housing ', ' Immigration ', ' Information Systems ', ' Information Technology Systems ', ' IT Systems ', ' Data Systems ', ' Interview ', ' Linear Regressions ', "" Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma "", ' non-Hodgkins lymphoma ', ' non-Hodgkins disease ', ' Nonhodgkins Lymphoma ', ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Obesity ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Patients ', ' Population Characteristics ', ' Population Density ', ' Poverty ', ' Prostate ', ' Prostatic Gland ', ' Prostate Gland ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Registries ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' San Francisco ', ' Smoking ', ' Social Environment ', ' socioenvironment ', ' social context ', ' social climate ', ' Social support ', ' social support network ', ' Stress ', ' survivorship ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' Transportation ', ' County ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', ' Racial Segregation ', ' segregation ', ' Businesses ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Caring ', ' Social Network ', ' base ', ' density ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Gynecologic ', ' Survivors ', ' Link ', ' Ensure ', ' Evaluation ', ' Physical activity ', ' mental ', ' Psyche structure ', ' Individual ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Collaborations ', ' healthy food ', ' Health Food ', ' Shapes ', ' Malignant neoplasm of prostate ', ' Prostatic Cancer ', ' Prostate Cancer ', ' Prostate CA ', ' Malignant prostatic tumor ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Prostate ', ' Overweight ', ' Over weight ', ' physical conditioning ', ' physical health ', ' psychosocial ', ' contextual factors ', ' Application Context ', ' Colorectal ', ' colorectum ', ' colo-rectal ', ' Colon or Rectum ', ' Services ', ' experience ', ' cohesion ', ' cohort ', ' Population Study ', ' study of the population ', ' studies of populations ', ' population-level study ', ' population-based study ', ' social ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' Modeling ', ' deprivation ', ' cancer site ', ' cancer location ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Meta-Analysis ', ' Meta-Analyses ', ' Data Pooling ', ' Clinical Trial Overviews ', ' cancer care ', ' cancer diagnosis ', ' Effectiveness ', ' low socioeconomic status ', ' low socioeconomic position ', ' low socio-economic status ', ' low socio-economic position ', ' low SES ', ' Low income ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Multiple Cancer Sites ', ' Prognostic Factor ', ' Prognostic/Survival Factor ', ' General Prognostic Factor ', ' Stress and Coping ', ' Cancer Patient ', ' survive cancer ', ' Cancer Survivor ', ' Cancer Survivorship ', ' SF-12 ', ' SF-36 ', ' Characteristics ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socio-economically ', ' socio-economic ', ' socioeconomics ', ' Behavioral ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' cost ', ' health related quality of life ', ' Social Functioning ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' man ', "" man's "", ' racial and ethnic ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' public health relevance ', ' population based ', ' food environment ', ' Breast Cancer Patient ', ' Breast Tumor Patient ', ' built environment ', ' walkability ', ' walkable ', ' improved outcome ', ' ethnic diversity ', ' ethnically diverse ', ' Healthy Eating ', ' farmers markets ', ' ']",NCI,CANCER PREVENTION INSTIT OF CALIFORNIA,R03,2017,33444,0.1351340490275811
"Physical Activity and Redesigned Community Spaces (PARCS) Study Diversity Supplement ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The built environment plays a critical role in promoting physical activity and health. The association between parks, as a key attribute of the built environment, and physical activity, however, remains inconclusive. This project employs a natural experiment design to assess the impact of the Community Parks Initiative (CPI), a New York City Department of Parks and Recreation (NYC Parks) park redesign and renovation initiative, on physical activity, park usage, psychosocial and mental health, and community wellbeing. The project will use a longitudinal design with matched controls. NYC Parks has identified 134 parks with extreme capital needs in high-priority neighborhoods and will begin renovating parks in waves. In late 2016, the first wave of 35 parks across 55 neighborhoods will close for renovations; these parks will reopen in late 2017. From this initial wave, 20 interventio parks have been selected for inclusion in this study. Intervention park neighborhoods have been matched to a control group of 20 socio-economically similar park neighborhoods that will not be renovated during the study. The study will address two aims. In Aim 1, investigators will compare total volume of PA and other health outcomes among residents in the intervention vs. control park neighborhoods (defined as .25 mile radius around each park) from baseline to 2.5 years post-renovation. We hypothesize that improvements will be observed in PA and health levels in intervention but not control neighborhoods. In Aim 2, an additional 10 park neighborhoods receiving renovation in 2018 and reopening in 2019 will be used to monitor replicability of intervention effects at 1.5 years post-renovation. This combined design enhances our ability to infer causality in a natural experiment. We aim to recruit and retain 40 study participants per park neighborhood, after attrition, for a total of 1600 participants in Aim 1 and 400 in Aim 2. Study participants will represent two distinct sociodemographic strata in each neighborhood: low-income housing and community- engaged residents. Measures include direct park observations and program checklists, park quality, self- reported and GPS-tracked park usage, accelerometry-based physical activity, self-reported psychosocial health, and perceived community wellbeing. The largest natural experiment of its kind to date, this study represents a rare opportunity to provide robust evidence to further our understanding of the complex relationship between parks and physical activity, psychosocial and mental health, and community wellbeing. The findings will inform future investments in health-oriented urban design policies and offer evidence for addressing health disparities through built environment strategies. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    The project will evaluate the long-term effects of a citywide public park redesign and renovation initiative on residents' physical activity, psychosocial and mental health, and community wellbeing.

"Neighborhood Socioeconomic Disadvantage and Medicare's 30-Day Rehospitalization Policy: Eliminating Rehospitalization Disparities by Informing Policy Design and Implementation ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Thirty-day re-hospitalizations disproportionately impact African American patients and those from socioeconomically disadvantaged neighborhoods. Hospitals that primarily serve disadvantaged populations bear a disproportionate burden of Medicare's hospital-based financial re-hospitalization penalties (mandated by S. 3025, Affordable Care Act). As these penalties continue to increase in coming years, penalized hospitals have stated that they will need to cut services to maintain financial solvency, which may further worsen disparities. This may be a potential unintended negative consequence of Medicare's policy decision to not adjust for socioeconomic factors in the re-hospitalization metrics to which the penalties are tied. At this decision's core is a debate on whether observed disparities result from confounding by cluster (i.e., disadvantaged populations primarily receiving care from 'bad' hospitals) or whether socioeconomic disadvantage outside the hospital has a greater influence on re-hospitalization than is currently recognized by Medicare. A statistical decomposition of the within- and between- hospital effects is needed to help disentangle whether the hospital or non-hospital socioeconomics play the greater role in re-hospitalization, but until recently few national-scale indictors of disadvantage were available for this purpose. (Individual-level indicators of disadvantage are neither widely available nor reliabl enough for either resolving this debate or for use in metric adjustment.) The Area Deprivation Index (ADI) is a validated measure of US disadvantage, based upon similar measures employed abroad for health policy development. The ADI uses US Census poverty, education, and housing and employment indicators to characterize regions, such as neighborhoods. Recently, we demonstrated that living in a severely disadvantaged US neighborhood (per a year 2000 Census-based ADI) predicts re-hospitalization as powerfully as the presence of illnesses, such as chronic pulmonary disease. However, to answer the critical policy debate above and to understand if the ADI is suitable for use as a metric adjuster, the ADI must be updated to the 2010 Census, its geographic stability (i.e., how the distribution of disadvantaged US neighborhoods has changed since 2000) and association consistency (i.e., whether the association of neighborhood disadvantage and re-hospitalization remains in 2010) determined, within- and between-hospital effects assessed (i.e., informing the hospital vs. neighborhood socioeconomics debate), and resilient hospitals (i.e., hospitals which primarily serve highly disadvantaged neighborhoods yet have lower than expected re-hospitalization rates) studied in comparison to less-resilient/non-resilient hospitals, especially in terms of patient, caregiver and clinician perspectives on the underlying reasons for this resilience. The potential policy impact o metric adjustment must also be understood. We propose to accomplish all of these steps, with an overarching goal of eliminating re-hospitalization disparities by informing policy and practice. This proposed project has the potential to immediately change re-hospitalization policy and inform metric revision. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Thirty-day re-hospitalizations disproportionately impact African American patients and those from socioeconomically disadvantaged neighborhoods; hospitals that primarily serve disadvantaged populations bear a disproportionate burden of the financial re-hospitalization penalties mandated by Section 3025 of the Affordable Care Act. As these penalties continue to increase in coming years, penalized hospitals have stated that they will need to cut services to maintain financial solvency, which may further worsen disparities--a potential unintended negative consequence of Medicare's policy decision to not adjust for socioeconomic factors in the re-hospitalization metrics to which the penalties are tied. To inform Medicare policy design and implementation, this proposal examines a novel method by which such an adjustment could be achieved, evaluates its suitability as an adjustment metric, and assesses the potential implications of adjustment.",Neighborhood Socioeconomic Disadvantage and Medicare's 30-Day Rehospitalization Policy: Eliminating Rehospitalization Disparities by Informing Policy Design and Implementation,9303201,R01MD010243,"['Affect ', ' bear ', ' Ursidae ', ' Bears ', ' Ursidae Family ', ' Censuses ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Employment ', ' Food or Food Product ', ' Food ', ' Future ', ' Geography ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' health insurance for disabled ', ' Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Disabled Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Aged and Disabled, Title 18 ', ' Medicare ', ' healthcare policy ', ' health care policy ', ' Health Policy ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Hospitals ', ' Housing ', ' indexing ', ' Internal Medicine ', ' Lung diseases ', ' lung disorder ', ' Respiratory System Disorder ', ' Respiratory System Disease ', ' Respiratory Disease ', ' Pulmonary Disorder ', ' Pulmonary Diseases ', ' Methods ', ' Theoretical model ', ' Theoretic Models ', ' mortality ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Patients ', ' Perception ', ' Play ', ' Poverty ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Socioeconomic Factors ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Care Givers ', ' Caregivers ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Chronic ', ' Link ', ' Individual ', ' Policy Developments ', ' Policies ', ' tool ', ' Services ', ' novel ', ' payment ', ' Code ', ' Coding System ', ' Sampling ', ' deprivation ', ' Address ', ' Qualitative Methods ', ' qualitative reasoning ', ' Data ', ' Update ', ' Characteristics ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socio-economically ', ' socio-economic ', ' socioeconomics ', ' cost ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' resilience ', ' Outcome ', ' Prevalence ', ' therapy design ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' public health relevance ', ' neighborhood association ', ' socioeconomic disadvantage ', ' socioeconomically underprivileged ', ' Socioeconomically disadvantaged ', ' neighborhood disadvantage ', ' disadvantaged population ', ' Affordable Care Act ', ' Obamacare ', ' ']",NIMHD,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,R01,2017,528399,0.0728301558436926

"Geography of opportunity: Neighborhood dynamics and child cognitive development DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Prenatal and early life exposures and environments are fundamental to life course health and prosperity and are increasingly recognized as such in national and international public health priorities. Fetal and early childhood environments affect children's cognitive and non-cognitive development, abilities, and performance in elementary school and, as a result, significantly affect subsequent educational trajectories, adult health, wealth, and social status. However opportunities for optimal development for children in the U.S. are not uniform, but rather are socially and spatially patterned from before birth-in the form of fetal programming and birth outcomes-through adolescence and into adulthood. It is therefore a pressing public health challenge to better understand the family and neighborhood environmental determinants of early childhood development in order to identify opportunities for child, family, and community interventions which improve children's health outcomes. Meeting this challenge requires linking the micro and macro demographic processes by which families and neighborhoods affect early child development with the conceptual, methodological, and statistical perspectives of spatial demography and population geography. With this career development award I will gain critical inter-disciplinary skills necessary to pursue a novel research agenda that: a) integrates population science theory and methods necessary to study residential context, segregation and mobility, b) describes the role of spatially and temporally dynamic residential context in early life course development of U.S. children, c) prepares me to compete successfully for R01-level research funding by year 5, and d) establishes me as an independent investigator at the intersection of spatial and social demography, life course demography / epidemiology, and public health. The research aims of this study are to: 1) develop and evaluate a geo-informatics data model for studying spatiotemporal population patterns including residential segregation, neighborhood deprivation and residential stability and mobility; 2) test the association of spatiotemporal neighborhood exposures with early childhood cognitive development and school readiness using Early Childhood Longitudinal Study (ECLS) Birth and Kindergarten cohort data; and 3) construct spatial, agent- based models to explore dynamics of the place-child development relationship. Residential environments are a source of social capital and collective efficacy for residents and could affect child development through the distribution of educational and recreational resources, through the effects of stress or support from varying crime, economic, and social characteristics of neighborhoods, or through local norms and role models for both parents and children. These factors will be measured using census, crime, and other population-based data sources to describe the spatial patterns of residential segregation; residential mobility, housing tenure, and stability; and neighborhood social environment including poverty, affluence, crime and family structure. Associations between spatial residential environments and childhood development will be tested using the ECLS birth and kindergarten cohorts using spatial regression, and econometric approaches which can test hypotheses of spatial externalities, clustering, and heterogeneity. The multilevel use of large, population-based longitudinal data with spatially-explicit environmental measures and hypotheses can shed light on both the magnitude of associations as well as the possible pathways through which environments strengthen or undermine optimal child development. The execution of these research aims will be intertwined with a comprehensive training and career mentoring plan carried out at Emory University and Penn State University Population Research Institute. Training goals include study of spatial, social and family demography, geo-informatics, and advanced statistical approaches to frequentist and Bayesian spatial analysis. Mentoring will support research productivity in the form of publications, collaboration with public health and population science scholars, and successful submission of R03 and R01 grants during the training period. Overall this proposal will allow me to become a uniquely skilled, independent researcher bridging spatial demography and social epidemiology. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Children's fetal and early life environments set them on a trajectory of cognitive and non-cognitive development and academic achievements which has far reaching consequences for adult health and wellbeing. In addition to family environment, children's neighborhood environments in these critical early years may foster or inhibit optimal development. This study will systematically examine how geographic and spatial variation in neighborhood environments might affect resident children's cognitive and non-cognitive skill development, and whether such exposures contribute to population health disparities.",Geography of opportunity: Neighborhood dynamics and child cognitive development,9271051,K01HD074726,"['adolescence (12-20) ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' Adolescence ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Affect ', ' Behavior ', ' Birth History ', ' Parturition ', ' Birth ', ' Censuses ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' CDC ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Infant and Child Development ', ' Child Development ', ' Child Health ', ' Child health care ', ' Crime ', ' Data Sources ', ' Demography ', ' Economics ', ' Environment ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' Family ', ' Geography ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Growth ', ' Health ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Human Development ', ' Life Cycle Stages ', ' life course ', ' Life Cycle ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Literature ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Study models ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Parents ', ' geographic population ', ' Poverty ', ' Productivity ', ' Public Health ', ' Publications ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Research ', ' Research Institute ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Support ', ' Residential Mobility ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Schools ', ' Social Characteristics ', ' Social Disorganizations ', ' Social Environment ', ' socioenvironment ', ' social context ', ' social climate ', ' Sociology ', ' statistics ', ' Stress ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Universities ', ' Measures ', ' Racial Segregation ', ' segregation ', ' Family Demographies ', ' Mediating ', ' base ', ' career ', ' role model ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Adolescent ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' Individual ', ' Bayesian statistics ', ' Bayesian statistical inference ', ' Bayesian statistical analysis ', ' Bayesian spatial analysis ', ' Bayesian network analysis ', ' Bayesian inference ', ' Bayesian Analysis ', ' Fostering ', ' Policies ', ' Funding ', ' Collaborations ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Complex ', ' Source ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' fetal ', ' meetings ', ' elementary school ', ' grade school ', ' Performance ', ' early childhood ', ' cohort ', ' Informatics ', ' Structure ', ' prenatal ', ' unborn ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' family structure ', ' models and simulation ', ' model-based simulation ', ' Social status ', ' social standing ', ' social position ', ' Academic achievement ', ' social ', ' Modeling ', ' Property ', ' deprivation ', ' theories ', ' kindergarten ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Readiness ', ' Preparedness ', ' Address ', ' social capital ', ' Data ', ' Health Sciences ', ' International ', ' National Institute of Child Health and Human Development ', ' NICHD ', ' Population Research ', ' Population-level research ', ' Population-based research ', ' Population Sciences ', ' K-Series Research Career Programs ', ' Research Career Program ', ' K-Awards ', ' Career Development Programs K-Series ', ' Career Development Awards and Programs ', ' Career Development Awards ', ' Cognitive ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' fetal programming ', ' community intervention ', ' data modeling ', ' housing tenure ', ' residential tenure ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' analytical tool ', ' skill acquisition ', ' skill development ', ' spatiotemporal ', ' public health relevance ', ' population based ', ' public health priorities ', ' population health ', ' social health determinants ', ' early life exposure ', ' Healthy People 2020 ', ' racial disparity ', ' race disparity ', ' disparities in race ', ' cognitive development ', ' course development ', ' course material development ', ' class development ', ' Life course epidemiology ', ' Lifecourse epidemiology ', ' ']",NICHD,EMORY UNIVERSITY,K01,2017,124054,0.1380741111292296
"Neighborhood Change: Impact on Sleep and Obesity-Related Health Disparities DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Individuals living in socioeconomically disadvantaged neighborhoods have disproportionately high rates of obesity and obesity-related morbidity, including increased risk for physical role limitations and cardiovascular diseases (CVD). Studies of potential mechanisms linking neighborhood disadvantage with health outcomes have primarily focused on daytime health behaviors, including diet or physical activity. However, sleep is a critical health behavior that is associated with neighborhood disadvantage, and may play a causal role in explaining the links between neighborhood disadvantage and health. However, the extant research on neighborhood disadvantage and sleep is based exclusively on cross-sectional data, using self-reports of sleep and neighborhood characteristics. Building on the existing research infrastructure developed by our team's previously funded, ongoing studies, we have a unique and important opportunity to study whether changes in the built and social environment, stimulated by substantial economic investment improves sleep, and in turn, reduces obesity-related health disparities. The study cohort includes a randomly selected cohort of 1100 low- income, African American adults, from two urban neighborhoods, one of which is undergoing a dramatic revitalization over the next 5 years (i.e., the intervention neighborhood), and the other (the sociodemographically-matched control neighborhood) is not undergoing any such changes. We will add longitudinal assessments of sleep using actigraphy, self-reports, and in a subsample of 300, objective, in-home monitoring of obstructive sleep apnea, to provide a rich characterization of sleep profiles before, during, and, after neighborhood changes. Evidence gained from this study would have substantial scientific and policy implications for identifying novel individual-level and neighborhood level factors that contribute to striking and pervasive racial and socioeconomic disparities in health. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Individuals living in socioeconomically disadvantaged neighborhoods have significantly higher rates of obesity and obesity-related health problems, including physical role limitations and cardiovascular diseases (CVD). Sleep is a critical health behavior that is associated with neighborhood disadvantage and health consequences. Therefore, sleep may serve as an important pathway linking neighborhood disadvantage with obesity and physical role limitations. Our study represents a unique opportunity to evaluate whether improvements in neighborhood conditions, spurred by substantial economic revitalization, improves sleep and in turn, mitigates obesity-related health disparities in a high-risk adult population.

"Social Disparities in NICU Care ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Racial/ethnic disparities in the quality of care provided in neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) to very low- birth-weight (VLBW; 1500g) result directly in avoidable death and morbidity. National health policy recommendations underscore that a comprehensive understanding of the multi-level factors that influence NICU quality, including mother and infant clinical, hospital, sociodemographic, and neighborhood factors, is needed to re- duce disparities. To date, research examining disparities of NICU quality suffers from considerable limitations. First, sociodemographic and neighborhood factors are rarely available for studies of NICU quality so their in- dependent and joint contributions are not well understood. Second, a lack of multi-level adjustment under- mines the validity of comparative assessments of quality by penalizing NICUs that care for vulnerable populations. Third, studies of neighborhood factors have narrowly focused on mortality, yet the majority of infants survive their birth hospitalization. To address these limitations and significantly advance the understanding of disparities in NICU quality, we will undertake a comprehensive appraisal of the multi-level factors associated with NICU quality; promote fairer comparisons by making sociodemographic and neighborhood influences explicit; and assess key areas of quality beyond mortality, including processes and outcomes of care that modulate long-term neu- rodevelopmental outcomes. Innovative methods include leveraging our vanguard efforts in developing and linking unique multi-level data sources to provide comprehensive assessments of NICU quality with unprecedented granularity, assessing NICU quality via key individual and composite measures, and using a mixed-methods approach to pro- vide unique insights into the mechanisms by which sociodemographic and neighborhood factors optimize or degrade NICU quality. This study is designed to achieve 3 specific aims: 1) Test the association of multi-level risk factors with NICU quality, 2) Evaluate the effect of multi-level risk adjustment on comparative ratings of NICU quality; and 3) Understand the drivers of disparities in NICU quality. An exceptional strength of our proposal is our ability to leverage the unique infrastructure of the California Per- inatal Quality Care Collaborative and its national counterpar the Vermont Oxford Network. Building on our pri- or work in linking complimentary high-quality clinical, administrative, and survey-based data sets containing multi-level factors, we will study  large population-scale sample of >30,000 VLBW infants in >130 NICUs in California between 2008-16. Results of this proposal are expected to have an immediate positive impact be- because they are designed to identify pragmatic areas where NICUs and communities can improve.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Unequal treatment may contribute to the differences in outcomes of vulnerable premature babies born to minorities or the poor. However, the links between social factors and the quality of medical care provided to premature babies are not well understood. We propose to address this gap, which will make an important contribution to the elimination of disparities.        ",Social Disparities in NICU Care,9251189,R01HD084667,"['Parturition ', ' Birth ', ' California ', ' Communities ', ' Data Sources ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Discrimination ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' Future ', ' Fetal Age ', ' Chronologic Fetal Maturity ', ' Gestational Age ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Hospitals ', ' Infant ', ' Premature Infant ', ' preterm neonate ', ' preterm infant human ', ' preterm infant ', ' preterm baby ', ' premature infant human ', ' premature baby ', ' infants born prematurely ', ' infants born premature ', ' Infection ', ' Intensive Care Units ', ' Neonatal Intensive Care Units ', ' neonatal ICU ', ' Newborn Intensive Care Units ', ' Interview ', ' Joints ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Length of Stay ', ' hospital stay ', ' hospital length of stay ', ' hospital days ', ' Number of Days in Hospital ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Mothers ', ' National Health Policy ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Nursing Staff ', ' nursing personnel ', ' Parents ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Retinal Diseases ', ' retinopathy ', ' retina disorder ', ' retina disease ', ' Retinal Disorder ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Social Environment ', ' socioenvironment ', ' social context ', ' social climate ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Testing ', ' Translations ', ' United States ', ' Vermont ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Research Methods ', ' Research Methodology ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' Peripartum ', ' Perinatal ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' Link ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' intraventricular hemorrhage ', ' Policies ', ' Measurement ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' very low birth weight ', ' VLBW ', ' Very Low Birth Weight Infant ', ' high risk infant ', ' vulnerable infant ', ' Necrotizing Enterocolitis ', ' Visit ', ' Performance ', ' care seeking ', ' Risk Adjustment ', ' social ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' Chronic lung disease ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Quality of Care ', ' QOC ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Provider ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Epidemiologist ', ' Process ', ' sex ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' social disparities ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' comparative ', ' collaborative care ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' public health relevance ', ' primary outcome ', ' built environment ', ' disparity reduction ', ' reduce disparity ', ' ']",NICHD,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2017,602009,0.08552930341974542
"Demographic Vulnerability, Neighborhood Pollution, and Racial Health Disparities DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposed project focuses on the ways in which social and economic conditions at the individual-, family-, and neighborhood-levels interact with neighborhood concentrations of environmental pollution to affect racial disparities in health and mortality. We will develop comprehensive measures of neighborhood pollution using data from the Environmental Protection Agency and several other sources, and attach these neighborhood- pollution estimates, along with information on other neighborhood characteristics, to longitudinal data for a diverse group of individuals in the Panel Study of Income Dynamics. The resulting multilevel data will provide a unique opportunity to assess long-term effects of neighborhood pollution on mortality, self-rated health, physical limitations, and diagnoses of cancer, cardiovascular disease, asthma, and other specific medical conditions for a national sample of adults. We will assess the efficacy of these data by comparing them to estimates of health-outcome prevalence and cross-sectional associations between neighborhood pollution and health derived from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. Analyses of our unique longitudinal, multilevel data will focus on the extent to which vulnerability to the health effects of neighborhood pollution is heightened by exposure to stressful conditions in the household or economic and social distress in the neighborhood of residence. Central to the project is the assessment of the role of group differences in exposure to neighborhood pollution, and differences in susceptibility to the effects of pollution, in explaining persistent racial and ethnic differences in health. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The project focuses directly on the effects of neighborhood pollution on several health outcomes. Identifying how the health effects of exposure to pollution vary across individual circumstances and neighborhood context has potentially important public health implications, as does understanding the role of pollution exposure in creating persistent racial and ethnic disparities in health.","Demographic Vulnerability, Neighborhood Pollution, and Racial Health Disparities",9269081,R01HD078501,"['Accounting ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Affect ', ' Air Pollution ', ' Bronchial Asthma ', ' Asthma ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' Censuses ', ' Disease Frequency Surveys ', ' Cross-Sectional Survey ', ' Cross-Sectional Analyses ', ' Cross Sectional Analysis ', ' Cross-Sectional Studies ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Economical Conditions ', ' Economic Conditions ', ' Economics ', ' Employment ', ' environmental contamination ', ' environmental contaminant ', ' Environmental Pollution ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Family ', ' Geography ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Household ', ' Long-Term Effects ', ' Longterm Effects ', ' mortality ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Public Health ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Research ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Social Conditions ', ' Societal Conditions ', ' Stress ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Environmental Protection Agency ', ' United States Environmental Protection Agency ', ' Measures ', ' stress', ' reaction ', ' stress response ', ' reaction', ' crisis ', ' biological adaptation to stress ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' Medical ', ' Link ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Predisposition ', ' Distress ', ' residential site ', ' residence ', ' Individual ', ' Inequality ', ' Exposure to ', ' NHANES ', ' National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey ', ' Life ', ' Pollution ', ' Source ', ' Location ', ' Benchmarking ', ' Best Practice Analysis ', ' experience ', ' stressor ', ' member ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Self-Report ', ' racial difference ', ' race differences ', ' ethnic difference ', ' ethnicity difference ', ' General Population ', ' General Public ', ' social ', ' land use ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' cancer diagnosis ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Data ', ' Characteristics ', ' Outcome ', ' Prevalence ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' public health relevance ', ' longitudinal analysis ', ' racial health disparity ', ' racial disparities in health ', ' panel study of income dynamics ', ' neighborhood disadvantage ', ' health difference ', ' differences in health ', ' longitudinal dataset ', ' longitudinal data set ', ' ']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2017,256470,0.21147943888212856
"Creating Community Driven, Personalized Health Maps for Patients with Diabetes Project Abstract/Summary: This NLM R01 proposal aims to develop and test a personal health library platform for patients with diabetes and prediabetes, harnessing both personal health and healthcare data (e.g., medication lists, upcoming appointments, self-tracking of diet and blood sugars) and location-based mapped data about neighborhood health resources (e.g., community reviews about the quality of grocery stores and parks). Diabetes and prediabetes patients have substantial needs for tracking and accessing health and healthcare information that are poorly met by existing platforms that largely operate in silos. Furthermore, existing digital health tools have not utilized participatory design approaches and have low uptake among specific subgroups, such as racial/ethnic minority and lower income populations. In this project, we will use design science to create and evaluate a new personal health library platform to strengthen and improve the ways in which low income individuals and communities of color access and interact with personal health data that better reflect their needs and interests. Specifically, we propose to create a new platform that enables patients with diabetes or prediabetes to import their personal health data to a mapping platform, in order to have access to store and view both private and public views of health- promoting and health-inhibiting community factors in their own neighborhood. This new platform will be titled: “Mapping to Amplify the Vitality of Engaged Neighborhoods,” or MAVEN. In Aim 1, we will use inductive observational methods to follow community leaders/health advocates and patients with either diabetes or prediabetes to understand existing health and healthcare journeys and map existing resources in their neighborhoods. We will recruit patients and community-based organization leaders from 3 San Francisco neighborhoods with the highest prevalence of diabetes and pre-diabetes, which also correspond with existing San Francisco Health Network clinics in our healthcare system. In Aim 2, we will recruit a second sample of individuals to complete user-centered design methods (e.g., card-sorting and thinkaloud interviews) to prioritize and test prototypes of data elements within the new MAVEN personal health library platform. In Aim 3, we will conduct real-world usability testing of a functional version of the MAVEN platform to explore its acceptability and usability in everyday life. Because we will engage racially/ethnically and socioeconomically diverse patients in this project, we will ensure that the MAVEN personal health library platform is relevant for patients with varying levels of health literacy and technology proficiency. In addition, because we will engage community health advocates and public healthcare system leaders, our findings will have more direct implications for implementation and dissemination. Project Narrative: This goal of this study is to develop and evaluate an online platform that patients with diabetes or prediabetes can use to combine important information relevant to their health and healthcare – such as medical information, personal data on diet or blood sugar levels, and community data on health resources in their neighborhood. We will first design the platform with community member and community health advocate input, and then we will test the platform to see how individuals use it in everyday life. We will recruit racially/ethnically and socioeconomically diverse individuals in this study to ensure that the final product is relevant for the broader public, even those without extensive experience using technology.","Creating Community Driven, Personalized Health Maps for Patients with Diabetes",9670581,R01LM013045,"['Communities ', ' health care delivery ', ' health services delivery ', ' Healthcare Delivery ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Diet ', ' dietary ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Exercise ', ' Face ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Food ', ' Food or Food Product ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Health Promotion ', ' promoting health ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' Personal Health Records ', ' Health Resources ', ' Health Status ', ' Level of Health ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Interview ', ' Libraries ', ' Life Style ', ' Lifestyle ', ' Low Income Population ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' nutrition ', ' Patients ', ' Pharmacy facility ', ' Pharmacies ', ' Privatization ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' San Francisco ', ' Science ', ' Sleep ', ' Social Work ', ' Social Service ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Technology ', ' Telephone ', ' Phone ', ' Testing ', ' Businesses ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' ethnographic ', ' Ethnography ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Phase ', ' Medical ', ' Ensure ', ' Evaluation ', ' Physical activity ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' participant recruitment ', ' Patient Recruitments ', ' uptake ', ' Collaborations ', ' tool ', ' Prediabetes syndrome ', ' syndrome x ', ' prediabetic ', ' pre-diabetic ', ' pre-diabetes ', ' Prediabetic State ', ' Prediabetes ', ' Patient Preferences ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Disease Management ', ' Disorder Management ', ' Complex ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' Clinic ', ' System ', ' Location ', ' Country ', ' Test Result ', ' interest ', ' Visit ', ' experience ', ' medical appointment ', ' peer ', ' member ', ' Sorting - Cell Movement ', ' sorting ', ' Health Technology ', ' Health Care Technology ', ' Sampling ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Low income ', ' Advocate ', ' Data ', ' Data Element ', ' High Prevalence ', ' Subgroup ', ' Process ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' Community Health ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socio-economically ', ' socio-economic ', ' socioeconomics ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' Output ', ' health literacy ', ' digital ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' ethnic minority ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' Health behavior change ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' user centered design ', ' usability ', ' prototype ', ' sharing data ', ' flexible ', ' flexibility ', ' health data ', ' data visualization ', ' ethnically diverse ', ' ethnic diversity ', ' Healthy Eating ', ' recruit ', ' Appointment ', ' Behavior ', ' Blood Glucose ', ' Blood Sugar ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Cities ', ' Color ', ' ']",NLM,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R01,2018,337285,0.06381823869997026
"Understanding the contributions of the neighborhood social environment to cardiovascular disease risk factors in a multi-ethnic cohort of Chicago women ABSTRACT While several advances have been made in the assessment of the impact of the neighborhood built environment (i.e., physical attributes like grocery stores or parks) on cardiometabolic disease risk, fewer gains have been made in understanding the contributions of the neighborhood social environment (i.e., socioeconomic composition, crime, and collective efficacy). Most prior neighborhood research on the social environment has utilized U.S. Census indicators, to characterize neighborhood features.14 Although these measures can sufficiently capture the role of neighborhood-level socioeconomic disadvantage and racial/ethnic residential segregation, they are more limited in their ability to assess the influence of other aspects of the social environment related to crime and collective efficacy like economic disinvestment and physical disorder. This is especially problematic at a time when public health practitioners are being called on to identify salient targets for more collaborative, cross-sector approaches to addressing social determinants of health. In recognition of this gap in the field, the objective of this application is to use more novel, widely available data sources to investigate the contributions of under-studied aspects of the social environment to cardiometabolic disease risk in a sample of women ages 18-44 living in the city of Chicago. We will achieve this objective in part by taking advantage of Google's “Street View” feature, which makes it possible to assess these features virtually by viewing high resolution images of neighborhoods of interest and taking a virtual “walk” through the neighborhood.17-19 We will also use a combination of business location databases, housing stock and affordability data, and American Community Survey data. The successful execution of these aims will meaningfully improve the field by testing the influence of multiple objective, cost-effective, and scalable measures of the social environment on cardiometabolic disease risk. NARRATIVE Public health practitioners are being called on to take more collaborative, cross-sector approaches to addressing social determinants of health due to the growing recognition that health is influenced by the social, physical, and economic environments in which people live. Studies of the neighborhood social environment and cardiovascular disease risk to date have largely focused on broad factors like neighborhood socioeconomic disadvantage and racial/ethnic residential segregation rather than specific aspects of the social environment that could serve as targets for healthy public policy development. The successful execution of these aims will provide the scientific community with objective, scalable ways of capturing the features of the neighborhood social environment that are hypothesized to underlie place-based health disparities.",Understanding the contributions of the neighborhood social environment to cardiovascular disease risk factors in a multi-ethnic cohort of Chicago women,9649844,R03HL145223,"['cost-effective ', ' cost effective ', ' Population ', ' Eating Behavior ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' high risk ', ' social health determinants ', ' socioeconomically underprivileged ', ' Socioeconomically disadvantaged ', ' socioeconomic disadvantage ', ' built environment ', ' lack of physical activity ', ' physical inactivity ', ' differences in health ', ' health difference ', ' high resolution imaging ', ' cardiometabolic ', ' cardiometabolism ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Birth ', ' Parturition ', ' Blood Pressure ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Censuses ', ' Cerebrovascular Disorders ', ' intracranial vascular dysfunction ', ' cerebrovascular dysfunction ', ' cerebral vascular dysfunction ', ' cerebral vascular disease ', ' brain vascular dysfunction ', ' brain vascular disease ', ' Intracranial Vascular Disorders ', ' Intracranial Vascular Diseases ', ' Cerebrovascular Disease ', ' Brain Vascular Disorders ', ' Chicago ', ' Cities ', ' Communities ', ' Community Surveys ', ' Coronary heart disease ', ' coronary disorder ', ' atherosclerotic heart disease ', ' Coronary Disease ', ' Crime ', ' Data Reporting ', ' data representation ', ' Data Sources ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Economics ', ' Environment ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health Promotion ', ' promoting health ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' Housing ', ' Inflammation ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Life Expectancy ', ' Longevity ', ' lifespan ', ' life span ', ' Length of Life ', ' Methods ', ' Persons ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' New York ', ' Poverty ', ' Prostitution ', ' survival sex ', ' commercial sex work ', ' commercial sex ', ' Public Health ', ' Public Policy ', ' Publications ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Questionnaires ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Social Characteristics ', ' Social Environment ', ' socioenvironment ', ' social context ', ' social climate ', ' Stress ', ' Time ', ' Travel ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' segregation ', ' Racial Segregation ', ' Walking ', ' Police ', ' Businesses ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Chronic ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Physical activity ', ' Individual ', ' data base ', ' Data Bases ', ' Databases ', ' Logistics ', ' Policy Developments ', ' Metabolic ', ' vandalism ', ' Source ', ' Location ', ' Country ', ' interest ', ' Services ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' field study ', ' field test ', ' field learning ', ' field based data ', ' hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis ', ' hypothalmus-pituitary-adrenal axis ', ' hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis ', ' cohort ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' disorder risk ', ' disease risk ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' Sampling ', ' Property ', ' cardiovascular disorder risk ', ' cardiovascular disease risk ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Body mass index ', ' Quetelet index ', ' BMI z-score ', ' BMI percentile ', ' low socioeconomic status ', ' low socioeconomic position ', ' low socio-economic status ', ' low socio-economic position ', ' low SES ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Reproducibility ', ' Process ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socio-economically ', ' socio-economic ', ' socioeconomics ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' NHLBI ', ' National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute ', ' virtual ', ' Outcome ', ' ']",NHLBI,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,R03,2018,79000,0.17887884089978
"Social Environmental Factors, DNA methylation of inflammation genes and Breast Cancer Survivorship among African American Women Cancer disparities might result from biologic, behavioral, and social environmental factors. This Career Development Proposal (CDP) will enable attainment of Dr. Jesse Plascak's long-term goal of becoming an NIH- funded independent investigator studying relationships between the social environment, biologic factors, and cancer disparities. The applicant's previous training includes social and spatial epidemiology of cancer disparities. Dr. Plascak has investigated relationships between neighborhood segregation (racial-ethnic and socioeconomic), social cohesion (positive relationships within neighborhoods), neighborhood disorder (physical deterioration or lack of social control), discrimination, and cancer outcomes. Attaining a trans-disciplinary and independent cancer disparities research program will require the following additional training and mentors: (1) cancer molecular biology – genetics and epigenetics (Drs. Kitaw Demissie and Helmut Zarbl), (2) counterfactual- based causal inference (Drs. Zhiqiang Tan and Mario Schootman), (3) African American (AA) breast cancer (BrCa) epidemiology (Dr. Elisa Bandera), and (4) systematic social observation (SSO) of the social environment (Drs. Andrew Rundle and Mario Schootman). Dr. Plascak will apply this mentored training to address a series of research questions using the longitudinal Women's Circle of Health Follow-up Study (WCHS-L) (R01CA185623) – an ongoing study enrolling 1,700 AA BrCa survivors with comprehensive questionnaire data including perceived neighborhood social cohesion, perceived neighborhood disorder, medical records, cancer registry records, and blood samples. DNA methylation (DNAm) of inflammation-related genes will be quantified from blood samples. SSO will be conducted to create objective measures of neighborhood disorder of each WCHS- L participant's residence. Residential segregation measures will be calculated from a dataset representative of the spatial distribution and sociodemographic composition of study area households. Causal inference methods will be used to test relationships between social environmental factors, DNAm, and BrCa survival. The research aims are to assess: (1) participants' objective neighborhood disorder using SSO and investigate correlations between social environmental factors (residential segregation, perceived and objective neighborhood disorder, social cohesion), (2) associations between social environmental factors and BrCa survival, and (3) whether aberrant DNAm and altered expression of inflammation-related genes mediate the association between environmental factors and BrCa survival. Training and research activities have been tailored to the Rutgers University exceptional research environment: The Cancer Institute of New Jersey (NCI Comprehensive Cancer Center housing a SEER registry) and Center for Environmental Exposures and Disease (NIEHS P30 center). Preliminary findings will form the basis of a R01 grant proposal. Completion of the activities outlined in this CDP will allow Dr. Plascak to become an independent, transdisciplinary investigator of cancer disparities; contributing to improvements in population health through the prevention and control of cancer and cancer disparities. This projects ultimately seeks to improve public health by identifying novel social and biologic factors that can be targeted to prevent or treat female breast cancer mortality. Social environmental factors such as residential segregation and neighborhood disorder can be prevented through public health-relevant policy. Epigenetic alteration of inflammation genes can be therapeutically targeted to potentially lengthen survival times following diagnosis with breast cancer.","Social Environmental Factors, DNA

"Modeling and Forecasting Atherosclerotic Risk: A Complex Systems Approach Project Summary/Abstract Inequality in health outcomes in relation to Americans' socioeconomic status (SES) is rising: a recent study by the Brookings Institution found that life expectancy for men and women in the top 10% of career earnings was over 10 years greater than those in the bottom 10%. Cardiovascular disease – still leading cause of death for Americans – merits study with respect to these findings. More research on how SES affects atherosclerotic risk is needed. The goal of our project is to develop advanced forecasting algorithms for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD)-related events – both at baseline and longitudinally – using systems-based modeling methodologies which incorporate probabilistic representations of patients' socioeconomic and environmental characteristics. This represents a paradigm shift beyond existing models used in guiding primary and secondary prevention of atherosclerotic disease; in particular, risk models developed by the American College of Cardiology Foundation and the American Heart Association (ACCF/AHA) are based solely on physiological risk factors. We believe that the prediction performance of ASCVD risk models can be significantly improved by incorporating socioeconomic and environmental risks, especially in an era where improved primary and secondary prevention and increased socioeconomic inequality have resulted in complex phenomena among elderly Americans with respect to ASCVD risk. Our preliminary work indicates a significant degree of neighborhood-level variability in major ASCVD events (myocardial infarction, stroke or cardiovascular death), with low-SES neighborhoods associated with event rates over three times that of high-SES neighborhoods. Moreover, neighborhood SES explained four times the amount of neighborhood-level variation in ASCVD event rates than that explained by the ACCF/AHA Pooled Cohort Equations Risk Model. Our proposed project will therefore provide an essential risk modeling platform to health care systems focused on optimizing the health of populations that are highly heterogeneous with respect to socioeconomic and environmental characteristics. These models will be developed in a team-based environment, including translational scientists from general internal medicine, cardiology, social work, spatial epidemiology, urban poverty, community development, immunology, and data and population health sciences. Informing the models will be a newly-established, cutting-edge regional research registry, based on electronic health data from Northeast Ohio's two largest health systems, Cleveland Clinic and MetroHealth. Ultimately, this research is anticipated to yield new mechanistic insights and hypotheses, more accurate prediction models for cardiovascular outcomes, and a basis for informing decisions at multiple strategic and programmatic levels. Project Narrative Poorer Americans are now expected to live 10 fewer years than wealthier Americans. Doctors and other providers need tools to identify people who are at greatest risk of poor heart disease outcomes. Our research will improve on current approaches by understanding the complexity of neighborhood, economic and clinical factors and how they determine heart disease risk.",Modeling and Forecasting

"Urban Revitalization and Long-Term Effects on Diet, Economic, and Health Outcomes Project Abstract Improving access to healthful foods such as fruits, vegetables, and whole grains has been an important policy strategy, intended to improve diet and reduce obesity among vulnerable populations. In our parent grant (Does a New Supermarket Improve Dietary Behaviors of Low-income African Americans? R01CA149105), our team capitalized on a natural experiment in which a Healthy Food Financing Initiative (HFFI)-supported full-service supermarket (FSS) was opened in an underserved area. In 2011, we enrolled a cohort (N=1,372) of randomly selected households from an intervention neighborhood (that received the new FSS) and a similar comparison neighborhood and followed the cohort from prior to the FSS’s opening through one year post-opening. We found that intervention neighborhood residents had some dietary improvements – lower added sugars, calories, and saturated fats, alcohols and added sugars (SoFAAS). However, use of the new FSS, the hypothesized mediator, was not associated with dietary changes. The proposed renewal grant seeks to examine whether the socioeconomic impact that the new FSS or anticipation of it and other developments among investors, had on the neighborhood might be responsible for the dietary improvements we observed. It also taps into a new opportunity to examine the effect of much larger ongoing and impending revitalization of the intervention neighborhood on neighborhood socioeconomic conditions and diet. Addressing these research questions will help us to better understand and to replicate the dietary improvements of placing an FSS in a food desert. Results will speak to the substantial literature linking neighborhood socioeconomic conditions, diet, and weight, largely limited to cross-sectional studies. We will also examine the extent to which the dietary improvements we observed in our parent study are maintained, and the pathways by which neighborhood socioeconomic conditions may impact diet. To achieve this, we will obtain and merge secondary retrospective and prospective data concerning neighborhood socioeconomic conditions (NSEC) of the intervention and control neighborhoods with existing survey data and neighborhood audits, and collect two additional waves of survey and audit data capturing the impending major neighborhood revitalization projects that are underway or in development. Data will be analyzed using difference in difference and structural modeling approaches to test the impact of these natural experiments and the hypothesized causal pathway from neighborhood change to dietary improvement. Thus, the proposed renewal will capitalize on our existing data, cohort, and research infrastructure to address critically important follow-on questions and will be the first study, to our knowledge, to test whether SES improvements at the neighborhood and individual level are associated with improved diet and weight status. Project Narrative Improving access to healthful foods such as fruits, vegetables, and whole grains has been a highly touted policy strategy, intending to improve diet and reduce obesity among vulnerable populations. Our parent study documented some improvements in diet among residents after the opening of a full-service supermarket in a low-income, predominantly African American neighborhood in Pittsburgh, PA. However, we found no association between use of the new supermarket and the dietary improvements. Our proposed study will continue to follow the randomly selected cohort to examine whether dietary changes are maintained, and to what degree a very large additional investment in the neighborhood results in dietary improvements. It is possible that the opening of the new supermarket created a neighborhood-level shift in socioeconomic conditions and, although much literature exists around neighborhood socioeconomic status (SES) and its association with diet and weight status, we know of no studies that have linked shifts in SES to changes in diet or weight. Should neighborhood SES improvement underlie dietary improvements, neighborhood investments other than increased access to healthful food might serve the same function and should be considered.","Urban Revitalization and Long-Term Effects on Diet, Economic, and Health Outcomes",9503697,R01CA149105,"['Alcohols ', ' Alcohol Chemical Class ', ' Behavior ', ' Energy Intake ', ' caloric dietary content ', ' Caloric Intake ', ' Crime ', ' Cross-Sectional Studies ', ' Disease Frequency Surveys ', ' Cross-Sectional Survey ', ' Cross-Sectional Analyses ', ' Cross Sectional Analysis ', ' Diet ', ' dietary ', ' Dietary Fiber ', ' whole grain ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Economics ', ' Food ', ' Food or Food Product ', ' Future ', ' Geographic Locations ', ' geographic site ', ' Geographical Location ', ' Geographic Region ', ' Geographic Area ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' Health Promotion ', ' promoting health ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' Household ', ' Incentives ', ' Income ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Investments ', ' Literature ', ' Long-Term Effects ', ' Longterm Effects ', ' Structural Models ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Obesity ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Parents ', ' Play ', ' Poverty ', ' Research ', ' Stress ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Testing ', ' Weight ', ' Measures ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Mediating ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Feeling hopeless ', ' hopelessness ', ' No hope for the future ', ' Negative about the future ', ' Loss of hope for the future ', ' Feels there is no future ', ' Cannot see a future ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Link ', ' Individual ', ' sugar ', ' Policies ', ' healthy food ', ' Health Food ', ' Calories ', ' Supermarket ', ' Services ', ' saturated fat ', ' saturated lipid ', ' saturated dietary lipid ', ' saturated dietary fat ', ' cohort ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' response ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Dietary intake ', ' Low income ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Improve Access ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Infrastructure ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Process ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socio-economically ', ' socio-economic ', ' socioeconomics ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' Food Access ', ' Outcome ', ' prospective ', ' Natural experiment ', ' fruits and vegetables ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' parent grant ', ' secondary analysis ', ' ']",NCI,RAND CORPORATION,R01,2018,716078,0.08183715879133904
"Using Geographically Targeted and Community-Based Methods to Identify Factors Associated with Micro-Level Disparities in Diabetic Outcomes and Enhance Monitoring of Glycemic Control Among Black Men Project Summary / Abstract  This mentored patient-oriented research career development award (K23) will support Dr. David Lee’s training and research to use geographically targeted and community-based methods to identify factors associated with micro-level disparities in diabetic outcomes and enhance monitoring of glycemic control among Black men. Though the prevalence of diabetes is increasing nationally, current diabetes surveillance methods are unable to identify hot spots of poor diabetic outcomes at a community level. However, studies based on a novel geographic method of diabetes surveillance have found that the increase in diabetes burden has been focused in specific communities, especially among Black neighborhoods. For Black adults, poor diabetes control has been associated with fewer primary care visits, less frequent HbA1c testing, and higher rates of emergency department use and hospitalizations, especially among diabetic Black men. Given this infrequent interaction with a usual source of healthcare, community-based settings may provide the advantages of pre- existing trust and engagement to optimize health outcomes for high-risk populations living in neighborhoods that are hot spots of diabetic complications. Thus, the specific aims of this proposal are 1) to use geospatial and quantitative methods to identify which micro-contextual factors account for local disparities in diabetic outcomes among Black communities, 2) to use geographically-targeted qualitative interviews to identify neighborhood-level factors that explain poor diabetic outcomes in certain Black communities, and 3) to perform community-based HbA1c testing and diabetes self-care surveys among Black men living in neighborhoods with a high prevalence of diabetic complications. This community-based research will leverage existing partnerships within a network of local Black-owned barbershops in New York City. Barbershops have become increasingly effective sites for promoting health and measuring health outcomes among Black men, a population which has high rates of mortality and morbidity from diabetes. The results of this research will inform future R-series applications to expand this approach to other high-risk subgroups in Black neighborhoods and other racial and ethnic communities with extremely poor diabetic outcomes. Dr. Lee’s training goals closely parallel his research aims and will further enhance his understanding of: 1) advanced quantitative analysis, 2) qualitative and mixed methods, 3) social and behavioral science, and 4) diabetes education and management. The proposed research and training will be conducted at the New York University School of Medicine and leverage resources of the other professional schools at NYU, which offer outstanding opportunities for collaboration, learning, and multidisciplinary research. This environment, in addition to his research and training plan will provide Dr. Lee with a strong foundation from which he can accelerate his career towards his goal of becoming a fully independent clinical investigator dedicated to reducing disparities in diabetes burden and improving health outcomes in communities that are overwhelmed by diabetic complications. PROJECT NARRATIVE  The overall burden of diabetes is increasing nationally, but specific neighborhoods, especially in Black communities, have experienced a disproportionately higher prevalence of diabetes and its complications such as kidney failure and lower extremity amputations. The goal of the proposed research is to use a mix of quantitative and qualitative methods to identify the micro-contextual factors that account for local disparities in diabetic outcomes among Black communities with a high versus low prevalence of diabetic complications and to enhance the monitoring of glycemic control in neighborhoods with especially poor diabetic outcomes. This K23 career development award will foster Dr. David Lee’s transition to becoming a fully-independent investigator capable of conducting high-impact research to enhance our understanding of local disparities in diabetic outcomes among communities with overwhelming diabetes burden.",Using Geographically Targeted and Community-Based Methods to Identify Factors Associated with Micro-Level Disparities in Diabetic Outcomes and Enhance Monitoring of Glycemic Control Among Black Men,9485945,K23DK110316,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Ambulatory Care ', ' outpatient treatment ', ' Outpatient Care ', ' Amputation ', ' Behavioral Sciences ', ' Clinical Investigator ', ' Communities ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Emergency Situation ', ' Emergencies ', ' Environment ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Geography ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health Promotion ', ' promoting health ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' Health Status ', ' Level of Health ', ' Glycosylated hemoglobin A ', ' hemoglobin A1c ', ' Hemoglobin A(1) ', ' HbA1c ', ' HbA1 ', ' Hb A1c ', ' Hb A1a+b ', ' Hb A1 ', ' Glycohemoglobin A ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Interview ', ' Learning ', ' Lower Extremity ', ' Membrum inferius ', ' Lower Limb ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' New York ', ' New York City ', ' Play ', ' Poverty ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Primary Care ', ' Kidney Failure ', ' Renal Insufficiency ', ' Renal Failure ', ' Kidney Insufficiency ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Schools ', ' medical schools ', ' school of medicine ', ' medical college ', ' Self Care ', ' personal care ', ' Social Sciences ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' Measures ', ' Self Management ', ' base ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Series ', ' Training ', ' social norm ', ' Trust ', ' diabetic ', ' Fostering ', ' Multidisciplinary Research ', ' Multidisciplinary Collaboration ', ' Interdisciplinary Research ', ' Interdisciplinary Study ', ' Collaborations ', ' Spottings ', ' Complications of Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Diabetic Complications ', ' Diabetes-Related Complications ', ' Diabetes Complications ', ' Source ', ' contextual factors ', ' Application Context ', ' Visit ', ' Accident and Emergency department ', ' Emergency room ', ' Emergency Department ', ' behavioral/social science ', ' diabetes education ', ' experience ', ' knowledge base ', ' knowledgebase ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' Address ', ' Qualitative Methods ', ' qualitative reasoning ', ' Data ', ' High Prevalence ', ' Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award ', ' Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award (K23) ', ' K23 Program ', ' K23 Mechanism ', ' K23 Award ', ' K-Series Research Career Programs ', ' Research Career Program ', ' K-Awards ', ' Career Development Programs K-Series ', ' Career Development Awards and Programs ', ' Career Development Awards ', ' Research Training ', ' Subgroup ', ' Surveillance Methods ', ' Low Prevalence ', ' Monitor ', ' Hot Spot ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socio-economically ', ' socio-economic ', ' socioeconomics ', ' point of care ', ' Behavioral ', ' diabetic management ', ' diabetes management ', ' glycemic control ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' participatory action research ', ' community based research ', ' community based design ', ' community based participatory research ', ' high risk ', ' diabetes control ', ' amputated limb ', ' limb amputation ', ' food environment ', ' race disparity ', ' disparities in race ', ' racial disparity ', ' reduce disparity ', ' disparity reduction ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare access ', ' health care service availability ', ' health care service access ', ' accessibility to healthcare ', ' accessibility to health care ', ' accessibility of health care ', ' access to healthcare ', ' access to health care ', ' health care availability ', ' health care community ', ' healthcare community ', ' high risk group ', ' high risk population ', ' ']",NIDDK,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,K23,2018,198604,0.07579936405432622
"Impact of Park Renovations on Physical Activity and Community Health in NYC ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The built environment plays a critical role in promoting physical activity and health. The association between parks, as a key attribute of the built environment, and physical activity, however, remains inconclusive. This project employs a natural experiment design to assess the impact of the Community Parks Initiative (CPI), a New York City Department of Parks and Recreation (NYC Parks) park redesign and renovation initiative, on physical activity, park usage, psychosocial and mental health, and community wellbeing. The project will use a longitudinal design with matched controls. NYC Parks has identified 134 parks with extreme capital needs in high-priority neighborhoods and will begin renovating parks in waves. In late 2016, the first wave of 35 parks across 55 neighborhoods will close for renovations; these parks will reopen in late 2017. From this initial wave, 20 interventio parks have been selected for inclusion in this study. Intervention park neighborhoods have been matched to a control group of 20 socio-economically similar park neighborhoods that will not be renovated during the study. The study will address two aims. In Aim 1, investigators will compare total volume of PA and other health outcomes among residents in the intervention vs. control park neighborhoods (defined as .25 mile radius around each park) from baseline to 2.5 years post-renovation. We hypothesize that improvements will be observed in PA and health levels in intervention but not control neighborhoods. In Aim 2, an additional 10 park neighborhoods receiving renovation in 2018 and reopening in 2019 will be used to monitor replicability of intervention effects at 1.5 years post-renovation. This combined design enhances our ability to infer causality in a natural experiment. We aim to recruit and retain 40 study participants per park neighborhood, after attrition, for a total of 1600 participants in Aim 1 and 400 in Aim 2. Study participants will represent two distinct sociodemographic strata in each neighborhood: low-income housing and community- engaged residents. Measures include direct park observations and program checklists, park quality, self- reported and GPS-tracked park usage, accelerometry-based physical activity, self-reported psychosocial health, and perceived community wellbeing. The largest natural experiment of its kind to date, this study represents a rare opportunity to provide robust evidence to further our understanding of the complex relationship between parks and physical activity, psychosocial and mental health, and community wellbeing. The findings will inform future investments in health-oriented urban design policies and offer evidence for addressing health disparities through built environment strategies. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    The project will evaluate the long-term effects of a citywide public park redesign and renovation initiative on residents' physical activity, psychosocial and mental health, and community wellbeing.

"Neighborhood Environments and Intergenerational Transmission of Cardiovascular Health PROJECT SUMMARY Given that < 5% of American have ideal cardiovascular health, efforts to improve cardiovascular health need to focus on aspects of the environment that promote and sustain cardiovascular health. However, given the difficulty and expense of obtaining longitudinal neighborhood measures, especially in early childhood and adolescent periods, along with rich data on markers of cardiovascular risk, few studies have characterized: 1) to what extent aspects of neighborhood context in residential and school-based settings during adolescence affect CVH and racial/ethnic differences in CVH among adolescent girls as they transition into adulthood, 2) at which developmental time period (childhood, adolescence, or adulthood) neighborhood environments have the most impact on CVH of women, and 3) the extent to which associations are mediated by stress- related processes. Moreover, the potential intergenerational influence of neighborhood environments on the cardiovascular health of the next generation has not yet been well characterized. Thus, the overarching goal of the proposed population-based study is to examine associations between neighborhood and school environments at critical developmental stages (early childhood, adolescence, adulthood) in relation to ideal cardiovascular health of adolescent girls as they transition to adulthood, and to determine whether these environments are associated with the cardiovascular health of their offspring. To achieve this goal, this study will leverage existing data from the National Growth and Health Study, a longitudinal study of black and white girls from diverse socioeconomic backgrounds that have been followed from age 9-10 to age 19-20. In a recently funded follow-up study, “Race, stress, and dysregulated eating: Maternal to child transmission of obesity”, women from the Richmond, CA site, and a subset of their children have, been re-enrolled for a follow-up assessment at ages 38-40. We have the unique opportunity to create a longitudinal database of indicators of neighborhood environments via study questionnaire and data linkages to historical geo- spatially referenced administrative data sources to create 40 years of contextual data. The proposed research will help improve understanding of how neighborhood environments may promote and sustain cardiovascular health of women and their children and to inform context-specific interventions targets that may help improve primordial prevention efforts for cardiovascular disease. RELEVANCE: The overall goal of this research project to examine neighborhood environments over the life course (early childhood, adolescence, and adulthood), in relation to the cardiovascular health of women and the intergenerational influence of these environments on the cardiovascular health of their offspring.

"Racial inequalities in health throughout adulthood: The cumulative impact of neighborhood chemical and non-chemical stressors on epigenomic pathways ABSTRACT Racial inequalities in healthy aging have been well-documented. Compared to White Americans, Black Americans experience illness and death at early ages and show steeper age-related declines in health. Our neighborhoods, as the site of where we live, learn, play, and pray, may serve as a powerful source of these racial inequalities. Racial residential segregation (which is the sorting of different racial groups into different neighborhoods through historical and current discriminatory policies and practices) has resulted in a racially unequal American neighborhood landscape. Neighborhoods with mostly Black residents experience more poverty, civic and commercial disinvestment, and more exposure to environmental hazards compared to neighborhoods with mostly White residents. While more researchers are documenting the role of neighborhoods in health inequalities, we may actually be underestimating the true impact of neighborhood context, because we often focus on specific health outcomes, such as cardiovascular disease or diabetes. However, there are likely shared biological mechanisms within the body that drive many of these diseases – and one such mechanism may be changes to our genomic structure, called epigenomics. While our genes do not change, the environment can have an impact on whether our genes are actually “expressed”. We will determine whether the accumulation of adulthood lived experience in racially-segregated neighborhoods is related to epigenomic patterns called DNA methylation. We will also specifically determine whether the accumulation of adulthood exposure to neighborhood industrial air pollution and disadvantage together are related to these patterns of DNA methylation. Finally, we will determine whether the DNA methylation patterns we see are related to racial inequalities in healthy aging. We hypothesize that racially-segregation Black neighborhoods, with their greater levels of industrial air pollution and social disadvantage, will be related to the types of patterns in DNA methylation that have been shown to be related to chronic diseases in molecular studies. In fact, we further hypothesize that these patterns in DNA methylation will be related to racial inequalities in cognitive function and the number of chronic diseases one has had. Clarifying the role of neighborhood context in racial inequalities in healthy aging is critical, as neighborhoods are not naturally- occurring. They develop and change through policies and are amenable to intervention. Identifying the role of DNA methylation that likely underlies many chronic diseases, will clarify the importance of neighborhoods and point to potential effective interventions. PROJECT NARRATIVE Racial inequalities in healthy aging are well-known and neighborhoods, where we live, learn, play, and pray, has emerged as a potentially powerful driver of these health inequalities. We will determine whether neighborhood social stressors and environmental hazards are, in combination, linked to racial inequalities in the molecular underpinnings of numerous chronic diseases of aging. The results of this study will highlight the role of neighborhoods as a potentially effective point of intervention to eliminate racial health inequalities.",Racial inequalities in health throughout adulthood: The cumulative impact of neighborhood chemical and non-chemical stressors on epigenomic pathways,9599645,R01MD013299,"['Acceleration ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Aging ', ' Air Pollution ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Data Collection ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' DNA ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' DNA Markers ', ' Ecology ', ' Environmental Science ', ' Environment ', ' Environmental Pollution ', ' environmental contamination ', ' environmental contaminant ', ' Genes ', ' Health ', ' Industrialization ', ' Learning ', ' Literature ', ' Methylation ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Play ', ' Poverty ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Social Environment ', ' socioenvironment ', ' social context ', ' social climate ', ' Social Sciences ', ' Stress ', ' Environmental Hazards ', ' Measures ', ' segregation ', ' Racial Segregation ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Site ', ' Chronic ', ' Biological ', ' Link ', ' Chemicals ', ' white American ', ' caucasian American ', ' Policies ', ' Inequality ', ' Exposure to ', ' DNA Methylation ', ' cognitive function ', ' Immune ', ' Immunes ', ' Complex ', ' Source ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' Physical environment ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' stressor ', ' Structure ', ' Sorting - Cell Movement ', ' sorting ', ' social ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Genomics ', ' Etiology ', ' disease causation ', ' causation ', ' Causality ', ' Data ', ' Collection ', ' Epigenetic Mechanism ', ' Epigenetic Change ', ' Epigenetic ', ' Epigenetic Process ', ' Molecular ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' epigenomics ', ' age dependent ', ' age related ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' healthy aging ', ' effective intervention ', ' health inequalities ', ' methylation pattern ', ' ']",NIMHD,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2018,734263,0.14998415096819992
"Neighborhood Change: Impact on Sleep and Obesity-Related Health Disparities DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Individuals living in socioeconomically disadvantaged neighborhoods have disproportionately high rates of obesity and obesity-related morbidity, including increased risk for physical role limitations and cardiovascular diseases (CVD). Studies of potential mechanisms linking neighborhood disadvantage with health outcomes have primarily focused on daytime health behaviors, including diet or physical activity. However, sleep is a critical health behavior that is associated with neighborhood disadvantage, and may play a causal role in explaining the links between neighborhood disadvantage and health. However, the extant research on neighborhood disadvantage and sleep is based exclusively on cross-sectional data, using self-reports of sleep and neighborhood characteristics. Building on the existing research infrastructure developed by our team's previously funded, ongoing studies, we have a unique and important opportunity to study whether changes in the built and social environment, stimulated by substantial economic investment improves sleep, and in turn, reduces obesity-related health disparities. The study cohort includes a randomly selected cohort of 1100 low- income, African American adults, from two urban neighborhoods, one of which is undergoing a dramatic revitalization over the next 5 years (i.e., the intervention neighborhood), and the other (the sociodemographically-matched control neighborhood) is not undergoing any such changes. We will add longitudinal assessments of sleep using actigraphy, self-reports, and in a subsample of 300, objective, in-home monitoring of obstructive sleep apnea, to provide a rich characterization of sleep profiles before, during, and, after neighborhood changes. Evidence gained from this study would have substantial scientific and policy implications for identifying novel individual-level and neighborhood level factors that contribute to striking and pervasive racial and socioeconomic disparities in health. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Individuals living in socioeconomically disadvantaged neighborhoods have significantly higher rates of obesity and obesity-related health problems, including physical role limitations and cardiovascular diseases (CVD). Sleep is a critical health behavior that is associated with neighborhood disadvantage and health consequences. Therefore, sleep may serve as an important pathway linking neighborhood disadvantage with obesity and physical role limitations. Our study represents a unique opportunity to evaluate whether improvements in neighborhood conditions, spurred by substantial economic revitalization, improves sleep and in turn, mitigates obesity-related health disparities in a high-risk adult population. Findings from this longitudinal study would provide a stronger test of the causal relationships between neighborhood disadvantage, sleep, and health.",Neighborhood Change: Impact on Sleep and Obesity-Related Health Disparities,9412184,R01HL122460,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Affect ', ' Behavior ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Control Groups ', ' Crime ', ' Diet ', ' dietary ', ' Economics ', ' Esthetics ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' Investments ', ' Literature ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Obesity ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Perception ', ' Play ', ' Public Housing ', ' Research ', ' Research Design ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Safety ', ' Sleep ', ' Sleep disturbances ', ' Social Environment ', ' socioenvironment ', ' social context ', ' social climate ', ' Stress ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Measures ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Businesses ', ' Mediating ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Solid ', ' Link ', ' Physical activity ', ' Individual ', ' Populations at Risk ', ' Policies ', ' Funding ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' Obstructive Sleep Apnea ', ' Syndrome, Sleep Apnea, Obstructive ', ' Supermarket ', ' Services ', ' experience ', ' cohesion ', ' cohort ', ' novel ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Self-Report ', ' social ', ' Sleep Disorders ', ' sleep problem ', ' Modeling ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' actigraphy ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Low income ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Data ', ' Measurable ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Strategic Planning ', ' Monitor ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socio-economically ', ' socio-economic ', ' socioeconomics ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Natural experiment ', ' community safety ', ' neighborhood safety ', ' participatory action research ', ' community based research ', ' community based design ', ' community based participatory research ', ' high risk ', ' public health relevance ', ' group intervention ', ' policy implication ', ' Healthy People 2020 ', ' screening ', ' race disparity ', ' disparities in race ', ' racial disparity ', ' socioeconomic disparity ', ' socioeconomically underprivileged ', ' Socioeconomically disadvantaged ', ' socioeconomic disadvantage ', ' built environment ', ' greenspace ', ' Green space ', ' activity tracker ', ' activity monitor ', ' accelerometry ', ' Accelerometer ', ' neighborhood disadvantage ', ' morbidity disparities ', ' disparities in morbidity ', ' sleep quality ', ' sleep health ', ' ']",NHLBI,RAND CORPORATION,R01,2018,794606,0.14098618614639608
"Neighborhood Socioeconomic Disadvantage and Medicare's 30-Day Rehospitalization Policy: Eliminating Rehospitalization Disparities by Informing Policy Design and Implementation ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Thirty-day re-hospitalizations disproportionately impact African American patients and those from socioeconomically disadvantaged neighborhoods. Hospitals that primarily serve disadvantaged populations bear a disproportionate burden of Medicare's hospital-based financial re-hospitalization penalties (mandated by S. 3025, Affordable Care Act). As these penalties continue to increase in coming years, penalized hospitals have stated that they will need to cut services to maintain financial solvency, which may further worsen disparities. This may be a potential unintended negative consequence of Medicare's policy decision to not adjust for socioeconomic factors in the re-hospitalization metrics to which the penalties are tied. At this decision's core is a debate on whether observed disparities result from confounding by cluster (i.e., disadvantaged populations primarily receiving care from 'bad' hospitals) or whether socioeconomic disadvantage outside the hospital has a greater influence on re-hospitalization than is currently recognized by Medicare. A statistical decomposition of the within- and between- hospital effects is needed to help disentangle whether the hospital or non-hospital socioeconomics play the greater role in re-hospitalization, but until recently few national-scale indictors of disadvantage were available for this purpose. (Individual-level indicators of disadvantage are neither widely available nor reliabl enough for either resolving this debate or for use in metric adjustment.) The Area Deprivation Index (ADI) is a validated measure of US disadvantage, based upon similar measures employed abroad for health policy development. The ADI uses US Census poverty, education, and housing and employment indicators to characterize regions, such as neighborhoods. Recently, we demonstrated that living in a severely disadvantaged US neighborhood (per a year 2000 Census-based ADI) predicts re-hospitalization as powerfully as the presence of illnesses, such as chronic pulmonary disease. However, to answer the critical policy debate above and to understand if the ADI is suitable for use as a metric adjuster, the ADI must be updated to the 2010 Census, its geographic stability (i.e., how the distribution of disadvantaged US neighborhoods has changed since 2000) and association consistency (i.e., whether the association of neighborhood disadvantage and re-hospitalization remains in 2010) determined, within- and between-hospital effects assessed (i.e., informing the hospital vs. neighborhood socioeconomics debate), and resilient hospitals (i.e., hospitals which primarily serve highly disadvantaged neighborhoods yet have lower than expected re-hospitalization rates) studied in comparison to less-resilient/non-resilient hospitals, especially in terms of patient, caregiver and clinician perspectives on the underlying reasons for this resilience. The potential policy impact o metric adjustment must also be understood. We propose to accomplish all of these steps, with an overarching goal of eliminating re-hospitalization disparities by informing policy and practice. This proposed project has the potential to immediately change re-hospitalization policy and inform metric revision. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Thirty-day re-hospitalizations disproportionately impact African American patients and those from socioeconomically disadvantaged neighborhoods; hospitals that primarily serve disadvantaged populations bear a disproportionate burden of the financial re-hospitalization penalties mandated by Section 3025 of the Affordable Care Act.

"Sustainable Solutions to Metal Air Pollution in Disadvantaged Neighborhoods DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project uses a community-based participatory approach to 1) Conduct formative research; 2) Develop an intervention; and 3) Evaluate intervention effects regarding possible health related exposures from metal recycling. Metal recycling is a robust, growing industry in the nation. The benefits of metal recycling over the use of raw materials include energy savings, the conservation of resources, the generation of jobs and the positive impact on trade of significant U.S. exports world-wide. The metal recycling industry in the U.S. generated over $64 billion in 2010. Metal recycling is a growing industry in Houston as well, with over 170 metal recycling facilities in operation. Because of no zoning, many of these sites operate ""next-door"" to neighborhoods that are predominantly poor and communities of color. During the last five years, the City of Houston Department of Health and Human Services (HDHHS) received nearly 200 air quality complaints from residents across the city about recycling activities, with the predominant concern being smoke and dust. To the extent that resources were available, the HDHHS Bureau of Pollution Control and Prevention conducted limited ambient air monitoring at 25 recycling facilities. Our preliminary results suggested possible environmental health risks, but there are insufficient data to draw definitive conclusions about the health risks of emissions from these facilities. A partnership arose among the HDHHS, the University of Texas School of Public Health, Rice University and Air Alliance Houston to work together with neighborhood residents and metal recyclers to address this potentially serious environmental health issue. Also, the HDHHS has been working since January 2013 with the metal recyclers' task force consisting of the Recycling Council of Texas and Gulf Coast and National Institute of Scrap Recycling Industries, Inc. (ISRI), and in response one metal recycler voluntarily upgraded their facility resulting in reduced aerosol emissions. We propose to conduct extensive air monitoring of metals in particulate matter in affected neighborhoods that will, in turn, inform a risk assessment associated with air emissions from metal recyclers in the community. Based on the risk assessment findings and additional community input, we will use a systematic health promotion planning method to implement and evaluate a multilevel, evidence and behavioral science theory-based public health action plan. The public health action plan will include recommendations for best practices for adoption by metal recyclers and targeted educational campaigns for neighborhood residents, metal recyclers and policy makers and we will re-evaluate emissions and risks following implementation of the plan. Affected neighborhood residents and metal recyclers have a critical role to play in this project to insure that we represent the full range of community concerns in designing and conducting the study, interpreting and disseminating study results and developing and evaluating a public health action plan. The ultimate goal of the project is to improve the health of Houston's communities that border metal recycling facilities. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Owing to nearly 200 air quality complaints from residents whose neighborhoods border metal recycling activities (many of which are predominantly poor and largely Hispanic or African- American), the City of Houston Department of Health and Human Services (HDHHS) conducted limited ambient air monitoring with results that are suggestive of possible environmental health risks. In light of these findings and heightened community concerns due to recent media exposure, the HDHHS partnered with the University of Texas School of Public Health, Rice University and Air Alliance Houston to conduct extensive air monitoring in affected neighborhoods that will, in turn, inform a risk assessment associated with air emissions from metal recyclers in the community. Based on our risk assessment findings and with additional community input from two key stakeholder groups (metal recyclers and neighborhood residents), we further propose to implement and evaluate a multi-level public health action plan that will improve the overall health of Houston's communities that border metal recycling facilities.",Sustainable Solutions to Metal Air Pollution in Disadvantaged Neighborhoods,9476992,R01ES023563,"['Adoption ', ' Aerosols ', ' Affect ', ' Air ', ' Air Pollution ', ' Awareness ', ' Behavioral Sciences ', ' Cities ', ' Color ', ' Communities ', ' Dust ', ' Environmental Health ', ' Environmental Health Science ', ' Environmental Pollution ', ' environmental contamination ', ' environmental contaminant ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health Promotion ', ' promoting health ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' Hispanic Americans ', ' Spanish Americans ', ' Industrialization ', ' Industry ', ' Institutes ', ' Interview ', ' Leadership ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Metals ', ' Methods ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Newspapers ', ' Occupations ', ' Professional Positions ', ' Jobs ', ' Plants ', ' Play ', ' Public Health ', ' Questionnaires ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Rice ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Savings ', ' Public Health Schools ', ' Smoke ', ' Suggestion ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Texas ', ' Training Programs ', ' Translating ', ' United States Dept. of Health and Human Services ', ' United States Department of Health and Human Services ', ' Department of Health and Human Services ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Generations ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Businesses ', ' Risk Assessment ', ' advisory team ', ' Task Forces ', ' Advisory Committees ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Series ', ' Link ', ' Chemicals ', ' Evaluation ', ' Policy Maker ', ' Workshop ', ' Educational workshop ', ' Fostering ', ' Measurement ', ' Recycling ', ' Exposure to ', ' air contaminant ', ' Knowledge ', ' Pollution ', ' Source ', ' Location ', ' Training and Education ', ' Education and Training ', ' experience ', ' particle ', ' pollutant ', ' Toxic effect ', ' Toxicities ', ' economic impact ', ' NIH Program Announcements ', ' Program Announcement ', ' Prevention ', ' carcinogenicity ', ' response ', ' theories ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' air monitoring ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Caliber ', ' Diameter ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Monitor ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' informant ', ' Particulate Matter ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' toxic metal ', ' exposure to metal ', ' Metal exposure ', ' gulf coast ', ' public health relevance ', ' intervention effect ', ' industry partnership ', ' industrial partnership ', ' industry partner ', ' longitudinal design ', ' operation ', ' screening ', ' metallicity ', ' neighborhood disadvantage ', ' disadvantaged population ', ' fine particulate matter ', ' PM2.5 ', ' fine particles ', ' coarse particulate matter ', ' PM10 ', ' coarse particles ', ' Inhaling ', ' Inhalation ', ' ']",NIEHS,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS HLTH SCI CTR HOUSTON,R01,2018,481189,0.101031348522972
"Promoting small business support of youth physical activity in low-income, minority neighborhoods Project Summary/Abstract An unacceptably high percentage of our nation’s low-income, minority youth (< 18 years of age) are not regularly physically active. This contributes to extreme health disparities such as obesity rates nearly two-fold higher than those seen in white youth and greater risk for diabetes and related cardiometabolic disorders. The presence of quality youth physical activity opportunities (YPAO) enables and encourages physically active lifestyles. Unfortunately, quality YPAOs often are lacking in places where minority youth live, resulting in low activity levels and subsequent health issues that represent significant disparities in our society. Our previous research found that small businesses (< 500 employees), which represent over 99% of all employers, are powerful resources for creating and improving YPAOs. In accordance with the Socioecological Model and established philanthropic principles, we developed an alpha version of an intervention (alpha-i) for increasing small businesses’ involvement with YPAOs. We are now poised to create a beta version (beta-i) and conduct a pilot study of its impact on small business support for YPAOs and YPAO utilization by youth in low-income, minority neighborhoods. To meet this objective, we will complete the following specific aims. Aim 1: Refine alpha-i components by completing focus groups with small business owners, YPAO providers, and parents/guardians of youth from low-income, predominantly minority neighborhoods. Results of the qualitative analysis will inform final tailoring of the intervention to create the beta-i which will be tested in Aim 2. Aim 2: Determine the effect of the beta-i on small business support for YPAOs in low-income, minority neighborhoods by conducting a plot cluster randomized-control trial with randomization at the neighborhood level. Intervention neighborhoods (n=10) will receive the beta-i while control neighborhoods (n=10) will be provided a standard practice intervention for a period of one year. The primary outcome for aim 2 will be the percentage of small businesses not supporting YPAOs at baseline that subsequently provide support for YPAOs at follow-up. We also will consider the U.S. dollar equivalent of all types of support (monetary, goods/services and time) donated for YPAOs by small businesses. Aim 3: Examine the impact of the increased small business support for YPAOs on YPAO utilization by youth. The primary outcome will be the percent change in the number of youth participating in YPAOs from baseline and follow-up in the treatment and control neighborhoods. The proposed study is significant because it will provide evidence that an easily replicated approach can be used to increase small business support for YPAOs and that this support results in greater use of the YPAOs by youth. Our next step will be to determine if YPAO changes resulting from increased small business support positively influence youth physical activity levels as measured by accelerometry. Our long-term goals are to create a nationally implementable practice for increasing support for YPAOs and strengthen the science of addressing health disparities in socially disadvantaged populations. Project Narrative Small businesses represent a substantial potential source of support for youth physical activity opportunities and in the proposed study, we will examine a mechanism we developed for increasing their support. Findings from this study have the potential to generate a major shift in public health policy by providing a strong evidence base that small businesses can be encouraged to play a major role in enhancing environmental conditions that have the potential to positively impact healthy lifestyles and chronic disease risks across the age spectrum.","Promoting small business support of youth physical activity in low-income, minority neighborhoods",9528906,R21NR017267,"['Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Back ', ' Dorsum ', ' Behavior ', ' Budgets ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Communities ', ' Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' type two diabetes ', ' type II DM ', ' type 2 DM ', ' maturity onset diabetes ', ' ketosis resistant diabetes ', ' adult onset diabetes ', ' Type II diabetes ', ' Type II Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Type 2 diabetes ', ' Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus ', ' T2DM ', ' T2D ', ' T2 DM ', ' Stable Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Slow-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Noninsulin Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Non-Insulin Dependent Diabetes ', ' NIDDM ', ' Maturity-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' MODY ', ' Ketosis-Resistant Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Adult-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Environment ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health Policy ', ' healthcare policy ', ' health care policy ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Marketing ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Obesity ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Morbid Obesity ', ' extreme obesity ', ' Severe obesity ', ' Parents ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Play ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Science ', ' Societies ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Businesses ', ' Youth ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' improved ', ' Physical activity ', ' Funding ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Exposure to ', ' Prediabetes syndrome ', ' syndrome x ', ' prediabetic ', ' pre-diabetic ', ' pre-diabetes ', ' Prediabetic State ', ' Prediabetes ', ' programs ', ' Event ', ' Source ', ' Overweight ', ' Over weight ', ' Physical environment ', ' Services ', ' Employee ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' disorder risk ', ' disease risk ', ' social ', ' Modeling ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Provider ', ' diabetes risk ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Low income ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' exploratory developmental study ', ' R21 Program ', ' R21 Mechanism ', ' Exploratory/Developmental Grant ', ' Characteristics ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' Advanced Development ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' eighteen years of age ', ' eighteen year old ', ' age 18 years ', ' 18 years of age ', ' 18 year old ', ' nineteen years old ', ' nineteen year old ', ' age 19 years ', ' 19 years of age ', ' 19 year old ', ' parental involvement ', ' control trial ', ' evidence base ', ' primary outcome ', ' public health priorities ', ' Healthy People 2020 ', ' healthy lifestyle ', ' activity tracker ', ' activity monitor ', ' accelerometry ', ' Accelerometer ', ' disadvantaged population ', ' active living ', ' active life style ', ' active lifestyle ', ' cardiometabolic ', ' cardiometabolism ', ' ']",NINR,UNIVERSITY OF DELAWARE,R21,2018,232214,0.058451225365856174

"Cognitive Resilience and Community Context: Examining the role of Neighborhood Built and Social Environments for Slowing the Progression of Dementia among older Americans PROJECT SUMMARY Previous research has identified multiple biological, genetic, and behavioral factors that are associated with cognitive impairment and decline. Recently, a parallel literature has looked beyond individual-level factors to consider the role of the social and built environment. Findings suggest that residence in socioeconomically advantaged neighborhoods may promote cognitive function and/or buffer cognitive decline in part through their greater density of physical resources (recreational centers, gyms, parks, walking paths, healthy food stores) as well as social and institutional resources (libraries, bookstores, community centers, social clubs) that promote physical activity and facilitate mental stimulation (e.g. social interaction) that may buffer cognitive decline with age. However, these relationships have not been empirically tested with national population-based data. This study will examine the moderating role of neighborhood built and social environments on trajectories of cognitive function in a national, racially-diverse sample of Americans followed since 2003. We will identify how features of the social and built environment are related to rates of decline in cognitive function among participants in the Reasons for Geographic and Racial Differences in Stroke (REGARDS) study. REGARDS is a national longitudinal cohort study of over 30,0000 black and white individuals age 45+ ongoing since 2003. In addition to being a longitudinal study collecting prospective data on cognitive function at annual intervals, the study also tracks residential locations through geographic coordinates that will be linked to secondary sources to characterize the surrounding social and built environment. The aims of this 4-year project are to i) characterize the built and social environment for respondents in the REGARDS study with respect to the physical and social resources that could mitigate cognitive decline; ii) use longitudinal data to examine the relationship between neighborhood resources and rates of cognitive decline over time; and iii) determine the extent to which built and social environments explain racial disparities in cognitive function. By augmenting this existing NIH-funded longitudinal cohort study with neighborhood characteristics, this study will provide a critical opportunity to examine the role of neighborhood built and social environments for preventing cognitive decline in Americans as they age. PROJECT NARRATIVE This study will examine the moderating role of neighborhood built and social environments on trajectories of cognitive function in a national sample of American adults followed since 2003. We will identify how features of the social and built environment are related to rates of decline in cognitive function among participants in the Reasons for Geographic and Racial Differences in Stroke (REGARDS) study.

"Sensitive Periods: Prospective Associations of Childhood and Adulthood Neighborhoods with Life Course Obesity and Blood Presure Trajectories PROJECT SUMMARY Compelling evidence has arisen on the role of neighborhood deprivation and childhood psychosocial adversity in cardiovascular health. Investigations into neighborhood health effects have identified two broad domains of neighborhood attributes that may be relevant to health: neighborhood physical environment and neighborhood social environment. Furthermore, early childhood is a critical stage in the life course during which inputs received can set health-related behaviors that may have long lasting impacts. Most of the current research has only investigated cross-sectional associations between neighborhood deprivation and cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors, which does not test the temporal assumption of causality. The proposed research will fill gaps in the literature using data from the New England Family Study (NEFS), a longitudinal investigation of risk factors for adult medical issues that may have early childhood developmental origins. Participants were followed since birth until adulthood in Providence, RI and Boston, MA, two of the most densely inhabited metropolitan areas in the Northeastern United States. Participants’ lifetime residential history will be geocoded and linked to neighborhood factors across the life course. The resulting dataset will allow the research team to examine two aspects of neighborhood deprivation: neighborhood socioeconomic status (NSES), and accessibility to green space, using multilevel models. Outcomes will include two major CVD risk factors across the life course: high blood pressure (HBP) and body mass index (BMI). The proposed study will address three aims to evaluate: 1) Longitudinal associations of NSES with HBP and BMI; 2) Longitudinal associations of neighborhood accessibility to green space with HBP and BMI; and 3) The extent to which childhood adversity modifies the longitudinal association of neighborhood deprivation with HBP and BMI. We hypothesize that participants experiencing childhood adversity in households in deprived neighborhoods are a high-risk subset of the population that should be prioritized. In addition, this study will make available neighborhood data to pursue spatial questions at a level of detail and with methodologies not previously accessible in the NEFS; and not available in most longitudinal observational studies. Results from this longitudinal study may provide new evidence that during critical periods of susceptibility in life, greater access to neighborhood green space and higher NSES may slow the development of CVD in middle- aged adults. The  PROJECT NARRATIVE This project will apply multilevel and spatial analytic methods to provide comprehensive answers about cumulative disadvantage resulting from neighborhood deprivation and childhood adversity on blood pressure and obesity, two major CVD risk factors posing substantial public health burdens. This study will be the first to longitudinally address fundamental questions regarding critical stages in the life course that can have severe life-long consequences on CVD risk. Analyses of this kind will provide insight into individual and community actions that can meaningfully improve public health and reduce environmental health disparities.",Sensitive Periods: Prospective Associations of Childhood and Adulthood Neighborhoods with Life Course Obesity and Blood Presure Trajectories,9393233,F31HL134300,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Atherosclerosis ', ' atherosclerotic vascular disease ', ' atherosclerotic disease ', ' atheromatosis ', ' Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease ', ' Atheroscleroses ', ' Behavior ', ' Birth ', ' Parturition ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Blood Pressure ', ' Boston ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Community Actions ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Environmental Health ', ' Environmental Health Science ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health Policy ', ' healthcare policy ', ' health care policy ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Household ', ' Housing ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Hypertension ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' high blood pressure ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Life Cycle Stages ', ' life course ', ' Life Cycle ', ' Literature ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' Long-Term Effects ', ' Longterm Effects ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' middle age ', ' midlife ', ' middle aged ', ' mid-life ', ' mid life ', ' Persons ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' New England ', ' Northeastern United States ', ' Obesity ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Social Environment ', ' socioenvironment ', ' social context ', ' social climate ', ' Stress ', ' Measures ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' analytical method ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Family Study ', ' Area ', ' Medical ', ' Link ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Predisposition ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Life ', ' Investigation ', ' psychosocial ', ' Physical environment ', ' experience ', ' early childhood ', ' metropolitan ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' social ', ' multilevel analysis ', ' multilevel modeling ', ' multilevel model ', ' methods to study multiple-level influences ', ' deprivation ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' vulnerable group ', ' cardiovascular disorder risk ', ' cardiovascular disease risk ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Body mass index ', ' Quetelet index ', ' BMI z-score ', ' BMI percentile ', ' Etiology ', ' disease causation ', ' causation ', ' Causality ', ' low socioeconomic status ', ' low socioeconomic position ', ' low socio-economic status ', ' low socio-economic position ', ' low SES ', ' training project ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Research Training ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Pathologic ', ' Characteristics ', ' Modification ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' years of life lost to disease ', ' years of life lost to disability ', ' disease burden ', ' burden of disease ', ' burden of illness ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' prospective ', ' life style intervention ', ' lifestyle intervention ', ' high risk ', ' critical period ', ' neighborhood association ', ' Evaluative Thinking ', ' Complex thinking ', ' Critical Thinking ', ' cardiovascular health ', ' greenspace ', ' Green space ', ' Longterm cohort ', ' Long-term cohort ', ' Longitudinal cohort ', ' Longitudinal observation study ', ' Longitudinal observational study ', ' ']",NHLBI,BROWN UNIVERSITY,F31,2018,12235,0.1114039490436323
"Natural Experiment of Neighborhood Revitalization and Cardiometabolic Health ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Individuals living in socioeconomically disadvantaged neighborhoods have disproportionately high rates of obesity and related morbidity, including increased risk for diabetes and cardiovascular diseases (CVD). Although previous research has made significant contributions to our understanding of the health consequences associated with neighborhood disadvantage, causal relationships have been difficult to establish due to a reliance on cross-sectional designs, selection biases and limited data on potential mechanisms. Building on the existing research infrastructure developed by our team's previously funded, ongoing natural experiment studies, we have a unique opportunity to study whether changes to the built and social environment, stimulated by substantial ($160 million) economic investment in housing development and neighborhood revitalization, improves cardio-metabolic outcomes in the ""intervention"" neighborhood relative to the matched ""control"" neighborhood which is not undergoing such changes. The study includes a randomly selected cohort of 732 low-income, African American adults, from two urban neighborhoods (intervention and control communities). Our study will be the first natural experiment to examine the impact of a place-based natural experiment strategy (rather than residential mobility strategy) on clinically relevant cardio-metabolic outcomes (BMI, HbA1c, blood pressure, and lipids) in a high-risk, though understudied, African American population. We will leverage existing data from our previously funded studies on potential mediators, including measures of the built and social environment, and health behaviors including diet, physical activity and sleep (objective and subjective measures). In this proposal, we will add measured cardio-metabolic outcomes, including blood pressure, HbA1c, and lipids. The next stage of economic revitalization of the intervention neighborhood is focused on redevelopment of housing. Thus, in addition, the proposed study is optimally timed to add survey measures of perceptions of housing conditions, neighborhood-level audits of housing conditions, and compilation of secondary data from publically available resources on housing sales, vacancy rates, etc.,             before and after the housing changes occur. Understanding the impact and pattern of neighborhood revitalization as it unfolds over time is critical in the arsenal of policies to mitigte pervasive racial/ ethnic and socioeconomic disparities in obesity and cardio-metabolic health. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Individuals living in socioeconomically disadvantaged neighborhoods have significantly higher rates of obesity and obesity-related health problems, including cardiovascular diseases (CVD) and diabetes. Our study is the first of its kind to evaluate whether improvements in neighborhood conditions, spurred by substantial neighborhood-level revitalization in a predominantly African American (AA) neighborhood improves residents' cardio-metabolic risk factors (obesity, glycated hemoglobin, cholesterol, and, blood pressure) relative to a comparison neighborhood that is not undergoing such changes. Prior studies of similar redevelopment initiatives lack the comparative research design, and none, to our knowledge, have measured cardio-metabolic risk factors in a high-risk, yet understudied African American resident base. Findings from this longitudinal study would provide critical evidence concerning the causal impact of a major policy initiative to redevelop high-poverty neighborhoods on the cardiovascular health of the community.",Natural Experiment of Neighborhood Revitalization and Cardiometabolic Health,9462844,R01HL131531,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Affect ', ' Blood Pressure ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cholesterol ', ' Cities ', ' Communities ', ' Control Groups ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Diet ', ' dietary ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Economics ', ' Environment ', ' Esthetics ', ' Experimental Designs ', ' Glycosylated Hemoglobin ', ' Glycated Hemoglobins ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' Health Status ', ' Level of Health ', ' Glycosylated hemoglobin A ', ' hemoglobin A1c ', ' Hemoglobin A(1) ', ' HbA1c ', ' HbA1 ', ' Hb A1c ', ' Hb A1a+b ', ' Hb A1 ', ' Glycohemoglobin A ', ' Housing ', ' Investments ', ' Lipids ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Obesity ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Perception ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' wellbeing ', ' well-being ', ' Poverty ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Research Design ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Residential Mobility ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Safety ', ' Sales ', ' Selection Bias ', ' Sleep ', ' Social Conditions ', ' Societal Conditions ', ' Social Environment ', ' socioenvironment ', ' social context ', ' social climate ', ' Stress ', ' Stroke ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' brain attack ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Apoplexy ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Businesses ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Physical activity ', ' Distress ', ' Individual ', ' Policies ', ' Multidisciplinary Research ', ' Multidisciplinary Collaboration ', ' Interdisciplinary Research ', ' Interdisciplinary Study ', ' Funding ', ' Exposure to ', ' Shapes ', ' Pattern ', ' Physical environment ', ' Supermarket ', ' Services ', ' experience ', ' cohesion ', ' cohort ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Self-Report ', ' disorder risk ', ' disease risk ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' social ', ' Sampling ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' cardiovascular disorder risk ', ' cardiovascular disease risk ', ' diabetes risk ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Low income ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Data ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Infrastructure ', ' lifestyle factors ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' Community Health ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socio-economically ', ' socio-economic ', ' socioeconomics ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' years of life lost to disease ', ' years of life lost to disability ', ' disease burden ', ' burden of disease ', ' burden of illness ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' cost efficient ', ' Population ', ' Natural experiment ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' clinical relevance ', ' clinically relevant ', ' comparative ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' high risk ', ' public health relevance ', ' secondary outcome ', ' population health ', ' longitudinal design ', ' socioeconomic disparity ', ' socioeconomically underprivileged ', ' Socioeconomically disadvantaged ', ' socioeconomic disadvantage ', ' cardiovascular health ', ' cardiometabolic risk ', ' built environment ', ' greenspace ', ' Green space ', ' walkable ', ' walkability ', ' neighborhood disadvantage ', ' disadvantaged population ', ' cardiometabolic ', ' cardiometabolism ', ' ']",NHLBI,RAND CORPORATION,R01,2018,707612,0.17657681073724985
"Limited English Proficiency, Health, and Healthcare among Older Immigrants DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Limited English proficiency (LEP) is a unique vulnerability of older immigrants that poses a significant risk to health and healthcare. Given tha social and environmental contexts play a critical role in the lives of persons with LEP, this application investigates how social connectedness and neighborhood/community characteristics (e.g., ethnic density, health service environments in the neighborhood) influence the link between LEP and health/healthcare. We used Korean American elders as the target group. Our selection was based on the fact that they are members of a rapidly expanding LEP population (i.e., Korean is ranked 4th in the languages spoken by LEP individuals in the U.S.) and that they manifest marked disparities in health and healthcare. The project aims to explore the direct and interactive roles of social connectedness and neighborhood characteristics (1) in the relation between LEP and health and (2) in the relation between LEP and healthcare. The negative impact of LEP on health/healthcare is expected to be greater when individuals lack social connections and/or when they live in areas lack ethnically oriented resources and services. The project employs an innovative and synergistic mix of Social Network Analysis (SNA) and Geographic Information Systems (GIS). To capture the heterogeneity of the population, we will use 3 sites that combine to represent a continuum of Korean American population density: New York (high), Texas (intermediate) and Florida (low). Following focus groups with Community Advisory Boards, direct assessments of ethnic communities will be conducted. At each site, a master list of ethnically oriented services (including health services) will be generated, and each identified service will be geo-coded. Subsequently, 900 Korean Americans (aged e 65, 300 at each site) will be surveyed using a probability sampling procedure. In addition to the traditional survey measures, name-generator approaches will be used to explore participants' social network members and places for healthcare. Using SNA, information from the name generators (names and addresses of people and places) will be indexed to represent (1) social connectedness and (2) engagement with health services at the community. Using GIS, the survey data will be linked to a file combining the 2010 Census and the area resource map derived from the direct community assessment. The combined file will include variables such as proportions of Koreans in the neighborhood and general as well as ethnically-oriented area health services. Multi-Level Models (MLM) will be used to explore the research questions and hypotheses. The results will not only enhance our understanding of the mechanisms underlying LEP vulnerability but also identify individual- and community-level factors (both in people and places) that could be used in health planning and interventions. The overall approach and findings will inform how to develop effective interventions to reduce language barriers and ensure access to appropriate health services for diverse LEP populations. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The application is in response to the NIA's interests in social, behavioral, cultural, and environmental context in addressing racial/ethnic health disparities, and the outcomes will inform how to effectively address health inequities. Results will enhance interventions directed at the 47 million Americans with linguistic barriers.","Limited English Proficiency, Health, and Healthcare among Older Immigrants",9521842,R01AG047106,"['Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Binding Sites ', ' Reactive Site ', ' Combining Site ', ' Health Service Area ', ' Service area ', ' Health Catchment Area ', ' Censuses ', ' Communities ', ' Elements ', ' Environment ', ' Face ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Florida ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Health ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Health Planning ', ' plan health ', ' Health Services ', ' Health Status ', ' Level of Health ', ' indexing ', ' Language ', ' Linguistics ', ' Linguistic ', ' Maps ', ' Persons ', ' Names ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' New York ', ' Play ', ' Population Density ', ' Probability Samples ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Stress ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Testing ', ' Texas ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' population diversity ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' diverse populations ', ' Social Network ', ' base ', ' density ', ' Procedures ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Link ', ' Ensure ', ' Individual ', ' Immigrant ', ' Koreans ', ' Complex ', ' interest ', ' Services ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' Korean American ', ' Participant ', ' member ', ' social ', ' Code ', ' Coding System ', ' RHOA gene ', ' Rho12 ', ' RHOH12 ', ' RHOA ', ' H12 ', ' ARH12 ', ' multilevel analysis ', ' multilevel modeling ', ' multilevel model ', ' methods to study multiple-level influences ', ' Geographic Information Systems ', ' geospatial information system ', ' Pathway Analysis ', ' Network Analysis ', ' Modeling ', ' behavioral health ', ' response ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Subgroup ', ' Characteristics ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' aged ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' ethnic minority ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' participatory action research ', ' community based research ', ' community based design ', ' community based participatory research ', ' public health relevance ', ' effective intervention ', ' Limited English Proficiency ', ' community partnership ', ' ethnic health disparity ', ' health service utilization ', ' health service use ', ' ']",NIA,"UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS, AUSTIN",R01,2018,81769,0.048588164574924056
"Healthy Life Expectancy Among Older Hispanics:  Individual and Neighborhood Influences Project Summary As life expectancy increases, questions arise about the quality of the additional years of life. Data consistently shows a Hispanic mortality advantage, especially among older adults. However, despite comparatively longer life expectancy, Hispanic elders are also at high risk of disease and disability. Therefore, the first goal of the proposed research is to analyze two NIH-funded datasets to identify changes in healthy life expectancy among very old Mexican-Americans as compared to otherwise similar non- Hispanic whites. Increases in proportion of life spent without disability would be evidence of compression of morbidity, whereas decreases in proportion of life spent without disability would be evidence of expansion of morbidity. Studies show that morbidity and disability trajectories (and hence healthy life expectancy) differs significantly across sub-populations (e.g. immigrants) and are also influenced by the neighborhood context. Therefore, the second aim of this study is to do sub-group analyses. This includes analyses by specific diseases, by demographic and SES groups, and by neighborhood variables. These goals will be accomplished using data on Mexican American elders from the Hispanic Established Populations for the Epidemiologic Study of the Elderly (H-EPESE). Non-Hispanic white elders will be sampled from the Health and Retirement Study (HRS) as the comparison group. Sullivan method will be used to calculate the life expectancy of each cross-sectional cohort, and multi-level modeling will be used to determine the relative influence of individual and neighborhood level characteristics. Results from the data would allow for measurement of population health over time for a growing and vulnerable population of elders. At the same time, results would allow for targeted interventions at both individual as well as neighborhood level variables. Understanding trends in healthy life expectancy is particularly important in a country with an already overburdened health services system5 since interventions that are targeted at particularly vulnerable groups may be more effective than those aimed at the general population34. Public Health Relevance Statements From both an individual and a societal level, living longer lives in good health is desirable. Recent research suggests that healthy life expectancy among very old Mexican Americans (compared to the general older population) may be on the decline. This is a growing and vulnerable population, and information about healthy life expectancy will be essential to guide public health officials as they allocate limited resources.",Healthy Life Expectancy Among Older Hispanics:  Individual and Neighborhood Influences,9487292,R03MD011390,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Birth ', ' Parturition ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' CDC ', ' Data Collection ', ' Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' type two diabetes ', ' type II DM ', ' type 2 DM ', ' maturity onset diabetes ', ' ketosis resistant diabetes ', ' adult onset diabetes ', ' Type II diabetes ', ' Type II Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Type 2 diabetes ', ' Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus ', ' T2DM ', ' T2D ', ' T2 DM ', ' Stable Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Slow-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Noninsulin Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Non-Insulin Dependent Diabetes ', ' NIDDM ', ' Maturity-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' MODY ', ' Ketosis-Resistant Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Adult-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Ethnic group ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Family ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health Services ', ' Immigration ', ' Life Expectancy ', ' Life Tables ', ' Literature ', ' Long-Term Care ', ' longterm care ', ' extended care ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Mexican Americans ', ' Chicanos ', ' Chicanas ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Obesity ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Public Health ', ' Publishing ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Societies ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', ' Hispanics ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Uninsured ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Chronic ', ' disability ', ' Individual ', ' Measurement ', ' Funding ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Immigrant ', ' Life ', ' Country ', ' American ', ' cohort ', ' disorder risk ', ' disease risk ', ' epidemiology study ', ' epidemiologic investigation ', ' Epidemiology Research ', ' Epidemiological Studies ', ' Epidemiologic Studies ', ' Epidemiologic Research ', ' multilevel analysis ', ' multilevel modeling ', ' multilevel model ', ' methods to study multiple-level influences ', ' Sampling ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' vulnerable group ', ' low socioeconomic status ', ' low socioeconomic position ', ' low socio-economic status ', ' low socio-economic position ', ' low SES ', ' Data ', ' Subgroup ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' Older Population ', ' trend ', ' Characteristics ', ' comparison group ', ' years of life lost to disease ', ' years of life lost to disability ', ' disease burden ', ' burden of disease ', ' burden of illness ', ' Minority ', ' Population ', ' aged ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' disability burden ', ' comparative ', ' loss of function ', ' high risk ', ' public health relevance ', ' population health ', ' race disparity ', ' disparities in race ', ' racial disparity ', ' built environment ', ' Health and Retirement Study ', ' ']",NIMHD,UNIVERSITY OF GEORGIA,R03,2018,75000,0.03650970051515711
"Impact of the Built Environment on Child Body Mass Index Project Summary The last several years have witnessed growing interest in the potential contribution of the “built environment” to the epidemic increase in obesity rates in the United States. This includes both the large structural aspects of the neighborhood and physical characteristics of homes and schools at the very micro level (the interiors and associated grounds of these buildings). The structural aspects of the neighborhood that surround the home and school includes urban design features such as streets and highways, land use mix, street connectivity, public transportation infrastructure (i.e., subway stations), park land, and recreational infrastructure, all of which could affect both physical activity and the accessibility of food and other resources. The physical characteristics of the home or school—including building size, the presence of elevators, stairs, spaces for physical activity, and related factors—could determine opportunities for physical activity and amount of activity needed to navigate the space. Thus far not established is how each of these factors contributes to childhood BMI in a distinct and interconnected way and/or how changes in such factors could influence obesity rates in a causal manner. This gap in knowledge is particularly troubling given the high cost of changing the built environment as well as the longevity of investments once made. Our research promises to provide insight critical to policymakers planning urban infrastructure investment. Particularly important to consider are disparities, and whether differences in the built environment could explain differences in obesity rates in key demographic groups, including income and race/ethnicity. We propose to combine New York City Department of Education FITNESSGRAM data, which includes BMI, school and residential locations, for all New York City public school children from 2005 onward, with detailed data on the built environment surrounding each child’s home and school as well as within their home and school. Then, we will use a variety of enhanced methodological techniques to estimate a less-biased, more causal relationship between the built environment and obesity. The methodological enhancements we utilize over past work are:  • A large, detailed dataset, including data on over 1 million NYC public school children.  • Examining longitudinally the same children over time, using both child, school and census tract level  fixed effects, among other methods, to determine casualty.  • Examining fine-grained differences in the built environment. For example, the relative influence of  living within 500 feet of a park or other built environment resources  • Data on both the home and school built environment, both inside the building and in the  neighborhood, modeled together. With these enhancements, we will be able to provide improved estimates on the influence of the built environment on child BMI, substantially answering key health and policy-related questions.

"The Effects of Education on Mortality: Evidence from a Large Representative  Sample of American Twins PROJECT SUMMARY Does education change people’s lives in a way that delays mortality? Or is education merely a proxy for unobserved endowments that promote longevity? Most scholars conclude that the former is true, but new evidence by Behrman et al.—who compare the mortality outcomes of Danish twins who differ on educational attainment—calls this conclusion into question. Unfortunately, Behrman et al.’s potentially field-changing finding—that obtaining additional schooling has no independent effect on survival net of other hard-to-observe characteristics—has not yet been subject to replication in the United States or other non-Scandinavian countries. Nor is there a strong scholarly consensus regarding the use of twin data to identify the causal effect of education on mortality in the general population. To address these and other concerns, we will produce the first U.S.-based estimates of the effects of education on mortality (and any variation in those effects that exists across sub-groups and/or birth cohorts), using a large and representative panel of twins drawn from linked complete-count Census records. For comparison purposes, and to shed additional light on the specific roles that neighborhood, family, and genetic factors play in confounding associations between education and mortality, we will also produce parallel estimates of the education-mortality relationship using data on (1) non-twin pairs who lived in different neighborhoods during childhood; (2) non-twin pairs who shared the same neighborhood growing up; and (3) non-twin siblings who shared the same family environment but whose genetic endowments vary to a greater degree. Findings from this research will have major implications for our understanding of educational gradients in mortality and should provide a useful foundation for future work examining the etiology of human survival. NARRATIVE Understanding and reducing socioeconomic disparities in health and mortality has long been a high priority on America’s research and public health agenda. Educational gradients in mortality are well documented, but recent twin-based research outside of the U.S. raises important questions about whether education can be effectively used as a policy lever to reduce inequalities in longevity. Our research will transform our assessment of the causal effect of education on mortality and of how that effect varies across population subgroups.",The Effects of Education on Mortality: Evidence from a Large Representative  Sample of American Twins,9529486,R21AG054824,"['Affect ', ' Americas ', ' Birth ', ' Parturition ', ' Censuses ', ' Death Records ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Endowment ', ' Environment ', ' Family ', ' Feasibility Studies ', ' Female ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Hand ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Infant ', ' Investments ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Longevity ', ' lifespan ', ' life span ', ' Length of Life ', ' male ', ' Methodology ', ' mortality ', ' Names ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Play ', ' Public Health ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Records ', ' Research ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Schools ', ' Siblings ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Twin Multiple Birth ', ' Twins ', ' United States ', ' Weight ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Longitudinal Surveys ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' Procedures ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Link ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' Individual ', ' young adulthood ', ' adult youth ', ' young adult ', ' Policies ', ' Inequality ', ' Funding ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Genetic ', ' Consensus ', ' American ', ' cohort ', ' family genetics ', ' Proxy ', ' General Population ', ' General Public ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' boys ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Etiology ', ' disease causation ', ' causation ', ' Causality ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Subgroup ', ' Characteristics ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socio-economically ', ' socio-economic ', ' socioeconomics ', ' cost ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' prospective ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' socioeconomic disparity ', ' longitudinal data set ', ' longitudinal dataset ', ' data resource ', ' ']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA,R21,2018,186773,0.06443548004002916
"Health Evaluation of the Neighborhoods Law Phase 2 (HENL2) Urban renewal (also referred to as regeneration or revitalization) go beyond the repair of physical and aesthetic components of the built environment to also address some of the social problems and improve human habitat while promoting sustainability. However, urban renewal programs tend to exclude health considerations and have even been accused of worsening social and physical environments by contributing to social exclusion or gentrification and promoting a greater dependence on cars, all associated with poor health conditions. Few urban renewal programs actively target health and promote health equity and while research in this area is emerging, barriers in data collection and analysis have made it difficult to study some of the long-term effects of these programs on health. The overarching goal of the Health Evaluation of the Neighborhoods Law Phase 2 (HENL2) study is: to examine the long-term effects of the Neighborhoods Law, an urban renewal program in Barcelona, Spain, on the health and health inequities of residents; compare these outcomes to previous short-term effects; and translate research findings into intervention and policy recommendations to reduce health inequities. The Neighborhoods Law (NL), one of the largest urban renewal programs in Europe, was implemented in 2004. From 2004 to 2011, 15 of 73 neighborhoods participated resulting in approximately 10% of the 1.6 million population being affected by the projects. The proposed study will use repeated cross-sectional data from the Barcelona Health Survey to examine the effects of the NL on health and health inequalities of residents living in areas intervened and those in non-intervened comparison neighborhoods. Findings from these studies will contribute to the limited evidence available on long-term effects of urban renewal programs that would help highlight the importance of public health considerations in the planning, implementation and evaluation of such programs. Furthermore, Barcelona is of special interest to cities like New York and Chicago for its `transformative remaking' of streets and is at the forefront of urban changes that are then modeled both in the United States (US) and globally. Therefore, an understanding of the impact of some of these programs on the health and wellbeing of residents is an important component of successful implementation in US cities. The proposed project will examine the long-term effects of the Neighborhoods Law, an urban renewal program in Barcelona, Spain, on the health and health inequalities of residents.

"Impact of Park Renovations on Physical Activity and Community Health in NYC ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The built environment plays a critical role in promoting physical activity and health. The association between parks, as a key attribute of the built environment, and physical activity, however, remains inconclusive. This project employs a natural experiment design to assess the impact of the Community Parks Initiative (CPI), a New York City Department of Parks and Recreation (NYC Parks) park redesign and renovation initiative, on physical activity, park usage, psychosocial and mental health, and community wellbeing. The project will use a longitudinal design with matched controls. NYC Parks has identified 134 parks with extreme capital needs in high-priority neighborhoods and will begin renovating parks in waves. In late 2016, the first wave of 35 parks across 55 neighborhoods will close for renovations; these parks will reopen in late 2017. From this initial wave, 20 interventio parks have been selected for inclusion in this study. Intervention park neighborhoods have been matched to a control group of 20 socio-economically similar park neighborhoods that will not be renovated during the study. The study will address two aims. In Aim 1, investigators will compare total volume of PA and other health outcomes among residents in the intervention vs. control park neighborhoods (defined as .25 mile radius around each park) from baseline to 2.5 years post-renovation. We hypothesize that improvements will be observed in PA and health levels in intervention but not control neighborhoods. In Aim 2, an additional 10 park neighborhoods receiving renovation in 2018 and reopening in 2019 will be used to monitor replicability of intervention effects at 1.5 years post-renovation. This combined design enhances our ability to infer causality in a natural experiment. We aim to recruit and retain 40 study participants per park neighborhood, after attrition, for a total of 1600 participants in Aim 1 and 400 in Aim 2. Study participants will represent two distinct sociodemographic strata in each neighborhood: low-income housing and community- engaged residents. Measures include direct park observations and program checklists, park quality, self- reported and GPS-tracked park usage, accelerometry-based physical activity, self-reported psychosocial health, and perceived community wellbeing. The largest natural experiment of its kind to date, this study represents a rare opportunity to provide robust evidence to further our understanding of the complex relationship between parks and physical activity, psychosocial and mental health, and community wellbeing. The findings will inform future investments in health-oriented urban design policies and offer evidence for addressing health disparities through built environment strategies. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    The project will evaluate the long-term effects of a citywide public park redesign and renovation initiative on residents' physical activity, psychosocial and mental health, and community wellbeing.

"A Social Epigenomic Approach to Health Disparities in Cardiovascular Risk Factors A SOCIAL EPIGENOMIC APPROACH TO HEALTH DISPARITIES IN CARDIOVASCULAR RISK FACTORS Individual-level socioeconomic factors such as education, income/wealth, and occupation have long been known to profoundly affect risk for cardiovascular diseases, and these effects accumulate across the life course to create systematic disadvantage that manifests in a wide range of health disparities. In addition, there is now increasing evidence that neighborhood-level disadvantage also negatively impacts cardiovascular health, both cross-sectionally and longitudinally, even after accounting for individual-level socioeconomic factors. One mechanism by which individual-level and neighborhood-level disadvantage may influence cardiovascular health is through epigenomic modifications of genes regulating adaptive cellular pathways (e.g. inflammation and immune response). To better understand the biological mechanisms underlying health disparities in cardiovascular disease, we propose to investigate the impact of individual and neighborhood disadvantage on the epigenome. We will conduct the discovery work in two epidemiologic studies – the Multi- Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA, N=1,264) and the Genetic Epidemiology Network of Arteriopathy (GENOA, N=1,728) – and replicate our results in other cohorts with similar measures, including the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities study (ARIC, N=3,911) and the Health and Retirement Study (HRS, N=2,000). This multi-cohort strategy increases scientific rigor by reducing false positives while improving our higher-dimensional understanding of the social epigenomic architecture underlying cardiovascular disease. To facilitate this multi-cohort approach, we will begin by harmonizing the measures of individual and neighborhood disadvantage (Aim 1) to enable us to identify and replicate DNA methylation (DNAm) sites that are associated with these measures of disadvantage (Aim 2) and then evaluate whether the DNAm sites are mediators of the well-established relationships between disadvantage and cardiovascular risk factors (Aim 3). Finally, we will perform pathway analysis to characterize the key biological pathways implicated by the DNAm sites identified in the previous Aims, and investigate their association with gene expression in MESA and GENOA (Aim 4). Narrative: In this project, we will use state-of-the-art methods to identify how socioeconomic factors and neighborhood conditions impact the epigenome, leading to disparities in cardiovascular risk factors such as hypertension, diabetes, and obesity. .",A Social Epigenomic Approach to Health Disparities in Cardiovascular Risk Factors,9494992,R01HL141292,"['Accounting ', ' Affect ', ' Aging ', ' Architecture ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Blood Pressure ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' type two diabetes ', ' type II DM ', ' type 2 DM ', ' maturity onset diabetes ', ' ketosis resistant diabetes ', ' adult onset diabetes ', ' Type II diabetes ', ' Type II Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Type 2 diabetes ', ' Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus ', ' T2DM ', ' T2D ', ' T2 DM ', ' Stable Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Slow-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Noninsulin Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Non-Insulin Dependent Diabetes ', ' NIDDM ', ' Maturity-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' MODY ', ' Ketosis-Resistant Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Adult-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Genes ', ' Genome ', ' Heart ', ' Hypertension ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' high blood pressure ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Income ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Inflammation ', ' Insulin ', ' Regular Insulin ', ' Novolin R ', ' Humulin R ', ' Life Cycle Stages ', ' life course ', ' Life Cycle ', ' Lipids ', ' Methods ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Obesity ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Occupations ', ' Professional Positions ', ' Jobs ', ' Promoter Regions ', ' genetic promoter element ', ' Promotor Regions ', ' Research ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Social Environment ', ' socioenvironment ', ' social context ', ' social climate ', ' Socioeconomic Factors ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Mediating ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Biological ', ' Individual ', ' Measurement ', ' Arteriopathy ', ' Arterial Disorder ', ' CpG-Rich Islands ', ' CpG Islands ', ' Immune response ', ' immunoresponse ', ' host response ', ' Immunological response ', ' DNA Methylation ', ' Diastolic blood pressure ', ' Diastolic Pressure ', ' waist circumference ', ' Physical environment ', ' cohort ', ' Mediation ', ' Negotiation ', ' Negotiating ', ' epidemiology study ', ' epidemiologic investigation ', ' Epidemiology Research ', ' Epidemiological Studies ', ' Epidemiologic Studies ', ' Epidemiologic Research ', ' social ', ' cardiovascular risk factor ', ' cardiovascular risk ', ' Pathway Analysis ', ' Network Analysis ', ' genetic epidemiology ', ' genetic epidemiologic study ', ' cardiovascular disorder risk ', ' cardiovascular disease risk ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Body mass index ', ' Quetelet index ', ' BMI z-score ', ' BMI percentile ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Regulatory Element ', ' Epigenetic Mechanism ', ' Epigenetic Change ', ' Epigenetic ', ' Epigenetic Process ', ' gene modification ', ' Gene-Modified ', ' Characteristics ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socio-economically ', ' socio-economic ', ' socioeconomics ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' epigenomics ', ' obesity risk ', ' inflammation marker ', ' inflammatory marker ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' Biological Markers ', ' fasting glucose ', ' epigenome ', ' methylation marker ', ' methylation biomarker ', ' cardiovascular health ', ' epigenome wide association analysis ', ' EWAS ', ' epigenome-wide association studies ', ' neighborhood disadvantage ', ' Health and Retirement Study ', ' genomic epidemiology ', ' high dimensionality ', ' Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis ', ' Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities ', ' ']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2018,791941,0.042314844329351994
"Neighborhoods, Cognitive Aging and Modifiable Risk Factors The role of modifiable risk factors (RF), like physical activity (PA), sleep quality, social engagement, and cardiovascular (CV) risk is receiving greater attention to promote the cognitive health of an aging population and reduce risk of Alzheimer's disease. Each of these risk factors is known to be influenced by environmental sources, such as neighborhood walkability, safety, noise, and access to low-cost transportation, retail, and healthy food sources. However, little is known about the role of neighborhood factors as drivers of cognitive aging and risk for Alzheimer's disease. If neighborhood matters, adaptations in the use of available infrastructures have the potential to impact thousands at a time. Those neighborhood factors that most impact individual RF and cognitive health to reduce Alzheimer's disease risk may further differ by race and sex. Evaluating the role of neighborhood characteristics on cognitive health is difficult to interpret from more widely used cross-sectional data due to residual confounding. Therefore, investigating how residentially stable older adults are affected by their local stable and changing contexts and how older adults who relocate to a new neighborhood may respond to their new context by changing health behaviors requires long-term study during the last 1/3 of life years prior to the onset of Alzheimer's disease. The Cardiovascular Health Study (CHS) represents an ideal cohort for studying interactions between individual health and neighborhood risk factors for various reasons. First, participants were well characterized for key modifiable RF, above, as well as cognition, and mobility. Second, the cohort is nationally representative, bi-racial and spans socioeconomically diverse, urban and rural neighborhoods, allowing us to examine the relation between individual risk and variability in neighborhood factors. Third, our proposal seeks to address the research challenges and opportunities articulated in the NIA Health Disparities Research Framework by examining interactions between environment, biology and behavior. We hypothesize that long-term exposure to neighborhood disadvantage may serve as a common cause of individual risk factors and neurocognitive and functional health, particularly in socio-demographically at-risk groups. Specific aims are to characterize associations between long-term neighborhood exposures and: 1) individual rates of decline and impairment in cognition and physical function; 2) individual risk factors (PA, sleep quality, social engagement and CV burden) for Alzheimer's disease, which may mediate neighborhood differences in cognitive and functional risk, and; 3) whether specific neighborhood exposures account for racial and sex differences in cognitive and functional risk. Addressing these questions in the CHS provides an unmatched opportunity to examine the influence of a range of neighborhood factors on long-term trajectories of cognitive and functional aging prior to the onset of Alzheimer's disease. This work will inform future design of multi-level approaches to target those neighborhood factors impacting multiple RF to optimize healthful activity, reduce health disparities, and help adults remain active and age in place. 1 Narrative We propose to evaluate in the 30-year Cardiovascular Health Study (CHS) whether long-term exposure to neighborhood disadvantage may serve as a common cause of individual risk factors and neurocognitive and functional health, particularly in groups at elevated risk for Alzheimer's disease by characterizing associations between long-term neighborhood exposures and: 1) individual rates of decline and impairment in cognition and physical function; 2) individual risk factors (physical activity, sleep quality, social support, and subclinical cardiovascular disease) for Alzheimer's disease, which may mediate neighborhood differences in neurocognitive and functional risk, and; 3) whether specific neighborhood exposures account for racial and sex differences in cognitive and functional risk. Addressing these questions in the CHS provides an unmatched opportunity to examine the influence of a range of neighborhood factors on long-term trajectories of cognitive and functional aging prior to the onset of AD to inform future design of multi-level approaches to target those factors impacting multiple healthful activities. 1","Neighborhoods, Cognitive Aging and Modifiable Risk Factors",9521742,R01AG055404,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged, 80 and over ', ' Oldest Old ', ' Aging ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Alzheimers Dementia ', "" Alzheimer's "", ' Alzheimer syndrome ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Attention ', ' Behavior ', ' Biology ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' circulatory system ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Cognition ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Environment ', ' Food ', ' Food or Food Product ', ' Future ', ' Gait ', ' Health ', ' indexing ', ' Libraries ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Noise ', ' Nonagenarian ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Research ', ' Retirement ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Safety ', ' Schools ', ' Sex Characteristics ', ' Sex Differences ', ' Social support ', ' social support network ', ' Telephone ', ' Phone ', ' Time ', ' Transportation ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Walking ', ' Mediating ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Site ', ' Clinical ', ' Residual ', ' Residual state ', ' Link ', ' Physical activity ', ' residential site ', ' residence ', ' Individual ', ' Rural ', ' healthy food ', ' Health Food ', ' Exposure to ', ' Life ', ' Event ', ' Source ', ' Physical Function ', ' Neurocognitive ', ' Visit ', ' Church ', ' Digit structure ', ' Digit ', ' Performance ', ' cohort ', ' Participant ', ' Mediation ', ' Negotiation ', ' Negotiating ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Self-Report ', ' racial difference ', ' race differences ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' cardiovascular risk factor ', ' cardiovascular risk ', ' Modeling ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' instrumental activity of daily living ', ' IADL ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' High Prevalence ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Cognitive ', ' Characteristics ', ' sex ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socio-economically ', ' socio-economic ', ' socioeconomics ', ' informant ', ' cost ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' resilience ', ' Outcome ', ' prospective ', ' Cognitive aging ', ' Impairment ', ' modifiable risk ', ' Health behavior change ', ' alzheimer risk ', ' Alzheimer risk factor ', "" Alzheimer's disease risk "", ' population aging ', ' aged population ', ' aging population ', ' socioeconomically underprivileged ', ' Socioeconomically disadvantaged ', ' socioeconomic disadvantage ', ' cardiovascular health ', ' built environment ', ' walkable ', ' walkability ', ' neighborhood disadvantage ', ' social participation ', ' social involvement ', ' social engagement ', ' sleep quality ', ' ']",NIA,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,551589,0.08041826279592182
"The Role of Neighborhood Stress in Cognitive Function among Racially and Ethnically Diverse Adults PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  The proposed research aims to evaluate the association between neighborhood context and cognitive function among racially and ethnically diverse middle-aged adults. The United States’ population is aging at unprecedented rates and it is also becoming diverse with racial and ethnic minority adults suffering a greater incidence of Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias compared to non-Hispanic white adults. Psychological and biological markers of chronic stress are important predictors of cognitive function and the neighborhood contexts in which individuals live, or have previously lived in, comprise an important backdrop for linking the effects of chronic stress to cognitive function. Neighborhood characteristics and race and ethnicity are interrelated and studying the effects of neighborhood contexts on cognitive function will inform on relevant determinants of cognitive health disparities. Further, because cognitive decline may begin long before old age, understanding its antecedents requires mapping changes that manifest in early and middle adulthood. In order to develop a more nuanced understanding of the link between neighborhoods and cognitive function, it is imperative to 1) determine the extent to which neighborhood stress is associated with cognitive function across racial and ethnic groups; 2) examine which specific facets of cognitive functioning are affected by neighborhood stress; and 3) evaluate the interplay between neighborhood context and genetic influences on cognitive function. The PI aims to address these aims by leveraging the strengths of three studies of middle- aged adults, CATSLife, ESCAPE, and MIDUS II to comprehensively assess the associations between neighborhood stress and cognitive function. The proposed research will make a timely contribution to our understanding of contextual influences on cognitive function.  Moreover, the research and training plan proposed under this award will advance the PI’s scientific and career development in several ways. With her sponsors’ mentorship and training activities, the PI will achieve three career goals: 1) learn and apply new skills on integrative data analysis and neighborhood coding techniques; 2) broaden conceptual understanding and gain advanced analytical experience in behavioral genetics; 3) develop the skills needed to design and implement studies that incorporate environmental and genetic perspectives to the study of context and cognitive function and aging. Achievement of these goals will position the PI to launch an independent line of research that will inform theoretical and empirical understanding on the influence of social/contextual sources of stress on cognitive health in adulthood, with a focus on elucidating common and/or differential associations across racial and ethnic groups. PROJECT NARRATIVE The neighborhood context in which individuals develop plays an important role in determining function in old age and may aid in understanding racial and ethnic disparities in cognitive impairment, Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias. This investigation will coordinate analyses across three studies of middle-aged adults to comprehensively assess the nature of the association between neighborhood contexts and cognitive function. Findings will increase understanding on the effect of neighborhood context characteristics on cognitive functioning and inform the tailoring of prevention and intervention efforts aimed at reducing the burden of cognitive impairment in older adults.",The Role of Neighborhood Stress in Cognitive Function among Racially and Ethnically Diverse Adults,9548452,F32AG056134,"['Accounting ', ' Achievement ', ' Achievement Attainment ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aging ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Alzheimers Dementia ', "" Alzheimer's "", ' Alzheimer syndrome ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Attention ', ' Award ', ' Cognition ', ' Data Analyses ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Environment ', ' Ethnic group ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Genes ', ' Behavioral Genetics ', ' behavior genetics ', ' Genetic Determinants of Behavior ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Hispanic Americans ', ' Spanish Americans ', ' Incidence ', ' Inflammation ', ' Intelligence ', ' Learning ', ' Mentorship ', ' middle age ', ' midlife ', ' middle aged ', ' mid-life ', ' mid life ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Play ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Specificity ', ' Stress ', ' Task Performances ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Training Activity ', ' training module ', ' United States ', ' Measures ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' career ', ' psychological ', ' psychologic ', ' Link ', ' Individual ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Genetic ', ' Exposure to ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' cognitively impaired ', ' cognitive loss ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Nature ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' cognitive function ', ' Investigation ', ' Source ', ' Techniques ', ' Country ', ' Dementia ', ' Amentia ', ' environmental stressor ', ' experience ', ' gene environment interaction ', ' environment effect on gene ', ' GxE interaction ', ' Gene x Environment Interaction ', ' Performance ', ' skills ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Self-Report ', ' racial difference ', ' race differences ', ' ethnic difference ', ' ethnicity difference ', ' social ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' Code ', ' Coding System ', ' career development ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' low socioeconomic status ', ' low socioeconomic position ', ' low socio-economic status ', ' low socio-economic position ', ' low SES ', ' Address ', ' Chronic stress ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Preventative intervention ', ' Research Training ', ' Cognitive ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' Risk Marker ', ' Characteristics ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' pathological aging ', ' Population ', ' Cognitive aging ', ' ethnic minority ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' Biological Markers ', ' cognitive performance ', ' genetic approach ', ' cognitive task ', ' cognitive ability ', ' attentional control ', ' ethnically diverse ', ' ethnic diversity ', ' racially diverse ', ' racial diversity ', ' racial minority ', ' ']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA RIVERSIDE,F32,2018,61174,0.009981556389783439
"Impact of Social Cohesion and Social Capital in PrEP Uptake and Adherence Among Transwomen of Color PROJECT SUMMARY This project seeks to use real-time geospatial methods to investigate relationships between social cohesion and social capital within Global Positioning System (GPS)-defined activity space neighborhoods and social networks in relation to HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) uptake and adherence cross-sectionally and longitudinally among transgender women (TW) of color (TWOC) in the New York City metropolitan statistical area (MSA) followed over two years. We will recruit 250 TWOC in the proposed The N2 Study: Transgender Women's Neighborhood and Networks Cohort Study to address the aims of the research. Eligibility requirements include: identifying as a transgender woman (individuals who were assigned a male sex at birth who identify as women, female, trans women, trans female, male-to-female or another diverse trans feminine gender identity on the spectrum) of color; HIV-seronegative; being 18 to 55 years old; residing in the New York City MSA; self-report no plans to move outside of the New York City metropolitan area in the next two years; self-reporting no restrictions to usual physical activity; and self-report willingness to carry a small GPS device for two-weeks at five points over the course of two years. Participants will wear the GPS device following protocols used in our previous feasibility research projects, including studies among TW. In this longitudinal study, six months after completing the initial 2-week GPS protocol, participants will carry the GPS device for an additional 2-weeks every six-months over the two-year study period—for a total of five times. Multiple GPS measures and multiple measures of social networks (at different time points) can better capture the breadth of people's exposure to neighborhood-level factors and dynamics in social networks. Also, GPS activity space environment and social networks data at baseline could potentially influence PrEP outcomes over time, providing a clear temporal ordering and an ability to consider potential time-lags. The proposed study will be the largest GPS study of HIV disparities in any transgender population and presents a remarkable opportunity to study environmental influences on HIV. Findings from the proposed research will impact HIV prevention intervention activities. First, the project will inform specific neighborhood-level policy interventions. For example, increased community efforts through increased social cohesion in neighborhoods may be an HIV prevention intervention that can reduce HIV health disparities. Second, from the GPS dataset we will know the travel patterns of TW and therefore be able to identify optimal geographic locations for HIV prevention interventions. This will advance the literature given that such interventions are seldom geographically targeted. Third, examining changes in spatial mobility (i.e. activity spaces) over time will be useful in knowing whether the risks of particular spaces change or remain constant because different neighborhoods will have different risk profiles. Finally, our dynamic network analysis we propose will deepen understanding of the effects of social networks on HIV prevention behaviors and will improve network-based HIV prevention interventions. PROJECT NARRATIVE This project seeks to use real-time geospatial methods to investigate relationships between social cohesion and social capital within GPS-defined activity space neighborhoods and social networks in relation to HIV pre- exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) use and adherence among transgender women of color in New York City, a population in the United States heavily impacted by HIV/AIDS.",Impact of Social Cohesion and Social Capital in PrEP Uptake and Adherence Among Transwomen of Color,9657326,R01MD013554,"['Behavior ', ' Birth ', ' Parturition ', ' Censuses ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Color ', ' Communities ', ' Dancing ', ' Eligibility Determination ', ' Protocol Screening ', ' Eligibility ', ' Environment ', ' Epidemic ', ' Female ', ' Gender Identity ', ' Geographic Locations ', ' geographic site ', ' Geographical Location ', ' Geographic Region ', ' Geographic Area ', ' Geography ', ' Goals ', ' HIV ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV Infections ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' HIV Seronegativity ', ' HTLV-III Seronegativity ', ' HTLV-III Seronegativities ', ' HIV Seronegativities ', ' Incidence ', ' Literature ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' male ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' New York City ', ' Odds Ratio ', ' Risk Ratio ', ' Relative Odds ', ' Cross-Product Ratio ', ' Polygamy ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Social Environment ', ' socioenvironment ', ' social context ', ' social climate ', ' Technology ', ' Time ', ' Travel ', ' United States ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' AIDS prevention ', ' HIV/AIDS prevention ', ' HIV Prevention ', ' AIDS/HIV prevention ', ' Social Network ', ' base ', ' urban area ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Biological ', ' Link ', ' Physical activity ', ' Feminine ', ' Individual ', ' Policies ', ' Funding ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' uptake ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Anal Sex ', ' Exposure to ', ' Clinic ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' Location ', ' contextual factors ', ' Application Context ', ' transgender ', ' trans* ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' cohesion ', ' metropolitan ', ' cohort ', ' skills ', ' Participant ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Self-Report ', ' General Population ', ' General Public ', ' Prevention ', ' Devices ', ' epidemiology study ', ' epidemiologic investigation ', ' Epidemiology Research ', ' Epidemiological Studies ', ' Epidemiologic Studies ', ' Epidemiologic Research ', ' social ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' AIDS/HIV problem ', ' HIV/AIDS problem ', ' HIV/AIDS ', ' AIDS/HIV ', ' Code ', ' Coding System ', ' Pathway Analysis ', ' Network Analysis ', ' Sampling ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Address ', ' social capital ', ' Adherence ', ' Data ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Preventative intervention ', ' Subgroup ', ' scientific advances ', ' scientific accomplishments ', ' Scientific Advances and Accomplishments ', ' Transmission ', ' transmission process ', ' sex ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' men who have sex with other men ', ' MSM ', ' men who have sex with men ', ' next generation ', ' willingness ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel approaches ', ' new approaches ', ' novel strategies ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' Network-based ', ' treatment development ', ' intervention development ', ' develop therapy ', ' therapy development ', ' surveillance study ', ' transwomen ', ' transwoman ', ' trans-women ', ' transgender women ', ' Gender and Sexual Minorities ', ' Sexual and Gender Minorities ', ' race disparity ', ' disparities in race ', ' racial disparity ', ' PrEP ', ' pre-exposure prophylaxis ', ' recruit ', ' ']",NIMHD,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,R01,2018,620133,-0.054975198515648825
"Understanding the contributions of the neighborhood social environment to cardiovascular disease risk factors in a multi-ethnic cohort of Chicago women ABSTRACT While several advances have been made in the assessment of the impact of the neighborhood built environment (i.e., physical attributes like grocery stores or parks) on cardiometabolic disease risk, fewer gains have been made in understanding the contributions of the neighborhood social environment (i.e., socioeconomic composition, crime, and collective efficacy). Most prior neighborhood research on the social environment has utilized U.S. Census indicators, to characterize neighborhood features.14 Although these measures can sufficiently capture the role of neighborhood-level socioeconomic disadvantage and racial/ethnic residential segregation, they are more limited in their ability to assess the influence of other aspects of the social environment related to crime and collective efficacy like economic disinvestment and physical disorder. This is especially problematic at a time when public health practitioners are being called on to identify salient targets for more collaborative, cross-sector approaches to addressing social determinants of health. In recognition of this gap in the field, the objective of this application is to use more novel, widely available data sources to investigate the contributions of under-studied aspects of the social environment to cardiometabolic disease risk in a sample of women ages 18-44 living in the city of Chicago. We will achieve this objective in part by taking advantage of Google's “Street View” feature, which makes it possible to assess these features virtually by viewing high resolution images of neighborhoods of interest and taking a virtual “walk” through the neighborhood.17-19 We will also use a combination of business location databases, housing stock and affordability data, and American Community Survey data. The successful execution of these aims will meaningfully improve the field by testing the influence of multiple objective, cost-effective, and scalable measures of the social environment on cardiometabolic disease risk. NARRATIVE Public health practitioners are being called on to take more collaborative, cross-sector approaches to addressing social determinants of health due to the growing recognition that health is influenced by the social, physical, and economic environments in which people live. Studies of the neighborhood social environment and cardiovascular disease risk to date have largely focused on broad factors like neighborhood socioeconomic disadvantage and racial/ethnic residential segregation rather than specific aspects of the social environment that could serve as targets for healthy public policy development. The successful execution of these aims will provide the scientific community with objective, scalable ways of capturing the features of the neighborhood social environment that are hypothesized to underlie place-based health disparities.",Understanding the contributions of the neighborhood social environment to cardiovascular disease risk factors in a multi-ethnic cohort of Chicago women,9789929,R03HL145223,"['Age ', ' ages ', ' Birth ', ' Parturition ', ' Blood Pressure ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Censuses ', ' intracranial vascular dysfunction ', ' cerebrovascular dysfunction ', ' cerebral vascular dysfunction ', ' cerebral vascular disease ', ' brain vascular dysfunction ', ' brain vascular disease ', ' Intracranial Vascular Disorders ', ' Intracranial Vascular Diseases ', ' Cerebrovascular Disease ', ' Brain Vascular Disorders ', ' Cerebrovascular Disorders ', ' Chicago ', ' Cities ', ' Communities ', ' Community Surveys ', ' coronary disorder ', ' atherosclerotic heart disease ', ' Coronary Disease ', ' Coronary heart disease ', ' Crime ', ' data representation ', ' Data Reporting ', ' Data Sources ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Economics ', ' Environment ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' promoting health ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' Health Promotion ', ' Housing ', ' Inflammation ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Life Expectancy ', ' lifespan ', ' life span ', ' Length of Life ', ' Longevity ', ' Methods ', ' Persons ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' New York ', ' Poverty ', ' survival sex ', ' commercial sex work ', ' commercial sex ', ' Prostitution ', ' Public Health ', ' Public Policy ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Publications ', ' Questionnaires ', ' Research ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk Factors ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Social Characteristics ', ' socioenvironment ', ' social context ', ' social climate ', ' Social Environment ', ' Time ', ' Travel ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Racial Segregation ', ' segregation ', ' Walking ', ' Police ', ' Businesses ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Chronic ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Physical activity ', ' Individual ', ' Databases ', ' data base ', ' Data Bases ', ' Logistics ', ' Policy Developments ', ' Metabolic ', ' vandalism ', ' Source ', ' Location ', ' Country ', ' interest ', ' Services ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' field study ', ' field test ', ' field learning ', ' field based data ', ' hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis ', ' hypothalmus-pituitary-adrenal axis ', ' hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis ', ' cohort ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' disorder risk ', ' disease risk ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' Sampling ', ' Property ', ' cardiovascular disorder risk ', ' cardiovascular disease risk ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Quetelet index ', ' BMI z-score ', ' BMI percentile ', ' Body mass index ', ' low socioeconomic position ', ' low socio-economic status ', ' low socio-economic position ', ' low SES ', ' low socioeconomic status ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Reproducibility ', ' Process ', ' socioeconomics ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socio-economically ', ' socio-economic ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute ', ' NHLBI ', ' virtual ', ' Outcome ', ' cost effective ', ' Population ', ' Eating Behavior ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' high risk ', ' social health determinants ', ' socioeconomic disadvantage ', ' socioeconomically underprivileged ', ' Socioeconomically disadvantaged ', ' built environment ', ' physical inactivity ', ' lack of physical activity ', ' health difference ', ' differences in health ', ' high resolution imaging ', ' cardiometabolism ', ' cardiometabolic ', ' social deficits ', ' social dysfunction ', ' social disorders ', ' social defects ', ' perceived stress ', ' ']",NHLBI,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,R03,2019,79000,0.17887884089978
"Promoting small business support of youth physical activity in low-income, minority neighborhoods Project Summary/Abstract An unacceptably high percentage of our nation’s low-income, minority youth (< 18 years of age) are not regularly physically active. This contributes to extreme health disparities such as obesity rates nearly two-fold higher than those seen in white youth and greater risk for diabetes and related cardiometabolic disorders. The presence of quality youth physical activity opportunities (YPAO) enables and encourages physically active lifestyles. Unfortunately, quality YPAOs often are lacking in places where minority youth live, resulting in low activity levels and subsequent health issues that represent significant disparities in our society. Our previous research found that small businesses (< 500 employees), which represent over 99% of all employers, are powerful resources for creating and improving YPAOs. In accordance with the Socioecological Model and established philanthropic principles, we developed an alpha version of an intervention (alpha-i) for increasing small businesses’ involvement with YPAOs. We are now poised to create a beta version (beta-i) and conduct a pilot study of its impact on small business support for YPAOs and YPAO utilization by youth in low-income, minority neighborhoods. To meet this objective, we will complete the following specific aims. Aim 1: Refine alpha-i components by completing focus groups with small business owners, YPAO providers, and parents/guardians of youth from low-income, predominantly minority neighborhoods. Results of the qualitative analysis will inform final tailoring of the intervention to create the beta-i which will be tested in Aim 2. Aim 2: Determine the effect of the beta-i on small business support for YPAOs in low-income, minority neighborhoods by conducting a plot cluster randomized-control trial with randomization at the neighborhood level. Intervention neighborhoods (n=10) will receive the beta-i while control neighborhoods (n=10) will be provided a standard practice intervention for a period of one year. The primary outcome for aim 2 will be the percentage of small businesses not supporting YPAOs at baseline that subsequently provide support for YPAOs at follow-up. We also will consider the U.S. dollar equivalent of all types of support (monetary, goods/services and time) donated for YPAOs by small businesses. Aim 3: Examine the impact of the increased small business support for YPAOs on YPAO utilization by youth. The primary outcome will be the percent change in the number of youth participating in YPAOs from baseline and follow-up in the treatment and control neighborhoods. The proposed study is significant because it will provide evidence that an easily replicated approach can be used to increase small business support for YPAOs and that this support results in greater use of the YPAOs by youth. Our next step will be to determine if YPAO changes resulting from increased small business support positively influence youth physical activity levels as measured by accelerometry. Our long-term goals are to create a nationally implementable practice for increasing support for YPAOs and strengthen the science of addressing health disparities in socially disadvantaged populations. Project Narrative Small businesses represent a substantial potential source of support for youth physical activity opportunities and in the proposed study, we will examine a mechanism we developed for increasing their support. Findings from this study have the potential to generate a major shift in public health policy by providing a strong evidence base that small businesses can be encouraged to play a major role in enhancing environmental conditions that have the potential to positively impact healthy lifestyles and chronic disease risks across the age spectrum.","Promoting small business support of youth physical activity in low-income, minority neighborhoods",9749956,R21NR017267,"['Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Back ', ' Dorsum ', ' Behavior ', ' Budgets ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Communities ', ' type two diabetes ', ' type II DM ', ' type 2 DM ', ' maturity onset diabetes ', ' ketosis resistant diabetes ', ' adult onset diabetes ', ' Type II diabetes ', ' Type II Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Type 2 diabetes ', ' Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus ', ' T2DM ', ' T2D ', ' T2 DM ', ' Stable Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Slow-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Noninsulin Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Noninsulin Dependent Diabetes ', ' Non-Insulin Dependent Diabetes ', ' NIDDM ', ' Maturity-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Ketosis-Resistant Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Adult-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Environment ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' healthcare policy ', ' health care policy ', ' Health Policy ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Marketing ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Obesity ', ' extreme obesity ', ' Severe obesity ', ' Morbid Obesity ', ' Parents ', ' pilot study ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' Play ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Science ', ' Societies ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' Businesses ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Youth ', ' improved ', ' Physical activity ', ' Funding ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Exposure to ', ' Prediabetes syndrome ', ' prediabetic ', ' pre-diabetic ', ' pre-diabetes ', ' Prediabetic State ', ' Prediabetes ', ' programs ', ' Event ', ' Source ', ' Overweight ', ' Over weight ', ' Physical environment ', ' Services ', ' Employee ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' disorder risk ', ' disease risk ', ' social ', ' Modeling ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Provider ', ' diabetes risk ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Low income ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Exploratory/Developmental Grant ', ' exploratory developmental study ', ' R21 Program ', ' R21 Mechanism ', ' Characteristics ', ' follow-up ', ' followup ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' active followup ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' Advanced Development ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' 18 year old ', ' eighteen years of age ', ' eighteen year old ', ' age 18 years ', ' 18 years of age ', ' 19 year old ', ' nineteen years old ', ' nineteen year old ', ' age 19 years ', ' 19 years of age ', ' parental involvement ', ' control trial ', ' evidence base ', ' primary outcome ', ' public health priorities ', ' Healthy People 2020 ', ' healthy lifestyle ', ' healthy life-style ', ' Accelerometer ', ' activity tracker ', ' activity monitor ', ' accelerometry ', ' exercise intervention ', ' physical activity intervention ', ' disadvantaged population ', ' active lifestyle ', ' active living ', ' active life style ', ' cardiometabolism ', ' cardiometabolic ', ' ']",NINR,UNIVERSITY OF DELAWARE,R21,2019,193214,0.058451225365856174
"Modeling and Forecasting Atherosclerotic Risk: A Complex Systems Approach Project Summary/Abstract Inequality in health outcomes in relation to Americans' socioeconomic status (SES) is rising: a recent study by the Brookings Institution found that life expectancy for men and women in the top 10% of career earnings was over 10 years greater than those in the bottom 10%. Cardiovascular disease – still leading cause of death for Americans – merits study with respect to these findings. More research on how SES affects atherosclerotic risk is needed. The goal of our project is to develop advanced forecasting algorithms for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD)-related events – both at baseline and longitudinally – using systems-based modeling methodologies which incorporate probabilistic representations of patients' socioeconomic and environmental characteristics. This represents a paradigm shift beyond existing models used in guiding primary and secondary prevention of atherosclerotic disease; in particular, risk models developed by the American College of Cardiology Foundation and the American Heart Association (ACCF/AHA) are based solely on physiological risk factors. We believe that the prediction performance of ASCVD risk models can be significantly improved by incorporating socioeconomic and environmental risks, especially in an era where improved primary and secondary prevention and increased socioeconomic inequality have resulted in complex phenomena among elderly Americans with respect to ASCVD risk. Our preliminary work indicates a significant degree of neighborhood-level variability in major ASCVD events (myocardial infarction, stroke or cardiovascular death), with low-SES neighborhoods associated with event rates over three times that of high-SES neighborhoods. Moreover, neighborhood SES explained four times the amount of neighborhood-level variation in ASCVD event rates than that explained by the ACCF/AHA Pooled Cohort Equations Risk Model. Our proposed project will therefore provide an essential risk modeling platform to health care systems focused on optimizing the health of populations that are highly heterogeneous with respect to socioeconomic and environmental characteristics. These models will be developed in a team-based environment, including translational scientists from general internal medicine, cardiology, social work, spatial epidemiology, urban poverty, community development, immunology, and data and population health sciences. Informing the models will be a newly-established, cutting-edge regional research registry, based on electronic health data from Northeast Ohio's two largest health systems, Cleveland Clinic and MetroHealth. Ultimately, this research is anticipated to yield new mechanistic insights and hypotheses, more accurate prediction models for cardiovascular outcomes, and a basis for informing decisions at multiple strategic and programmatic levels. Project Narrative Poorer Americans are now expected to live 10 fewer years than wealthier Americans. Doctors and other providers need tools to identify people who are at greatest risk of poor heart disease outcomes. Our research will improve on current approaches by understanding the complexity of neighborhood, economic and clinical factors and how they determine heart disease risk.",Modeling and Forecasting

"The Effect of Neighborhood Change on Health and Well-Being Project Summary This is a study of how neighborhoods are changing their racial/ethnic and income composition as a result of mobility choices made by individual families. The consequent changes in segregation and disparate local environments for people of different race, ethnicity, and income have substantial potential consequences for their health and well-being. The study takes advantage of access to a new data resource – linked records of as many as 90% of enumerated Americans in 2000 and 2010 – to pursue two main aims: Aim 1) To assess the balance of flows of persons into and out of neighborhoods that are associated with specific neighborhood-level changes in race/ethnicity and income levels that we observe, such as increasing concentration of poverty or growing racial/ethnic diversity. Aim 2) To model the selectivity of people's locations in 2000 and their post- 2000 movements in neighborhoods, based both on how places appeared in 2000 and how they were changing in the next decade. The proposed study builds on a growing body of research that breaks with binary conceptualizations of segregation (e.g., the longstanding emphasis on the white-black divide or a simple distinction between poor and non-poor neighborhoods) to acknowledge the multigroup composition of metropolitan America and the variety of kinds of social class changes that are occurring. It will make use of confidential individual-level data in a Census Research Data Center (RDC) that has been linked between the 2000 and 2010 censuses to track changes in composition in changing neighborhoods (decomposing net change into numbers of persons in each group who arrived, left, or stayed). It will also to identify the personal/household characteristics associated with each type of mobility. This study of neighborhood change and residential mobility is highly relevant to major contemporary social concerns related to persistent minority segregation and increasing neighborhood diversity. Research conducted in the RDC will demonstrate the value of the Census Bureau's investment in record linkage and increase the likelihood of continued efforts of this kind. Project Narrative This project will study the changes in neighborhood racial/ethnic and socioeconomic composition that occurred in the 2000-2010 decade in all metropolitan areas of the United States. It will decompose net neighborhood changes into the flows of in-movers and leavers in different kinds of neighborhoods and evaluate the characteristics of persons involved in flows in each direction. Because neighborhoods are increasingly understood as having major effects on the health and well being of residents, this research will provide fundamental insights for health and population research, education, and policy- making.",The Effect of Neighborhood Change on Health and Well-Being,9686395,R01HD095653,"['Affect ', ' Americas ', ' Blood Circulation ', ' Circulation ', ' Bloodstream ', ' Censuses ', ' Communities ', ' Economics ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Environment ', ' balance function ', ' balance ', ' Equilibrium ', ' Family ', ' Health ', ' Household ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Income ', ' Investments ', ' body movement ', ' Movement ', ' Persons ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' wellbeing ', ' well-being ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' Policy Making ', ' Poverty ', ' Probability Samples ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Records ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Residential Mobility ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Social Class ', ' Time ', ' Typology ', ' United States ', ' Work ', ' Racial Segregation ', ' segregation ', ' Longitudinal Surveys ', ' base ', ' Left ', ' Area ', ' Link ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Inequality ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Dimensions ', ' Pattern ', ' Location ', ' American ', ' metropolitan ', ' Sorting - Cell Movement ', ' sorting ', ' social ', ' Modeling ', ' Low income ', ' Data ', ' Population Research ', ' Population-level research ', ' Population-based research ', ' trend ', ' Characteristics ', ' socioeconomics ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socio-economically ', ' socio-economic ', ' Minority ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' ethnic diversity ', ' ethnically diverse ', ' data resource ', ' ']",NICHD,BROWN UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,445057,0.22889227638559756
"Natural Experiment of Neighborhood Revitalization and Cardiometabolic Health ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Individuals living in socioeconomically disadvantaged neighborhoods have disproportionately high rates of obesity and related morbidity, including increased risk for diabetes and cardiovascular diseases (CVD). Although previous research has made significant contributions to our understanding of the health consequences associated with neighborhood disadvantage, causal relationships have been difficult to establish due to a reliance on cross-sectional designs, selection biases and limited data on potential mechanisms. Building on the existing research infrastructure developed by our team's previously funded, ongoing natural experiment studies, we have a unique opportunity to study whether changes to the built and social environment, stimulated by substantial ($160 million) economic investment in housing development and neighborhood revitalization, improves cardio-metabolic outcomes in the ""intervention"" neighborhood relative to the matched ""control"" neighborhood which is not undergoing such changes. The study includes a randomly selected cohort of 732 low-income, African American adults, from two urban neighborhoods (intervention and control communities). Our study will be the first natural experiment to examine the impact of a place-based natural experiment strategy (rather than residential mobility strategy) on clinically relevant cardio-metabolic outcomes (BMI, HbA1c, blood pressure, and lipids) in a high-risk, though understudied, African American population. We will leverage existing data from our previously funded studies on potential mediators, including measures of the built and social environment, and health behaviors including diet, physical activity and sleep (objective and subjective measures). In this proposal, we will add measured cardio-metabolic outcomes, including blood pressure, HbA1c, and lipids. The next stage of economic revitalization of the intervention neighborhood is focused on redevelopment of housing. Thus, in addition, the proposed study is optimally timed to add survey measures of perceptions of housing conditions, neighborhood-level audits of housing conditions, and compilation of secondary data from publically available resources on housing sales, vacancy rates, etc.,             before and after the housing changes occur. Understanding the impact and pattern of neighborhood revitalization as it unfolds over time is critical in the arsenal of policies to mitigte pervasive racial/ ethnic and socioeconomic disparities in obesity and cardio-metabolic health. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Individuals living in socioeconomically disadvantaged neighborhoods have significantly higher rates of obesity and obesity-related health problems, including cardiovascular diseases (CVD) and diabetes. Our study is the first of its kind to evaluate whether improvements in neighborhood conditions, spurred by substantial neighborhood-level revitalization in a predominantly African American (AA) neighborhood improves residents' cardio-metabolic risk factors (obesity, glycated hemoglobin, cholesterol, and, blood pressure) relative to a comparison neighborhood that is not undergoing such changes. Prior studies of similar redevelopment initiatives lack the comparative research design, and none, to our knowledge, have measured cardio-metabolic risk factors in a high-risk, yet understudied African American resident base.

"Racial inequalities in health throughout adulthood: The cumulative impact of neighborhood chemical and non-chemical stressors on epigenomic pathways ABSTRACT Racial inequalities in healthy aging have been well-documented. Compared to White Americans, Black Americans experience illness and death at early ages and show steeper age-related declines in health. Our neighborhoods, as the site of where we live, learn, play, and pray, may serve as a powerful source of these racial inequalities. Racial residential segregation (which is the sorting of different racial groups into different neighborhoods through historical and current discriminatory policies and practices) has resulted in a racially unequal American neighborhood landscape. Neighborhoods with mostly Black residents experience more poverty, civic and commercial disinvestment, and more exposure to environmental hazards compared to neighborhoods with mostly White residents. While more researchers are documenting the role of neighborhoods in health inequalities, we may actually be underestimating the true impact of neighborhood context, because we often focus on specific health outcomes, such as cardiovascular disease or diabetes. However, there are likely shared biological mechanisms within the body that drive many of these diseases – and one such mechanism may be changes to our genomic structure, called epigenomics. While our genes do not change, the environment can have an impact on whether our genes are actually “expressed”. We will determine whether the accumulation of adulthood lived experience in racially-segregated neighborhoods is related to epigenomic patterns called DNA methylation. We will also specifically determine whether the accumulation of adulthood exposure to neighborhood industrial air pollution and disadvantage together are related to these patterns of DNA methylation. Finally, we will determine whether the DNA methylation patterns we see are related to racial inequalities in healthy aging. We hypothesize that racially-segregation Black neighborhoods, with their greater levels of industrial air pollution and social disadvantage, will be related to the types of patterns in DNA methylation that have been shown to be related to chronic diseases in molecular studies. In fact, we further hypothesize that these patterns in DNA methylation will be related to racial inequalities in cognitive function and the number of chronic diseases one has had. Clarifying the role of neighborhood context in racial inequalities in healthy aging is critical, as neighborhoods are not naturally- occurring. They develop and change through policies and are amenable to intervention. Identifying the role of DNA methylation that likely underlies many chronic diseases, will clarify the importance of neighborhoods and point to potential effective interventions. PROJECT NARRATIVE Racial inequalities in healthy aging are well-known and neighborhoods, where we live, learn, play, and pray, has emerged as a potentially powerful driver of these health inequalities. We will determine whether neighborhood social stressors and environmental hazards are, in combination, linked to racial inequalities in the molecular underpinnings of numerous chronic diseases of aging. The results of this study will highlight the role of neighborhoods as a potentially effective point of intervention to eliminate racial health inequalities.",Racial inequalities in health throughout adulthood: The cumulative impact of neighborhood chemical and non-chemical stressors on epigenomic pathways,9763639,R01MD013299,"['Acceleration ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Aging ', ' Air Pollution ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Data Collection ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' diabetes ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' DNA ', ' DNA Markers ', ' Environmental Science ', ' Ecology ', ' Environment ', ' environmental contamination ', ' environmental contaminant ', ' Environmental Pollution ', ' Genes ', ' Health ', ' Industrialization ', ' Learning ', ' Literature ', ' Methylation ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' mortality ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Play ', ' Poverty ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' socioenvironment ', ' social context ', ' social climate ', ' Social Environment ', ' Social Sciences ', ' Stress ', ' Environmental Hazards ', ' Measures ', ' Racial Segregation ', ' segregation ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Site ', ' Chronic ', ' Biological ', ' Link ', ' Chemicals ', ' caucasian American ', ' white American ', ' Policies ', ' Inequality ', ' Exposure to ', ' DNA Methylation ', ' cognitive function ', ' Immune ', ' Immunes ', ' Complex ', ' Source ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' Physical environment ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' stressor ', ' Sorting - Cell Movement ', ' sorting ', ' social ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' structural genomics ', ' disease causation ', ' causation ', ' Causality ', ' Etiology ', ' Data ', ' Collection ', ' Epigenetic Process ', ' Epigenetic Mechanism ', ' Epigenetic Change ', ' Epigenetic ', ' Molecular ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' epigenomics ', ' age related ', ' age dependent ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' healthy aging ', ' effective intervention ', ' health inequalities ', ' methylation pattern ', ' ']",NIMHD,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2019,716795,0.14998415096819992
"Neighborhoods, Cognitive Aging and Modifiable Risk Factors The role of modifiable risk factors (RF), like physical activity (PA), sleep quality, social engagement, and cardiovascular (CV) risk is receiving greater attention to promote the cognitive health of an aging population and reduce risk of Alzheimer's disease. Each of these risk factors is known to be influenced by environmental sources, such as neighborhood walkability, safety, noise, and access to low-cost transportation, retail, and healthy food sources. However, little is known about the role of neighborhood factors as drivers of cognitive aging and risk for Alzheimer's disease. If neighborhood matters, adaptations in the use of available infrastructures have the potential to impact thousands at a time. Those neighborhood factors that most impact individual RF and cognitive health to reduce Alzheimer's disease risk may further differ by race and sex. Evaluating the role of neighborhood characteristics on cognitive health is difficult to interpret from more widely used cross-sectional data due to residual confounding. Therefore, investigating how residentially stable older adults are affected by their local stable and changing contexts and how older adults who relocate to a new neighborhood may respond to their new context by changing health behaviors requires long-term study during the last 1/3 of life years prior to the onset of Alzheimer's disease. The Cardiovascular Health Study (CHS) represents an ideal cohort for studying interactions between individual health and neighborhood risk factors for various reasons. First, participants were well characterized for key modifiable RF, above, as well as cognition, and mobility. Second, the cohort is nationally representative, bi-racial and spans socioeconomically diverse, urban and rural neighborhoods, allowing us to examine the relation between individual risk and variability in neighborhood factors. Third, our proposal seeks to address the research challenges and opportunities articulated in the NIA Health Disparities Research Framework by examining interactions between environment, biology and behavior. We hypothesize that long-term exposure to neighborhood disadvantage may serve as a common cause of individual risk factors and neurocognitive and functional health, particularly in socio-demographically at-risk groups. Specific aims are to characterize associations between long-term neighborhood exposures and: 1) individual rates of decline and impairment in cognition and physical function; 2) individual risk factors (PA, sleep quality, social engagement and CV burden) for Alzheimer's disease, which may mediate neighborhood differences in cognitive and functional risk, and; 3) whether specific neighborhood exposures account for racial and sex differences in cognitive and functional risk. Addressing these questions in the CHS provides an unmatched opportunity to examine the influence of a range of neighborhood factors on long-term trajectories of cognitive and functional aging prior to the onset of Alzheimer's disease. This work will inform future design of multi-level approaches to target those neighborhood factors impacting multiple RF to optimize healthful activity, reduce health disparities, and help adults remain active and age in place. 1 Narrative We propose to evaluate in the 30-year Cardiovascular Health Study (CHS) whether long-term exposure to neighborhood disadvantage may serve as a common cause of individual risk factors and neurocognitive and functional health, particularly in groups at elevated risk for Alzheimer's disease by characterizing associations between long-term neighborhood exposures and: 1) individual rates of decline and impairment in cognition and physical function; 2) individual risk factors (physical activity, sleep quality, social support, and subclinical cardiovascular disease) for Alzheimer's disease, which may mediate neighborhood differences in neurocognitive and functional risk, and; 3) whether specific neighborhood exposures account for racial and sex differences in cognitive and functional risk. Addressing these questions in the CHS provides an unmatched opportunity to examine the influence of a range of neighborhood factors on long-term trajectories of cognitive and functional aging prior to the onset of AD to inform future design of multi-level approaches to target those factors impacting multiple healthful activities. 1","Neighborhoods, Cognitive Aging and Modifiable Risk Factors",9696724,R01AG055404,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Affect ', ' Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged, 80 and over ', ' Oldest Old ', ' Aging ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Alzheimers Dementia ', "" Alzheimer's "", ' Alzheimer syndrome ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Attention ', ' Behavior ', ' Biology ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' circulatory system ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Cognition ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Environment ', ' Food or Food Product ', ' Food ', ' Future ', ' Gait ', ' Health ', ' indexing ', ' Libraries ', ' longterm study ', ' long-term study ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Noise ', ' Nonagenarian ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Research ', ' Retirement ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Safety ', ' Schools ', ' social support network ', ' Social support ', ' Phone ', ' Telephone ', ' Time ', ' Transportation ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Walking ', ' Mediating ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' Site ', ' Clinical ', ' Residual state ', ' Residual ', ' Link ', ' Physical activity ', ' residence ', ' residential site ', ' Individual ', ' Rural ', ' Health Food ', ' healthy food ', ' Exposure to ', ' Life ', ' Event ', ' Source ', ' Physical Function ', ' Neurocognitive ', ' Visit ', ' Church ', ' Digit structure ', ' Digit ', ' Performance ', ' cohort ', ' Participant ', ' Mediation ', ' Negotiation ', ' Negotiating ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Self-Report ', ' racial difference ', ' race differences ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' cardiovascular risk factor ', ' cardiovascular risk ', ' Modeling ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' IADL ', ' instrumental activity of daily living ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' High Prevalence ', ' Cognitive ', ' Characteristics ', ' sex ', ' follow-up ', ' followup ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' active followup ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' socioeconomics ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socio-economically ', ' socio-economic ', ' informant ', ' cost ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' resilience ', ' Outcome ', ' prospective ', ' Cognitive aging ', ' Impairment ', ' modifiable risk ', ' Health behavior change ', "" Alzheimer's disease risk "", ' alzheimer risk ', ' Alzheimer risk factor ', ' aging population ', ' population aging ', ' aged population ', ' socioeconomic disadvantage ', ' socioeconomically underprivileged ', ' Socioeconomically disadvantaged ', ' cardiovascular health ', ' built environment ', ' walkability ', ' walkable ', ' neighborhood disadvantage ', ' social engagement ', ' social participation ', ' social involvement ', ' sleep quality ', ' quality of sleep ', ' aging in place ', ' age in place ', ' Infrastructure ', ' sociodemographics ', ' socio-demographics ', ' Sex Differences ', ' sex-specific differences ', ' sex-related differences ', ' sex-dependent differences ', ' ']",NIA,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,600925,0.08041826279592182
"Neighborhood Socioeconomic Disadvantage and Medicare's 30-Day Rehospitalization Policy: Eliminating Rehospitalization Disparities by Informing Policy Design and Implementation ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Thirty-day re-hospitalizations disproportionately impact African American patients and those from socioeconomically disadvantaged neighborhoods. Hospitals that primarily serve disadvantaged populations bear a disproportionate burden of Medicare's hospital-based financial re-hospitalization penalties (mandated by S. 3025, Affordable Care Act). As these penalties continue to increase in coming years, penalized hospitals have stated that they will need to cut services to maintain financial solvency, which may further worsen disparities. This may be a potential unintended negative consequence of Medicare's policy decision to not adjust for socioeconomic factors in the re-hospitalization metrics to which the penalties are tied. At this decision's core is a debate on whether observed disparities result from confounding by cluster (i.e., disadvantaged populations primarily receiving care from 'bad' hospitals) or whether socioeconomic disadvantage outside the hospital has a greater influence on re-hospitalization than is currently recognized by Medicare. A statistical decomposition of the within- and between- hospital effects is needed to help disentangle whether the hospital or non-hospital socioeconomics play the greater role in re-hospitalization, but until recently few national-scale indictors of disadvantage were available for this purpose. (Individual-level indicators of disadvantage are neither widely available nor reliabl enough for either resolving this debate or for use in metric adjustment.) The Area Deprivation Index (ADI) is a validated measure of US disadvantage, based upon similar measures employed abroad for health policy development. The ADI uses US Census poverty, education, and housing and employment indicators to characterize regions, such as neighborhoods. Recently, we demonstrated that living in a severely disadvantaged US neighborhood (per a year 2000 Census-based ADI) predicts re-hospitalization as powerfully as the presence of illnesses, such as chronic pulmonary disease. However, to answer the critical policy debate above and to understand if the ADI is suitable for use as a metric adjuster, the ADI must be updated to the 2010 Census, its geographic stability (i.e., how the distribution of disadvantaged US neighborhoods has changed since 2000) and association consistency (i.e., whether the association of neighborhood disadvantage and re-hospitalization remains in 2010) determined, within- and between-hospital effects assessed (i.e., informing the hospital vs. neighborhood socioeconomics debate), and resilient hospitals (i.e., hospitals which primarily serve highly disadvantaged neighborhoods yet have lower than expected re-hospitalization rates) studied in comparison to less-resilient/non-resilient hospitals, especially in terms of patient, caregiver and clinician perspectives on the underlying reasons for this resilience. The potential policy impact o metric adjustment must also be understood. We propose to accomplish all of these steps, with an overarching goal of eliminating re-hospitalization disparities by informing policy and practice. This proposed project has the potential to immediately change re-hospitalization policy and inform metric revision. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Thirty-day re-hospitalizations disproportionately impact African American patients and those from socioeconomically disadvantaged neighborhoods; hospitals that primarily serve disadvantaged populations bear a disproportionate burden of the financial re-hospitalization penalties mandated by Section 3025 of the Affordable Care Act. As these penalties continue to increase in coming years, penalized hospitals have stated that they will need to cut services to maintain financial solvency, which may further worsen disparities--a potential unintended negative consequence of Medicare's policy decision to not adjust for socioeconomic factors in the re-hospitalization metrics to which the penalties are tied. To inform Medicare policy design and implementation, this proposal examines a novel method by which such an adjustment could be achieved, evaluates its suitability as an adjustment metric, and assesses the potential implications of adjustment.",Neighborhood Socioeconomic Disadvantage and Medicare's 30-Day Rehospitalization Policy: Eliminating Rehospitalization Disparities by Informing Policy Design and Implementation,9720712,R01MD010243,"['Affect ', ' Ursidae Family ', ' bear ', ' Ursidae ', ' Bears ', ' Censuses ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Employment ', ' Food or Food Product ', ' Food ', ' Future ', ' Geography ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' health insurance for disabled ', ' Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Disabled Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Aged and Disabled, Title 18 ', ' Medicare ', ' healthcare policy ', ' health care policy ', ' Health Policy ', ' Hospitals ', ' Housing ', ' indexing ', ' Internal Medicine ', ' lung disorder ', ' disorder of the lung ', ' disease of the lung ', ' Respiratory System Disorder ', ' Respiratory System Disease ', ' Respiratory Disease ', ' Pulmonary Disorder ', ' Pulmonary Diseases ', ' Lung diseases ', ' Methods ', ' Theoretic Models ', ' Theoretical model ', ' mortality ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Patients ', ' Perception ', ' Play ', ' Poverty ', ' Risk ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Socioeconomic Factors ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Care Givers ', ' Caregivers ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Chronic ', ' Link ', ' Individual ', ' Policy Developments ', ' Policies ', ' tool ', ' Services ', ' hospital readmission ', ' rehospitalization ', ' readmission ', ' re-hospitalization ', ' re-admission ', ' hospital re-admission ', ' novel ', ' payment ', ' Code ', ' Coding System ', ' Sampling ', ' deprivation ', ' Address ', ' Qualitative Methods ', ' qualitative reasoning ', ' Data ', ' Update ', ' Characteristics ', ' socioeconomics ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socio-economically ', ' socio-economic ', ' cost ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' resilience ', ' Outcome ', ' Prevalence ', ' therapy design ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' public health relevance ', ' neighborhood association ', ' socioeconomic disadvantage ', ' socioeconomically underprivileged ', ' Socioeconomically disadvantaged ', ' neighborhood disadvantage ', ' disadvantaged population ', ' Affordable Care Act ', ' Obamacare ', ' readmission rates ', ' rehospitalization rate ', ' re-hospitalization rate ', ' re-admission rates ', ' hospital readmission rate ', ' hospital re-admission rates ', ' Financial Hardship ', ' financial stress ', ' financial strain ', ' financial distress ', ' financial burden ', ' ']",NIMHD,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,R01,2019,521384,0.0728301558436926
"Health Evaluation of the Neighborhoods Law Phase 2 (HENL2) Urban renewal (also referred to as regeneration or revitalization) go beyond the repair of physical and aesthetic components of the built environment to also address some of the social problems and improve human habitat while promoting sustainability. However, urban renewal programs tend to exclude health considerations and have even been accused of worsening social and physical environments by contributing to social exclusion or gentrification and promoting a greater dependence on cars, all associated with poor health conditions. Few urban renewal programs actively target health and promote health equity and while research in this area is emerging, barriers in data collection and analysis have made it difficult to study some of the long-term effects of these programs on health. The overarching goal of the Health Evaluation of the Neighborhoods Law Phase 2 (HENL2) study is: to examine the long-term effects of the Neighborhoods Law, an urban renewal program in Barcelona, Spain, on the health and health inequities of residents; compare these outcomes to previous short-term effects; and translate research findings into intervention and policy recommendations to reduce health inequities. The Neighborhoods Law (NL), one of the largest urban renewal programs in Europe, was implemented in 2004. From 2004 to 2011, 15 of 73 neighborhoods participated resulting in approximately 10% of the 1.6 million population being affected by the projects. The proposed study will use repeated cross-sectional data from the Barcelona Health Survey to examine the effects of the NL on health and health inequalities of residents living in areas intervened and those in non-intervened comparison neighborhoods. Findings from these studies will contribute to the limited evidence available on long-term effects of urban renewal programs that would help highlight the importance of public health considerations in the planning, implementation and evaluation of such programs. Furthermore, Barcelona is of special interest to cities like New York and Chicago for its `transformative remaking' of streets and is at the forefront of urban changes that are then modeled both in the United States (US) and globally. Therefore, an understanding of the impact of some of these programs on the health and wellbeing of residents is an important component of successful implementation in US cities.

"Urban Revitalization and Long-Term Effects on Diet, Economic, and Health Outcomes Project Abstract Improving access to healthful foods such as fruits, vegetables, and whole grains has been an important policy strategy, intended to improve diet and reduce obesity among vulnerable populations. In our parent grant (Does a New Supermarket Improve Dietary Behaviors of Low-income African Americans? R01CA149105), our team capitalized on a natural experiment in which a Healthy Food Financing Initiative (HFFI)-supported full-service supermarket (FSS) was opened in an underserved area. In 2011, we enrolled a cohort (N=1,372) of randomly selected households from an intervention neighborhood (that received the new FSS) and a similar comparison neighborhood and followed the cohort from prior to the FSS’s opening through one year post-opening. We found that intervention neighborhood residents had some dietary improvements – lower added sugars, calories, and saturated fats, alcohols and added sugars (SoFAAS). However, use of the new FSS, the hypothesized mediator, was not associated with dietary changes. The proposed renewal grant seeks to examine whether the socioeconomic impact that the new FSS or anticipation of it and other developments among investors, had on the neighborhood might be responsible for the dietary improvements we observed. It also taps into a new opportunity to examine the effect of much larger ongoing and impending revitalization of the intervention neighborhood on neighborhood socioeconomic conditions and diet. Addressing these research questions will help us to better understand and to replicate the dietary improvements of placing an FSS in a food desert. Results will speak to the substantial literature linking neighborhood socioeconomic conditions, diet, and weight, largely limited to cross-sectional studies. We will also examine the extent to which the dietary improvements we observed in our parent study are maintained, and the pathways by which neighborhood socioeconomic conditions may impact diet. To achieve this, we will obtain and merge secondary retrospective and prospective data concerning neighborhood socioeconomic conditions (NSEC) of the intervention and control neighborhoods with existing survey data and neighborhood audits, and collect two additional waves of survey and audit data capturing the impending major neighborhood revitalization projects that are underway or in development. Data will be analyzed using difference in difference and structural modeling approaches to test the impact of these natural experiments and the hypothesized causal pathway from neighborhood change to dietary improvement. Thus, the proposed renewal will capitalize on our existing data, cohort, and research infrastructure to address critically important follow-on questions and will be the first study, to our knowledge, to test whether SES improvements at the neighborhood and individual level are associated with improved diet and weight status. Project Narrative Improving access to healthful foods such as fruits, vegetables, and whole grains has been a highly touted policy strategy, intending to improve diet and reduce obesity among vulnerable populations. Our parent study documented some improvements in diet among residents after the opening of a full-service supermarket in a low-income, predominantly African American neighborhood in Pittsburgh, PA. However, we found no association between use of the new supermarket and the dietary improvements. Our proposed study will continue to follow the randomly selected cohort to examine whether dietary changes are maintained, and to what degree a very large additional investment in the neighborhood results in dietary improvements. It is possible that the opening of the new supermarket created a neighborhood-level shift in socioeconomic conditions and, although much literature exists around neighborhood socioeconomic status (SES) and its association with diet and weight status, we know of no studies that have linked shifts in SES to changes in diet or weight. Should neighborhood SES improvement underlie dietary improvements, neighborhood investments other than increased access to healthful food might serve the same function and should be considered.","Urban Revitalization and Long-Term Effects on Diet, Economic, and Health Outcomes",9745535,R01CA149105,"['Alcohols ', ' Alcohol Chemical Class ', ' Behavior ', ' Energy Intake ', ' caloric dietary content ', ' Caloric Intake ', ' Crime ', ' Disease Frequency Surveys ', ' Cross-Sectional Survey ', ' Cross-Sectional Analyses ', ' Cross Sectional Analysis ', ' Cross-Sectional Studies ', ' dietary ', ' Diet ', ' whole grain ', ' Dietary Fiber ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Economics ', ' Food or Food Product ', ' Food ', ' Future ', ' geographic site ', ' Geographical Location ', ' Geographic Region ', ' Geographic Area ', ' Geographic Locations ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' promoting health ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' Health Promotion ', ' Household ', ' Incentives ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Income ', ' Investments ', ' Literature ', ' Longterm Effects ', ' Long-Term Effects ', ' Structural Models ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Obesity ', ' Parents ', ' Play ', ' Poverty ', ' Research ', ' Stress ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Testing ', ' Weight ', ' Measures ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' Mediating ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' hopelessness ', ' No hope for the future ', ' Negative about the future ', ' Loss of hope for the future ', ' Feels there is no future ', ' Cannot see a future ', ' Feeling hopeless ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Link ', ' Individual ', ' sugar ', ' Policies ', ' Health Food ', ' healthy food ', ' Calories ', ' Supermarket ', ' Services ', ' saturated fat ', ' saturated lipid ', ' saturated dietary lipid ', ' saturated dietary fat ', ' cohort ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' response ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Dietary intake ', ' Low income ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Improve Access ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Process ', ' socioeconomics ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socio-economically ', ' socio-economic ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' Food Access ', ' Outcome ', ' prospective ', ' Natural experiment ', ' fruits and vegetables ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' parent grant ', ' secondary analysis ', ' ']",NCI,RAND CORPORATION,R01,2019,746010,0.08183715879133904
"Cognitive Resilience and Community Context: Examining the role of Neighborhood Built and Social Environments for Slowing the Progression of Dementia among older Americans PROJECT SUMMARY Previous research has identified multiple biological, genetic, and behavioral factors that are associated with cognitive impairment and decline. Recently, a parallel literature has looked beyond individual-level factors to consider the role of the social and built environment. Findings suggest that residence in socioeconomically advantaged neighborhoods may promote cognitive function and/or buffer cognitive decline in part through their greater density of physical resources (recreational centers, gyms, parks, walking paths, healthy food stores) as well as social and institutional resources (libraries, bookstores, community centers, social clubs) that promote physical activity and facilitate mental stimulation (e.g. social interaction) that may buffer cognitive decline with age. However, these relationships have not been empirically tested with national population-based data. This study will examine the moderating role of neighborhood built and social environments on trajectories of cognitive function in a national, racially-diverse sample of Americans followed since 2003. We will identify how features of the social and built environment are related to rates of decline in cognitive function among participants in the Reasons for Geographic and Racial Differences in Stroke (REGARDS) study. REGARDS is a national longitudinal cohort study of over 30,0000 black and white individuals age 45+ ongoing since 2003. In addition to being a longitudinal study collecting prospective data on cognitive function at annual intervals, the study also tracks residential locations through geographic coordinates that will be linked to secondary sources to characterize the surrounding social and built environment. The aims of this 4-year project are to i) characterize the built and social environment for respondents in the REGARDS study with respect to the physical and social resources that could mitigate cognitive decline; ii) use longitudinal data to examine the relationship between neighborhood resources and rates of cognitive decline over time; and iii) determine the extent to which built and social environments explain racial disparities in cognitive function. By augmenting this existing NIH-funded longitudinal cohort study with neighborhood characteristics, this study will provide a critical opportunity to examine the role of neighborhood built and social environments for preventing cognitive decline in Americans as they age.

"Limited English Proficiency, Health, and Healthcare among Older Immigrants DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Limited English proficiency (LEP) is a unique vulnerability of older immigrants that poses a significant risk to health and healthcare. Given tha social and environmental contexts play a critical role in the lives of persons with LEP, this application investigates how social connectedness and neighborhood/community characteristics (e.g., ethnic density, health service environments in the neighborhood) influence the link between LEP and health/healthcare. We used Korean American elders as the target group. Our selection was based on the fact that they are members of a rapidly expanding LEP population (i.e., Korean is ranked 4th in the languages spoken by LEP individuals in the U.S.) and that they manifest marked disparities in health and healthcare. The project aims to explore the direct and interactive roles of social connectedness and neighborhood characteristics (1) in the relation between LEP and health and (2) in the relation between LEP and healthcare. The negative impact of LEP on health/healthcare is expected to be greater when individuals lack social connections and/or when they live in areas lack ethnically oriented resources and services. The project employs an innovative and synergistic mix of Social Network Analysis (SNA) and Geographic Information Systems (GIS). To capture the heterogeneity of the population, we will use 3 sites that combine to represent a continuum of Korean American population density: New York (high), Texas (intermediate) and Florida (low). Following focus groups with Community Advisory Boards, direct assessments of ethnic communities will be conducted. At each site, a master list of ethnically oriented services (including health services) will be generated, and each identified service will be geo-coded. Subsequently, 900 Korean Americans (aged e 65, 300 at each site) will be surveyed using a probability sampling procedure. In addition to the traditional survey measures, name-generator approaches will be used to explore participants' social network members and places for healthcare. Using SNA, information from the name generators (names and addresses of people and places) will be indexed to represent (1) social connectedness and (2) engagement with health services at the community. Using GIS, the survey data will be linked to a file combining the 2010 Census and the area resource map derived from the direct community assessment. The combined file will include variables such as proportions of Koreans in the neighborhood and general as well as ethnically-oriented area health services. Multi-Level Models (MLM) will be used to explore the research questions and hypotheses. The results will not only enhance our understanding of the mechanisms underlying LEP vulnerability but also identify individual- and community-level factors (both in people and places) that could be used in health planning and interventions. The overall approach and findings will inform how to develop effective interventions to reduce language barriers and ensure access to appropriate health services for diverse LEP populations. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The application is in response to the NIA's interests in social, behavioral, cultural, and environmental context in addressing racial/ethnic health disparities, and the outcomes will inform how to effectively address health inequities. Results will enhance interventions directed at the 47 million Americans with linguistic barriers.","Limited English Proficiency, Health, and Healthcare among Older Immigrants",9836783,R01AG047106,"['Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Binding Sites ', ' Reactive Site ', ' Combining Site ', ' Service area ', ' Health Catchment Area ', ' Health Service Area ', ' Censuses ', ' Communities ', ' Elements ', ' Environment ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' Florida ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Health ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' plan health ', ' Health Planning ', ' Health Services ', ' Level of Health ', ' Health Status ', ' indexing ', ' Language ', ' Linguistic ', ' Linguistics ', ' Maps ', ' Persons ', ' Names ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' New York ', ' Play ', ' Population Density ', ' Probability Samples ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Stress ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Testing ', ' Texas ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' population diversity ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' diverse populations ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' Social Network ', ' base ', ' density ', ' Procedures ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Link ', ' Ensure ', ' Individual ', ' Immigrant ', ' Koreans ', ' Complex ', ' interest ', ' Services ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' Korean American ', ' Participant ', ' member ', ' social ', ' Code ', ' Coding System ', ' RHOA gene ', ' Rho12 ', ' RHOH12 ', ' RHOA ', ' H12 ', ' ARH12 ', ' multilevel analysis ', ' multilevel modeling ', ' multilevel model ', ' multi-level model ', ' multi-level analysis ', ' methods to study multiple-level influences ', ' Geographic Information Systems ', ' geospatial information system ', ' Pathway Analysis ', ' Network Analysis ', ' Modeling ', ' behavioral health ', ' response ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Subgroup ', ' Characteristics ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Behavioral ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' aged ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' community based participatory research ', ' participatory action research ', ' community based research ', ' community based design ', ' public health relevance ', ' effective intervention ', ' Limited English Proficiency ', ' community partnership ', ' ethnic health disparity ', ' health service use ', ' health service utilization ', ' ']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,R01,2019,262294,0.048588164574924056
"Urban Revitalization and Long-Term Effects on Diet, Economic, and Health Outcomes Project Abstract Improving access to healthful foods such as fruits, vegetables, and whole grains has been an important policy strategy, intended to improve diet and reduce obesity among vulnerable populations. In our parent grant (Does a New Supermarket Improve Dietary Behaviors of Low-income African Americans? R01CA149105), our team capitalized on a natural experiment in which a Healthy Food Financing Initiative (HFFI)-supported full-service supermarket (FSS) was opened in an underserved area. In 2011, we enrolled a cohort (N=1,372) of randomly selected households from an intervention neighborhood (that received the new FSS) and a similar comparison neighborhood and followed the cohort from prior to the FSS’s opening through one year post-opening. We found that intervention neighborhood residents had some dietary improvements – lower added sugars, calories, and saturated fats, alcohols and added sugars (SoFAAS). However, use of the new FSS, the hypothesized mediator, was not associated with dietary changes. The proposed renewal grant seeks to examine whether the socioeconomic impact that the new FSS or anticipation of it and other developments among investors, had on the neighborhood might be responsible for the dietary improvements we observed. It also taps into a new opportunity to examine the effect of much larger ongoing and impending revitalization of the intervention neighborhood on neighborhood socioeconomic conditions and diet. Addressing these research questions will help us to better understand and to replicate the dietary improvements of placing an FSS in a food desert. Results will speak to the substantial literature linking neighborhood socioeconomic conditions, diet, and weight, largely limited to cross-sectional studies. We will also examine the extent to which the dietary improvements we observed in our parent study are maintained, and the pathways by which neighborhood socioeconomic conditions may impact diet. To achieve this, we will obtain and merge secondary retrospective and prospective data concerning neighborhood socioeconomic conditions (NSEC) of the intervention and control neighborhoods with existing survey data and neighborhood audits, and collect two additional waves of survey and audit data capturing the impending major neighborhood revitalization projects that are underway or in development. Data will be analyzed using difference in difference and structural modeling approaches to test the impact of these natural experiments and the hypothesized causal pathway from neighborhood change to dietary improvement. Thus, the proposed renewal will capitalize on our existing data, cohort, and research infrastructure to address critically important follow-on questions and will be the first study, to our knowledge, to test whether SES improvements at the neighborhood and individual level are associated with improved diet and weight status. Project Narrative Improving access to healthful foods such as fruits, vegetables, and whole grains has been a highly touted policy strategy, intending to improve diet and reduce obesity among vulnerable populations. Our parent study documented some improvements in diet among residents after the opening of a full-service supermarket in a low-income, predominantly African American neighborhood in Pittsburgh, PA. However, we found no association between use of the new supermarket and the dietary improvements. Our proposed study will continue to follow the randomly selected cohort to examine whether dietary changes are maintained, and to what degree a very large additional investment in the neighborhood results in dietary improvements. It is possible that the opening of the new supermarket created a neighborhood-level shift in socioeconomic conditions and, although much literature exists around neighborhood socioeconomic status (SES) and its association with diet and weight status, we know of no studies that have linked shifts in SES to changes in diet or weight. Should neighborhood SES improvement underlie dietary improvements, neighborhood investments other than increased access to healthful food might serve the same function and should be considered.","Urban Revitalization and Long-Term Effects on Diet, Economic, and Health Outcomes",9906629,R01CA149105,"['Alcohols ', ' Alcohol Chemical Class ', ' Behavior ', ' Energy Intake ', ' caloric dietary content ', ' Caloric Intake ', ' Crime ', ' Disease Frequency Surveys ', ' Cross-Sectional Survey ', ' Cross-Sectional Analyses ', ' Cross Sectional Analysis ', ' Cross-Sectional Studies ', ' dietary ', ' Diet ', ' whole grain ', ' Dietary Fiber ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Economics ', ' Food or Food Product ', ' Food ', ' Future ', ' geographic site ', ' Geographical Location ', ' Geographic Region ', ' Geographic Area ', ' Geographic Locations ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' promoting health ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' Health Promotion ', ' Household ', ' Incentives ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Income ', ' Investments ', ' Literature ', ' Longterm Effects ', ' Long-Term Effects ', ' Structural Models ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Obesity ', ' Parents ', ' Play ', ' Poverty ', ' Research ', ' Stress ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Testing ', ' Weight ', ' Measures ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' Mediating ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' hopelessness ', ' No hope for the future ', ' Negative about the future ', ' Loss of hope for the future ', ' Feels there is no future ', ' Cannot see a future ', ' Feeling hopeless ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Link ', ' Individual ', ' sugar ', ' Policies ', ' Health Food ', ' healthy food ', ' Calories ', ' Supermarket ', ' Services ', ' saturated fat ', ' saturated lipid ', ' saturated dietary lipid ', ' saturated dietary fat ', ' cohort ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' response ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Dietary intake ', ' Low income ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Improve Access ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Process ', ' socioeconomics ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socio-economically ', ' socio-economic ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' Food Access ', ' Outcome ', ' prospective ', ' Natural experiment ', ' fruits and vegetables ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' parent grant ', ' secondary analysis ', ' ']",NCI,RAND CORPORATION,R01,2019,248165,0.08183715879133904

"Impact of Social Cohesion and Social Capital in PrEP Uptake and Adherence Among Transwomen of Color PROJECT SUMMARY This project seeks to use real-time geospatial methods to investigate relationships between social cohesion and social capital within Global Positioning System (GPS)-defined activity space neighborhoods and social networks in relation to HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) uptake and adherence cross-sectionally and longitudinally among transgender women (TW) of color (TWOC) in the New York City metropolitan statistical area (MSA) followed over two years. We will recruit 250 TWOC in the proposed The N2 Study: Transgender Women's Neighborhood and Networks Cohort Study to address the aims of the research. Eligibility requirements include: identifying as a transgender woman (individuals who were assigned a male sex at birth who identify as women, female, trans women, trans female, male-to-female or another diverse trans feminine gender identity on the spectrum) of color; HIV-seronegative; being 18 to 55 years old; residing in the New York City MSA; self-report no plans to move outside of the New York City metropolitan area in the next two years; self-reporting no restrictions to usual physical activity; and self-report willingness to carry a small GPS device for two-weeks at five points over the course of two years. Participants will wear the GPS device following protocols used in our previous feasibility research projects, including studies among TW. In this longitudinal study, six months after completing the initial 2-week GPS protocol, participants will carry the GPS device for an additional 2-weeks every six-months over the two-year study period—for a total of five times. Multiple GPS measures and multiple measures of social networks (at different time points) can better capture the breadth of people's exposure to neighborhood-level factors and dynamics in social networks. Also, GPS activity space environment and social networks data at baseline could potentially influence PrEP outcomes over time, providing a clear temporal ordering and an ability to consider potential time-lags. The proposed study will be the largest GPS study of HIV disparities in any transgender population and presents a remarkable opportunity to study environmental influences on HIV. Findings from the proposed research will impact HIV prevention intervention activities. First, the project will inform specific neighborhood-level policy interventions. For example, increased community efforts through increased social cohesion in neighborhoods may be an HIV prevention intervention that can reduce HIV health disparities. Second, from the GPS dataset we will know the travel patterns of TW and therefore be able to identify optimal geographic locations for HIV prevention interventions. This will advance the literature given that such interventions are seldom geographically targeted. Third, examining changes in spatial mobility (i.e. activity spaces) over time will be useful in knowing whether the risks of particular spaces change or remain constant because different neighborhoods will have different risk profiles. Finally, our dynamic network analysis we propose will deepen understanding of the effects of social networks on HIV prevention behaviors and will improve network-based HIV prevention interventions.

"Social Environmental Factors, DNA methylation of inflammation genes and Breast Cancer Survivorship among African American Women Cancer disparities might result from biologic, behavioral, and social environmental factors. This Career Development Proposal (CDP) will enable attainment of Dr. Jesse Plascak's long-term goal of becoming an NIH- funded independent investigator studying relationships between the social environment, biologic factors, and cancer disparities. The applicant's previous training includes social and spatial epidemiology of cancer disparities. Dr. Plascak has investigated relationships between neighborhood segregation (racial-ethnic and socioeconomic), social cohesion (positive relationships within neighborhoods), neighborhood disorder (physical deterioration or lack of social control), discrimination, and cancer outcomes. Attaining a trans-disciplinary and independent cancer disparities research program will require the following additional training and mentors: (1) cancer molecular biology – genetics and epigenetics (Drs. Kitaw Demissie and Helmut Zarbl), (2) counterfactual- based causal inference (Drs. Zhiqiang Tan and Mario Schootman), (3) African American (AA) breast cancer (BrCa) epidemiology (Dr. Elisa Bandera), and (4) systematic social observation (SSO) of the social environment (Drs. Andrew Rundle and Mario Schootman). Dr. Plascak will apply this mentored training to address a series of research questions using the longitudinal Women's Circle of Health Follow-up Study (WCHS-L) (R01CA185623) – an ongoing study enrolling 1,700 AA BrCa survivors with comprehensive questionnaire data including perceived neighborhood social cohesion, perceived neighborhood disorder, medical records, cancer registry records, and blood samples. DNA methylation (DNAm) of inflammation-related genes will be quantified from blood samples. SSO will be conducted to create objective measures of neighborhood disorder of each WCHS- L participant's residence. Residential segregation measures will be calculated from a dataset representative of the spatial distribution and sociodemographic composition of study area households. Causal inference methods will be used to test relationships between social environmental factors, DNAm, and BrCa survival. The research aims are to assess: (1) participants' objective neighborhood disorder using SSO and investigate correlations between social environmental factors (residential segregation, perceived and objective neighborhood disorder, social cohesion), (2) associations between social environmental factors and BrCa survival, and (3) whether aberrant DNAm and altered expression of inflammation-related genes mediate the association between environmental factors and BrCa survival. Training and research activities have been tailored to the Rutgers University exceptional research environment: The Cancer Institute of New Jersey (NCI Comprehensive Cancer Center housing a SEER registry) and Center for Environmental Exposures and Disease (NIEHS P30 center). Preliminary findings will form the basis of a R01 grant proposal. Completion of the activities outlined in this CDP will allow Dr. Plascak to become an independent, transdisciplinary investigator of cancer disparities; contributing to improvements in population health through the prevention and control of cancer and cancer disparities. This projects ultimately seeks to improve public health by identifying novel social and biologic factors that can be targeted to prevent or treat female breast cancer mortality. Social environmental factors such as residential segregation and neighborhood disorder can be prevented through public health-relevant policy. Epigenetic alteration of inflammation genes can be therapeutically targeted to potentially lengthen survival times following diagnosis with breast cancer.","Social Environmental Factors, DNA

"Social Disparities in NICU Care ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Racial/ethnic disparities in the quality of care provided in neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) to very low- birth-weight (VLBW; 1500g) result directly in avoidable death and morbidity. National health policy recommendations underscore that a comprehensive understanding of the multi-level factors that influence NICU quality, including mother and infant clinical, hospital, sociodemographic, and neighborhood factors, is needed to re- duce disparities. To date, research examining disparities of NICU quality suffers from considerable limitations. First, sociodemographic and neighborhood factors are rarely available for studies of NICU quality so their in- dependent and joint contributions are not well understood. Second, a lack of multi-level adjustment under- mines the validity of comparative assessments of quality by penalizing NICUs that care for vulnerable populations. Third, studies of neighborhood factors have narrowly focused on mortality, yet the majority of infants survive their birth hospitalization. To address these limitations and significantly advance the understanding of disparities in NICU quality, we will undertake a comprehensive appraisal of the multi-level factors associated with NICU quality; promote fairer comparisons by making sociodemographic and neighborhood influences explicit; and assess key areas of quality beyond mortality, including processes and outcomes of care that modulate long-term neu- rodevelopmental outcomes. Innovative methods include leveraging our vanguard efforts in developing and linking unique multi-level data sources to provide comprehensive assessments of NICU quality with unprecedented granularity, assessing NICU quality via key individual and composite measures, and using a mixed-methods approach to pro- vide unique insights into the mechanisms by which sociodemographic and neighborhood factors optimize or degrade NICU quality. This study is designed to achieve 3 specific aims: 1) Test the association of multi-level risk factors with NICU quality, 2) Evaluate the effect of multi-level risk adjustment on comparative ratings of NICU quality; and 3) Understand the drivers of disparities in NICU quality. An exceptional strength of our proposal is our ability to leverage the unique infrastructure of the California Per- inatal Quality Care Collaborative and its national counterpar the Vermont Oxford Network. Building on our pri- or work in linking complimentary high-quality clinical, administrative, and survey-based data sets containing multi-level factors, we will study  large population-scale sample of >30,000 VLBW infants in >130 NICUs in California between 2008-16. Results of this proposal are expected to have an immediate positive impact be- because they are designed to identify pragmatic areas where NICUs and communities can improve.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Unequal treatment may contribute to the differences in outcomes of vulnerable premature babies born to minorities or the poor. However, the links between social factors and the quality of medical care provided to premature babies are not well understood. We propose to address this gap, which will make an important contribution to the elimination of disparities.        ",Social Disparities in NICU Care,9627721,R01HD084667,"['Birth ', ' Parturition ', ' California ', ' Communities ', ' Data Sources ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Discrimination ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' Future ', ' Fetal Age ', ' Chronologic Fetal Maturity ', ' Gestational Age ', ' Hospital Admission ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Hospitals ', ' Infant ', ' preterm neonate ', ' preterm infant human ', ' preterm infant ', ' preterm baby ', ' premature infant human ', ' premature baby ', ' infants born prematurely ', ' infants born premature ', ' Premature Infant ', ' Infection ', ' Intensive Care Units ', ' neonatal ICU ', ' Newborn Intensive Care Units ', ' Neonatal Intensive Care Units ', ' Interview ', ' Joints ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' hospital stay ', ' hospital length of stay ', ' hospital days ', ' Number of Days in Hospital ', ' Length of Stay ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' mortality ', ' Mothers ', ' National Health Policy ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' nursing personnel ', ' Nursing Staff ', ' Parents ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' retinopathy ', ' retina disorder ', ' retina disease ', ' Retinal Disorder ', ' Retinal Diseases ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' socioenvironment ', ' social context ', ' social climate ', ' Social Environment ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Testing ', ' Translations ', ' United States ', ' Vermont ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Research Methods ', ' Research Methodology ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' Perinatal ', ' Peripartum ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' Link ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' intraventricular hemorrhage ', ' Policies ', ' Measurement ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Very Low Birth Weight Infant ', ' very low birth weight ', ' VLBW ', ' high risk infant ', ' vulnerable infant ', ' Necrotizing Enterocolitis ', ' Visit ', ' Performance ', ' care seeking ', ' Risk Adjustment ', ' social ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' Chronic lung disease ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Quality of Care ', ' QOC ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Provider ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Epidemiologist ', ' Process ', ' sex ', ' follow-up ', ' followup ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' active followup ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' social disparities ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' comparative ', ' collaborative care ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' public health relevance ', ' primary outcome ', ' built environment ', ' disparity reduction ', ' reduce disparity ', ' care outcomes ', ' healthcare outcomes ', ' health care outcomes ', ' Infrastructure ', ' sociodemographics ', ' socio-demographics ', ' ']",NICHD,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,598352,0.08552930341974542
"Impact of Park Renovations on Physical Activity and Community Health in NYC ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The built environment plays a critical role in promoting physical activity and health. The association between parks, as a key attribute of the built environment, and physical activity, however, remains inconclusive. This project employs a natural experiment design to assess the impact of the Community Parks Initiative (CPI), a New York City Department of Parks and Recreation (NYC Parks) park redesign and renovation initiative, on physical activity, park usage, psychosocial and mental health, and community wellbeing. The project will use a longitudinal design with matched controls. NYC Parks has identified 134 parks with extreme capital needs in high-priority neighborhoods and will begin renovating parks in waves. In late 2016, the first wave of 35 parks across 55 neighborhoods will close for renovations; these parks will reopen in late 2017. From this initial wave, 20 interventio parks have been selected for inclusion in this study. Intervention park neighborhoods have been matched to a control group of 20 socio-economically similar park neighborhoods that will not be renovated during the study. The study will address two aims. In Aim 1, investigators will compare total volume of PA and other health outcomes among residents in the intervention vs. control park neighborhoods (defined as .25 mile radius around each park) from baseline to 2.5 years post-renovation. We hypothesize that improvements will be observed in PA and health levels in intervention but not control neighborhoods. In Aim 2, an additional 10 park neighborhoods receiving renovation in 2018 and reopening in 2019 will be used to monitor replicability of intervention effects at 1.5 years post-renovation. This combined design enhances our ability to infer causality in a natural experiment. We aim to recruit and retain 40 study participants per park neighborhood, after attrition, for a total of 1600 participants in Aim 1 and 400 in Aim 2. Study participants will represent two distinct sociodemographic strata in each neighborhood: low-income housing and community- engaged residents. Measures include direct park observations and program checklists, park quality, self- reported and GPS-tracked park usage, accelerometry-based physical activity, self-reported psychosocial health, and perceived community wellbeing. The largest natural experiment of its kind to date, this study represents a rare opportunity to provide robust evidence to further our understanding of the complex relationship between parks and physical activity, psychosocial and mental health, and community wellbeing. The findings will inform future investments in health-oriented urban design policies and offer evidence for addressing health disparities through built environment strategies. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    The project will evaluate the long-term effects of a citywide public park redesign and renovation initiative on residents' physical activity, psychosocial and mental health, and community wellbeing.

"Impact of the Built Environment on Child Body Mass Index Project Summary The last several years have witnessed growing interest in the potential contribution of the “built environment” to the epidemic increase in obesity rates in the United States. This includes both the large structural aspects of the neighborhood and physical characteristics of homes and schools at the very micro level (the interiors and associated grounds of these buildings). The structural aspects of the neighborhood that surround the home and school includes urban design features such as streets and highways, land use mix, street connectivity, public transportation infrastructure (i.e., subway stations), park land, and recreational infrastructure, all of which could affect both physical activity and the accessibility of food and other resources. The physical characteristics of the home or school—including building size, the presence of elevators, stairs, spaces for physical activity, and related factors—could determine opportunities for physical activity and amount of activity needed to navigate the space. Thus far not established is how each of these factors contributes to childhood BMI in a distinct and interconnected way and/or how changes in such factors could influence obesity rates in a causal manner. This gap in knowledge is particularly troubling given the high cost of changing the built environment as well as the longevity of investments once made. Our research promises to provide insight critical to policymakers planning urban infrastructure investment. Particularly important to consider are disparities, and whether differences in the built environment could explain differences in obesity rates in key demographic groups, including income and race/ethnicity. We propose to combine New York City Department of Education FITNESSGRAM data, which includes BMI, school and residential locations, for all New York City public school children from 2005 onward, with detailed data on the built environment surrounding each child’s home and school as well as within their home and school. Then, we will use a variety of enhanced methodological techniques to estimate a less-biased, more causal relationship between the built environment and obesity. The methodological enhancements we utilize over past work are:  • A large, detailed dataset, including data on over 1 million NYC public school children.  • Examining longitudinally the same children over time, using both child, school and census tract level  fixed effects, among other methods, to determine casualty.  • Examining fine-grained differences in the built environment. For example, the relative influence of  living within 500 feet of a park or other built environment resources  • Data on both the home and school built environment, both inside the building and in the  neighborhood, modeled together. With these enhancements, we will be able to provide improved estimates on the influence of the built environment on child BMI, substantially answering key health and policy-related questions.

"Preventing Substance Use in the Context of Poverty: Risk and Protection from Early Childhood to Early Adulthood Project Summary One of the most debilitating and pervasive high-risk ecologies children encounter in American society is poverty and its many correlates, such as compromised parenting, deprived neighborhoods and schools, deviant peer clustering, and poor nutrition and medical care. Despite the greater risk of a host of maladaptive outcomes associated with poverty, few studies have prospectively examined young adult adjustment for children born into poverty beginning at age 2. Even fewer longitudinal trials initiated in early childhood have examined the impact of a brief and repeated family intervention in preventing alcohol and drug use disorder (ADUD). The Early Steps Multisite (ESM) prevention trial was specifically designed to address the needs of children and families living in poverty, often marked by compromised parenting and parent well-being. Initiated at child age 2 and follow-ups at nine ages through age 16, the ESM sample was recruited from WIC centers in three geographically, socioeconomically, and ethnically diverse communities: Pittsburgh, PA; Charlottesville, VA; and Eugene, OR. To increase the number of sample families at risk for later ADUD, eligibility was restricted to WIC families with additional socioeconomic, family, and child risk factors. Families were randomly assigned to be offered a yearly FCU intervention, including adapted and tailored family management interventions. The children and families were initially assessed at child age 2 and then yearly through age 10.5, using a multi-agent and multi-method strategy that included direct observations of family interaction in most years, and subsequently followed at ages 14 and 16. In the current application, we are proposing to continue following this multiethnic sample (N=731) of youth who are transitioning to adulthood, at ages 19 and 21. With genotyping on an extensive contemporary array, prospective data on neighborhood risk and racial/ethnic disparities, we propose to examine direct, interactive, and cascading effects of child, genetic, family, peer, and neighborhood factors on ADUD and related outcomes; lasting effects of the Family Check-Up on ADUD and related problem and prosocial behavior; and moderating effects of the Family Check- Up’s effectiveness.

"Creating Community Driven, Personalized Health Maps for Patients with Diabetes Project Abstract/Summary: This NLM R01 proposal aims to develop and test a personal health library platform for patients with diabetes and prediabetes, harnessing both personal health and healthcare data (e.g., medication lists, upcoming appointments, self-tracking of diet and blood sugars) and location-based mapped data about neighborhood health resources (e.g., community reviews about the quality of grocery stores and parks). Diabetes and prediabetes patients have substantial needs for tracking and accessing health and healthcare information that are poorly met by existing platforms that largely operate in silos. Furthermore, existing digital health tools have not utilized participatory design approaches and have low uptake among specific subgroups, such as racial/ethnic minority and lower income populations. In this project, we will use design science to create and evaluate a new personal health library platform to strengthen and improve the ways in which low income individuals and communities of color access and interact with personal health data that better reflect their needs and interests. Specifically, we propose to create a new platform that enables patients with diabetes or prediabetes to import their personal health data to a mapping platform, in order to have access to store and view both private and public views of health- promoting and health-inhibiting community factors in their own neighborhood. This new platform will be titled: “Mapping to Amplify the Vitality of Engaged Neighborhoods,” or MAVEN. In Aim 1, we will use inductive observational methods to follow community leaders/health advocates and patients with either diabetes or prediabetes to understand existing health and healthcare journeys and map existing resources in their neighborhoods. We will recruit patients and community-based organization leaders from 3 San Francisco neighborhoods with the highest prevalence of diabetes and pre-diabetes, which also correspond with existing San Francisco Health Network clinics in our healthcare system. In Aim 2, we will recruit a second sample of individuals to complete user-centered design methods (e.g., card-sorting and thinkaloud interviews) to prioritize and test prototypes of data elements within the new MAVEN personal health library platform. In Aim 3, we will conduct real-world usability testing of a functional version of the MAVEN platform to explore its acceptability and usability in everyday life. Because we will engage racially/ethnically and socioeconomically diverse patients in this project, we will ensure that the MAVEN personal health library platform is relevant for patients with varying levels of health literacy and technology proficiency. In addition, because we will engage community health advocates and public healthcare system leaders, our findings will have more direct implications for implementation and dissemination. Project Narrative: This goal of this study is to develop and evaluate an online platform that patients with diabetes or prediabetes can use to combine important information relevant to their health and healthcare – such as medical information, personal data on diet or blood sugar levels, and community data on health resources in their neighborhood. We will first design the platform with community member and community health advocate input, and then we will test the platform to see how individuals use it in everyday life. We will recruit racially/ethnically and socioeconomically diverse individuals in this study to ensure that the final product is relevant for the broader public, even those without extensive experience using technology.","Creating Community Driven, Personalized Health Maps for Patients with Diabetes",9776611,R01LM013045,"['Appointment ', ' Behavior ', ' Blood Glucose ', ' Blood Sugar ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Cities ', ' Color ', ' Communities ', ' health services delivery ', ' Healthcare Delivery ', ' health care delivery ', ' diabetes ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' dietary ', ' Diet ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Exercise ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' Food or Food Product ', ' Food ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' promoting health ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' Health Promotion ', ' Personal Health Records ', ' Health Resources ', ' Level of Health ', ' Health Status ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Interview ', ' Libraries ', ' Lifestyle ', ' Life Style ', ' Low Income Population ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' nutrition ', ' Patients ', ' Pharmacies ', ' Pharmacy facility ', ' Privatization ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' San Francisco ', ' Science ', ' Sleep ', ' Social Service ', ' Social Work ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Technology ', ' Phone ', ' Telephone ', ' Testing ', ' Businesses ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Ethnography ', ' ethnographic ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Phase ', ' Medical ', ' Ensure ', ' Evaluation ', ' Physical activity ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Patient Recruitments ', ' participant recruitment ', ' uptake ', ' Collaborations ', ' tool ', ' Prediabetes syndrome ', ' prediabetic ', ' pre-diabetic ', ' pre-diabetes ', ' Prediabetic State ', ' Prediabetes ', ' Patient Preferences ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Disease Management ', ' Disorder Management ', ' Complex ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' Clinic ', ' System ', ' Location ', ' Country ', ' Test Result ', ' interest ', ' Visit ', ' experience ', ' medical appointment ', ' peer ', ' member ', ' Sorting - Cell Movement ', ' sorting ', ' Health Technology ', ' Healthcare Technology ', ' Health Care Technology ', ' Sampling ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Low income ', ' Advocate ', ' Data ', ' Data Element ', ' High Prevalence ', ' Subgroup ', ' Process ', ' follow-up ', ' followup ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' active followup ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' Community Health ', ' socioeconomics ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socio-economically ', ' socio-economic ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' electronic health care record ', ' Output ', ' health literacy ', ' digital ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' Health behavior change ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' user centered design ', ' usability ', ' prototype ', ' data sharing ', ' flexibility ', ' flexible ', ' health data ', ' data visualization ', ' ethnic diversity ', ' ethnically diverse ', ' Healthy Eating ', ' recruit ', ' ']",NLM,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R01,2019,314636,0.06381823869997026
"Impact of ecological park restoration on health in low income neighborhoods: A natural experiment Summary Individuals living in socioeconomically deprived inner cities have disproportionately high rates of cardiovascular disease, cancers, Type 2 diabetes and obesity, which have stress- and physical activity-related etiologies. Previous research on the urban built environment suggests that parks may reduce stress and increase physical activity. Yet, the causal health relationships have been difficult to establish due to reliance on cross-sectional designs, coarse exposure assessment, limited health effects data and neglect of negative aspects of green space (e.g., litter, noise). This study will capitalize on an upcoming natural experiment in five low-income neighborhoods in Detroit, MI involving the ecological restoration of unmaintained parks to grassland meadows. Five control park neighborhoods were matched on demographic and built characteristics. This longitudinal study will include participants (n=590 after attrition) from ten intervention/control park neighborhoods with baseline measurement then annual measurement for three years post- restoration. Our study will be the first natural experiment to examine the impact of ecological restoration with individual-level measurement of visual/auditory exposure (e.g., greenery, birdsong) to green space on health. We will go beyond the usual objective measure of physical activity (GPS/accelerometer) in park studies to include a validated stress biomarker (salivary cortisol) and cardio-metabolic indicators (BMI, blood pressure, hip-to-waist ratio, C-reactive protein and A1C). The question to be answered is: Does ecological restoration of abandoned parks into grassland meadows and bird habitats increase nearby resident’s physical activity, lower their stress, and improve their cardio-metabolic health? We propose three aims. Aim 1: Establish the effect of ecological restoration of parks on physical activity from baseline through 3-years post-restoration, using a non-randomized design. Aim 2: Illuminate the stress reduction potential of restored parks. Aim 3: Evaluate the effect of ecological restoration on downstream cardio-metabolic health outcomes. Understanding the role of ecological restoration on health will provide the unique opportunity to inform replication, scalability and generalizability for cities managing park resources in low-income neighborhoods. Our findings will be vital in the development of policies needed to mitigate pervasive socioeconomic disparities in obesity, Type 2 diabetes, cancer, and cardio-metabolic health. Project narrative Using a natural experiment, this project will evaluate the effects of ecological restoration of unmaintained Detroit city parks on physical activity, stress and cardio-metabolic health employing a non-randomized design. Our findings will inform built environment planning and policies designed to mitigate pervasive socioeconomic disparities in obesity, cancer and cardio- metabolic health.",Impact of ecological park restoration on health in low income neighborhoods: A natural experiment,9740713,R01CA239187,"['Affect ', ' Anxiety ', ' Birds ', ' Avian ', ' Aves ', ' Blood Pressure ', ' C-reactive protein ', ' Proteins, specific or class, C-reactive ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cities ', ' City Planning ', ' development policy ', ' type two diabetes ', ' type II DM ', ' type 2 DM ', ' maturity onset diabetes ', ' ketosis resistant diabetes ', ' adult onset diabetes ', ' Type II diabetes ', ' Type II Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Type 2 diabetes ', ' Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus ', ' T2DM ', ' T2D ', ' T2 DM ', ' Stable Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Slow-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Noninsulin Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Noninsulin Dependent Diabetes ', ' Non-Insulin Dependent Diabetes ', ' NIDDM ', ' Maturity-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Ketosis-Resistant Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Adult-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Exercise ', ' Grasses ', ' Gramineae ', ' Poaceae ', ' Health ', ' Proctocort ', ' Nutracort ', ' Hytone ', ' Hydrocortone ', ' Eldecort ', ' Dermacort ', ' Cortril ', ' Cortispray ', ' Cortisol ', ' Cortenema ', ' Cortef ', ' Cort-Dome ', ' Cetacort ', ' Aeroseb-HC ', ' Hydrocortisone ', ' indexing ', ' Industrialization ', ' longterm study ', ' long-term study ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' Michigan ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Noise ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Obesity ', ' Plants ', ' Recreation ', ' Research ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Stress ', ' Taxes ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' unemployed ', ' out of work ', ' joblessness ', ' jobless ', ' Unemployment ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' Health Benefit ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Waist-Hip Ratio ', ' waist-to-hip ratio ', ' Ensure ', ' Physical activity ', ' Visual ', ' Individual ', ' Policies ', ' Measurement ', ' Environmental Impact ', ' Ecological impact ', ' Auditory ', ' Salivary ', ' Techniques ', ' restoration ', ' inner city ', ' Participant ', ' Sampling ', ' Habitats ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' disease causation ', ' causation ', ' Causality ', ' Etiology ', ' Low income ', ' Consent ', ' Data ', ' Characteristics ', ' socioeconomics ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socio-economically ', ' socio-economic ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' neglect ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Grasslands ', ' cancer type ', ' Natural experiment ', ' bird song ', ' birdsong ', ' Biological Markers ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' socioeconomic disparity ', ' built environment ', ' blood pressure reduction ', ' reduction in blood pressure ', ' reduction in BP ', ' reduce blood pressure ', ' reduce BP ', ' lowers blood pressure ', ' lower blood pressure ', ' lower BP ', ' BP reduction ', ' Green space ', ' greenspace ', ' Accelerometer ', ' activity tracker ', ' activity monitor ', ' accelerometry ', ' recruit ', ' stress reduction ', ' cardiometabolism ', ' cardiometabolic ', ' perceived stress ', ' ']",NCI,MICHIGAN STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,636112,0.04996921481227205
"The Relations Between Neighborhood and Family Factors in the Healthy Development of African American Youth ABSTRACT Understanding the adoption of early healthy coping patterns in children and young adolescents who live in violent contexts can reveal strengths that are vital in both families and individuals who reside in neighborhoods characterized by high crime, poverty, racial segregation and family stress. Research has shown that youth who consistently experience and witness community violence in their neighborhoods are at increased risk for psychological issues such as PTSD, depression, and anxiety. Scholars have indicated that for African American populations, subjective measures such as reports of neighborhood stress are associated with more psychological distress, while youth perceptions of neighborhood cohesion are related to lower levels of psychological stress. Coming home to a family who is aware of and discussing explicitly coping measures to be taken in such contexts allows youth to develop resilience that gives them the tools necessary to look beyond their environment to a different future. One such tool is racial-ethnic socialization (RES), defined as the transmission of attitudes, beliefs and values surrounding race/ethnicity. The focus of this proposed project is to understand how neighborhood factors are related to race-related socialization and healthy development of African American children. The proposed project will collect data from a sample of 100 African American children ages 8-15 and their parents within the first two years of the study to explore how subjective and objective characteristics of neighborhoods is associated with mental health outcomes. Additionally, we seek to understand if RES moderates the effects of neighborhood factors on mental health outcomes. We will be using the collected data to examine each of our aims. Aim 1 identifies objective and subjective neighborhood profiles that serve as a basis for understanding how these profiles link to mental health outcomes for youth (Aim 2). Finally, Aim 3 examines how neighborhood profiles and mental health outcomes can be mitigated by ERS, providing evidence-based data for future interventions in racial-ethnic socialization. The Relation Between Neighborhood and Family Factors in the Healthy Development of  African American Youth Project Narrative The proposed research examines how subjective and objective measures of neighborhoods are related to the healthy development of African Americans. The study also examines how racial/ethnic socialization is associated neighborhood impact on mental health outcomes.

"A Social Epigenomic Approach to Health Disparities in Cardiovascular Risk Factors A SOCIAL EPIGENOMIC APPROACH TO HEALTH DISPARITIES IN CARDIOVASCULAR RISK FACTORS Individual-level socioeconomic factors such as education, income/wealth, and occupation have long been known to profoundly affect risk for cardiovascular diseases, and these effects accumulate across the life course to create systematic disadvantage that manifests in a wide range of health disparities. In addition, there is now increasing evidence that neighborhood-level disadvantage also negatively impacts cardiovascular health, both cross-sectionally and longitudinally, even after accounting for individual-level socioeconomic factors. One mechanism by which individual-level and neighborhood-level disadvantage may influence cardiovascular health is through epigenomic modifications of genes regulating adaptive cellular pathways (e.g. inflammation and immune response). To better understand the biological mechanisms underlying health disparities in cardiovascular disease, we propose to investigate the impact of individual and neighborhood disadvantage on the epigenome. We will conduct the discovery work in two epidemiologic studies – the Multi- Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA, N=1,264) and the Genetic Epidemiology Network of Arteriopathy (GENOA, N=1,728) – and replicate our results in other cohorts with similar measures, including the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities study (ARIC, N=3,911) and the Health and Retirement Study (HRS, N=2,000). This multi-cohort strategy increases scientific rigor by reducing false positives while improving our higher-dimensional understanding of the social epigenomic architecture underlying cardiovascular disease. To facilitate this multi-cohort approach, we will begin by harmonizing the measures of individual and neighborhood disadvantage (Aim 1) to enable us to identify and replicate DNA methylation (DNAm) sites that are associated with these measures of disadvantage (Aim 2) and then evaluate whether the DNAm sites are mediators of the well-established relationships between disadvantage and cardiovascular risk factors (Aim 3). Finally, we will perform pathway analysis to characterize the key biological pathways implicated by the DNAm sites identified in the previous Aims, and investigate their association with gene expression in MESA and GENOA (Aim 4). Narrative: In this project, we will use state-of-the-art methods to identify how socioeconomic factors and neighborhood conditions impact the epigenome, leading to disparities in cardiovascular risk factors such as hypertension, diabetes, and obesity. .",A Social Epigenomic Approach to Health Disparities in Cardiovascular Risk Factors,9674533,R01HL141292,"['Accounting ', ' Affect ', ' Aging ', ' Architecture ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Blood Pressure ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' diabetes ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' type two diabetes ', ' type II DM ', ' type 2 DM ', ' maturity onset diabetes ', ' ketosis resistant diabetes ', ' adult onset diabetes ', ' Type II diabetes ', ' Type II Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Type 2 diabetes ', ' Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus ', ' T2DM ', ' T2D ', ' T2 DM ', ' Stable Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Slow-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Noninsulin Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Noninsulin Dependent Diabetes ', ' Non-Insulin Dependent Diabetes ', ' NIDDM ', ' Maturity-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Ketosis-Resistant Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Adult-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Genes ', ' Genome ', ' Heart ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' high blood pressure ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Hypertension ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Income ', ' Inflammation ', ' Regular Insulin ', ' Novolin R ', ' Humulin R ', ' Insulin ', ' life course ', ' Life Cycle ', ' Life Cycle Stages ', ' Lipids ', ' Methods ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Obesity ', ' Professional Positions ', ' Jobs ', ' Occupations ', ' genetic promoter element ', ' Promotor Regions ', ' Promoter Regions ', ' Research ', ' Risk Factors ', ' socioenvironment ', ' social context ', ' social climate ', ' Social Environment ', ' Socioeconomic Factors ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Mediating ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Biological ', ' Individual ', ' Measurement ', ' Arterial Disorder ', ' Arteriopathy ', ' CpG Islands ', ' CpG-Rich Islands ', ' Immune response ', ' immunoresponse ', ' host response ', ' Immunological response ', ' DNA Methylation ', ' Diastolic blood pressure ', ' Diastolic Pressure ', ' waist circumference ', ' Physical environment ', ' cohort ', ' Mediation ', ' Negotiation ', ' Negotiating ', ' epidemiology study ', ' epidemiologic investigation ', ' Epidemiology Research ', ' Epidemiological Studies ', ' Epidemiologic Studies ', ' Epidemiologic Research ', ' social ', ' cardiovascular risk factor ', ' cardiovascular risk ', ' Pathway Analysis ', ' Network Analysis ', ' genetic epidemiology ', ' genetic epidemiologic study ', ' cardiovascular disorder risk ', ' cardiovascular disease risk ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Quetelet index ', ' BMI z-score ', ' BMI percentile ', ' Body mass index ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Regulatory Element ', ' Epigenetic Process ', ' Epigenetic Mechanism ', ' Epigenetic Change ', ' Epigenetic ', ' Gene-Modified ', ' gene modification ', ' Characteristics ', ' socioeconomics ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socio-economically ', ' socio-economic ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' epigenomics ', ' obesity risk ', ' risk of obesity ', ' risk for obesity ', ' inflammatory marker ', ' inflammation marker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' fasting glucose ', ' epigenome ', ' methylation biomarker ', ' methylation marker ', ' cardiovascular health ', ' epigenome-wide association studies ', ' epigenome wide association analysis ', ' EWAS ', ' neighborhood disadvantage ', ' Health and Retirement Study ', ' genomic epidemiology ', ' high dimensionality ', ' Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis ', ' Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities ', ' ']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2019,733235,0.042314844329351994
"Using Geographically Targeted and Community-Based Methods to Identify Factors Associated with Micro-Level Disparities in Diabetic Outcomes and Enhance Monitoring of Glycemic Control Among Black Men Project Summary / Abstract  This mentored patient-oriented research career development award (K23) will support Dr. David Lee’s training and research to use geographically targeted and community-based methods to identify factors associated with micro-level disparities in diabetic outcomes and enhance monitoring of glycemic control among Black men. Though the prevalence of diabetes is increasing nationally, current diabetes surveillance methods are unable to identify hot spots of poor diabetic outcomes at a community level. However, studies based on a novel geographic method of diabetes surveillance have found that the increase in diabetes burden has been focused in specific communities, especially among Black neighborhoods. For Black adults, poor diabetes control has been associated with fewer primary care visits, less frequent HbA1c testing, and higher rates of emergency department use and hospitalizations, especially among diabetic Black men. Given this infrequent interaction with a usual source of healthcare, community-based settings may provide the advantages of pre- existing trust and engagement to optimize health outcomes for high-risk populations living in neighborhoods that are hot spots of diabetic complications. Thus, the specific aims of this proposal are 1) to use geospatial and quantitative methods to identify which micro-contextual factors account for local disparities in diabetic outcomes among Black communities, 2) to use geographically-targeted qualitative interviews to identify neighborhood-level factors that explain poor diabetic outcomes in certain Black communities, and 3) to perform community-based HbA1c testing and diabetes self-care surveys among Black men living in neighborhoods with a high prevalence of diabetic complications. This community-based research will leverage existing partnerships within a network of local Black-owned barbershops in New York City. Barbershops have become increasingly effective sites for promoting health and measuring health outcomes among Black men, a population which has high rates of mortality and morbidity from diabetes. The results of this research will inform future R-series applications to expand this approach to other high-risk subgroups in Black neighborhoods and other racial and ethnic communities with extremely poor diabetic outcomes. Dr. Lee’s training goals closely parallel his research aims and will further enhance his understanding of: 1) advanced quantitative analysis, 2) qualitative and mixed methods, 3) social and behavioral science, and 4) diabetes education and management. The proposed research and training will be conducted at the New York University School of Medicine and leverage resources of the other professional schools at NYU, which offer outstanding opportunities for collaboration, learning, and multidisciplinary research. This environment, in addition to his research and training plan will provide Dr. Lee with a strong foundation from which he can accelerate his career towards his goal of becoming a fully independent clinical investigator dedicated to reducing disparities in diabetes burden and improving health outcomes in communities that are overwhelmed by diabetic complications. PROJECT NARRATIVE  The overall burden of diabetes is increasing nationally, but specific neighborhoods, especially in Black communities, have experienced a disproportionately higher prevalence of diabetes and its complications such as kidney failure and lower extremity amputations. The goal of the proposed research is to use a mix of quantitative and qualitative methods to identify the micro-contextual factors that account for local disparities in diabetic outcomes among Black communities with a high versus low prevalence of diabetic complications and to enhance the monitoring of glycemic control in neighborhoods with especially poor diabetic outcomes. This K23 career development award will foster Dr. David Lee’s transition to becoming a fully-independent investigator capable of conducting high-impact research to enhance our understanding of local disparities in diabetic outcomes among communities with overwhelming diabetes burden.",Using Geographically Targeted and Community-Based Methods to Identify Factors Associated with Micro-Level Disparities in Diabetic Outcomes and Enhance Monitoring of Glycemic Control Among Black Men,9685184,K23DK110316,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Ambulatory Care ', ' outpatient treatment ', ' Outpatient Care ', ' Amputation ', ' Behavioral Sciences ', ' Clinical Investigator ', ' Communities ', ' diabetes ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Emergencies ', ' Emergency Situation ', ' Environment ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Geography ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' promoting health ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' Health Promotion ', ' Level of Health ', ' Health Status ', ' hemoglobin A1c ', ' Hemoglobin A(1) ', ' HbA1c ', ' HbA1 ', ' Hb A1c ', ' Hb A1a+b ', ' Hb A1 ', ' Glycohemoglobin A ', ' Glycosylated hemoglobin A ', ' Hospital Admission ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Interview ', ' Learning ', ' Membrum inferius ', ' Lower Limb ', ' Lower Extremity ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' mortality ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' New York ', ' New York City ', ' Play ', ' Poverty ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Primary Care ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Renal Insufficiency ', ' Renal Failure ', ' Kidney Insufficiency ', ' Kidney Failure ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Schools ', ' school of medicine ', ' medical college ', ' medical schools ', ' personal care ', ' Self Care ', ' Social Sciences ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' Measures ', ' Self Management ', ' base ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Series ', ' Training ', ' social norm ', ' Trust ', ' diabetic ', ' Fostering ', ' Interdisciplinary Study ', ' Multidisciplinary Research ', ' Multidisciplinary Collaboration ', ' Interdisciplinary Research ', ' Collaborations ', ' Spottings ', ' Complications of Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Diabetic Complications ', ' Diabetes-Related Complications ', ' Diabetes Complications ', ' Source ', ' contextual factors ', ' Application Context ', ' Visit ', ' Accident and Emergency department ', ' Emergency room ', ' Emergency Department ', ' behavioral/social science ', ' diabetes education ', ' experience ', ' knowledge base ', ' knowledgebase ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' Address ', ' Qualitative Methods ', ' qualitative reasoning ', ' Data ', ' High Prevalence ', ' Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award ', ' Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award (K23) ', ' K23 Program ', ' K23 Mechanism ', ' K23 Award ', ' K-Series Research Career Programs ', ' Research Career Program ', ' K-Awards ', ' Career Development Programs K-Series ', ' Career Development Awards and Programs ', ' Career Development Awards ', ' Research Training ', ' Subgroup ', ' Surveillance Methods ', ' Low Prevalence ', ' Monitor ', ' Hot Spot ', ' socioeconomics ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socio-economically ', ' socio-economic ', ' point of care ', ' Behavioral ', ' diabetes management ', ' diabetic management ', ' glycemic control ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' community based participatory research ', ' participatory action research ', ' community based research ', ' community based design ', ' high risk ', ' diabetes control ', ' limb amputation ', ' amputated limb ', ' food environment ', ' racial disparity ', ' race disparity ', ' disparities in race ', ' disparity reduction ', ' reduce disparity ', ' health care availability ', ' healthcare service availability ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare availability ', ' healthcare accessibility ', ' healthcare access ', ' health care service availability ', ' health care service access ', ' health care access ', ' accessibility to healthcare ', ' accessibility to health care ', ' accessibility of health care ', ' access to healthcare ', ' access to health care ', ' healthcare community ', ' health care community ', ' high risk population ', ' high risk group ', ' ']",NIDDK,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,K23,2019,198304,0.07579936405432622
"Racial inequalities in health throughout adulthood: The cumulative impact of neighborhood chemical and non-chemical stressors on epigenomic pathways ABSTRACT Racial inequalities in healthy aging have been well-documented. Compared to White Americans, Black Americans experience illness and death at early ages and show steeper age-related declines in health. Our neighborhoods, as the site of where we live, learn, play, and pray, may serve as a powerful source of these racial inequalities. Racial residential segregation (which is the sorting of different racial groups into different neighborhoods through historical and current discriminatory policies and practices) has resulted in a racially unequal American neighborhood landscape. Neighborhoods with mostly Black residents experience more poverty, civic and commercial disinvestment, and more exposure to environmental hazards compared to neighborhoods with mostly White residents. While more researchers are documenting the role of neighborhoods in health inequalities, we may actually be underestimating the true impact of neighborhood context, because we often focus on specific health outcomes, such as cardiovascular disease or diabetes. However, there are likely shared biological mechanisms within the body that drive many of these diseases – and one such mechanism may be changes to our genomic structure, called epigenomics. While our genes do not change, the environment can have an impact on whether our genes are actually “expressed”. We will determine whether the accumulation of adulthood lived experience in racially-segregated neighborhoods is related to epigenomic patterns called DNA methylation. We will also specifically determine whether the accumulation of adulthood exposure to neighborhood industrial air pollution and disadvantage together are related to these patterns of DNA methylation. Finally, we will determine whether the DNA methylation patterns we see are related to racial inequalities in healthy aging. We hypothesize that racially-segregation Black neighborhoods, with their greater levels of industrial air pollution and social disadvantage, will be related to the types of patterns in DNA methylation that have been shown to be related to chronic diseases in molecular studies. In fact, we further hypothesize that these patterns in DNA methylation will be related to racial inequalities in cognitive function and the number of chronic diseases one has had. Clarifying the role of neighborhood context in racial inequalities in healthy aging is critical, as neighborhoods are not naturally- occurring. They develop and change through policies and are amenable to intervention. Identifying the role of DNA methylation that likely underlies many chronic diseases, will clarify the importance of neighborhoods and point to potential effective interventions. PROJECT NARRATIVE Racial inequalities in healthy aging are well-known and neighborhoods, where we live, learn, play, and pray, has emerged as a potentially powerful driver of these health inequalities. We will determine whether neighborhood social stressors and environmental hazards are, in combination, linked to racial inequalities in the molecular underpinnings of numerous chronic diseases of aging. The results of this study will highlight the role of neighborhoods as a potentially effective point of intervention to eliminate racial health inequalities.",Racial inequalities in health throughout adulthood: The cumulative impact of neighborhood chemical and non-chemical stressors on epigenomic pathways,9890792,R01MD013299,"['Acceleration ', ' Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Aging ', ' Air Pollution ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Data Collection ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' DNA ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' DNA Markers ', ' Ecology ', ' Environmental Science ', ' Environment ', ' Environmental Pollution ', ' environmental contaminant ', ' environmental contamination ', ' Genes ', ' Health ', ' Industrialization ', ' Learning ', ' Literature ', ' Methylation ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Play ', ' Poverty ', ' Race ', ' Racial Group ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Social Environment ', ' social climate ', ' social context ', ' socioenvironment ', ' socioenvironmental ', ' Social Sciences ', ' Stress ', ' Environmental Hazards ', ' Measures ', ' segregation ', ' Racial Segregation ', ' Afro American ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Black Populations ', ' black American ', ' African American ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Site ', ' Chronic ', ' Biological ', ' Link ', ' Chemicals ', ' white American ', ' caucasian American ', ' Policies ', ' Inequality ', ' Exposure to ', ' DNA Methylation ', ' cognitive function ', ' Immunes ', ' Immune ', ' Complex ', ' Source ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' Physical environment ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' stressor ', ' sorting ', ' Sorting - Cell Movement ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' structural genomics ', ' Causality ', ' causation ', ' disease causation ', ' Etiology ', ' Data ', ' Collection ', ' Epigenetic ', ' Epigenetic Change ', ' Epigenetic Mechanism ', ' Epigenetic Process ', ' Molecular ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' epigenomics ', ' age dependent ', ' age related ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' healthy aging ', ' effective intervention ', ' health inequalities ', ' methylation pattern ', ' social disadvantage ', ' social stressor ', ' ']",NIMHD,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2020,760587,0.14998415096819992
"Neighborhood Socioeconomic Environments and Social Disparity in Child Obesity: The Fragile Families & Child Wellbeing Study While the prevalence of childhood obesity seems to have reached a plateau recently, substantial disparities in child obesity by race/ethnicity and family socio-economic status (hereafter, social disparity in child obesity) continue to widen; the rates decreased in non-Hispanic white or high-socioeconomic status (SES) children but increased among minority or low-SES children. Given the adverse health outcomes that result from obesity, it is critical to examine which factors affect childhood obesity and its social disparity. Changes in neighborhood SES over the last 2 decades correspond to the recent increases in social disparity in child obesity, thus neighborhood SES is potentially one important contributor to the greater social disparity in child obesity. Past studies have established a scientific premise for research in this area; however, the majority of evidence has (1) been based on cross-sectional studies, (2) not accounted for residential mobility of individuals, (3) utilized less valid self-reported heights and weights, and/or (4) not examined mediating mechanisms by which neighborhood SES affects child obesity. Further, little research has examined whether neighborhood SES has differential effects on child obesity by important subgroups (e.g., based on race/ethnicity and family SES). This proposed study is a secondary data analysis of a large, longitudinal study, namely the Fragile Families & Child Wellbeing Study (FFCWS), to examine the longitudinal association between neighborhood SES changes and childhood obesity and its social disparity. The FFCWS is a $40 million study of 4,898 children born in 1998- 2000 and their families. This proposed study will address the gaps described above by using data from FFCWS. The specific aims are to examine from young childhood to adolescence: 1) the contribution of neighborhood SES changes on child obesity; 2) the extent by which neighborhood SES changes explain social disparity in obesity; 3) the mediating effects of individual obesity-related behaviors and neighborhood social environments on the association between neighborhood SES changes and child obesity; and 4) the interacting effects of individual sociodemographic factors on the association between neighborhood SES changes and child obesity. Using the FFCWS is advantageous because data from the FFCWS (1) include objectively- measured body mass index of children when they were three, five, nine, and fifteen; (2) have information about multiple levels of exposures ranging from the individual and family levels to the neighborhood and social levels, which can be utilized as potential moderators, mediators, or covariates; and (3) were collected in 2000s during the drastically changing time period in neighborhood SES, which would allow for better causal inference. This study builds on important preliminary studies and the extensive relevant experience of two principal investigators. This study is very cost-effective and will elucidate the role of neighborhood socioeconomic status on child obesity including mediating and moderating relationships, allowing for recommendations that will inform community-level interventions to reduce child obesity. PROJECT NARRATIVE To prevent childhood obesity, building a health-promoting community is important. This study will inform future community planning and policy by examining the mechanisms by which neighborhood socioeconomic status affects child obesity and disparities in obesity by race/ethnicity and family socio-economic status.

"Neighborhoods, Cognitive Aging and Modifiable Risk Factors The role of modifiable risk factors (RF), like physical activity (PA), sleep quality, social engagement, and cardiovascular (CV) risk is receiving greater attention to promote the cognitive health of an aging population and reduce risk of Alzheimer's disease. Each of these risk factors is known to be influenced by environmental sources, such as neighborhood walkability, safety, noise, and access to low-cost transportation, retail, and healthy food sources. However, little is known about the role of neighborhood factors as drivers of cognitive aging and risk for Alzheimer's disease. If neighborhood matters, adaptations in the use of available infrastructures have the potential to impact thousands at a time. Those neighborhood factors that most impact individual RF and cognitive health to reduce Alzheimer's disease risk may further differ by race and sex. Evaluating the role of neighborhood characteristics on cognitive health is difficult to interpret from more widely used cross-sectional data due to residual confounding. Therefore, investigating how residentially stable older adults are affected by their local stable and changing contexts and how older adults who relocate to a new neighborhood may respond to their new context by changing health behaviors requires long-term study during the last 1/3 of life years prior to the onset of Alzheimer's disease. The Cardiovascular Health Study (CHS) represents an ideal cohort for studying interactions between individual health and neighborhood risk factors for various reasons. First, participants were well characterized for key modifiable RF, above, as well as cognition, and mobility. Second, the cohort is nationally representative, bi-racial and spans socioeconomically diverse, urban and rural neighborhoods, allowing us to examine the relation between individual risk and variability in neighborhood factors. Third, our proposal seeks to address the research challenges and opportunities articulated in the NIA Health Disparities Research Framework by examining interactions between environment, biology and behavior. We hypothesize that long-term exposure to neighborhood disadvantage may serve as a common cause of individual risk factors and neurocognitive and functional health, particularly in socio-demographically at-risk groups. Specific aims are to characterize associations between long-term neighborhood exposures and: 1) individual rates of decline and impairment in cognition and physical function; 2) individual risk factors (PA, sleep quality, social engagement and CV burden) for Alzheimer's disease, which may mediate neighborhood differences in cognitive and functional risk, and; 3) whether specific neighborhood exposures account for racial and sex differences in cognitive and functional risk. Addressing these questions in the CHS provides an unmatched opportunity to examine the influence of a range of neighborhood factors on long-term trajectories of cognitive and functional aging prior to the onset of Alzheimer's disease. This work will inform future design of multi-level approaches to target those neighborhood factors impacting multiple RF to optimize healthful activity, reduce health disparities, and help adults remain active and age in place. 1 Narrative We propose to evaluate in the 30-year Cardiovascular Health Study (CHS) whether long-term exposure to neighborhood disadvantage may serve as a common cause of individual risk factors and neurocognitive and functional health, particularly in groups at elevated risk for Alzheimer's disease by characterizing associations between long-term neighborhood exposures and: 1) individual rates of decline and impairment in cognition and physical function; 2) individual risk factors (physical activity, sleep quality, social support, and subclinical cardiovascular disease) for Alzheimer's disease, which may mediate neighborhood differences in neurocognitive and functional risk, and; 3) whether specific neighborhood exposures account for racial and sex differences in cognitive and functional risk. Addressing these questions in the CHS provides an unmatched opportunity to examine the influence of a range of neighborhood factors on long-term trajectories of cognitive and functional aging prior to the onset of AD to inform future design of multi-level approaches to target those factors impacting multiple healthful activities. 1","Neighborhoods, Cognitive Aging and Modifiable Risk Factors",9928873,R01AG055404,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Affect ', ' Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', ' Aged, 80 and over ', ' Oldest Old ', ' Aging ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' AD dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer syndrome ', "" Alzheimer's "", "" Alzheimer's disease dementia "", ' Alzheimers Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Attention ', ' Behavior ', ' Biology ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' circulatory system ', ' Cognition ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Environment ', ' Food ', ' Food or Food Product ', ' Future ', ' Gait ', ' Health ', ' indexing ', ' Libraries ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' longitudinal outcome studies ', ' longterm study ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Noise ', ' Nonagenarian ', ' Race ', ' Racial Group ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Research ', ' Retirement ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Safety ', ' Schools ', ' Social support ', ' social support network ', ' Telephone ', ' Phone ', ' Time ', ' Transportation ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Walking ', ' Mediating ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' socio-economic position ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' Site ', ' Clinical ', ' Residual ', ' Residual state ', ' Link ', ' Physical activity ', ' residential building ', ' residential site ', ' residence ', ' Individual ', ' Rural ', ' healthy food ', ' Health Food ', ' Exposure to ', ' Life ', ' Event ', ' Source ', ' Physical Function ', ' Neurocognitive ', ' Visit ', ' Church ', ' Digit ', ' Digit structure ', ' Performance ', ' cohort ', ' Participant ', ' Negotiating ', ' Negotiation ', ' Mediation ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' race differences ', ' racial difference ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' cardiovascular risk ', ' cardiovascular risk factor ', ' Modeling ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' IADL ', ' instrumental activity of daily living ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' High Prevalence ', ' Cognitive ', ' Characteristics ', ' sex ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' follow-up ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio-economically ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomics ', ' informant ', ' cost ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' resilience ', ' Outcome ', ' prospective ', ' Cognitive aging ', ' Impairment ', ' modifiable risk ', ' Health behavior change ', ' Alzheimer risk factor ', ' alzheimer risk ', "" Alzheimer's disease risk "", ' aged population ', ' population aging ', ' aging population ', ' Socioeconomically disadvantaged ', ' socio-economic disadvantage ', ' socio-economically disadvantaged ', ' socio-economically underprivileged ', ' socioeconomically underprivileged ', ' socioeconomic disadvantage ', ' cardiovascular health ', ' built environment ', ' walkable ', ' walkability ', ' neighborhood disadvantage ', ' social involvement ', ' social participation ', ' social engagement ', ' quality of sleep ', ' sleep quality ', ' age in place ', ' aging in place ', ' Infrastructure ', ' socio-demographics ', ' sociodemographics ', ' Differences between sexes ', ' Differs between sexes ', ' Sexual differences ', ' sex-dependent differences ', ' sex-related differences ', ' sex-specific differences ', ' Sex Differences ', ' ']",NIA,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,585398,0.08041826279592182
"Creating Community Driven, Personalized Health Maps for Patients with Diabetes Project Abstract/Summary: This NLM R01 proposal aims to develop and test a personal health library platform for patients with diabetes and prediabetes, harnessing both personal health and healthcare data (e.g., medication lists, upcoming appointments, self-tracking of diet and blood sugars) and location-based mapped data about neighborhood health resources (e.g., community reviews about the quality of grocery stores and parks). Diabetes and prediabetes patients have substantial needs for tracking and accessing health and healthcare information that are poorly met by existing platforms that largely operate in silos. Furthermore, existing digital health tools have not utilized participatory design approaches and have low uptake among specific subgroups, such as racial/ethnic minority and lower income populations. In this project, we will use design science to create and evaluate a new personal health library platform to strengthen and improve the ways in which low income individuals and communities of color access and interact with personal health data that better reflect their needs and interests. Specifically, we propose to create a new platform that enables patients with diabetes or prediabetes to import their personal health data to a mapping platform, in order to have access to store and view both private and public views of health- promoting and health-inhibiting community factors in their own neighborhood. This new platform will be titled: “Mapping to Amplify the Vitality of Engaged Neighborhoods,” or MAVEN. In Aim 1, we will use inductive observational methods to follow community leaders/health advocates and patients with either diabetes or prediabetes to understand existing health and healthcare journeys and map existing resources in their neighborhoods. We will recruit patients and community-based organization leaders from 3 San Francisco neighborhoods with the highest prevalence of diabetes and pre-diabetes, which also correspond with existing San Francisco Health Network clinics in our healthcare system. In Aim 2, we will recruit a second sample of individuals to complete user-centered design methods (e.g., card-sorting and thinkaloud interviews) to prioritize and test prototypes of data elements within the new MAVEN personal health library platform. In Aim 3, we will conduct real-world usability testing of a functional version of the MAVEN platform to explore its acceptability and usability in everyday life. Because we will engage racially/ethnically and socioeconomically diverse patients in this project, we will ensure that the MAVEN personal health library platform is relevant for patients with varying levels of health literacy and technology proficiency. In addition, because we will engage community health advocates and public healthcare system leaders, our findings will have more direct implications for implementation and dissemination. Project Narrative: This goal of this study is to develop and evaluate an online platform that patients with diabetes or prediabetes can use to combine important information relevant to their health and healthcare – such as medical information, personal data on diet or blood sugar levels, and community data on health resources in their neighborhood. We will first design the platform with community member and community health advocate input, and then we will test the platform to see how individuals use it in everyday life. We will recruit racially/ethnically and socioeconomically diverse individuals in this study to ensure that the final product is relevant for the broader public, even those without extensive experience using technology.","Creating Community Driven, Personalized Health Maps for Patients with Diabetes",10204644,R01LM013045,"['Appointment ', ' Behavior ', ' Blood Glucose ', ' Blood Sugar ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Cities ', ' Color ', ' Communities ', ' health care delivery ', ' Healthcare Delivery ', ' health services delivery ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Diet ', ' dietary ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Exercise ', ' Face ', ' faces ', ' facial ', ' Food ', ' Food or Food Product ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Health Promotion ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' promoting health ', ' Personal Health Records ', ' Health Resources ', ' Health Status ', ' Level of Health ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Interview ', ' Libraries ', ' Life Style ', ' Lifestyle ', ' Low Income Population ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' nutrition ', ' Patients ', ' Pharmacy facility ', ' Pharmacies ', ' Privatization ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' San Francisco ', ' Science ', ' Sleep ', ' Social Work ', ' Social Service ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Technology ', ' Telephone ', ' Phone ', ' Testing ', ' Businesses ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' ethnographic ', ' Ethnography ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Phase ', ' Medical ', ' Ensure ', ' Evaluation ', ' Physical activity ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' participant recruitment ', ' Patient Recruitments ', ' uptake ', ' Collaborations ', ' tool ', ' Prediabetes ', ' Prediabetic State ', ' pre-diabetes ', ' pre-diabetic ', ' prediabetic ', ' Prediabetes syndrome ', ' Patient Preferences ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Disorder Management ', ' Disease Management ', ' Complex ', ' Home ', ' Home environment ', ' Clinic ', ' System ', ' Location ', ' Country ', ' Test Result ', ' interest ', ' Visit ', ' experience ', ' medical appointment ', ' peer ', ' member ', ' sorting ', ' Sorting - Cell Movement ', ' Health Care Technology ', ' Healthcare Technology ', ' Health Technology ', ' Sampling ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Low income ', ' Advocate ', ' Data ', ' Data Element ', ' High Prevalence ', ' Subgroup ', ' Process ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' follow-up ', ' Community Health ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio-economically ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomics ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' Output ', ' health literacy ', ' digital ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' ethnic minority ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' Health behavior change ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' user centered design ', ' usability ', ' prototype ', ' data sharing ', ' flexible ', ' flexibility ', ' health data ', ' data visualization ', ' internet portal ', ' on-line portal ', ' online portal ', ' web-based portal ', ' web portal ', ' ethnically diverse ', ' ethnic diversity ', ' data library ', ' data archive ', ' Healthy Eating ', ' recruit ', ' ']",NLM,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R01,2020,59750,0.06381823869997026
"San Francisco Bay Clinical Trial Unit: Expanding COVID-19 Testing in Heavily Impacted Communities in San Francisco Project Summary/Abstract As of mid-May, 2020, severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus that causes COVID-19 disease, has been diagnosed in more than 1.3 million persons in the United States and accounted for more than 80,000 US deaths. Identifying persons infected with SARS-CoV-2 before they present to health care can reduce transmission and flatten the epidemic curve. The San Francisco Bay Area was particularly hard hit early in the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States, and like many parts of the United States, has substantial racial/ethnic disparities in the distribution of cases of COVID-19 in the City. The eastern parts of the City have the highest case rates, with most heavily impacted communities including the Mission, Bayview and Sunnydale neighborhoods, and the Tenderloin, but relatively few COVID-19 testing sites exist there. In addition, outbreaks have been occurring in congregate living situations in San Francisco, where testing can be difficult to perform. We plan to increase SARS-CoV-2 testing through 2 low-barrier testing approaches to identify previously undiagnosed persons. First, we will use a mobile testing unit to reach persons in facilities and neighborhoods where COVID-19 rates are high. Second, we will conduct testing through a community mobilization event in a heavily impacted neighborhood in the southeast San Francisco, testing more than 3000 persons over a four-day time period. We will integrate HIV testing into SARS-CoV-2 testing, as rates of HIV testing have dramatically declined since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, and there is substantial overlap in the populations at risk of both types of infection. These activities will have the additional benefit of increasing capacity at the 2 Clinical Research Sites of the San Francisco Bay Clinical Trials Unit to conduct COVID-19 research, including trials of vaccines and therapeutic interventions. Project Narrative We plan to increase COVID-19 testing in San Francisco through 2 mechanisms: 1) using a mobile van to reach into facilities and neighborhoods where outbreaks are occurring and 2) conducting a community mobilization testing event in a neighborhood particularly hard hit by COVID-19. These efforts will also help the Clinical Research Sites of the San Francisco Bay Clinical Trials Unit to be ready to conduct COVID-19 vaccine and treatment trials.",San Francisco Bay Clinical Trial Unit: Expanding COVID-19 Testing in Heavily Impacted Communities in San Francisco,10166243,UM1AI069496,"['Cities ', ' Communities ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease Outbreaks ', ' Outbreaks ', ' Epidemic ', ' Infection ', ' Mission ', ' Persons ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Research ', ' San Francisco ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Virus ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Populations at Risk ', ' Event ', ' intervention therapy ', ' Therapeutic Intervention ', ' AIDS test ', ' AIDS/HIV test ', ' HIV test ', ' HIV-1 test ', ' HIV-2 test ', ' Human immunodeficiency virus test ', ' Transmission ', ' transmission process ', ' treatment trial ', ' clinical site ', ' clinical research site ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' Clinical Trials Unit ', ' vaccination study ', ' vaccination trial ', ' vaccine study ', ' vaccine trial ', ' COVID19 ', ' corona virus disease 2019 ', ' coronavirus disease 2019 ', ' COVID-19 ', ' 2019 novel coronavirus ', ' SARS-CoV-2 ', ' SARS-CoV2 ', ' SARS-associated coronavirus 2 ', ' SARS-coronavirus-2 ', ' SARS-related coronavirus 2 ', ' Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ', ' Wuhan coronavirus ', ' 2019-nCoV ', ' COVID19 vaccine ', ' corona virus disease 2019 vaccine ', ' coronavirus disease 2019 vaccine ', ' COVID-19 vaccine ', ' COVID-19 epidemic ', ' COVID19 epidemic ', ' COVID19 pandemic ', ' corona virus disease 2019 epidemic ', ' corona virus disease 2019 pandemic ', ' coronavirus disease 2019 epidemic ', ' coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic ', ' COVID-19 pandemic ', ' ']",NIAID,PUBLIC HEALTH FOUNDATION ENTERPRISES,UM1,2020,600000,0.05681897611726725
"Cardiometabolic Risk Development and Management in Changing Neighborhoods: the Jackson Heart Study Project Summary It is well established that African Americans have higher levels of cardiometabolic risk factors than whites and are less likely to achieve hypertension and diabetes control. The neighborhood environment is a critical structural determinant of these disparities given the disproportionate exposure of African Americans to deleterious residential environments. In light of this, we propose using the JHS, a state of the art epidemiologic cohort of African Americans (n=5,306), combined with rigorously assessed neighborhood contextual factors to examine longitudinal associations between features of the physical, social, and local healthcare environment and cardiometabolic risk factor development and management over a 20-year period. Understanding the role of changing neighborhood environments in shaping cardiometabolic risk factor development and management is critical to improving causal inferences and developing appropriate policies and interventions designed to mitigate the burden of cardiometabolic risk factors in this high-risk population. Furthermore, understanding these changes in the unique context of the South, a region of the country with the highest burden of chronic disease and urban areas characterized by high proportions of African Americans, low population density, and geographically dispersed amenities, will allow us to better understand how neighborhood processes operate in this setting and better tailor ongoing prevention efforts. The primary goals of the proposed study are to: 1) compile a multilevel database of time-varying neighborhood contextual data (i.e. physical, social, and healthcare characteristics) that can be linked to the Jackson Heart Study (JHS)— a unique, state-of-the art cohort study of African Americans and 2) to examine longitudinal associations of changes in neighborhood contextual factors with HTN and DBM development and management. Aim 1 will examine longitudinal associations between time-varying physical and social neighborhood features and cardiometabolic risk factors among African American adults. Aim 2 will examine longitudinal associations between time-varying neighborhood physical and social features and HTN and DBM control. Aim 3 will examine associations between local access to primary care and cardiometabolic risk factor development and management and whether features of the physical and social environment modify associations. This project will build upon detailed neighborhood data collection from Exams 1-3, incorporate emerging neighborhood data collection techniques, and take advantage of the collaborative partnership established between the Drexel University Dornsife School of Public Health and the JHS through the Center for Integrative Approaches to Health Disparities. PROJECT NARRATIVE The overarching goal of this project is to use the Jackson Heart Study— a state-of-the-art cohort study of African American adults— to investigate longitudinal associations between features of the neighborhood physical, social, and healthcare environment and cardiometabolic risk development and management over a 20-year period.

Yet, the causal health relationships have been difficult to establish due to reliance on cross-sectional designs, coarse exposure assessment, limited health effects data and neglect of negative aspects of green space (e.g., litter, noise). This study will capitalize on an upcoming natural experiment in five low-income neighborhoods in Detroit, MI involving the ecological restoration of unmaintained parks to grassland meadows. Five control park neighborhoods were matched on demographic and built characteristics. This longitudinal study will include participants (n=590 after attrition) from ten intervention/control park neighborhoods with baseline measurement then annual measurement for three years post- restoration. Our study will be the first natural experiment to examine the impact of ecological restoration with individual-level measurement of visual/auditory exposure (e.g., greenery, birdsong) to green space on health. We will go beyond the usual objective measure of physical activity (GPS/accelerometer) in park studies to include a validated stress biomarker (salivary cortisol) and cardio-metabolic indicators (BMI, blood pressure, hip-to-waist ratio, C-reactive protein and A1C). The question to be answered is: Does ecological restoration of abandoned parks into grassland meadows and bird habitats increase nearby resident’s physical activity, lower their stress, and improve their cardio-metabolic health? We propose three aims. Aim 1: Establish the effect of ecological restoration of parks on physical activity from baseline through 3-years post-restoration, using a non-randomized design. Aim 2: Illuminate the stress reduction potential of restored parks. Aim 3: Evaluate the effect of ecological restoration on downstream cardio-metabolic health outcomes. Understanding the role of ecological restoration on health will provide the unique opportunity to inform replication, scalability and generalizability for cities managing park resources in low-income neighborhoods. Our findings will be vital in the development of policies needed to mitigate pervasive socioeconomic disparities in obesity, Type 2 diabetes, cancer, and cardio-metabolic health. Project narrative Using a natural experiment, this project will evaluate the effects of ecological restoration of unmaintained Detroit city parks on physical activity, stress and cardio-metabolic health employing a non-randomized design. Our findings will inform built environment planning and policies designed to mitigate pervasive socioeconomic disparities in obesity, cancer and cardio- metabolic health.",Impact of ecological park restoration on health in low income neighborhoods: A natural experiment,9980816,R01CA239187,"['Affect ', ' Anxiety ', ' Birds ', ' Aves ', ' Avian ', ' Blood Pressure ', ' C-reactive protein ', ' Proteins, specific or class, C-reactive ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cities ', ' City Planning ', ' development policy ', ' Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Adult-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Ketosis-Resistant Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Maturity-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' NIDDM ', ' Non-Insulin Dependent Diabetes ', ' Noninsulin Dependent Diabetes ', ' Noninsulin Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Slow-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Stable Diabetes Mellitus ', ' T2 DM ', ' T2D ', ' T2DM ', ' Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Type 2 diabetes ', ' Type II Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Type II diabetes ', ' adult onset diabetes ', ' ketosis resistant diabetes ', ' maturity onset diabetes ', ' type 2 DM ', ' type II DM ', ' type two diabetes ', ' Exercise ', ' Poaceae ', ' Gramineae ', ' Grasses ', ' Health ', ' Hydrocortisone ', ' Aeroseb-HC ', ' Cetacort ', ' Cort-Dome ', ' Cortef ', ' Cortenema ', ' Cortisol ', ' Cortispray ', ' Cortril ', ' Dermacort ', ' Eldecort ', ' Hydrocortone ', ' Hytone ', ' Nutracort ', ' Proctocort ', ' indexing ', ' Industrialization ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' longitudinal outcome studies ', ' longterm study ', ' Michigan ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Noise ', ' Obesity ', ' adiposity ', ' corpulence ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulentia ', ' obese ', ' obese people ', ' obese person ', ' obese population ', ' Plants ', ' Recreation ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Stress ', ' Taxes ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Unemployment ', ' jobless ', ' joblessness ', ' out of work ', ' unemployed ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Afro American ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Black Populations ', ' black American ', ' African American ', ' Health Benefit ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' waist-to-hip ratio ', ' Waist-Hip Ratio ', ' Ensure ', ' Physical activity ', ' Visual ', ' Individual ', ' Policies ', ' Measurement ', ' Ecological impact ', ' Environmental Impact ', ' Auditory ', ' Salivary ', ' Techniques ', ' restoration ', ' inner city ', ' Participant ', ' Sampling ', ' Habitats ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Causality ', ' causation ', ' disease causation ', ' Etiology ', ' Low income ', ' Consent ', ' Data ', ' Characteristics ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio-economically ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomics ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' neglect ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Grasslands ', ' cancer type ', ' Natural experiment ', ' birdsong ', ' bird song ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' socioeconomic disparity ', ' built environment ', ' BP reduction ', ' lower BP ', ' lower blood pressure ', ' lowers blood pressure ', ' reduce BP ', ' reduce blood pressure ', ' reduction in BP ', ' reduction in blood pressure ', ' blood pressure reduction ', ' greenspace ', ' Green space ', ' accelerometry ', ' activity monitor ', ' activity tracker ', ' Accelerometer ', ' recruit ', ' stress reduction ', ' cardiometabolic ', ' cardiometabolism ', ' perceived stress ', ' ']",NCI,MICHIGAN STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,638556,0.04996921481227205
"Longitudinal associations between neighborhood greenspace and brain aging in cognitively normal older adults PROJECT ABSTRACT No treatments are available to prevent Alzheimer’s disease, which currently affects 5.8 million Americans. Alzheimer’s risk can be reduced through healthy diets, stress reduction and physical activity, yet maintaining these can be difficult in practice due to cost and low motivation. Addressing these barriers, urban planning and public health researchers have evidenced neighborhood characteristics that promote health by offering amenities encouraging health behaviors such as walking. Greenspace (public and private areas with vegetation) is one such neighborhood feature previously associated with reduced Alzheimer’s risk and slower cognitive decline in the few published studies to date. Dr. Besser’s short-term research goal is to advance the research on this topic, to assess if neighborhood greenspace is associated with brain aging in older adults. The K01 specific aims are to determine if living in neighborhoods with greater vegetation and better access to parks in early, mid, and late-life is associated with slower rates of cognitive decline and less brain atrophy in cognitively normal older adults, and whether these associations vary by sex, race, apolipoprotein E genotype (genetic risk factor for Alzheimer’s disease), and geographic region. This longitudinal, observational study will combine clinical and brain volume data from three Alzheimer’s Disease Centers, a mailed questionnaire, and neighborhood greenspace measures derived using geographic information systems. Outcome variables will include cognitive domain (episodic memory, language, attention, executive function) and brain volume measures (hippocampal volume, white matter hyperintensities). Multi-level linear mixed models will account for neighborhood clustering and control for confounders (e.g., demographics, neighborhood socioeconomic status). The parallel career development plan involves: 1) learning to develop key neighborhood built environment and brain aging measures; 2) advancing and developing specialized primary data collection skills; 3) gaining knowledge in the biology and epidemiology of aging and cognitive neuroscience; 4) preparing and submitting the first R01 proposal; and 5) cultivating multidisciplinary collaborations. Dr. Besser’s institution, Florida Atlantic University, offers a highly supportive environment with all of the necessary faculty, teaching, financial, and research supports and rich opportunities for multidisciplinary and collaborative research. The primary mentor and co-mentor are experts in their respective fields of neurology/aging research and urban and regional planning. Dr. Besser’s institutional environment, career development plan, and specific aims are ideally suited to enable her long-term goal to become an expert and independent research scientist with an established, innovative, R01-funded research program focused on neighborhood built environments to support healthy brain aging. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research will investigate if exposure to greater neighborhood greenspace in early, mid, and late- life is associated with healthy brain aging as measured via regional brain volumes and longitudinal decline on multiple cognitive domains. The study will assess whether there are critical periods in which greenspace exposure may be most beneficial, as well as potential effect modification by sex, race, apolipoprotein E (genetic risk factor for Alzheimer’s disease), and geographic region. The ultimate goal is to provide evidence for community-level interventions that can increase cognitive resilience and healthy behaviors throughout the lifespan, promoting healthy brain aging and allowing older adults to age in place.",Longitudinal associations between neighborhood greenspace and brain aging in cognitively normal older adults,9976690,K01AG063895,"['Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ',

"Preventing Substance Use in the Context of Poverty: Risk and Protection from Early Childhood to Early Adulthood Project Summary One of the most debilitating and pervasive high-risk ecologies children encounter in American society is poverty and its many correlates, such as compromised parenting, deprived neighborhoods and schools, deviant peer clustering, and poor nutrition and medical care. Despite the greater risk of a host of maladaptive outcomes associated with poverty, few studies have prospectively examined young adult adjustment for children born into poverty beginning at age 2. Even fewer longitudinal trials initiated in early childhood have examined the impact of a brief and repeated family intervention in preventing alcohol and drug use disorder (ADUD). The Early Steps Multisite (ESM) prevention trial was specifically designed to address the needs of children and families living in poverty, often marked by compromised parenting and parent well-being. Initiated at child age 2 and follow-ups at nine ages through age 16, the ESM sample was recruited from WIC centers in three geographically, socioeconomically, and ethnically diverse communities: Pittsburgh, PA; Charlottesville, VA; and Eugene, OR. To increase the number of sample families at risk for later ADUD, eligibility was restricted to WIC families with additional socioeconomic, family, and child risk factors. Families were randomly assigned to be offered a yearly FCU intervention, including adapted and tailored family management interventions. The children and families were initially assessed at child age 2 and then yearly through age 10.5, using a multi-agent and multi-method strategy that included direct observations of family interaction in most years, and subsequently followed at ages 14 and 16. In the current application, we are proposing to continue following this multiethnic sample (N=731) of youth who are transitioning to adulthood, at ages 19 and 21. With genotyping on an extensive contemporary array, prospective data on neighborhood risk and racial/ethnic disparities, we propose to examine direct, interactive, and cascading effects of child, genetic, family, peer, and neighborhood factors on ADUD and related outcomes; lasting effects of the Family Check-Up on ADUD and related problem and prosocial behavior; and moderating effects of the Family Check- Up’s effectiveness.

"Impact of Park Renovations on Physical Activity and Community Health in NYC ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The built environment plays a critical role in promoting physical activity and health. The association between parks, as a key attribute of the built environment, and physical activity, however, remains inconclusive. This project employs a natural experiment design to assess the impact of the Community Parks Initiative (CPI), a New York City Department of Parks and Recreation (NYC Parks) park redesign and renovation initiative, on physical activity, park usage, psychosocial and mental health, and community wellbeing. The project will use a longitudinal design with matched controls. NYC Parks has identified 134 parks with extreme capital needs in high-priority neighborhoods and will begin renovating parks in waves. In late 2016, the first wave of 35 parks across 55 neighborhoods will close for renovations; these parks will reopen in late 2017. From this initial wave, 20 interventio parks have been selected for inclusion in this study. Intervention park neighborhoods have been matched to a control group of 20 socio-economically similar park neighborhoods that will not be renovated during the study. The study will address two aims. In Aim 1, investigators will compare total volume of PA and other health outcomes among residents in the intervention vs. control park neighborhoods (defined as .25 mile radius around each park) from baseline to 2.5 years post-renovation. We hypothesize that improvements will be observed in PA and health levels in intervention but not control neighborhoods. In Aim 2, an additional 10 park neighborhoods receiving renovation in 2018 and reopening in 2019 will be used to monitor replicability of intervention effects at 1.5 years post-renovation. This combined design enhances our ability to infer causality in a natural experiment. We aim to recruit and retain 40 study participants per park neighborhood, after attrition, for a total of 1600 participants in Aim 1 and 400 in Aim 2. Study participants will represent two distinct sociodemographic strata in each neighborhood: low-income housing and community- engaged residents. Measures include direct park observations and program checklists, park quality, self- reported and GPS-tracked park usage, accelerometry-based physical activity, self-reported psychosocial health, and perceived community wellbeing. The largest natural experiment of its kind to date, this study represents a rare opportunity to provide robust evidence to further our understanding of the complex relationship between parks and physical activity, psychosocial and mental health, and community wellbeing. The findings will inform future investments in health-oriented urban design policies and offer evidence for addressing health disparities through built environment strategies. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    The project will evaluate the long-term effects of a citywide public park redesign and renovation initiative on residents' physical activity, psychosocial and mental health, and community wellbeing.

"Social Environmental Factors, DNA methylation of inflammation genes and Breast Cancer Survivorship among African American Women Cancer disparities might result from biologic, behavioral, and social environmental factors. This Career Development Proposal (CDP) will enable attainment of Dr. Jesse Plascak's long-term goal of becoming an NIH- funded independent investigator studying relationships between the social environment, biologic factors, and cancer disparities. The applicant's previous training includes social and spatial epidemiology of cancer disparities. Dr. Plascak has investigated relationships between neighborhood segregation (racial-ethnic and socioeconomic), social cohesion (positive relationships within neighborhoods), neighborhood disorder (physical deterioration or lack of social control), discrimination, and cancer outcomes. Attaining a trans-disciplinary and independent cancer disparities research program will require the following additional training and mentors: (1) cancer molecular biology – genetics and epigenetics (Drs. Kitaw Demissie and Helmut Zarbl), (2) counterfactual- based causal inference (Drs. Zhiqiang Tan and Mario Schootman), (3) African American (AA) breast cancer (BrCa) epidemiology (Dr. Elisa Bandera), and (4) systematic social observation (SSO) of the social environment (Drs. Andrew Rundle and Mario Schootman). Dr. Plascak will apply this mentored training to address a series of research questions using the longitudinal Women's Circle of Health Follow-up Study (WCHS-L) (R01CA185623) – an ongoing study enrolling 1,700 AA BrCa survivors with comprehensive questionnaire data including perceived neighborhood social cohesion, perceived neighborhood disorder, medical records, cancer registry records, and blood samples. DNA methylation (DNAm) of inflammation-related genes will be quantified from blood samples. SSO will be conducted to create objective measures of neighborhood disorder of each WCHS- L participant's residence. Residential segregation measures will be calculated from a dataset representative of the spatial distribution and sociodemographic composition of study area households. Causal inference methods will be used to test relationships between social environmental factors, DNAm, and BrCa survival. The research aims are to assess: (1) participants' objective neighborhood disorder using SSO and investigate correlations between social environmental factors (residential segregation, perceived and objective neighborhood disorder, social cohesion), (2) associations between social environmental factors and BrCa survival, and (3) whether aberrant DNAm and altered expression of inflammation-related genes mediate the association between environmental factors and BrCa survival. Training and research activities have been tailored to the Rutgers University exceptional research environment: The Cancer Institute of New Jersey (NCI Comprehensive Cancer Center housing a SEER registry) and Center for Environmental Exposures and Disease (NIEHS P30 center). Preliminary findings will form the basis of a R01 grant proposal. Completion of the activities outlined in this CDP will allow Dr. Plascak to become an independent, transdisciplinary investigator of cancer disparities; contributing to improvements in population health through the prevention and control of cancer and cancer disparities. This projects ultimately seeks to improve public health by identifying novel social and biologic factors that can be targeted to prevent or treat female breast cancer mortality. Social environmental factors such as residential segregation and neighborhood disorder can be prevented through public health-relevant policy. Epigenetic alteration of inflammation genes can be therapeutically targeted to potentially lengthen survival times following diagnosis with breast cancer.","Social Environmental Factors, DNA

"Impact of Social Cohesion and Social Capital in PrEP Uptake and Adherence Among Transwomen of Color PROJECT SUMMARY This project seeks to use real-time geospatial methods to investigate relationships between social cohesion and social capital within Global Positioning System (GPS)-defined activity space neighborhoods and social networks in relation to HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) uptake and adherence cross-sectionally and longitudinally among transgender women (TW) of color (TWOC) in the New York City metropolitan statistical area (MSA) followed over two years. We will recruit 250 TWOC in the proposed The N2 Study: Transgender Women's Neighborhood and Networks Cohort Study to address the aims of the research. Eligibility requirements include: identifying as a transgender woman (individuals who were assigned a male sex at birth who identify as women, female, trans women, trans female, male-to-female or another diverse trans feminine gender identity on the spectrum) of color; HIV-seronegative; being 18 to 55 years old; residing in the New York City MSA; self-report no plans to move outside of the New York City metropolitan area in the next two years; self-reporting no restrictions to usual physical activity; and self-report willingness to carry a small GPS device for two-weeks at five points over the course of two years. Participants will wear the GPS device following protocols used in our previous feasibility research projects, including studies among TW. In this longitudinal study, six months after completing the initial 2-week GPS protocol, participants will carry the GPS device for an additional 2-weeks every six-months over the two-year study period—for a total of five times. Multiple GPS measures and multiple measures of social networks (at different time points) can better capture the breadth of people's exposure to neighborhood-level factors and dynamics in social networks. Also, GPS activity space environment and social networks data at baseline could potentially influence PrEP outcomes over time, providing a clear temporal ordering and an ability to consider potential time-lags. The proposed study will be the largest GPS study of HIV disparities in any transgender population and presents a remarkable opportunity to study environmental influences on HIV. Findings from the proposed research will impact HIV prevention intervention activities. First, the project will inform specific neighborhood-level policy interventions. For example, increased community efforts through increased social cohesion in neighborhoods may be an HIV prevention intervention that can reduce HIV health disparities. Second, from the GPS dataset we will know the travel patterns of TW and therefore be able to identify optimal geographic locations for HIV prevention interventions. This will advance the literature given that such interventions are seldom geographically targeted. Third, examining changes in spatial mobility (i.e. activity spaces) over time will be useful in knowing whether the risks of particular spaces change or remain constant because different neighborhoods will have different risk profiles. Finally, our dynamic network analysis we propose will deepen understanding of the effects of social networks on HIV prevention behaviors and will improve network-based HIV prevention interventions.

"Using Geographically Targeted and Community-Based Methods to Identify Factors Associated with Micro-Level Disparities in Diabetic Outcomes and Enhance Monitoring of Glycemic Control Among Black Men Project Summary / Abstract  This mentored patient-oriented research career development award (K23) will support Dr. David Lee’s training and research to use geographically targeted and community-based methods to identify factors associated with micro-level disparities in diabetic outcomes and enhance monitoring of glycemic control among Black men. Though the prevalence of diabetes is increasing nationally, current diabetes surveillance methods are unable to identify hot spots of poor diabetic outcomes at a community level. However, studies based on a novel geographic method of diabetes surveillance have found that the increase in diabetes burden has been focused in specific communities, especially among Black neighborhoods. For Black adults, poor diabetes control has been associated with fewer primary care visits, less frequent HbA1c testing, and higher rates of emergency department use and hospitalizations, especially among diabetic Black men. Given this infrequent interaction with a usual source of healthcare, community-based settings may provide the advantages of pre- existing trust and engagement to optimize health outcomes for high-risk populations living in neighborhoods that are hot spots of diabetic complications. Thus, the specific aims of this proposal are 1) to use geospatial and quantitative methods to identify which micro-contextual factors account for local disparities in diabetic outcomes among Black communities, 2) to use geographically-targeted qualitative interviews to identify neighborhood-level factors that explain poor diabetic outcomes in certain Black communities, and 3) to perform community-based HbA1c testing and diabetes self-care surveys among Black men living in neighborhoods with a high prevalence of diabetic complications. This community-based research will leverage existing partnerships within a network of local Black-owned barbershops in New York City. Barbershops have become increasingly effective sites for promoting health and measuring health outcomes among Black men, a population which has high rates of mortality and morbidity from diabetes. The results of this research will inform future R-series applications to expand this approach to other high-risk subgroups in Black neighborhoods and other racial and ethnic communities with extremely poor diabetic outcomes. Dr. Lee’s training goals closely parallel his research aims and will further enhance his understanding of: 1) advanced quantitative analysis, 2) qualitative and mixed methods, 3) social and behavioral science, and 4) diabetes education and management. The proposed research and training will be conducted at the New York University School of Medicine and leverage resources of the other professional schools at NYU, which offer outstanding opportunities for collaboration, learning, and multidisciplinary research. This environment, in addition to his research and training plan will provide Dr. Lee with a strong foundation from which he can accelerate his career towards his goal of becoming a fully independent clinical investigator dedicated to reducing disparities in diabetes burden and improving health outcomes in communities that are overwhelmed by diabetic complications. PROJECT NARRATIVE  The overall burden of diabetes is increasing nationally, but specific neighborhoods, especially in Black communities, have experienced a disproportionately higher prevalence of diabetes and its complications such as kidney failure and lower extremity amputations. The goal of the proposed research is to use a mix of quantitative and qualitative methods to identify the micro-contextual factors that account for local disparities in diabetic outcomes among Black communities with a high versus low prevalence of diabetic complications and to enhance the monitoring of glycemic control in neighborhoods with especially poor diabetic outcomes. This K23 career development award will foster Dr. David Lee’s transition to becoming a fully-independent investigator capable of conducting high-impact research to enhance our understanding of local disparities in diabetic outcomes among communities with overwhelming diabetes burden.",Using Geographically Targeted and Community-Based Methods to Identify Factors Associated with Micro-Level Disparities in Diabetic Outcomes and Enhance Monitoring of Glycemic Control Among Black Men,9931224,K23DK110316,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Ambulatory Care ', ' Outpatient Care ', ' outpatient treatment ', ' Amputation ', ' Behavioral Sciences ', ' Clinical Investigator ', ' Communities ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Emergency Situation ', ' Emergencies ', ' Environment ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Geography ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health Promotion ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' promoting health ', ' Health Status ', ' Level of Health ', ' Glycosylated hemoglobin A ', ' Glycohemoglobin A ', ' Hb A1 ', ' Hb A1a+b ', ' Hb A1c ', ' HbA1 ', ' HbA1c ', ' Hemoglobin A(1) ', ' hemoglobin A1c ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Hospital Admission ', ' Interview ', ' Learning ', ' Lower Extremity ', ' Lower Limb ', ' Membrum inferius ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' New York ', ' New York City ', ' Play ', ' Poverty ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Primary Care ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Kidney Failure ', ' Kidney Insufficiency ', ' Renal Failure ', ' Renal Insufficiency ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Schools ', ' medical schools ', ' medical college ', ' school of medicine ', ' Social Sciences ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' Measures ', ' base ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Series ', ' Training ', ' social norm ', ' Trust ', ' diabetic ', ' Fostering ', ' Interdisciplinary Research ', ' Multidisciplinary Collaboration ', ' Multidisciplinary Research ', ' Interdisciplinary Study ', ' Collaborations ', ' Spottings ', ' Diabetes Complications ', ' Diabetes-Related Complications ', ' Diabetic Complications ', ' Complications of Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Source ', ' Application Context ', ' contextual factors ', ' Visit ', ' Emergency Department ', ' Emergency room ', ' Accident and Emergency department ', ' behavioral/social science ', ' diabetes education ', ' experience ', ' knowledgebase ', ' knowledge base ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Address ', ' qualitative reasoning ', ' Qualitative Methods ', ' Data ', ' High Prevalence ', ' K23 Award ', ' K23 Mechanism ', ' K23 Program ', ' Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award (K23) ', ' Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award ', ' Career Development Awards ', ' Career Development Awards and Programs ', ' Career Development Programs K-Series ', ' K-Awards ', ' Research Career Program ', ' K-Series Research Career Programs ', ' Research Training ', ' Subgroup ', ' Surveillance Methods ', ' Low Prevalence ', ' Monitor ', ' Hot Spot ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio-economically ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomics ', ' point of care ', ' Behavioral ', ' diabetic management ', ' diabetes management ', ' glycemic control ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' community based design ', ' community based research ', ' participatory action research ', ' community based participatory research ', ' high risk ', ' diabetes control ', ' amputated limb ', ' limb amputation ', ' food environment ', ' disparities in race ', ' race disparity ', ' racial disparity ', ' reduce disparity ', ' disparity reduction ', ' access to health care ', ' access to healthcare ', ' accessibility of health care ', ' accessibility to health care ', ' accessibility to healthcare ', ' health care access ', ' health care service access ', ' health care service availability ', ' healthcare access ', ' healthcare accessibility ', ' healthcare availability ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare service availability ', ' health care availability ', ' health care community ', ' healthcare community ', ' high risk group ', ' high risk population ', ' diabetes self-care ', ' diabetes self-management ', ' ']",NIDDK,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,K23,2020,197661,0.07579936405432622
"A Novel Approach to Disentangling the Relationship Between Neighborhood Environment, Adverse Childhood Experiences, and Childhood Obesity ABSTRACT Obesity populations on environmental obesity impacts 2.7 million American children. Children from racial/ethnic minority and low-income  have higher obesity prevalence, contributing to health disparities. Obesity reduction efforts focused individual health behavior change have seen limited success, resulting in calls to examine social and factors that contribute to obesity. A better understanding of complex risk factors for childhood can inform targeted interventions, clinical practice, and policy. 1 Adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) are one understudied complex risk factor for childhood obesity. ACEs are traumatic experiences that occur during childhood such as sexual abuse, family member incarceration, or witnessing violent crime. Almost half of children have experienced ACEs and populations with ACEs have higher obesity prevalence. ACEs can increase obesity risk via sequelae of chronic or severe stress or by hindering healthy behaviors, though the impact of ACEs on childhood obesity is not well understood. Multi-level research examining the influence of neighborhood environment on the ACEs-obesity relationships is particularly lacking. Neighborhood factors such as lack of access to healthcare and high crime may contribute to both ACEs and obesity via indirect and overlapping pathways. It is difficult to disentangle the impact of neighborhood factors because many co-occur within the broader context of neighborhood poverty and racial segregation; sophisticated approaches such as geospatial analysis, longitudinal research, and novel methods for quantifying neighborhood risk are necessary. This study will be the first to examine the relationship between neighborhood environment, ACEs, and childhood obesity using advanced statistical methods. Aims 1a and 1b entail development and testing of a neighborhood ACEs index using existing multi-level geospatial data. Aim 2 entails examining the relationship between the neighborhood ACEs index and childhood obesity incidence using existing longitudinal data. Aim 3 entails determining neighborhood factors most associated with ACEs exposure and childhood obesity in order to identify potential targets for intervention, clinical practice, and policy. This study has the potential to inform targeted efforts for improving the health of millions of children who experience ACEs and obesity. The associated Career Development Plan focuses on ACEs, advanced statistics, and geospatial analysis. The Plan will advance my ability to use diverse, multi-level, geospatial data to examine complex childhood obesity risk factors - a skillset rare among nurse scientists but directly relevant to my research on how social determinants of health impact obesity. The Plan includes expert mentorship, focused coursework, and training at the inaugural NICHD P50 Translational Center for Child Maltreatment Studies. Collectively, this study will advance knowledge about the impact of ACEs on childhood obesity and simultaneously further my career goal to establish a program of research on understanding and reducing childhood obesity disparities. PROJECT NARRATIVE Adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) are a risk factor for childhood obesity, though the ACEs-obesity relationship is not well understood. The impact of neighborhood environment is particularly understudied, despite its influence on both ACEs and obesity risk. This study will examine the relationship between neighborhood environment, ACEs, and childhood obesity in order to inform targeted approaches to reducing obesity for the millions of children who experience ACEs.","A Novel Approach to Disentangling the Relationship Between Neighborhood Environment, Adverse Childhood Experiences, and Childhood Obesity",9950270,K23HD101554,"['Accounting ', ' Behavior ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' children ', "" childrens' "", ' youngster ', ' Complement ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Crime ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Environment ', ' Exercise ', ' Family ', ' Geography ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health Personnel ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' health care worker ', ' health provider ', ' health workforce ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' medical personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' Health Policy ', ' health care policy ', ' healthcare policy ', ' Household ', ' Incidence ', ' indexing ', ' Low Income Population ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' New York City ', ' Nurses ', ' nurse ', ' Obesity ', ' adiposity ', ' corpulence ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulentia ', ' obese ', ' obese people ', ' obese person ', ' obese population ', ' Philadelphia ', ' Poverty ', ' Psychometrics ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Schools ', ' Science ', ' statistics ', ' Stress ', ' Testing ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' segregation ', ' Racial Segregation ', ' Caregivers ', ' Care Givers ', ' Family member ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Chronic ', ' incarcerated ', ' incarceration ', ' Imprisonment ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' psychological ', ' psychologic ', ' Domestic Violence ', ' Training ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' Individual ', ' Policies ', ' Development Plans ', ' Funding ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Physiopathology ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Collaborations ', ' sex abuse ', ' sexually abused ', ' Sexual abuse ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' foster care ', ' Complex ', ' System ', ' physical health ', ' physical conditioning ', ' psychosocial ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' social ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' career development ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Low income ', ' Data ', ' NICHD ', "" National Institute of Children's Health and Human Development "", ' National Institute of Child Health and Human Development ', ' randomisation ', ' randomization ', ' randomly assigned ', ' Randomized ', ' Career Development Awards ', ' Career Development Awards and Programs ', ' Career Development Programs K-Series ', ' K-Awards ', ' Research Career Program ', ' K-Series Research Career Programs ', ' Sum ', ' Childhood maltreatment ', ' child maltreatment ', ' Child Abuse and Neglect ', ' Validation ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' child adiposity ', ' child obesity ', ' childhood adiposity ', ' childhood obesity ', ' obese children ', ' obesity during childhood ', ' pediatric obesity ', ' obesity in children ', ' new approaches ', ' novel approaches ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel strategies ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' ethnic minority ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' risk for obesity ', ' risk of obesity ', ' obesity risk ', ' Health behavior change ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' clinical practice ', ' social health determinants ', ' Faculty Education ', ' Faculty Training ', ' Teacher Education ', ' Teacher Educator ', ' Teacher Preparation ', ' Teacher Training ', ' faculty development ', ' faculty professional development ', ' instructor training ', ' teacher development ', ' Teacher Professional Development ', ' screening ', ' violent crime ', ' access to health care ', ' access to healthcare ', ' accessibility of health care ', ' accessibility to health care ', ' accessibility to healthcare ', ' health care access ', ' health care service access ', ' health care service availability ', ' healthcare access ', ' healthcare accessibility ', ' healthcare availability ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare service availability ', ' health care availability ', ' Child Health ', ' adult adiposity ', ' adults with obesity ', ' adult obesity ', ' adverse childhood experiences ', ' adverse childhood events ', ' Obesity Epidemic ', ' social factors ', ' ']",NICHD,TEMPLE UNIV OF THE COMMONWEALTH,K23,2020,129867,0.13462654499404916
"Integration of Socio-Spatial Data for Neighborhoods with Multi-omic profiles to Identify and Mitigate Factors Affecting Risk of ALzheimer's Disease Alzheimer’s disease (AD) affects a higher proportion of Hispanics - the fastest growing group of older adults in the U.S. - than Caucasians, and at younger ages. The causes of these differences are unknown, partly due to underrepresentation of Hispanics in AD research. Uncovering the reasons for this disparity may provide insight into the causes of AD and help to develop solutions and is this project's goal. Robust findings have linked the social and physical characteristics of neighborhoods to cognitive health, and the neighborhood - el barrio - is known to be important to Hispanic populations. However, identifying specific contextual and individual factors that affect risk of AD is a complex problem. This project aims to determine the effects of neighborhood factors on AD-like cognitive trajectories in Hispanic Americans, by a novel approach that integrates 1) individual differences revealed by high-dimensional multi-omics (genetic and metabolic molecular markers) and 2) mediation/moderation by family and neighborhood dynamics. Our access to a Mexican American cohort - the San Antonio Mexican American Family Study (SAFS) - will enable us to test if variations in AD-like cognitive trajectories across neighborhoods are explained exclusively by individual characteristics, or depend at least partly on social and physical elements of neighborhoods. SAFS participants have been deeply characterized for almost 30 years, including clinical (cardiometabolic and cognitive trajectories), structural neuroimaging, and environmental data; whole-genome sequencing (WGS), and other -omics (e.g., metabolic profiles, epigenomics, protein and RNA expression patterns). The specific aims of this project are to 1) determine if familism provides protection from AD-like cognitive decline compared to non-AD like cognitive decline in Mexican Americans; 2) analyze the associations between social and built environments of different neighborhoods and AD-like cognitive trajectories, by using online street imagery analysis of 17 neighborhoods within each of which at least 30 SAFS participants reside; 3) detect environmental (social and spatial) signals at neighborhood and family levels, reflected in any high-dimensional metabolomic/lipidomic, epigenomic, and transcriptomic biomarkers we find correlated with risk of AD-like cognitive decline; and 4) exploit the results to provide guidance for neighborhood-based projects aimed at decreasing the risk of AD-like cognitive decline, by developing a strategic communication toolkit, and convening a forum that will engage diverse stakeholders, particularly neighborhood designers and city planners. Overall, the results will elucidate pathways through which neighborhood-specific factors contribute to AD-like cognitive decline in Hispanics, offering new approaches to mitigation of AD. Alzheimer´s disease (AD) disproportionately impacts Hispanics/Latinos residing in the US, but the reasons are unknown. The physical and social features of living environments – the neighborhood or el barrio for Mexican Americans – likely influence the relationship between the aging process and individuals' cognitive trajectories but dissecting such contextual versus individual effects upon risk of Alzheimer´s disease (AD) is a complex problem. To overcome this knowledge gap, this project aims to determine the effects of neighborhood on AD-like cognitive trajectories in Mexican Americans, by a novel approach that integrates 1) individual differences revealed by high-dimensional -omics data and 2) mediation by family and el barrio dynamics; together yielding new evidence to assist neighborhood and city planners and policymakers to improve outcomes in this fastest-growing elderly population in the U.S.",Integration of Socio-Spatial Data for Neighborhoods with Multi-omic profiles to Identify and Mitigate Factors Affecting Risk of ALzheimer's Disease,10095572,DP1AG069870,"['Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', ' Aging ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' AD dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer syndrome ', "" Alzheimer's "", "" Alzheimer's disease dementia "", ' Alzheimers Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Cities ', ' Communication ', ' Elements ', ' Environment ', ' Family ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Hispanic Americans ', ' Spanish Americans ', ' Mexican Americans ', ' Chicanas ', ' Chicanos ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Research ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Social Environment ', ' social climate ', ' social context ', ' socioenvironment ', ' socioenvironmental ', ' Testing ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Transcription ', ' Caucasians ', ' Caucasian ', ' Caucasian Race ', ' Caucasoid ', ' Caucasoid Race ', ' Occidental ', ' white race ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Latino Population ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' hispanic community ', ' Hispanics ', ' Latino ', ' Imagery ', ' base ', ' Family Study ', ' Clinical ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Link ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Metabolic ', ' Genetic ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' cognitive loss ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' Knowledge ', ' Complex ', ' Pattern ', ' cohort ', ' Structure ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' neuroimaging ', ' Participant ', ' Negotiating ', ' Negotiation ', ' Mediation ', ' social ', ' protein expression ', ' metabolism measurement ', ' metabonomics ', ' metabolomics ', ' genome sequencing ', ' Data ', ' Cognitive ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' epigenomics ', ' new approaches ', ' novel approaches ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel strategies ', ' Population ', ' Individual Differences ', ' transcriptomics ', ' Alzheimer risk factor ', ' alzheimer risk ', "" Alzheimer's disease risk "", ' molecular biomarker ', ' molecular marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' built environment ', ' multiomics ', ' multiple omics ', ' improved outcome ', ' metabolic profile ', ' entire genome ', ' full genome ', ' whole genome ', ' high dimensionality ', ' cardiometabolic ', ' cardiometabolism ', ' ']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS RIO GRANDE VALLEY,DP1,2020,2906000,0.014983296797157831
"Modeling and Forecasting Atherosclerotic Risk: A Complex Systems Approach Project Summary/Abstract Inequality in health outcomes in relation to Americans' socioeconomic status (SES) is rising: a recent study by the Brookings Institution found that life expectancy for men and women in the top 10% of career earnings was over 10 years greater than those in the bottom 10%. Cardiovascular disease – still leading cause of death for Americans – merits study with respect to these findings. More research on how SES affects atherosclerotic risk is needed. The goal of our project is to develop advanced forecasting algorithms for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD)-related events – both at baseline and longitudinally – using systems-based modeling methodologies which incorporate probabilistic representations of patients' socioeconomic and environmental characteristics. This represents a paradigm shift beyond existing models used in guiding primary and secondary prevention of atherosclerotic disease; in particular, risk models developed by the American College of Cardiology Foundation and the American Heart Association (ACCF/AHA) are based solely on physiological risk factors. We believe that the prediction performance of ASCVD risk models can be significantly improved by incorporating socioeconomic and environmental risks, especially in an era where improved primary and secondary prevention and increased socioeconomic inequality have resulted in complex phenomena among elderly Americans with respect to ASCVD risk. Our preliminary work indicates a significant degree of neighborhood-level variability in major ASCVD events (myocardial infarction, stroke or cardiovascular death), with low-SES neighborhoods associated with event rates over three times that of high-SES neighborhoods. Moreover, neighborhood SES explained four times the amount of neighborhood-level variation in ASCVD event rates than that explained by the ACCF/AHA Pooled Cohort Equations Risk Model. Our proposed project will therefore provide an essential risk modeling platform to health care systems focused on optimizing the health of populations that are highly heterogeneous with respect to socioeconomic and environmental characteristics. These models will be developed in a team-based environment, including translational scientists from general internal medicine, cardiology, social work, spatial epidemiology, urban poverty, community development, immunology, and data and population health sciences. Informing the models will be a newly-established, cutting-edge regional research registry, based on electronic health data from Northeast Ohio's two largest health systems, Cleveland Clinic and MetroHealth. Ultimately, this research is anticipated to yield new mechanistic insights and hypotheses, more accurate prediction models for cardiovascular outcomes, and a basis for informing decisions at multiple strategic and programmatic levels. Project Narrative Poorer Americans are now expected to live 10 fewer years than wealthier Americans. Doctors and other providers need tools to identify people who are at greatest risk of poor heart disease outcomes. Our research will improve on current approaches by understanding the complexity of neighborhood, economic and clinical factors and how they determine heart disease risk.",Modeling and Forecasting

"The Relations Between Neighborhood and Family Factors in the Healthy Development of African American Youth ABSTRACT Understanding the adoption of early healthy coping patterns in children and young adolescents who live in violent contexts can reveal strengths that are vital in both families and individuals who reside in neighborhoods characterized by high crime, poverty, racial segregation and family stress. Research has shown that youth who consistently experience and witness community violence in their neighborhoods are at increased risk for psychological issues such as PTSD, depression, and anxiety. Scholars have indicated that for African American populations, subjective measures such as reports of neighborhood stress are associated with more psychological distress, while youth perceptions of neighborhood cohesion are related to lower levels of psychological stress. Coming home to a family who is aware of and discussing explicitly coping measures to be taken in such contexts allows youth to develop resilience that gives them the tools necessary to look beyond their environment to a different future. One such tool is racial-ethnic socialization (RES), defined as the transmission of attitudes, beliefs and values surrounding race/ethnicity. The focus of this proposed project is to understand how neighborhood factors are related to race-related socialization and healthy development of African American children. The proposed project will collect data from a sample of 100 African American children ages 8-15 and their parents within the first two years of the study to explore how subjective and objective characteristics of neighborhoods is associated with mental health outcomes. Additionally, we seek to understand if RES moderates the effects of neighborhood factors on mental health outcomes. We will be using the collected data to examine each of our aims. Aim 1 identifies objective and subjective neighborhood profiles that serve as a basis for understanding how these profiles link to mental health outcomes for youth (Aim 2). Finally, Aim 3 examines how neighborhood profiles and mental health outcomes can be mitigated by ERS, providing evidence-based data for future interventions in racial-ethnic socialization. The Relation Between Neighborhood and Family Factors in the Healthy Development of  African American Youth Project Narrative The proposed research examines how subjective and objective measures of neighborhoods are related to the healthy development of African Americans. The study also examines how racial/ethnic socialization is associated neighborhood impact on mental health outcomes. Achievement of the aims could lead to the development of interventions focused on improving health and reducing health disparities for African American youth.",The Relations Between Neighborhood and Family Factors in the Healthy Development of African American Youth,9889156,SC2GM130440,"['Achievement ', ' Achievement Attainment ', ' Adolescence ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' Adoption ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Aggressive behavior ', ' Aggression ', ' Anxiety ', ' Attitude ', ' Awareness ', ' Belief ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' children ', "" childrens' "", ' youngster ', ' Cluster Analysis ', ' Cluster Analyses ', ' Color ', ' Communities ', ' Community Surveys ', ' Crime ', ' Statistical Data Interpretation ', ' Statistical Data Analyses ', ' Statistical Data Analysis ', ' statistical analysis ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Environment ', ' Family ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Parent-Child Relations ', ' Parent-Child Relationship ', ' parent child interaction ', ' parent offspring interaction ', ' Parents ', ' Perception ', ' Poverty ', ' Race ', ' Racial Group ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Socialization ', ' statistics ', ' Stress ', ' Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders ', ' PTSD ', ' Post-Traumatic Neuroses ', ' Posttraumatic Neuroses ', ' Posttraumatic Stress Disorders ', ' post-trauma stress disorder ', ' posttrauma stress disorder ', ' traumatic neurosis ', ' Psychological Stress ', ' Psychologic Stress ', ' Testing ', ' Violence ', ' violent ', ' violent behavior ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' segregation ', ' Racial Segregation ', ' Afro American ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Black Populations ', ' black American ', ' African American ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Youth ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' psychological ', ' psychologic ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' juvenile ', ' juvenile human ', ' Adolescent ', ' Link ', ' Individual ', ' adult youth ', ' young adulthood ', ' young adult ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Exposure to ', ' tool ', ' Emotional well being ', ' Feels well ', ' Normal mental condition ', ' Normal mental state ', ' Normal psyche ', ' Psychological Well Being ', ' Sense of well-being ', ' emotional wellbeing ', ' mental well-being ', ' mental wellbeing ', ' psychological wellbeing ', ' psychological wellness ', ' self wellness ', ' sense of wellbeing ', ' Well in self ', ' Dimensions ', ' Home ', ' Home environment ', ' Pattern ', ' Equation ', ' experience ', ' 6-11 years old ', ' middle childhood ', ' stressor ', ' college student ', ' university student ', ' cohesion ', ' Structure ', ' Prevention ', ' Reporting ', ' parent monitoring ', ' parental monitoring ', ' psychological distress ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Subgroup ', ' Collection ', ' Transmission ', ' transmission process ', ' Characteristics ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' resilience ', ' Outcome ', ' coping ', ' Population ', ' 5 years of age ', ' age 5 years ', ' five year old ', ' five years of age ', ' 5 year old ', ' 17 years of age ', ' age 17 years ', ' seventeen year old ', ' seventeen years of age ', ' 17 year old ', ' ethnic minority ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' community safety ', ' neighborhood safety ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' develop therapy ', ' intervention development ', ' treatment development ', ' therapy development ', ' evidence base ', ' early adolescence ', ' coping mechanism ', ' exposure to violence ', ' violence exposure ', ' ']",NIGMS,CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY NORTHRIDGE,SC2,2020,145000,0.14081784864045055
"Examining the effects of neighborhood factors and geography on racial/ethnic disparities on achieving sustained viral suppression Project Summary/Abstract  The risk of HIV transmission and disease progression to AIDS decreases among people living with HIV (PLHIV) that have achieved viral suppression. Prior studies have measured the last viral load in a year to assess viral suppression. However, this single measurement only provides viral suppression status at a single point in time and does not indicate sustained viral suppression throughout a year (all viral load tests within a year <200 copies/mL). Particularly, PLHIV belonging to racial/ethnic minority groups are challenged by barriers to achieving and maintaining viral suppression. Some of these barriers are related to physical and social neighborhood factors such as living in economically deprived neighborhoods. There has been little research to date about the role of neighborhood factors in achieving sustained viral suppression. Therefore, the objective of this F31 study is to assess the contribution of neighborhood, geographic and distance factors on racial/ethnic disparities in sustained viral suppression. To address this objective, secondary data analysis will be conducted using administrative data from the Miami-Dade County Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program, which provides HIV care and treatment to approximately 9,600 underserved and uninsured minority PLHIV. This proposed research study aims to (1) identify individual and neighborhood level factors that are associated with residing in geographic hotspots of low sustained viral suppression, (2) identify the moderating effect of neighborhood disadvantage on the association between race/ethnicity and sustained viral suppression, and (3) examine the moderating effect of race/ethnicity on the association between sustained viral suppression and travel time and distance to HIV case management sites and AIDS Drug Assistance Program pharmacies. The central hypothesis is that neighborhood disadvantage and distance to HIV care facility will contribute to racial/ethnic disparities in achieving sustained viral suppression. The proposed study will use multi-level mixed effects modeling to estimate the association between individual and neighborhood factors and sustained viral suppression and geographic information system tools to identify hotspots of sustained viral suppression and to determine travel time and distance to HIV care facilities. In order to successfully implement this proposed study and launch the research career of a young minority investigator, training in the following 5 areas are proposed: (1) HIV care and treatment disparities, (2) neighborhood and geographic determinants of HIV disparities, (3) multilevel mixed modeling, (4) spatial statistics, and (5) responsible conduct of research and professional development (grant and scientific writing). This study and training experience will facilitate the applicant’s development towards becoming an independent health disparities researcher and provide essential skills to help her successfully compete for a post-doctoral grant or an early career development grant funding. Furthermore, findings from this study will identify neighborhood, geographic, and distance factors that may be targeted to ensure consistent and long-term viral load suppression for vulnerable PLHIV. Project Narrative  Sustained HIV viral suppression minimizes HIV transmission risk to others. Therefore, this study will identify neighborhood predictors and geographic factors on disparities of racial/ethnic minorities achieving sustained viral suppression. The findings from this study will guide the development of appropriate location- based interventions for marginalized population to improve HIV outcomes.",Examining the effects of neighborhood factors and geography on racial/ethnic disparities on achieving sustained viral suppression,10013625,F31MD015234,"['Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome ', ' AIDS ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immuno-Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immunologic Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Affect ', ' Cities ', ' Continuity of Patient Care ', ' Continuity of Care ', ' Continuum of Care ', ' Counseling ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Epidemic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiologic ', ' epidemiological ', ' Face ', ' faces ', ' facial ', ' Geographic Factor ', ' Geography ', ' Grant ', ' Health care facility ', ' Health Facilities ', ' Healthcare Facility ', ' care facilities ', ' HIV ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' indexing ', ' Methods ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Pharmacy facility ', ' Pharmacies ', ' Poverty ', ' Psychosocial Factor ', ' psychosocial variables ', ' Race ', ' Racial Group ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Research ', ' Research Design ', ' Study Type ', ' study design ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' statistics ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Travel ', ' Woman ', ' Writing ', ' County ', ' Measures ', ' Treatment outcome ', ' Factor Analyses ', ' Factor Analysis ', ' Case Management ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Latino Population ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' hispanic community ', ' Hispanics ', ' diverse populations ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' population diversity ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' Uninsured ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Economical Factors ', ' Economic Factors ', ' Logistic Regressions ', ' Ensure ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Measurement ', ' Disease Progression ', ' communicable disease transmission ', ' infectious disease transmission ', ' disease transmission ', ' Funding ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R01 Program ', ' Research Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' tool ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Viral Burden ', ' Viral Load ', ' Viral Load result ', ' Pattern ', ' Location ', ' Country ', ' Viral ', ' Application Context ', ' contextual factors ', ' Postdoc ', ' Research Associate ', ' post-doc ', ' post-doctoral ', ' Postdoctoral Fellow ', ' experience ', ' metropolitan ', ' skills ', ' research study ', ' Economically Deprived ', ' economic disadvantage ', ' economically disadvantaged ', ' underclass ', ' Economically Deprived Population ', ' Predictive Factor ', ' social ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' AIDS/HIV ', ' HIV/AIDS ', ' HIV/AIDS problem ', ' AIDS/HIV problem ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' geospatial information system ', ' Geographic Information Systems ', ' Modeling ', ' career development ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' HIV diagnosis ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' AIDS test ', ' AIDS/HIV test ', ' HIV test ', ' HIV-1 test ', ' HIV-2 test ', ' Human immunodeficiency virus test ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' investigator training ', ' Transmission ', ' transmission process ', ' Modification ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio-economically ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomics ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' intervention design ', ' treatment design ', ' therapy design ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' health equity ', ' responsible research conduct ', ' retention strategy ', ' student retention ', ' retention rate ', ' minority investigator ', ' Haitian ', ' neighborhood disadvantage ', ' disparities in treatment ', ' treatment disparity ', ' barrier to health care ', ' barrier to healthcare ', ' barrier to treatment ', ' obstacle to care ', ' obstacle to healthcare ', ' barrier to care ', ' health care outcomes ', ' healthcare outcomes ', ' care outcomes ', ' social factors ', ' ']",NIMHD,FLORIDA INTERNATIONAL UNIVERSITY,F31,2020,34061,0.10272232017183046
"Urban Revitalization and Long-Term Effects on Diet, Economic, and Health Outcomes Project Abstract Improving access to healthful foods such as fruits, vegetables, and whole grains has been an important policy strategy, intended to improve diet and reduce obesity among vulnerable populations. In our parent grant (Does a New Supermarket Improve Dietary Behaviors of Low-income African Americans? R01CA149105), our team capitalized on a natural experiment in which a Healthy Food Financing Initiative (HFFI)-supported full-service supermarket (FSS) was opened in an underserved area. In 2011, we enrolled a cohort (N=1,372) of randomly selected households from an intervention neighborhood (that received the new FSS) and a similar comparison neighborhood and followed the cohort from prior to the FSS’s opening through one year post-opening. We found that intervention neighborhood residents had some dietary improvements – lower added sugars, calories, and saturated fats, alcohols and added sugars (SoFAAS). However, use of the new FSS, the hypothesized mediator, was not associated with dietary changes. The proposed renewal grant seeks to examine whether the socioeconomic impact that the new FSS or anticipation of it and other developments among investors, had on the neighborhood might be responsible for the dietary improvements we observed. It also taps into a new opportunity to examine the effect of much larger ongoing and impending revitalization of the intervention neighborhood on neighborhood socioeconomic conditions and diet. Addressing these research questions will help us to better understand and to replicate the dietary improvements of placing an FSS in a food desert. Results will speak to the substantial literature linking neighborhood socioeconomic conditions, diet, and weight, largely limited to cross-sectional studies. We will also examine the extent to which the dietary improvements we observed in our parent study are maintained, and the pathways by which neighborhood socioeconomic conditions may impact diet. To achieve this, we will obtain and merge secondary retrospective and prospective data concerning neighborhood socioeconomic conditions (NSEC) of the intervention and control neighborhoods with existing survey data and neighborhood audits, and collect two additional waves of survey and audit data capturing the impending major neighborhood revitalization projects that are underway or in development. Data will be analyzed using difference in difference and structural modeling approaches to test the impact of these natural experiments and the hypothesized causal pathway from neighborhood change to dietary improvement. Thus, the proposed renewal will capitalize on our existing data, cohort, and research infrastructure to address critically important follow-on questions and will be the first study, to our knowledge, to test whether SES improvements at the neighborhood and individual level are associated with improved diet and weight status. Project Narrative Improving access to healthful foods such as fruits, vegetables, and whole grains has been a highly touted policy strategy, intending to improve diet and reduce obesity among vulnerable populations. Our parent study documented some improvements in diet among residents after the opening of a full-service supermarket in a low-income, predominantly African American neighborhood in Pittsburgh, PA. However, we found no association between use of the new supermarket and the dietary improvements. Our proposed study will continue to follow the randomly selected cohort to examine whether dietary changes are maintained, and to what degree a very large additional investment in the neighborhood results in dietary improvements. It is possible that the opening of the new supermarket created a neighborhood-level shift in socioeconomic conditions and, although much literature exists around neighborhood socioeconomic status (SES) and its association with diet and weight status, we know of no studies that have linked shifts in SES to changes in diet or weight. Should neighborhood SES improvement underlie dietary improvements, neighborhood investments other than increased access to healthful food might serve the same function and should be considered.","Urban Revitalization and Long-Term Effects on Diet, Economic, and Health Outcomes",9985738,R01CA149105,"['Alcohols ', ' Alcohol Chemical Class ', ' Behavior ', ' Energy Intake ', ' Caloric Intake ', ' caloric dietary content ', ' Crime ', ' Cross-Sectional Studies ', ' Cross Sectional Analysis ', ' Cross-Sectional Analyses ', ' Cross-Sectional Survey ', ' Disease Frequency Surveys ', ' Diet ', ' dietary ', ' Dietary Fiber ', ' whole grain ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Economics ', ' Food ', ' Food or Food Product ', ' Future ', ' Geographic Locations ', ' Geographic Area ', ' Geographic Region ', ' Geographical Location ', ' geographic site ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' Health Promotion ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' promoting health ', ' Household ', ' Incentives ', ' Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Economical Income ', ' Investments ', ' Literature ', ' Long-Term Effects ', ' Longterm Effects ', ' Structural Models ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Obesity ', ' adiposity ', ' corpulence ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulentia ', ' obese ', ' obese people ', ' obese person ', ' obese population ', ' Parents ', ' Play ', ' Poverty ', ' Research ', ' Stress ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Testing ', ' Weight ', ' Measures ', ' Afro American ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Black Populations ', ' black American ', ' African American ', ' Mediating ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' socio-economic position ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' Cannot see a future ', ' Feels there is no future ', ' Loss of hope for the future ', ' Negative about the future ', ' No hope for the future ', ' hopelessness ', ' Feeling hopeless ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Link ', ' Individual ', ' sugar ', ' Policies ', ' healthy food ', ' Health Food ', ' Calories ', ' Supermarket ', ' Services ', ' saturated dietary fat ', ' saturated dietary lipid ', ' saturated lipid ', ' saturated fat ', ' cohort ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' response ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' Dietary intake ', ' Low income ', ' Mediator ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Improve Access ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Process ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio-economically ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomics ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' Food Access ', ' Outcome ', ' prospective ', ' Natural experiment ', ' fruits and vegetables ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' parent grant ', ' secondary analysis ', ' ']",NCI,RAND CORPORATION,R01,2020,745974,0.08183715879133904
"Accelerating Excellence in Translational Science (AXIS) Abstract This project will use national and local incidence, mortality and testing data, with GIS driven agent-based disease modelling to identify the “neighborhood effects” that drive the uneven patterns of transmission and serious outcomes from COVID-19. Neighborhood environments have been associated with chronic disease mortality, disability, cumulative stress, cognitive decline, loss of physical functioning. These same neighborhood effects are implicit in exacerbating disparities in the spread and health outcomes of COVID-19, however the exact mechanisms and the magnitude of the impact of entrenched social disparities specifically on COVID-19 outcomes are not yet known. The key hypothesis is that agent based disease spread modeling of the existing retrospective COVID-19 data sources at the national and local levels with geospatial data input and spatial-temporal analysis will provide powerful knowledge on the structural factors that influenced the pandemic’s spread in local areas and will facilitate the development of valuable recommendations on how to mitigate current and future disparities in impacts of COVID-19 and other future infectious epidemics and pandemics. We will test our key hypothesis and accomplish our objectives via the following Specific Aims. Determine what Counties factors related to the social determinants of health have influenced the spread of coronavirus in the United States.  1) Determine, within the identified Counties, which social determinants have had significant  impact on either spread or inhibit spread of CV-19.  2) Determine which populations groups have been impacted more severely in these local  contexts and why?  3) Determine what specific recommendations can be made from these findings? The expected outcomes of this research are published manuscripts and scholarly presentations that provide science- based recommendations on the how health authorities and policy makers can proactively address social factors that amplify disease and poor health outcomes in certain communities.

"Built Environment, Pedestrian Injuries and Deep Learning (BEPIDL) Study PROJECT SUMMARY Road traffic injuries are a major contributor to the burden of disease globally with nearly 1.3 million deaths globally and as many as 50 million injured annually with pedestrians and cyclists in low and middle-income countries (LMICs) among the most affected. Road infrastructure of the built environment (e.g., sidewalks), neighborhood design (e.g., street connectivity) and urban development (e.g., urban sprawl) are key determinants of the risk of pedestrian injuries. In LMICs, poor road infrastructure and neighborhood design are acknowledged as being important contributors to rising numbers of road traffic injuries and deaths, but there are few studies systematically identifying and quantifying what specific features of the built environment are contributing to motor vehicle collisions in these settings. Within LMIC cities, there are often large disparities where infrastructure is improved that reflect socioeconomic characteristics, leading to health inequities in road traffic injury. The paucity of georeferenced data on the built environment in LMICs has made research on road traffic injuries more difficult, though recent advances in computer vision and image analysis combined with Big Data of publicly available, georeferenced, images of roads worldwide (e.g., Google Street View, GSV) can help overcome the paucity of data and the cost and time limitations of collecting and analyzing data on the built environment in LMICs. Automated image analysis has largely been made possible via deep learning, a subfield of artificial intelligence and machine learning and relies on training neural networks to detect and label specific objects within images. These methods can drastically reduce the barriers to citywide built environment and traffic safety research in LMIC cities, thus substantially increasing research capacity and generalizability. My career goal is to become an independent investigator in global urban health with a focus on road safety and the built environment in LMICs. I propose undertaking research and training in deep learning methods applied to public health in the setting of Bogota, Colombia: 1) Develop neural networks to create a database of BE features of the road infrastructure from image data and to create neighborhood typologies from those features; 2) Assess the association between neighborhood-level BE features and typologies and pedestrian collisions and fatalities and road safety perceptions; 3) Assess the association of neighborhood social environment characteristics with pedestrian collision and fatalities, perceptions, and BE features and typologies. I am seeking additional training in 1) developing competency in deep learning methods applied to public health; 2) creating neighborhood indictors and typologies of health and the built environment; 3) applying Bayesian spatiotemporal models to understand how neighborhood characteristics and typologies influence health; 4) develop skills in multi-country collaboration, grant writing and overseeing research projects in LMICs. PROJECT NARRATIVE Roads and neighborhoods with a built environment that support safe and active transportation are a major priority in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) due to 90% of road traffic deaths occurring in these locations, especially to pedestrians and other vulnerable road users, yet data on key built environment features at a large scale are not always readily available in these settings. My career goal is to improve population health by examining the effects of the built environment and transportation on health through the adoption and use of methods that can leverage Big Data sources and answer complex, multilevel research questions by overcoming the lack of built environment data in LMICs. The proposed research uses deep learning and advanced statistical methods to create a citywide dataset of built and social environment features in Bogota, Colombia that will provide crucial data to answer questions of their impact on pedestrian injuries and deaths, as well as assessing the presence of health inequities in their distribution and that will lay the groundwork to expand these efforts to more cities in Latin America and other LMICs.","Built Environment, Pedestrian Injuries and Deep Learning (BEPIDL) Study",10123391,K01TW011782,"['deep learning ', ' Infrastructure ', ' neural network ', ' automated image analysis ', ' data infrastructure ', ' Adoption ', ' Affect ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Cities ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Colombia ', ' Computer Vision Systems ', ' computer vision ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Collection ', ' Data Sources ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Latin America ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Mathematics ', ' Math ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' Persons ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Perception ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Risk ', ' Safety ', ' Social Environment ', ' social climate ', ' social context ', ' socioenvironment ', ' socioenvironmental ', ' Time ', ' Transportation ', ' Typology ', ' Urban Developments ', ' Urban Health ', ' Writing ', ' Competence ', ' Research Methods ', ' Research Methodology ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' injuries ', ' Injury ', ' career ', ' Label ', ' improved ', ' Image Analyses ', ' image evaluation ', ' image interpretation ', ' Image Analysis ', ' Training ', ' Discipline ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Databases ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R01 Program ', ' Research Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Collaborations ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Adopted ', ' Complex ', ' Location ', ' Country ', ' computer imaging ', ' digital imaging ', ' experience ', ' computer science ', ' skills ', ' social ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Modeling ', ' career development ', ' Data ', ' Research Training ', ' Characteristics ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio-economically ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomics ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' pedestrian injury ', ' cost ', ' injured ', ' burden of disease ', ' disease burden ', ' years of life lost to disability ', ' years of life lost to disease ', ' burden of illness ', ' virtual ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Automobile collision ', ' Automobile crash ', ' Car collision ', ' Car crash ', ' Motor vehicle collision ', ' Motor vehicle crash ', ' Vehicular collision ', ' Vehicular crash ', ' Vehicle crash ', ' spatiotemporal ', ' high risk ', ' population health ', ' neighborhood association ', ' BigData ', ' Big Data ', ' built environment ', ' learning activity ', ' learning method ', ' learning strategy ', ' LMIC ', ' low and middle-income countries ', ' ']",FIC,DREXEL UNIVERSITY,K01,2020,138024,-0.0037022980396792197
"A Social Epigenomic Approach to Health Disparities in Cardiovascular Risk Factors A SOCIAL EPIGENOMIC APPROACH TO HEALTH DISPARITIES IN CARDIOVASCULAR RISK FACTORS Individual-level socioeconomic factors such as education, income/wealth, and occupation have long been known to profoundly affect risk for cardiovascular diseases, and these effects accumulate across the life course to create systematic disadvantage that manifests in a wide range of health disparities. In addition, there is now increasing evidence that neighborhood-level disadvantage also negatively impacts cardiovascular health, both cross-sectionally and longitudinally, even after accounting for individual-level socioeconomic factors. One mechanism by which individual-level and neighborhood-level disadvantage may influence cardiovascular health is through epigenomic modifications of genes regulating adaptive cellular pathways (e.g. inflammation and immune response). To better understand the biological mechanisms underlying health disparities in cardiovascular disease, we propose to investigate the impact of individual and neighborhood disadvantage on the epigenome. We will conduct the discovery work in two epidemiologic studies – the Multi- Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA, N=1,264) and the Genetic Epidemiology Network of Arteriopathy (GENOA, N=1,728) – and replicate our results in other cohorts with similar measures, including the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities study (ARIC, N=3,911) and the Health and Retirement Study (HRS, N=2,000). This multi-cohort strategy increases scientific rigor by reducing false positives while improving our higher-dimensional understanding of the social epigenomic architecture underlying cardiovascular disease. To facilitate this multi-cohort approach, we will begin by harmonizing the measures of individual and neighborhood disadvantage (Aim 1) to enable us to identify and replicate DNA methylation (DNAm) sites that are associated with these measures of disadvantage (Aim 2) and then evaluate whether the DNAm sites are mediators of the well-established relationships between disadvantage and cardiovascular risk factors (Aim 3). Finally, we will perform pathway analysis to characterize the key biological pathways implicated by the DNAm sites identified in the previous Aims, and investigate their association with gene expression in MESA and GENOA (Aim 4). Narrative: In this project, we will use state-of-the-art methods to identify how socioeconomic factors and neighborhood conditions impact the epigenome, leading to disparities in cardiovascular risk factors such as hypertension, diabetes, and obesity. .",A Social Epigenomic Approach to Health Disparities in Cardiovascular Risk Factors,9852551,R01HL141292,"['Accounting ', ' Affect ', ' Aging ', ' Architecture ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Blood Pressure ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Adult-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Ketosis-Resistant Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Maturity-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' NIDDM ', ' Non-Insulin Dependent Diabetes ', ' Noninsulin Dependent Diabetes ', ' Noninsulin Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Slow-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Stable Diabetes Mellitus ', ' T2 DM ', ' T2D ', ' T2DM ', ' Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Type 2 diabetes ', ' Type II Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Type II diabetes ', ' adult onset diabetes ', ' ketosis resistant diabetes ', ' maturity onset diabetes ', ' type 2 DM ', ' type II DM ', ' type two diabetes ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Genes ', ' Genome ', ' Heart ', ' Hypertension ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' high blood pressure ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Economical Income ', ' Inflammation ', ' Insulin ', ' Humulin R ', ' Novolin R ', ' Regular Insulin ', ' Life Cycle Stages ', ' Life Cycle ', ' life course ', ' Lipids ', ' Methods ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Obesity ', ' adiposity ', ' corpulence ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulentia ', ' obese ', ' obese people ', ' obese person ', ' obese population ', ' Occupations ', ' Jobs ', ' Professional Positions ', ' Promoter Regions ', ' Promotor Regions ', ' genetic promoter element ', ' genetic promoter sequence ', ' promoter sequence ', ' Research ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Social Environment ', ' social climate ', ' social context ', ' socioenvironment ', ' socioenvironmental ', ' Socioeconomic Factors ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Mediating ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Biological ', ' Individual ', ' Measurement ', ' Arteriopathy ', ' Arterial Disorder ', ' CpG-Rich Islands ', ' CpG Islands ', ' Immunological response ', ' host response ', ' immunoresponse ', ' Immune response ', ' DNA Methylation ', ' Diastolic Pressure ', ' Diastolic blood pressure ', ' waist circumference ', ' Physical environment ', ' cohort ', ' Negotiating ', ' Negotiation ', ' Mediation ', ' Epidemiologic Research ', ' Epidemiologic Studies ', ' Epidemiological Studies ', ' Epidemiology Research ', ' epidemiologic investigation ', ' epidemiology study ', ' social ', ' cardiovascular risk ', ' cardiovascular risk factor ', ' Network Analysis ', ' Pathway Analysis ', ' genetic epidemiologic study ', ' genetic epidemiology ', ' cardiovascular disease risk ', ' cardiovascular disorder risk ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' BMI percentile ', ' BMI z-score ', ' Quetelet index ', ' Body mass index ', ' Mediator ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Regulatory Element ', ' Epigenetic ', ' Epigenetic Change ', ' Epigenetic Mechanism ', ' Epigenetic Process ', ' gene modification ', ' Gene-Modified ', ' Characteristics ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio-economically ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomics ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' epigenomics ', ' risk for obesity ', ' risk of obesity ', ' obesity risk ', ' inflammation marker ', ' inflammatory marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' fasting glucose ', ' epigenome ', ' methylation marker ', ' methylation biomarker ', ' cardiovascular health ', ' EWAS ', ' epigenome wide association analysis ', ' epigenome-wide association studies ', ' neighborhood disadvantage ', ' Health and Retirement Study ', ' genomic epidemiology ', ' high dimensionality ', ' Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis ', ' Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities ', ' ']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2020,676386,0.042314844329351994
"The Effect of Neighborhood Change on Health and Well-Being Project Summary This is a study of how neighborhoods are changing their racial/ethnic and income composition as a result of mobility choices made by individual families. The consequent changes in segregation and disparate local environments for people of different race, ethnicity, and income have substantial potential consequences for their health and well-being. The study takes advantage of access to a new data resource – linked records of as many as 90% of enumerated Americans in 2000 and 2010 – to pursue two main aims: Aim 1) To assess the balance of flows of persons into and out of neighborhoods that are associated with specific neighborhood-level changes in race/ethnicity and income levels that we observe, such as increasing concentration of poverty or growing racial/ethnic diversity. Aim 2) To model the selectivity of people's locations in 2000 and their post- 2000 movements in neighborhoods, based both on how places appeared in 2000 and how they were changing in the next decade. The proposed study builds on a growing body of research that breaks with binary conceptualizations of segregation (e.g., the longstanding emphasis on the white-black divide or a simple distinction between poor and non-poor neighborhoods) to acknowledge the multigroup composition of metropolitan America and the variety of kinds of social class changes that are occurring. It will make use of confidential individual-level data in a Census Research Data Center (RDC) that has been linked between the 2000 and 2010 censuses to track changes in composition in changing neighborhoods (decomposing net change into numbers of persons in each group who arrived, left, or stayed). It will also to identify the personal/household characteristics associated with each type of mobility. This study of neighborhood change and residential mobility is highly relevant to major contemporary social concerns related to persistent minority segregation and increasing neighborhood diversity. Research conducted in the RDC will demonstrate the value of the Census Bureau's investment in record linkage and increase the likelihood of continued efforts of this kind. Project Narrative This project will study the changes in neighborhood racial/ethnic and socioeconomic composition that occurred in the 2000-2010 decade in all metropolitan areas of the United States. It will decompose net neighborhood changes into the flows of in-movers and leavers in different kinds of neighborhoods and evaluate the characteristics of persons involved in flows in each direction. Because neighborhoods are increasingly understood as having major effects on the health and well being of residents, this research will provide fundamental insights for health and population research, education, and policy- making.",The Effect of Neighborhood Change on Health and Well-Being,9883822,R01HD095653,"['Affect ', ' Americas ', ' Blood Circulation ', ' Bloodstream ', ' Circulation ', ' Censuses ', ' Communities ', ' Economics ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Environment ', ' Equilibrium ', ' balance ', ' balance function ', ' Family ', ' Health ', ' Household ', ' Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Economical Income ', ' Investments ', ' Movement ', ' body movement ', ' Persons ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' well-being ', ' wellbeing ', ' Policy Making ', ' Poverty ', ' Probability Samples ', ' Race ', ' Racial Group ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Records ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Residential Mobility ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Social Class ', ' Time ', ' Typology ', ' United States ', ' Work ', ' segregation ', ' Racial Segregation ', ' Longitudinal Surveys ', ' base ', ' Left ', ' Area ', ' Link ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Inequality ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Dimensions ', ' Pattern ', ' Location ', ' American ', ' metropolitan ', ' sorting ', ' Sorting - Cell Movement ', ' social ', ' Modeling ', ' Low income ', ' Data ', ' Population-based research ', ' Population-level research ', ' Population Research ', ' trend ', ' Characteristics ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio-economically ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomics ', ' Minority ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' ethnically diverse ', ' ethnic diversity ', ' data resource ', ' data centers ', ' ']",NICHD,BROWN UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,425384,0.22889227638559756
"Urgent Revision to Creating Peace: community-level intervention to reduce youth violence (R01MD013797, PI: Miller) In response to NOT-MD-20-022 (Notice of Special Interest (NOSI): Competitive and Administrative Supplements for Community Interventions to Reduce the Impact of COVID-19 on Health Disparity and Other Vulnerable Populations), this urgent competitive revision (PA-18-935) aims to evaluate a novel community- based multi-level intervention focused on child and youth thriving to respond to the pressing need for behavioral supports for youth and adults in the context of COVID-19. Residents in oppressed neighborhoods who are predominantly Black and Latinx have increased vulnerability to COVID-19 and the economic and social consequences of public health mitigation measures. The pandemic has disrupted social supports and increased social isolation among youth in these communities. This community-partnered, multi-level intervention engages supportive adults and youth to envision child/youth thriving to increase collective self- efficacy, reduce social isolation, promote emotional well-being among supportive adults and youth, and reduce youth violence in urban, racially-segregated neighborhoods. This intervention involves community members and youth leaders assessing child and youth thriving in their neighborhood, using a community-developed Child/Youth Thriving Matrix tool to engage in structured dialogue on neighborhood transformation, racial and gender equity, youth engagement, and organizing for social change. Findings from discussions will inform youth engagement in racial and gender justice activities in the context of this pandemic and offer a prototype for a community-level intervention to help mitigate the consequences of a pandemic, systemic racism, and structural inequities. This proposed study will assess feasibility of this Child/Youth Thriving Matrix tool as a community-based, multi-level intervention to promote neighborhood resilience and prevent youth violence. In Aim 1, we will evaluate feasibility of implementing Child/Youth Thriving Matrix within two neighborhoods (i.e., >80% retention of participants through all sessions; satisfaction scores > 4.0 (range 1-5); identification of at least three areas of focus for enhancing child thriving). Two other matched neighborhoods will be offered an individual mindfulness intervention as a control condition (final anticipated n = 80 participants/arm). Aim 2 will explore appropriateness of measures to evaluate intervention effects on individual- and neighborhood-level collective efficacy, emotional well-being (including mental health and social isolation), and youth violence, in preparation for a larger trial to test this community-level intervention. These research objectives build on infrastructure of the parent study (Creating Peace: community-based youth violence prevention to address racism and discrimination (R01MD013797, PI: Miller)). The goal of this urgent revision is to optimize a community-designed, community-level intervention to address structural inequities that have become all too apparent during this pandemic with an emphasis on neighborhood strengths and building resilience. Residents in oppressed neighborhoods who are predominantly Black and Latinx have increased vulnerability to both COVID-19 and the economic and social consequences of public health mitigation measures. This urgent competitive revision aims to evaluate a novel community-based multi-level intervention focused on child and youth thriving to respond to the urgent need for behavioral supports for youth and supportive adults in the context of COVID-19. This community-based, multi-level intervention is intended to increase collective self- efficacy, promote emotional well-being and reduce social isolation among supportive adults and youth, and reduce youth violence in racially-segregated neighborhoods.","Urgent Revision to Creating Peace: community-level intervention to reduce youth violence (R01MD013797, PI: Miller)",10215711,R01MD013797,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' children ', "" childrens' "", ' youngster ', ' Communities ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Economics ', ' Environment ', ' Family ', ' Goals ', ' Justice ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Parents ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Social Change ', ' Social modification ', ' Social transformation ', ' Social isolation ', ' Social support ', ' social support network ', ' Testing ', ' Translating ', ' Violence ', ' violent ', ' violent behavior ', ' Work ', ' Child Support ', ' County ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Youth ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' racism ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' adult youth ', ' young adulthood ', ' young adult ', ' satisfaction ', ' tool ', ' Emotional well being ', ' Feels well ', ' Normal mental condition ', ' Normal mental state ', ' Normal psyche ', ' Psychological Well Being ', ' Sense of well-being ', ' emotional wellbeing ', ' mental well-being ', ' mental wellbeing ', ' psychological wellbeing ', ' psychological wellness ', ' self wellness ', ' sense of wellbeing ', ' Well in self ', ' interest ', ' experience ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Prevention program ', ' member ', ' peace ', ' Prevention ', ' social ', ' response ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Administrative Supplement ', ' Preparation ', ' Behavioral ', ' pandemic ', ' pandemic disease ', ' community intervention ', ' virtual ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' teen violence ', ' youth violence ', ' resilience ', ' Trauma ', ' prototype ', ' intervention effect ', ' prevent youth violence ', ' youth violence prevention ', ' reduce youth violence ', ' arm ', ' gender equity ', ' mindfulness-based intervention ', ' mindfulness intervention ', ' adolescent health ', ' participant retention ', ' Child Health ', ' Infrastructure ', ' community involvement ', ' COVID19 ', ' corona virus disease 2019 ', ' coronavirus disease 2019 ', ' COVID-19 ', ' evaluate effectiveness ', ' effectiveness evaluation ', ' ']",NIMHD,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2020,324997,0.03816790373846464
