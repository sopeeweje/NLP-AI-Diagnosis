"CANCER COURSES FOR NURSES WORKING WITH MINORITY GROUPS DESCRIPTION:  (Applicant's Description) This project seeks to contribute to      the reduction of health disparities and cancer mortality among African           Americans (AAs) through the implementation of 6 2-day cancer prevention and      early detection programs for nurse educators.  This proposed project is a        refinement and extension of the successful work that the Oncology Nursing        Society implemented to address cancer prevention and control issues in           minority populations.  The project aims to provide nurse educators (1)           didactic and simulated hands-on experience in assessing cancer risk and          assessing the physical status of five anatomical sites which have a high         cancer incidence rate among AAs; (2) didactic and group process on the           specifics of planning community-based cancer prevention and early detection      teaching/learning experiences within the African American (AA) community and     among AAs within the practice setting; (3) didactic and group process in the     specifics of accessing cancer information using the World Wide Web; (4)          opportunities to discuss strategies for integrating didactic content,            thoughtful discussions, clinical/laboratory experiences, and related             literature focused on cancer prevention and early detection among AAs into       nursing curricula; (5) opportunities to establish links with national            agencies and/or organizations which address cancer issues in the local           communities; and, (6) identify and develop instructional materials for nurse     educators that may be used to introduce issues, trends, and concepts related     to cancer prevention and early detection among AAs within nursing curricula.     The long term objectives of the project are to:  (1) increase the number of      nurse educators trained in cancer prevention and early detection; (2)            increase the number of nurse educators prepared to facilitate teaching and       learning experiences focused on cancer prevention and early detection within     the AA community or among AAs within the practice setting; and (3) increase      the degree to which nurse educators integrate didactic content, thoughtful       discussions, clinical/laboratory experiences, and related literature focused     on cancer prevention and early detection among AAs into nursing curricula.

"CD556, Infection, and Race in Preterm Delivery DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The rate of preterm delivery among African American (AA) women is 1.5 to 2.4 times higher than Caucasian (CS). The 2010 national public health goal is eliminating ethnic disparity in preterm delivery (PTD). Although the mechanism of PTD is unclear, infections are among the main ethnologic factors implicated. We propose here a unifying hypothesis by which infection and host factors may increase the risk of PTD among African Americans (AA). The fetus is a semiallogenic antigen that requires efficient protection from the maternal humoral immune system. Decay accelerating factor (DAF) is a protective host factor DAF is expressed in the feto-maternal interphase and its main function is protection from cytotoxic effect of autologous complement (c)attack. DAF expression is controlled by progesterone (P) and P was implicated in pregnancy losses. Infection upregulates nitric oxide (NO) and in turn NO downregulates DAF expression. Decreased DAF expression alters the protective quality of the feto-maternal interphase and may trigger complement mediated increases in proinflarnmatory tumor necrosis factor (TNF), and prostaglandin production resulting in PTL/PTD. We propose that both infection and biologic/genetic factors may contribute to the disturbances in the endocrine-NO-immune axis. Various factors in concert may act to alter the C/DAF ratio in the feto-maternal interface thereby leading to the activation of proinflammatory/prostaglandin pathway. The C cascade and TNF response occurs upon infection or vaginal colonization. Virulent E. coli is capable to display synergistic signaling via E.coli adhesin-host receptor and elicit aggressive cytokine responses. Although these factors may effect all women, AA are at higher risk due to an increased inherent capacity of rejection or hyperresponsiveness of alloantigens. The inherent differences may result in the observed PTD disparities between AA and CS. We propose to the following: 1. Characterize expression of DAF among AA and CS women undergoing elective pregnancy tennination, term and pretenn labor. 2. Characterize allelic polymorphism in the DAF Tcb, Cr(a-), and TNFA alleles and analyze possible association with infection, PTD and race. 3. Characterize genotypes of vaginal colonization isolates in patients with term and preterm delivery. The long-term goal of our project is to characterize mechanism of infection associated PTL/PTD and the role of the host and pathogen factors interacting at the urogenital interphase in birth outcome.

"CANCER DIET KNOWLEDGE AND BELIEFS IN AFRICAN AMERICANS  DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant) Cancer occurs throughout the world, but cancer risk varies widely by regions, population groups and countries, suggesting geographic, environmental, and cultural implications. In the United States, African Americans (AA) have the highest cancer incidence and the lowest survival rates. The reasons for the disparity in cancer incidence and mortality rates among this population group have not been clearly elucidated, but dietary factors are implicated. The overall objective of the study is to better describe and understand the dietary habits, and the barriers, which prevent AA from adopting eating habits consistent with the dietary guidelines. Specifically, the project aims to. i) assess nutrition knowledge and selected dietary beliefs related to cancer, in rural, urban, low- and middle-income AA populations; ii) identify perceived barriers to the adoption of the eating behaviors consistent with the dietary guidelines, in rural, urban, low- and middle-income AA populations; and iii) define the food preferences, practices and purchasing patterns, in rural, urban, low- and middle-income AA populations. The proposed study would be confined to: i) college students from a HBCU in a rural, Alabama setting; ii) volunteers from a low-income, rural, Alabama community/ies; iii) college students from a HBCU in an urban, Georgia (Atlanta) setting; and iv) volunteers from a low-income, urban, Georgia (Atlanta) community/ies. Participants would be recruited through advertisements in campus newspapers, through university extension educators, social service workers, community-based organizations and Black churches. A cross sectional survey, utilizing in-depth, structured interviews would be conducted among adults aged 18 to 30 years old, in selected HBCUs and communities in Alabama and Georgia (N = 1,200 volunteers; n = 300/group). The questionnaire would elicit demographic information, cancer-related food and nutrition knowledge, food preferences, food practices and purchasing patterns. It would be reviewed, pilot-tested and administered by trained interviewers. Descriptive statistics and analysis of variance, and Fisher's LSD would be used to analyzes the data. The findings could be utilized to guide the development of community-based, culturally-specific, cancer risk reduction nutrition intervention strategies that would better meet the needs of AA, inform policy and funding decisions for cancer risk reduction programs for the diverse AA population.

"CD556, Infection, and Race in Preterm Delivery DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The rate of preterm delivery among African American (AA) women is 1.5 to 2.4 times higher than Caucasian (CS). The 2010 national public health goal is eliminating ethnic disparity in preterm delivery (PTD). Although the mechanism of PTD is unclear, infections are among the main ethnologic factors implicated. We propose here a unifying hypothesis by which infection and host factors may increase the risk of PTD among African Americans (AA). The fetus is a semiallogenic antigen that requires efficient protection from the maternal humoral immune system. Decay accelerating factor (DAF) is a protective host factor DAF is expressed in the feto-maternal interphase and its main function is protection from cytotoxic effect of autologous complement (c)attack. DAF expression is controlled by progesterone (P) and P was implicated in pregnancy losses. Infection upregulates nitric oxide (NO) and in turn NO downregulates DAF expression. Decreased DAF expression alters the protective quality of the feto-maternal interphase and may trigger complement mediated increases in proinflarnmatory tumor necrosis factor (TNF), and prostaglandin production resulting in PTL/PTD. We propose that both infection and biologic/genetic factors may contribute to the disturbances in the endocrine-NO-immune axis. Various factors in concert may act to alter the C/DAF ratio in the feto-maternal interface thereby leading to the activation of proinflammatory/prostaglandin pathway. The C cascade and TNF response occurs upon infection or vaginal colonization. Virulent E. coli is capable to display synergistic signaling via E.coli adhesin-host receptor and elicit aggressive cytokine responses. Although these factors may effect all women, AA are at higher risk due to an increased inherent capacity of rejection or hyperresponsiveness of alloantigens. The inherent differences may result in the observed PTD disparities between AA and CS. We propose to the following: 1. Characterize expression of DAF among AA and CS women undergoing elective pregnancy tennination, term and pretenn labor. 2. Characterize allelic polymorphism in the DAF Tcb, Cr(a-), and TNFA alleles and analyze possible association with infection, PTD and race. 3. Characterize genotypes of vaginal colonization isolates in patients with term and preterm delivery. The long-term goal of our project is to characterize mechanism of infection associated PTL/PTD and the role of the host and pathogen factors interacting at the urogenital interphase in birth outcome.

"CD556, Infection, and Race in Preterm Delivery DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The rate of preterm delivery among African American (AA) women is 1.5 to 2.4 times higher than Caucasian (CS). The 2010 national public health goal is eliminating ethnic disparity in preterm delivery (PTD). Although the mechanism of PTD is unclear, infections are among the main ethnologic factors implicated. We propose here a unifying hypothesis by which infection and host factors may increase the risk of PTD among African Americans (AA). The fetus is a semiallogenic antigen that requires efficient protection from the maternal humoral immune system. Decay accelerating factor (DAF) is a protective host factor DAF is expressed in the feto-maternal interphase and its main function is protection from cytotoxic effect of autologous complement (c)attack. DAF expression is controlled by progesterone (P) and P was implicated in pregnancy losses. Infection upregulates nitric oxide (NO) and in turn NO downregulates DAF expression. Decreased DAF expression alters the protective quality of the feto-maternal interphase and may trigger complement mediated increases in proinflarnmatory tumor necrosis factor (TNF), and prostaglandin production resulting in PTL/PTD. We propose that both infection and biologic/genetic factors may contribute to the disturbances in the endocrine-NO-immune axis. Various factors in concert may act to alter the C/DAF ratio in the feto-maternal interface thereby leading to the activation of proinflammatory/prostaglandin pathway. The C cascade and TNF response occurs upon infection or vaginal colonization. Virulent E. coli is capable to display synergistic signaling via E.coli adhesin-host receptor and elicit aggressive cytokine responses. Although these factors may effect all women, AA are at higher risk due to an increased inherent capacity of rejection or hyperresponsiveness of alloantigens. The inherent differences may result in the observed PTD disparities between AA and CS. We propose to the following: 1. Characterize expression of DAF among AA and CS women undergoing elective pregnancy tennination, term and pretenn labor. 2. Characterize allelic polymorphism in the DAF Tcb, Cr(a-), and TNFA alleles and analyze possible association with infection, PTD and race. 3. Characterize genotypes of vaginal colonization isolates in patients with term and preterm delivery. The long-term goal of our project is to characterize mechanism of infection associated PTL/PTD and the role of the host and pathogen factors interacting at the urogenital interphase in birth outcome.

"Domestic Violence Prevention for African American Women DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The applicant's long-term goal is to develop a community based, culturally relevant intimate partner violence (IPV) prevention program for young African-American (AA) women. To achieve this goal, a focused research career development plan is proposed: 1) to gain advanced knowledge regarding qualitative research design, methods and analyses, 2) to gain advanced knowledge of young adult AA women's IPV risk and protective factors by conducting and analyzing data from focus groups, and 3) to gain theoretical and practical knowledge about research in the local AA community by conducting a community based IPV needs assessment, focus groups, and ultimately a culturally specific IPV prevention program. The purpose of the proposed accompanying study is to address gaps in prevention science by developing an IPV prevention program that uses a culturally specific approach to apply key elements of IPV prevention to an evidenced based prevention program that has demonstrated efficacy with ethnically diverse groups. A pilot test of each prevention component (peer group support, skills training, group social bonding) of the IPV prevention curriculum among young adult AA women is proposed. There is an urgent need for prevention science to develop programs that decrease the vulnerability of young AA women since they comprise the largest known group of IPV victims in the United States. Yet there is a paucity of evidence based IPV prevention programs that have been developed to reflect the ethno cultural variance of young adult AA women. Importantly, this study provides the opportunity for Dr. Tyson to extend her strong methodological and analytical skills by developing her own independent research project. Both the research process and findings will contribute to building knowledge for the transfer of violence prevention programs to other ethnic/cultural groups. The proposed study is a direct response to the National Institute of Nursing Research call to conduct research that will improve the delivery of services to at risk populations that experience social and health care disparities and addresses a significant gap in prevention science and nursing inquiry.

"Geography of Amputations Among African Americans DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Nontraumatic lower-extremity amputations (LEA) are a devastating consequence of diabetes. Persons age 65 and older account about 50% of persons with diabetes who had nontraumatic lower-extremity amputations. African Americans (AA) age 65 or older with diabetes are at increased risk of such amputations.  Internationally, substantial geographic variation exists in incidence of LEAs between and within nations. In the United States, comparisons between hospital referral regions have shown nine-fold variation. Studies that have assessed the extent of the variation of LEA among smaller geographic areas, such as counties, are not available. The purpose of the revised exploratory study is to: 1) characterize the geographic variation of the incidence of diabetes-related LEA at the county level among AA and white persons age 65-99 in 3 southern states, and 2) explore the association of selected determinants with the geographic variation in diabetes-related incidence of LEA among AA and white persons age 65-99 in 3 southern states. These determinants have been selected based on 1) those previously suggested as explanation of the geographic variation that was observed in LEA rates; 2) emerging research that shows that persons in areas with adverse socioeconomic conditions have lower health status, more disease, more surgical procedures, and a higher rate of avoidable hospitalizations among persons with diabetes; and 3) risk factors for LEA regardless of their geographic variation. The study area has been selected based on the 25 percent or more AA persons in these 3 southern states. Based on the reviewers' comments, we have provided greater detail about the data quality, the likelihood of useful outcomes, and aspects about the proposed statistical analysis.   Using an ecological study design, existing data sources will be linked and analyzed, including Medicare claims data (LEA, foot ulcers, peripheral vascular disease, diabetes), Provider of Services file (availability of medical providers), and the 2000 census data (area sociodemographics). We will use county-rates of LEA among AA and white persons age 65-99 with diabetes as the outcome measure. This exploratory study will serve to focus subsequent, more in-depth studies on identifying additional underlying factors that could determine why those with diabetes are at increased risk of LEA in specific geographic areas in a future RO1.

"Ethnic/Racial Minorities in the Colon CFR DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a common malignancy in Western countries. However, its frequency varies four-fold among US ethnic/racial minorities, with Japanese Americans (JAs) and African Americans (AAs) having a marked excess risk for the disease. Moreover, in contrast to JA patients who experience a better survival than whites, AAs with CRC present at a later stage and have a shorter, stage-adjusted survival than whites. The poor outcome of AA patients is not completely explained by their reduced access to medical care. These ethnic/racial disparities constitute an important public health challenge and also offer unique opportunities for etiologic research. This collaborative application will build upon the existing colorectal cancer Cooperative Family Registry (CFR) resource by recruiting additional families of AA (N=979) and Japanese (N=448) descent in Northern California, Southern California, North Carolina and Hawaii, using the CFR core protocol. We will then use the data and samples collected from a total of 1,514 AA, 745 JA and 750 white population-based families in the CFR to test the following hypotheses: 1) DNA mismatch repair deficiency is a more common pathogenic pathway to CRC in AAs, compared to whites, as reflected by a greater prevalence of tumor microsatellite instability (MSI); 2) Functional gene variants  and environmental exposures related to chemical carcinogenesis and methyl group metabolism are associated with an increased risk of MSI-high CRC, particularly in AAs and JAs; 3) Functional variants in cell proliferation- and angiogenesis-related genes are associated with risk of advanced-stage CRC and poor overall survival, particularly in AAs; 4) Functional variants in genes related to response to 5-fluorouracil/oxaliplatin chemotherapy are associated with shorter disease-free and overall survival, especially in AA s; 5) Other gene variants that are rare in whites but relatively common in AAs and JAs are associated with CRC and may significantly contribute to the etiology of the disease in these groups. The power to test these hypotheses will not be adequate without the proposed expanded recruitment. The insight into biological pathways gained by this project may lead to new means of prevention and treatment that may help not only to alleviate health disparities in the US but also better control CRC among all ethnic/racial groups.

"African American Weight Control Registry DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   Professional Goal: The purpose of this Mentored-Patient Oriented Career Development proposal is to enhance the research development of Dr. Ann Smith Barnes. In addition to the establishment of a descriptive database of African Americans (AA) successful at weight-loss maintenance, Dr. Smith Barnes will acquire research training at the University of Texas School of Public Health. She will complete academic requirements for a Master's degree in public health and will obtain an understanding of research design, data collection and analysis. Under the mentorship of Dr. Kenneth Goodrick, Dr. Smith Barnes will use the award to broaden general understanding of elements of successful weight-loss maintenance in AA. The support will establish her as a leader in obesity management in minority populations. Specific Aims of African American Weight Control Registry: The project will use focus groups and a cross sectional study design to: a) identify relevant variables for weight loss and maintenance in AA using the theoretical framework of Theory of Planned Behavior; b) using information from focus groups, develop an instrument to assess weight loss and maintenance in AA; c) establish a registry of AA who are successful at weight loss (defined as 10 percent of their body weight) and weight-loss maintenance for (1 year and those who have been successful at weight loss but not maintenance; d)survey individuals selected from the registry to validate the instrument and to compare characteristics of AA who are successful at weight loss and maintenance to AA who are not successful at maintenance. This study will have four stages: I) Focus groups II) Instrument development III) Registry establishment and IV) Psycohometric analysis of the survey instrument and comparison of responses of successful versus unsuccessful weight-loss maintainers. Hypotheses: 1. The three constructs, attitude, subjective norm, and perceived behavioral control, will be significantly correlated to intention to adopt weight-loss maintenance practices in AA. 2. Successful weight-loss maintainers will differ from weight re-gainers in the TPB constructs of attitude, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control. Conclusions: This descriptive, comparative study of weight-loss maintainers and re-gainers will provide critical information for development of appropriate weight-loss interventions in AA.

"Intramuscular lipid and insulin action: ethnic aspects DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  African-American (AA) individuals are less sensitive to insulin than Caucasian (C) individuals, a difference that may bear upon the greater prevalence of type 2 diabetes among AA, both adults and children. The ethnic/racial difference in insulin sensitivity (SI) is established early in life, and is apparent among prepubertal children, suggesting an inherent physiological basis. To date, no explanation has been uncovered for lower SI among AA. Preliminary data from the Pi's laboratory indicate that muscle lipid content (ML), as estimated from both computed tomography scanning and magnetic resonance spectroscopy, is higher among AA vs C women. Research has indicated that greater ML is associated with lower SI. The PI also has shown that AA have relatively lower adiponectin, a hormone that stimulates intramuscular lipid oxidation and improves Si. Preliminary data indicate that lower adiponectin among AA may be due to greater post-challenge insulin concentration.  The Specific Aims of this proposal are to:  1. Determine whether greater ML among AA explains lower SI.  2. Determine whether greater ML among AA is associated with, and potentially due to, lower oxidative capacity, as reflected in the ADP time constant from 31P-MRS.  3. Using low- and moderate-fat dietary interventions, determine if experimental manipulation of ML alters Si in healthy AA and C subjects; and, using low- and high-carbohydrate dietary interventions, determine if experimental manipulation of insulin secretion alters insulin, adiponectin, and ML in healthy AA and C subjects.  Secondary Aims are to determine whether higher GLP-1 among AA is responsible for greater insulin secretion, and whether experimental manipulation of ML is associated with changes in 5'-AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), and/or other factors involved in the regulation of substrate metabolism. Because lifestyle and pharmacologic interventions that deplete ML have been reported, demonstration that greater ML is responsible for ethnic/racial differences in SI is likely to lead to means of reducing risk for type 2 diabetes among AA.

"Assessing depression in African American cancer patients    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): African Americans (AA) have the highest incidence and death rates from all cancers in the U.S. Adequate assessment and treatment of depression in AA cancer patients is essential to reduce this unequal burden of cancer and health disparity. Current knowledge of AA cancer patients' depression is extremely limited. A few existing studies suggest inadequate recognition of the extent of depression in this population. Currently no available instrument has been validated for screening depression of AA cancer patients, despite increasing evidence of cultural insensitivity of depression measures for African Americans. It is imperative to develop a culturally sensitive screening instrument for AA cancer patients' depression, in order to provide adequate referral and needed care. The development of this instrument would require a deep understanding of AA depressive experience. This application is the first study of the lived experience of depression in AA cancer patients. It is significant because of the large size of AA cancer population, the need to combat cancer disparity, and its implication for quality of life and long-term survival of AA cancer patients. Using a mixed design, the study will provide baseline knowledge of AA depressive experience and identify AA depressive symptoms as an initial step of the instrument construction. The specific aims are as follows: 1) Describe the meaning and structure of AA depressive experience in the context of living with cancer; 2) Compare depressed and nondepressed AA cancer patients to identify beliefs and attitudes about having cancer, which are associated with depression; and 3) Identify manifestations of AA depression and create a symptom catalogue that can be developed into a culturally sensitive screening instrument for assessing AA cancer patient's depression in a future study. The interview sample will consist of 80 cancer patients-20 patients in each of four groups: 3 AA groups and a white group consisting of two subgroups, varying by degree of depression. The group members will be further stratified by age and cancer diagnosis for an unstructured individual interview that will be audiotaped, transcribed, and analyzed verbatim. In the validation phase, an additional 10 AA cancer patients will be recruited to determine the credibility of study outcomes. Qualitative data analysis using the NUDIST software will identify themes and their relationships to describe: 1) meanings and structure of the lived depressive experience of AA cancer patients; 2) beliefs and attitudes about having cancer; and 3) self- explanations of depressive experiences. The mixed method analysis using statistical and qualitative methods will be used to identify AA depressive symptoms. Consequently, a symptom catalogue that inventories the identified AA depressive symptoms will be constructed so that a culturally sensitive screening instrument for assessing depression in AA cancer patients can be developed in a future study.           ",Assessing depression in African American cancer patients,7162400,R03CA115191,"['neoplasm /cancer ', ' depression ', ' experience ', ' clinical research ', ' ']",NCI,CASE WESTERN RESERVE UNIVERSITY,R03,2006,77250,0.06065609299245478
"Factors Influencing the Racial Disparity in SIDS.    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The incidence of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) in the US has declined 50% since 1992, when the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) first recommended that infants be placed in a non-prone position for sleep. Despite the tremendous success of the subsequent Back to Sleep campaign, African-American (AA) infants remain twice as likely to be placed prone, and twice as likely to die from SIDS. The racial disparity exists across all educational and income categories, and the extent of the racial disparity has increased rather than decreased. The NICHD, in both its 2000 general Strategic Plan (From Cells to Selves) and its 2000 Strategic Plan for SIDS research (Targeting Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS): A Strategic Plan), highlighted the need to understand mechanisms leading to racial, ethnic, and social disparities as a research priority.      Very little is known about the reasons why AA parents use the prone position. Further, no studies have taken advantage of the observed socioeconomic status(SES)-associated variability in SIDS and prone sleeping within the AA community. By examining within-group differences, it is possible to move beyond comparative racial descriptions to identification of potentially modifiable factors. The overall purpose of these investigations, therefore, is to better understand factors contributing to the comparatively high incidence of prone sleep positioning in AA infants. In order to achieve this, will address the following Specific Aims: 1) To compare knowledge, attitudes, and practices regarding infant sleep position in AA parents of higher and lower SES. 2) To identify risk factors for non-use of the recommended supine sleep position in AA families with higher and lower SES. 3) To develop a phenomenological understanding of the decisions made by AA parents of higher and lower SES who do not use recommended supine sleep position, through qualitative methods. 4) To develop, implement, and evaluate an appropriate intervention program based on the knowledge gained through Specific Aims 1-3.      This study addresses important gaps in our understanding of factors informing parental decision regarding infant sleep positioning in AAs. By understanding the social and cultural factors, it should be possible to design more effective interventions, thereby potentially decreasing the rate of SIDS in AA infants.         ",Factors Influencing the Racial Disparity in SIDS.,7027350,K24RR023681,"['child rearing ', ' parent ', ' sleep ', ' clinical research ', ' ']",NCRR,CHILDREN'S RESEARCH INSTITUTE,K24,2006,155454,0.08022772078108067
"Ethnic/Racial Minorities in the Colon CFR DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a common malignancy in Western countries. However, its frequency varies four-fold among US ethnic/racial minorities, with Japanese Americans (JAs) and African Americans (AAs) having a marked excess risk for the disease. Moreover, in contrast to JA patients who experience a better survival than whites, AAs with CRC present at a later stage and have a shorter, stage-adjusted survival than whites. The poor outcome of AA patients is not completely explained by their reduced access to medical care. These ethnic/racial disparities constitute an important public health challenge and also offer unique opportunities for etiologic research. This collaborative application will build upon the existing colorectal cancer Cooperative Family Registry (CFR) resource by recruiting additional families of AA (N=979) and Japanese (N=448) descent in Northern California, Southern California, North Carolina and Hawaii, using the CFR core protocol. We will then use the data and samples collected from a total of 1,514 AA, 745 JA and 750 white population-based families in the CFR to test the following hypotheses: 1) DNA mismatch repair deficiency is a more common pathogenic pathway to CRC in AAs, compared to whites, as reflected by a greater prevalence of tumor microsatellite instability (MSI); 2) Functional gene variants  and environmental exposures related to chemical carcinogenesis and methyl group metabolism are associated with an increased risk of MSI-high CRC, particularly in AAs and JAs; 3) Functional variants in cell proliferation- and angiogenesis-related genes are associated with risk of advanced-stage CRC and poor overall survival, particularly in AAs; 4) Functional variants in genes related to response to 5-fluorouracil/oxaliplatin chemotherapy are associated with shorter disease-free and overall survival, especially in AA s; 5) Other gene variants that are rare in whites but relatively common in AAs and JAs are associated with CRC and may significantly contribute to the etiology of the disease in these groups. The power to test these hypotheses will not be adequate without the proposed expanded recruitment. The insight into biological pathways gained by this project may lead to new means of prevention and treatment that may help not only to alleviate health disparities in the US but also better control CRC among all ethnic/racial groups.

"Race and Health Outcomes Associated with Obesity    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Two overarching goals of Healthy People 2010 are to increase years and quality of healthy life and to eliminate health disparities. Because obesity disproportionately affects African and Hispanic Americans, understanding the influence of race on obesity's impact on different health outcomes is especially vital to achieving these goals. Interestingly, although African Americans (AAs) continue to have substantially lower life-expectancy than whites, observational studies suggest that obesity may have a lower impact on mortality in AAs than in whites even though healthcare expenditures in obese AAs are lower than in obese white Americans. Racial differences in obesity-related mortality and cost may be a reflection of differences on several fronts: higher rates of competing health risks such as smoking, HIV, and trauma in AAs; a reduced association between obesity and cardiovascular risk in AAs; and delays in diagnosis and treatment in normal-weight AAs. Using data from 3 national databases-the Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey (MCBS), National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), and Medical Expenditures Panel Survey (MEPS)-this study will examine the interplay between race and body mass index (BMI) as they relate to 4 important outcomes: 1.mortality; 2.cardiovascular risk; 3.delays in diagnosis and treatment of cardiovascular risk factors; and 4.healthcare expenditures associated with obesity. Previous studies examining obesity-related mortality have not been able to adequately address the issue of competing health risks and residual confounding from smoking and preclinical illness, which can obscure an association between obesity and higher mortality. Because MCBS data are linked to Medicare claims longitudinally, this study will be able to control for smoking and limit confounding from pre-clinical disease and competing health risks. Furthermore, the studies proposed in this application will address several important questions: Is the association between obesity and novel cardiovascular risk factors reduced compared to whites? Are leaner minority adults, who do not meet the traditional paradigm of being at high cardiovascular risk, at high risk for cardiovascular disease and more susceptible to having delays in diagnosis and treatment? What are the different types of care and medical conditions that drive racial differences in obesity related healthcare expenditures? In clarifying these relationships, our findings could shed light on mechanisms underlying racial differences in obesity-related risk and cost. Our findings could also guide the setting of public health priorities and the targeting of specific initiatives to reduce racial disparities in healthcare and mortality.         ",Race and Health Outcomes Associated with Obesity,7281077,R01DK071083,[''],NIDDK,BETH ISRAEL DEACONESS MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2006,88854,0.09466150087123468
"Predictors of Hemodialysis Access Dysfunction    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   Hemodialysis vascular access dysfunction accounts for extensive morbidity, and is the greatest contributor to cost among patients with renal failure. Diabetics and African Americans (AA's) are disproportionately affected; however, reasons for this are unclear.   The primary aims of the proposed study are 1) estimate the association between diabetes and AA race and arteriovenous fistula (AVF) survival; 2) explore whether factors associated with vessel location and primary cause of renal disease account for the relationship between diabetes and AA race and AVF survival; 3) determine if vein caliber and arterial resistance account for the association between diabetes and AA race and AVF survival, and 4) determine if inflammation accounts for the association between diabetes and AA race and AVF failure.   Two parallel activities will be conducted to address our scientific aims. First we will use data from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid end-stage renal disease (ESRD) Clinical Performance Measures (CPM) Project, United States Renal Data System (USRDS) and an established cohort from a Veterans' Affairs sponsored study of dialysis patients undergoing AVF placement to identify factors that might account for the association between diabetes and race and AVF survival. Second, we will recruit a cohort of 180 pre-dialysis patients preparing to undergo access placement from the clinics at Emory University, Emory Crawford Long Hospital, Grady Memorial Hospital and the Dialysis Access Center of Atlanta to ascertain if serum markers of inflammation account for the association between diabetes and AA race and access survival. The proposed studies aim to elucidate reasons for the disparities in vascular access survival among diabetics and AA's.       ",Predictors of Hemodialysis Access Dysfunction,7097588,K23DK065634,"['biomarker ', ' hemodialysis ', ' vascular resistance ', ' catheterization ', ' diabetes mellitus ', ' medical complication ', ' inflammation ', ' patient /disease registry ', ' human subject ', ' chronic renal failure ', ' epidemiology ', ' African American ', ' caucasian American ', ' racial /ethnic difference ', ' human data ', ' comorbidity ', ' clinical research ', ' disease /disorder etiology ', ' patient oriented research ', ' health disparity ', ' ']",NIDDK,EMORY UNIVERSITY,K23,2006,127116,0.04561307111362382
"Intramuscular lipid and insulin action: ethnic aspects DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  African-American (AA) individuals are less sensitive to insulin than Caucasian (C) individuals, a difference that may bear upon the greater prevalence of type 2 diabetes among AA, both adults and children. The ethnic/racial difference in insulin sensitivity (SI) is established early in life, and is apparent among prepubertal children, suggesting an inherent physiological basis. To date, no explanation has been uncovered for lower SI among AA. Preliminary data from the Pi's laboratory indicate that muscle lipid content (ML), as estimated from both computed tomography scanning and magnetic resonance spectroscopy, is higher among AA vs C women. Research has indicated that greater ML is associated with lower SI. The PI also has shown that AA have relatively lower adiponectin, a hormone that stimulates intramuscular lipid oxidation and improves Si. Preliminary data indicate that lower adiponectin among AA may be due to greater post-challenge insulin concentration.  The Specific Aims of this proposal are to:  1. Determine whether greater ML among AA explains lower SI.  2. Determine whether greater ML among AA is associated with, and potentially due to, lower oxidative capacity, as reflected in the ADP time constant from 31P-MRS.  3. Using low- and moderate-fat dietary interventions, determine if experimental manipulation of ML alters Si in healthy AA and C subjects; and, using low- and high-carbohydrate dietary interventions, determine if experimental manipulation of insulin secretion alters insulin, adiponectin, and ML in healthy AA and C subjects.  Secondary Aims are to determine whether higher GLP-1 among AA is responsible for greater insulin secretion, and whether experimental manipulation of ML is associated with changes in 5'-AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), and/or other factors involved in the regulation of substrate metabolism. Because lifestyle and pharmacologic interventions that deplete ML have been reported, demonstration that greater ML is responsible for ethnic/racial differences in SI is likely to lead to means of reducing risk for type 2 diabetes among AA.

"Ethnic Differences in Media Response and Recruitment    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Ethnic diversity in recruitment is a vital prerequisite to eliminating the health disparity in cancer control trials and health promotion programs. Although recruitment campaigns are sometimes guided by learning models, little attention is paid to a critical requirement: how to reach key target audiences with persuasive messages and hold their attention long enough for the messages to be processed. Little scientific rigor has been applied to the study of methods to increase information seeking and to improve the recruitment of minorities into cancer control or treatment trials. Even the most innovative research is stymied by the lack of representative samples of the population the research is designed to serve. The goals of this study are: 1) to develop and prospectively test, theory-driven, ethnically appropriate health-related messages to promote information seeking and recruitment; 2) to test methods for marketing/communication of the messages and; 3) to assess differences in response (in terms of information seeking and recruitment), between African American (AA) and Caucasian males into a prostate cancer control program. To accomplish these goals, direct response radio (DRR) and direct response newspaper (DRN), guided by a framework that includes Social Marketing, will be tested as methods to improve information seeking and recruitment. Our preliminary data has shown a differential response by ethnicity (AA and Caucasian) to DRR and DRN information seeking and recruitment. It is our hypotheses that, guided by our integrated Marketing and Cognitive-Affective conceptual framework, and our pilot work: 1) AA men will be more responsive to a DRR campaign than Caucasian men, 2) Caucasian men will be more responsive to a DRN campaign than AA men, 3) DRR will be more cost-effective for the recruitment of AA men than for Caucasian men, and 4) specific cognitive-affective factors will be associated with response. The significance of this work would be the advancement of knowledge of risk communications research via the study of a theory-driven process that may improve information seeking and recruitment of AA men to cancer control protocols. It would also serve as a potential model for improved information seeking and recruitment of AA men to be tested in other cancer control and treatment trials and potentially as a model for other minorities.         ",Ethnic Differences in Media Response and Recruitment,7031408,R01CA114321,"['aging ', ' health ', ' model ', ' neoplasm /cancer ', ' prostate neoplasm ', ' racial /ethnic difference ', ' clinical research ', ' communication ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2006,312136,0.03065118361973943

"African American Weight Control Registry DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   Professional Goal: The purpose of this Mentored-Patient Oriented Career Development proposal is to enhance the research development of Dr. Ann Smith Barnes. In addition to the establishment of a descriptive database of African Americans (AA) successful at weight-loss maintenance, Dr. Smith Barnes will acquire research training at the University of Texas School of Public Health. She will complete academic requirements for a Master's degree in public health and will obtain an understanding of research design, data collection and analysis. Under the mentorship of Dr. Kenneth Goodrick, Dr. Smith Barnes will use the award to broaden general understanding of elements of successful weight-loss maintenance in AA. The support will establish her as a leader in obesity management in minority populations. Specific Aims of African American Weight Control Registry: The project will use focus groups and a cross sectional study design to: a) identify relevant variables for weight loss and maintenance in AA using the theoretical framework of Theory of Planned Behavior; b) using information from focus groups, develop an instrument to assess weight loss and maintenance in AA; c) establish a registry of AA who are successful at weight loss (defined as 10 percent of their body weight) and weight-loss maintenance for (1 year and those who have been successful at weight loss but not maintenance; d)survey individuals selected from the registry to validate the instrument and to compare characteristics of AA who are successful at weight loss and maintenance to AA who are not successful at maintenance. This study will have four stages: I) Focus groups II) Instrument development III) Registry establishment and IV) Psycohometric analysis of the survey instrument and comparison of responses of successful versus unsuccessful weight-loss maintainers. Hypotheses: 1. The three constructs, attitude, subjective norm, and perceived behavioral control, will be significantly correlated to intention to adopt weight-loss maintenance practices in AA. 2. Successful weight-loss maintainers will differ from weight re-gainers in the TPB constructs of attitude, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control. Conclusions: This descriptive, comparative study of weight-loss maintainers and re-gainers will provide critical information for development of appropriate weight-loss interventions in AA.

"Factors Influencing Physical Activity in Older African American Men    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application is in response to NIH PA# PA-03-170 entitled Health Promotion Among Racial and Ethnic Minority Males. A large body of evidence indicates that racial/ethnic disparities in health behaviors significantly contribute to the higher rates of morbidity and mortality in African American (AA) men. It is also firmly established that regular physical activity (PA) reduces the risk of many chronic diseases and increases longevity. Despite the positive relationship between PA and several health outcomes, national studies indicate a significantly higher prevalence of regular PA among white than AA adults and among younger versus older adults. In addition, experiences by both investigators and practitioners diffusing community- based PA programs serving older adults indicate far less participation by men in general and particularly by racial/ethnic minority men. The disparity in rates of PA and dismal participation in community PA programs may then be contributing factors to the severe health disparities that exist with older AA men. Thus, the overall goals of this project are to: 1) identify barriers and facilitators to engaging in PA for older AA men, 2) broaden our understanding of age and culturally appropriate PA for older AA men, and 3) design and implement a pilot intervention to test the feasibility of increasing PA among older AA men. AIM 1: To identify individual, social, cultural and community barriers to and facilitators of PA in AA men age 45-84 years. In- depth interviews with older AA men and those that routinely interact with them will allow for exploration of individual, social, cultural and community structural (environmental) components that may interact with other factors (e.g., age) to impact PA beliefs, preferences, and behaviors among older AA men. AIM 2: Develop and pilot-test for feasibility a culturally relevant and gender-appropriate PA promotion program for older AA men. Findings from the in-depth interviews will guide the implementation of a community-based pilot intervention to encourage and assist older AA men in initiating and maintaining regular PA. The need to better understand the factors influencing PA in older AA men is paramount because they suffer much higher rates of acute and chronic physical and mental conditions that can be ameliorated by regular PA. Thus, PA can help reduce human suffering, offset premature death and disability, and improve quality of life for a segment of the population stricken by abysmal health - older AA men.          ",Factors Influencing Physical Activity in Older African American Men,7135674,R21AG028674,"['human middle age (35-64) ', ' human old age (65+) ', ' exercise ', ' body physical activity ', ' human subject ', ' interview ', ' health behavior ', ' attitude ', ' belief ', ' psychological values ', ' preference ', ' male ', ' African American ', ' racial /ethnic difference ', ' culture ', ' clinical research ', ' behavioral /social science research tag ', ' health disparity ', ' ']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA AT COLUMBIA,R21,2006,147600,0.03677926661499964

This study will screen 3,000 periodontally healthy children from Newark for the presence of Actinobacillus actiinomycetemcomitans (Aa). 205 test (Aa+) and 410 control (Aa-) will be recalled at 6-month intervals for 4-5 yrs to identify factors predictive of disease onset. Screening and recall exams include a periodontal examination, collection of saliva and buccal cells as well as crevicular fluid and subgingival plaque from pocketed sites and the mesial of all 1st molars. Samples will be stored for future analysis. Horizontal bite- wing radiographs are used to establish the LAP diagnosis. When bone loss is detected, stored site-specific samples will be analyzed. The revised proposal includes 2 aims: 1. to determine whether Aa, clones of Aa, or 200 members of the flora associated with Aa could be predictive of the onset of LAP; 2. to examine host factors that can affect Aa colonization, persistence, subgingival migration and subsequent activation of innate and acquired immune factors associated with disease onset. These factors include: iron-saturation of lactoferrin, IgA antibody titers to Aa adhesins, a Growth Modifying Factor (GMF) that killls Gram+ pioneer plaque microbes that compete with Aa, IgG antibody levels to leukotoxin and levels of 21 cytokines that can affect disease initiation. Comparison of data from Aa+ (test) and Aa- (control) groups should provide information with which to determine the combination of microbial and host markers predictive of risk for LAP onset. To date in those recalled for 1yr or more, 7 of 36 Aa+ students have developed LAP, while none of the Aa- conrols have LAP (p <.01). Pilot data from saliva obtained from students recalled indicates the following; 1. GMF from Aa+ students can kill pioneer plaque microbes in vitro (p < .01), 2. lower IgA levels are found in students repeatedly colonized by Aa, and 3. a specific cytokine, MIP 1a, is significantly elevated in Aa+/LAP subjects prior to bone loss (p <.01). The knowledge gained from this prospective study should identify markers required to develop a salivary-based diagnostic test that can be used to design preventive strategies to reduce oral health disparities in this predominantly African American and Hispanic population.           ",Localized Aggressive Periodontitis: Microbial & Host Markers for Susceptibility,7321527,R01DE017968,"['health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Actinobacillus ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Small Inducible Cytokine A3 ', ' Stem Cell Inhibitor ', ' MIP-1a ', ' MIP-1 Alpha ', ' MIP 1alpha ', ' Chemokine (C-C motif) Ligand 3 ', ' microbial host ', ' Environment ', ' Microarray Analysis ', ' microarray technology ', ' Microarray-Based Analysis ', ' Epithelial Cells ', ' All Sites ', ' Data ', ' Collection ', ' sex ', ' Exhibits ', ' Killings ', ' Future ', ' Affect ', ' Gingival Crevicular Fluid ', ' Gingival Exudate ', ' Age ', ' base ', ' Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Growth Factor ', ' Proteins Growth Factors ', ' Growth Substances ', ' Growth Agents ', ' GFAC ', ' sample collection ', ' specimen collection ', ' Site ', ' Surface ', ' Immunoglobulin A ', ' IgA ', ' Immunoglobulin G ', ' IgG ', ' 7S Gamma Globulin ', ' In Vitro ', ' Incidence ', ' Incisor ', ' incisor (dental) ', ' Evaluation ', ' Predisposition ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Screening procedure ', ' screenings ', ' screening ', ' Oral cavity ', ' Mouth ', ' Cavitas Oris ', ' Buccal Cavity Head and Neck ', ' Buccal Cavity ', ' Lactoferrin ', ' Lactotransferrin ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Numbers ', ' Bacterial Adhesins ', ' adhesin ', ' Methods ', ' Movement ', ' body movement ', ' Onset of illness ', ' disorder onset ', ' disease onset ', ' Integration Host Factors ', ' Host Factor Protein ', ' Host Factor ', ' Oral health ', ' dental health ', ' Organism ', ' living system ', ' Iron ', ' Fe element ', ' Liquid substance ', ' liquid ', ' fluid ', ' Periodontitis ', ' Chronic Periodontitis ', ' Antibodies ', ' Bacterial Antigens ', ' Inflammatory ', ' Prospective Studies ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Risk ', ' Saliva ', ' Knowledge ', ' Students ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Localized ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Tooth structure ', ' teeth ', ' Tooth ', ' Wing ', ' Immune ', ' Contralateral ', ' Oral ', ' Salivary ', ' Salivary immunoglobulin A ', ' salivary IgA ', ' microorganism ', ' tooth surface ', ' Bacteria ', ' Bite ', ' Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction ', ' reverse transcriptase PCR ', ' RTPCR ', ' RT-PCR ', ' microbial ', ' bone loss ', ' leukotoxin ', ' Prevention strategy ', ' Preventive strategy ', ' member ', ' Predictive Factor ', ' Cells ', ' cytokine ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans ', ' Bacterium comitans ', ' Bacterium actinomycetem comitans ', ' A. actinomycetemcomitans ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Diagnostic tests ', ' Hispanics ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Prevalence ', ' migration ', ' Microbe ', ' human disease ', ' Control Groups ', ' ']",NIDCR,UNIV OF MED/DENT OF NJ-NJ DENTAL SCHOOL,R01,2007,696635,0.15203844389894752
"TRIAD Center for Health Disparities    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Teamwork in Research and Intervention to Alleviate Disparities (TRIAD) EXPORT Center goal is to implement intervention research to address major health disparities of African-Americans, Hispanics, rural and low-income children and adults in central North Carolina, and, in particular, test interventions that can be tailored to geographic populations to address health disparities across the nation. African-Americans (AAs) constitute more than 30% of the population and the Hispanic population has increased >400% over the past decade. AA and Hispanic disparities exceed national [HP 2010] and state [Healthy Carolinians 2010] targets for HIV/AIDS, cardiovascular disease (CVD), and diabetes and related risk factors. Through this P20 center we propose to conduct research that will provide better understanding of how these disparities can be alleviated, and thus direction for ultimately eliminating the selected disparities in AAs, Hispanics, rural and low-income populations. AIMS are to 1) Increase the number and capacity of health disparity researchers that are from ethnic or racial minorities and female gender, 2) Enhance the infrastructure for interdisciplinary health disparity research focused on testing interventions and methods to prevent risk behaviors and improve self-management of health problems among African, Hispanics, rural and low income Americans 3) Expand involvement of the community in research, 4) Disseminate information on health disparities research. Administrative, Research, Training and Engagement Cores are interactive and synergistic and will be used to achieve the aims through efficacy studies. This is a collaborative effort of Nursing, Public Health Education, Exercise and Sports Science, Nutrition, Education, Anthropology, Mathematics, Human Development and Family Studies, the Center for Biotechnology, Genetics and Health Research, the Center for Youth, Family and Community Partnerships, health systems, school systems, free clinics and community and lay organizations. The long-term goal is for this EXPORT Center to assist the community, region and state and nation in meeting the health needs of a diverse citizenry through effective interventions and methods. Public statement: This Center will test ways to help minorities, rural and poor persons prevent and   deal with health problems. The major health problems we are concerned with are heart disease, diabetes and HIV/AIDS.

"Factors Influencing Physical Activity in Older African American Men    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application is in response to NIH PA# PA-03-170 entitled Health Promotion Among Racial and Ethnic Minority Males. A large body of evidence indicates that racial/ethnic disparities in health behaviors significantly contribute to the higher rates of morbidity and mortality in African American (AA) men. It is also firmly established that regular physical activity (PA) reduces the risk of many chronic diseases and increases longevity. Despite the positive relationship between PA and several health outcomes, national studies indicate a significantly higher prevalence of regular PA among white than AA adults and among younger versus older adults. In addition, experiences by both investigators and practitioners diffusing community- based PA programs serving older adults indicate far less participation by men in general and particularly by racial/ethnic minority men. The disparity in rates of PA and dismal participation in community PA programs may then be contributing factors to the severe health disparities that exist with older AA men. Thus, the overall goals of this project are to: 1) identify barriers and facilitators to engaging in PA for older AA men, 2) broaden our understanding of age and culturally appropriate PA for older AA men, and 3) design and implement a pilot intervention to test the feasibility of increasing PA among older AA men. AIM 1: To identify individual, social, cultural and community barriers to and facilitators of PA in AA men age 45-84 years. In- depth interviews with older AA men and those that routinely interact with them will allow for exploration of individual, social, cultural and community structural (environmental) components that may interact with other factors (e.g., age) to impact PA beliefs, preferences, and behaviors among older AA men. AIM 2: Develop and pilot-test for feasibility a culturally relevant and gender-appropriate PA promotion program for older AA men. Findings from the in-depth interviews will guide the implementation of a community-based pilot intervention to encourage and assist older AA men in initiating and maintaining regular PA. The need to better understand the factors influencing PA in older AA men is paramount because they suffer much higher rates of acute and chronic physical and mental conditions that can be ameliorated by regular PA. Thus, PA can help reduce human suffering, offset premature death and disability, and improve quality of life for a segment of the population stricken by abysmal health - older AA men.          ",Factors Influencing Physical Activity in Older African American Men,7283955,R21AG028674,"['Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Data ', ' High Prevalence ', ' Rate ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Feasibility Studies ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Age ', ' base ', ' Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Goals ', ' improved ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' Health education ', ' Health Tutoring ', ' Health Instruction ', ' Health Personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Health Promotion ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Man (Taxonomy) ', ' Depth ', ' Acute ', ' Chronic ', ' Diffuse ', ' Phase ', ' Interview ', ' Physical activity ', ' caucasian American ', ' white American ', ' Psyche structure ', ' mental ', ' disability ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Longevity ', ' lifespan ', ' life span ', ' Length of Life ', ' male ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Minority Groups ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Mortality ', ' Persons ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Condition ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Risk ', ' programs ', ' Testing ', ' Translating ', ' Attitude ', ' Work ', ' Behavior ', ' Belief ', ' behavior change ', ' preference ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' Structure ', ' disorder prevention ', ' disease prevention ', ' social ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' Gender ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Family member ', ' Mediating ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' chronic disorder ', ' chronic disease/disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Communities ', ' Qualitative Research ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Treatment Efficacy ', ' therapy efficacy ', ' therapeutically effective ', ' therapeutic efficacy ', ' intervention efficacy ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' therapy design ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' ']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA AT COLUMBIA,R21,2007,171984,0.03677926661499964
"Family Violence in Older African American Women    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   Dr. Paranjape's goal for this proposal is to acquire the tools necessary to become a leader in the field of FV and to improve the healthcare of older women. Building upon an excellent training in primary care and basic epidemiological skills, Dr. Paranjape proposes a career development plan that (1) integrates mentoring by an inter-disciplinary sponsor team with didactic coursework and tutorials designed to expand her theoretical and methodological horizons and (2) includes a series of focused research projects to amplify and reinforce existing and acquired methodological skills. Family Violence (FV) is a major public health problem; injury and violence are among the top ten high public health priority areas identified in the Healthy People 2010 report.  Although the health effects of FV in women have been well documented, the prevalence and health effects of FV, risk factors and screening methods for FV in older African American (AA) women, are still poorly understood. Thus, to begin to address this gap in our knowledge base, the specific aims of the research proposal are to: 1) develop and validate a scale that measures FV in older AA women 2) to identify the correlates of FV in this population, including individual factors, coping efforts and adjustment outcomes and 3) to develop a simple screening tool for FV in this population. This study will provide preliminary data for further research on the health effects of FV in older minority women. Dr. Kaslow, who is an extremely well-established and well funded investigator in the area of FV in AA women, will mentor Dr. Paranjape for the duration of this award, guiding her through the research and career development plan. An advisory council made up of Drs Ouslander, Kutner, Jacobson, Thompson, Rodriguez, Corbie-Smith, and Flacker, with complementary areas of expertise in aging, statistics, research in primary care, research in minority communities, and elder abuse research will also provide instruction in areas critical to Dr. Paranjape's career development plan. The research and training activities proposed herein will allow Dr. Paranjape to submit an R01 grant towards the end of the award period, providing a timely catalyst for her as she progresses towards attaining her career goal of being a leader in FV research.           ",Family Violence in Older African American Women,7261380,K23RR023364,"['Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Healthy People 2010 ', ' Provider ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' low socioeconomic status ', ' low socioeconomic position ', ' low socio-economic status ', ' low socio-economic position ', ' Elder Abuse ', ' senior abuse ', ' elderly abuse ', ' abuse of older adults ', ' Elements ', ' Address ', ' Caring ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Independent Scientist Award ', ' K02 Award ', ' Research Training ', ' Stress and Coping ', ' Child Abuse and Neglect ', ' child maltreatment ', ' Childhood maltreatment ', ' Rate ', ' Principal Investigator ', ' follow-up ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' Face ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Family ', ' Female ', ' physical abuse ', ' physical maltreatment ', ' Spouses ', ' Married Persons ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Affect ', ' Injury ', ' catalyst ', ' Age ', ' career ', ' Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' improved ', ' Health ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Health care facility ', ' Healthcare Facility ', ' Health Facilities ', ' Health Priorities ', ' Health Services ', ' health care service ', ' Health Status ', ' Level of Health ', ' Hospitals ', ' Area ', ' Acute ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Medical ', ' Series ', ' Family Violence ', ' Survivors ', ' indexing ', ' Screening procedure ', ' screenings ', ' screening ', ' Training ', ' Life Expectancy ', ' Individual ', ' Numbers ', ' health care service utilization ', ' healthcare utilization ', ' healthcare service utilization ', ' health services utilization ', ' Health Care Utilization ', ' Family history of ', ' Family Medical History Epidemiology ', ' Family Medical History ', ' Living Arrangement ', ' Development Plans ', ' Inequality ', ' Battered Women ', ' abuse of women ', ' abuse of females ', ' Abused women ', ' Abused females ', ' Funding ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Minor ', ' Morbidity -

"Factors Influencing the Racial Disparity in SIDS.    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The incidence of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) in the US has declined 50% since 1992, when the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) first recommended that infants be placed in a non-prone position for sleep. Despite the tremendous success of the subsequent Back to Sleep campaign, African-American (AA) infants remain twice as likely to be placed prone, and twice as likely to die from SIDS. The racial disparity exists across all educational and income categories, and the extent of the racial disparity has increased rather than decreased. The NICHD, in both its 2000 general Strategic Plan (From Cells to Selves) and its 2000 Strategic Plan for SIDS research (Targeting Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS): A Strategic Plan), highlighted the need to understand mechanisms leading to racial, ethnic, and social disparities as a research priority.      Very little is known about the reasons why AA parents use the prone position. Further, no studies have taken advantage of the observed socioeconomic status(SES)-associated variability in SIDS and prone sleeping within the AA community. By examining within-group differences, it is possible to move beyond comparative racial descriptions to identification of potentially modifiable factors. The overall purpose of these investigations, therefore, is to better understand factors contributing to the comparatively high incidence of prone sleep positioning in AA infants. In order to achieve this, will address the following Specific Aims: 1) To compare knowledge, attitudes, and practices regarding infant sleep position in AA parents of higher and lower SES. 2) To identify risk factors for non-use of the recommended supine sleep position in AA families with higher and lower SES. 3) To develop a phenomenological understanding of the decisions made by AA parents of higher and lower SES who do not use recommended supine sleep position, through qualitative methods. 4) To develop, implement, and evaluate an appropriate intervention program based on the knowledge gained through Specific Aims 1-3.      This study addresses important gaps in our understanding of factors informing parental decision regarding infant sleep positioning in AAs. By understanding the social and cultural factors, it should be possible to design more effective interventions, thereby potentially decreasing the rate of SIDS in AA infants.         ",Factors Influencing the Racial Disparity in SIDS.,7252682,K24RR023681,"['Decision Making ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Purpose ', ' low socioeconomic status ', ' low socioeconomic position ', ' low socio-economic status ', ' low socio-economic position ', ' Address ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Qualitative Methods ', ' National Institute of Child Health and Human Development ', ' NICHD ', ' Strategic Planning ', ' Targeted Research ', ' Rate ', ' socioeconomics ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomic ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio economic ', ' Family ', ' base ', ' Happiness ', ' positive attitude ', ' Health Personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Hospitals ', ' Household ', ' Incidence ', ' Income ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Infant ', ' Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice ', ' Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice ', ' Knowledge, Attitudes, Behaviors ', ' Funding ', ' Epidemiologic Studies ', ' epidemiologic investigation ', ' Epidemiology Research ', ' Epidemiological Studies ', ' Epidemiologic Research ', ' Parents ', ' Pediatrics ', ' Prone Position ', ' grandparent ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Sleep ', ' Research Priority ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Sudden infant death syndrome ', ' Sudden Unexpected Infant Death ', ' Sudden Infant Death ', ' SIDS ', ' Crib Death ', ' Cot Death ', ' Testing ', ' Investigation ', ' Work ', ' Techniques ', ' Birth ', ' Parturition ', ' American ', ' success ', ' intervention program ', ' Categories ', ' social ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' Cells ', ' Measures ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Academy ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Communities ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Back to Sleep ', ' infant sleep position ', ' infantile sleep position ', ' social disparities ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' racial/ethnic ', ' comparative ', ' ']",NCRR,CHILDREN'S RESEARCH INSTITUTE,K24,2007,158498,0.08022772078108067
"Predictors of Hemodialysis Access Dysfunction    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   Hemodialysis vascular access dysfunction accounts for extensive morbidity, and is the greatest contributor to cost among patients with renal failure. Diabetics and African Americans (AA's) are disproportionately affected; however, reasons for this are unclear.   The primary aims of the proposed study are 1) estimate the association between diabetes and AA race and arteriovenous fistula (AVF) survival; 2) explore whether factors associated with vessel location and primary cause of renal disease account for the relationship between diabetes and AA race and AVF survival; 3) determine if vein caliber and arterial resistance account for the association between diabetes and AA race and AVF survival, and 4) determine if inflammation accounts for the association between diabetes and AA race and AVF failure.   Two parallel activities will be conducted to address our scientific aims. First we will use data from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid end-stage renal disease (ESRD) Clinical Performance Measures (CPM) Project, United States Renal Data System (USRDS) and an established cohort from a Veterans' Affairs sponsored study of dialysis patients undergoing AVF placement to identify factors that might account for the association between diabetes and race and AVF survival. Second, we will recruit a cohort of 180 pre-dialysis patients preparing to undergo access placement from the clinics at Emory University, Emory Crawford Long Hospital, Grady Memorial Hospital and the Dialysis Access Center of Atlanta to ascertain if serum markers of inflammation account for the association between diabetes and AA race and access survival.

"Behavioral and Physiological Responses to Race-Related Stress in Diabetic Women    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): African American (AA) women carry a disproportionate burden of T2DM and some of its complications. The stress of exposure to discrimination may contribute to altered blood pressure, glycemia, insulin resistance, and self-care behaviors, thereby increasing risk for complications. Our aims are to: 1) Establish proof of principle that cumulative lifetime exposure to perceived discrimination is related to baseline behavioral and physiological factors that underlie complications in AA women with T2DM; 2) Establish proof of principal that cumulative lifetime exposure to perceived discrimination primes individuals for heightened reactivity to acute stressors. 3) Explore candidate modifiers of the relationship between cumulative lifetime exposure to perceived discrimination and stress reactivity; and 4) Refine and expand plans for a daily process study of these variables with diabetic AA women to support an R01 application. Forty AA women and 40 White women with T2DM will participate. On day 1, participants will perform 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring. On day 2, participants will complete baseline measures of exposure to discrimination, fasting glucose, insulin resistance, and blood pressure. Then we will expose the participants to a public speaking task in the laboratory to detect metabolic and cardiovascular reactivity to the acute stressor. On day 3, participants will again perform 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring. Five hypotheses will be tested. Ha1: There will be an effect for race on cumulative lifetime exposure to perceived discrimination. AA women will report greater cumulative lifetime exposure to perceived discrimination than White women. Ha2: There will be an effect for cumulative lifetime exposure to perceived discrimination on resting blood pressure, insulin resistance, and diabetes self- care behaviors. Higher cumulative lifetime exposure to perceived discrimination will be associated with higher resting blood pressure, higher insulin resistance, and lower diabetes self-care behaviors. Ha3: There will be an effect for stressor period on blood pressure and glycemia. Post-stressor blood pressure and glycemia will be higher than baseline levels. Ha4: There will be an effect for cumulative lifetime exposure to perceived discrimination on reactivity to experimental stressor. Higher lifetime exposure to perceived discrimination will predict greater glycemic and blood pressure reactivity to an acute experimental stressor. Ha5: There will be an effect for cumulative lifetime exposure to perceived discrimination on delayed recovery from an experimental stressor. Higher levels of lifetime exposure to perceived discrimination will predict less nighttime blood pressure dipping in response to an acute experimental stressor. Ha6: There will be trends for modifiers of the association between cumulative lifetime exposure to perceived discrimination and stress reactivity. Social support, SES, and coping will be explored. If successful, this R21 will lead to an R01 application for a daily process study with greater ecological validity. Eventually, this line of research will inform interventions to help AA women with T2DM manage racial stress, thereby reducing disparities in diabetes outcomes. African American (AA) women carry a disproportionate burden of T2DM and some of its complications. Exposure to the mental stress of racial discrimination may contribute to altered blood pressure, glycemia, insulin resistance, and self-care behaviors, thereby increasing risk for complications. This study will establish proof of principle that cumulative lifetime exposure to perceived discrimination is related to behavioral and physiological factors that underlie complications in AA women with T2DM. Eventually this line of research may lead to interventions to help AA women with T2DM better manage the stress of racial discrimination, thereby decreasing risk for diabetes complications and attenuating gender and racial disparities in diabetes complications.          ",Behavioral and Physiological Responses to Race-Related Stress in Diabetic Women,7305418,R21DK074468,"['racial discrimination ', ' race discrimination ', ' caucasian American ', ' white American ', ' Laboratories ', ' Psyche structure ', ' mental ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Individual ', ' Recovery ', ' diabetic ', ' Ambulatory Blood Pressure Monitoring ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Mortality ', ' Persons ', ' Metabolic ', ' Prejudice ', ' Exposure to ', ' Attenuated ', ' Daily ', ' Complications of Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Diabetic Complications ', ' Diabetes-Related Complications ', ' Diabetes Complications ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Research ', ' Rest ', ' Risk ', ' Self Care ', ' personal care ', ' Social support ', ' social support network ', ' Stress ', ' Psychological Stress ', ' Public Speaking ', ' Testing ', ' Woman ', ' Hour ', ' day ', ' Source ', ' Behavior ', ' Blood Pressure ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' stressor ', ' Participant ', ' Reporting ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' circulatory system ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' Cardiovascular system (all sites) ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' High Blood Pressure ', ' response ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' insulin sensitivity ', ' glycemic control ', ' Outcome ', ' coping ', ' Resistance ', ' resistant ', ' non-diabetic ', ' nondiabetic ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' type II DM ', ' type 2 DM ', ' maturity onset diabetes ', ' ketosis resistant diabetes ', ' adult onset diabetes ', ' Type II diabetes ', ' Type II Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Type 2 diabetes ', ' Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus ', ' T2DM ', ' T2D ', ' T2 DM ', ' Stable Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Slow-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Noninsulin Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Non-Insulin Dependent Diabetes ', ' NIDDM ', ' Maturity-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' MODY ', ' Ketosis-Resistant Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Adult-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Discrimination (Psychology) ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' trend ', ' Rate ', ' Process ', ' Behavioral ', ' Fasting ', ' fasts ', ' fasted ', ' Female ', ' Glucose ', ' Dextrose ', ' D-Glucose ', ' Goals ', ' improved ', ' Acute ', ' Hypertension ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' high blood pressure ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Link ', ' Insulin Resistance ', ' insulin resistant ', ' ']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF CONNECTICUT SCH OF MED/DNT,R21,2007,222000,0.022978556635123635
"Ethnic/Racial Minorities in the Colon CFR DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a common malignancy in Western countries. However, its frequency varies four-fold among US ethnic/racial minorities, with Japanese Americans (JAs) and African Americans (AAs) having a marked excess risk for the disease. Moreover, in contrast to JA patients who experience a better survival than whites, AAs with CRC present at a later stage and have a shorter, stage-adjusted survival than whites. The poor outcome of AA patients is not completely explained by their reduced access to medical care. These ethnic/racial disparities constitute an important public health challenge and also offer unique opportunities for etiologic research. This collaborative application will build upon the existing colorectal cancer Cooperative Family Registry (CFR) resource by recruiting additional families of AA (N=979) and Japanese (N=448) descent in Northern California, Southern California, North Carolina and Hawaii, using the CFR core protocol. We will then use the data and samples collected from a total of 1,514 AA, 745 JA and 750 white population-based families in the CFR to test the following hypotheses: 1) DNA mismatch repair deficiency is a more common pathogenic pathway to CRC in AAs, compared to whites, as reflected by a greater prevalence of tumor microsatellite instability (MSI); 2) Functional gene variants  and environmental exposures related to chemical carcinogenesis and methyl group metabolism are associated with an increased risk of MSI-high CRC, particularly in AAs and JAs; 3) Functional variants in cell proliferation- and angiogenesis-related genes are associated with risk of advanced-stage CRC and poor overall survival, particularly in AAs; 4) Functional variants in genes related to response to 5-fluorouracil/oxaliplatin chemotherapy are associated with shorter disease-free and overall survival, especially in AA s; 5) Other gene variants that are rare in whites but relatively common in AAs and JAs are associated with CRC and may significantly contribute to the etiology of the disease in these groups. The power to test these hypotheses will not be adequate without the proposed expanded recruitment. The insight into biological pathways gained by this project may lead to new means of prevention and treatment that may help not only to alleviate health disparities in the US but also better control CRC among all ethnic/racial groups.

"Ribavirin Pharmacokinetics, Race and HCV Treatment    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) is the most common cause for liver cirrhosis and a major risk factor for primary hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in the United States. In the absence of highly effective treatment, the number of patients with decompensated liver cirrhosis and primary HCC related to HCV is projected to increase by 200% and the number of deaths by 300% by the year 2030. HCV is 2 times more prevalent and is associated with worse outcome in African Americans (AA) than in Caucasian Americans (CA). Ironically, AA infected with HCV genotype 1 exhibit significantly lower rates of HCV clearance following treatment pegylated interferon alfa (PEGIFNa) in combination with ribavirin. More effective treatments for HCV genotype 1 infections in AA are needed to reduce the future health disparity between AA and CA with HCV. When combined with IFN ribavirin decreases HCV relapse rate following treatment resulting in a 2-3 higher sustained virological rate by compared to IFN alone. Several recent studies lead us to hypothesize that ribavirin pharmacokinetics is different in AA and CA HCV genotype 1 patients and that this difference contributes to the lower efficacy of PEGIFN and ribavirin in AA: 1) there is a significant correlation between both the ribavirin dose and ribavirin serum concentration during treatment and virologic response rates in patients receiving PEGIFN combination therapy; 2) a recent mathematical model HCV RNA kinetics suggests ribavirin treatment is more important to HCV clearance in patients in whom IFN therapy is less effective such as AA infected with HCV genotype 1; 3) a pilot study by Brennan et al. found increased ribavirin clearance and lower ribavirin serum levels in AA compared to CA HCV patients. The long-term objective of this project is to reduce the disparity in the efficacy of treatment for HCV between AA and CA. The project has 2 specific aims: 1) to determine the relationship between ribavirin plasma levels and virologic response and anemia in AA and CA HCV genotype 1 patients during PEGIFN alfa-2a and ribavirin treatment in the Virahep-C study; and 2) to determine ribavirin pharmacokinetics in AA and CA infected with HCV genotype 1. In all probability, PEGIFN and ribavirin or a ribavirin-like drug will remain a component of future HCV treatments that include HCV polymerase and protease inhibitors. The results of this study will clarify the importance of ribavirin pharmacokinetics during PEGIFN and ribavirin treatment, help to optimize ribavirin dose, and ultimately improve the efficacy of HCV genotype 1 treatment in AA as well as in CA patients. This proposed study seeks to improve the efficacy of current therapy for chronic hepatitis C (HCV) in African Americans infected with genotype 1 of the virus, the most resistant to treatment. More effective treatments are necessary to reduce the disparities between African Americans and Caucasian Americans in sickness and deaths related to HCV liver disease.          ","Ribavirin Pharmacokinetics, Race and HCV Treatment",7242435,R21DK078100,"['Chronic Hepatitis C ', ' chronic hepatitis C virus infection ', ' chronic HCV infection ', ' Chronic viral hepatitis C ', ' Chronic type C viral hepatitis ', ' American ', ' Toxic effect ', ' Toxicities ', ' novel ', ' Measures ', ' Relative (related person) ', ' Relative ', ' Hospital Mortality ', ' Inhospital Mortality ', ' In-house Mortalities ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' response ', ' mathematical model ', ' mathematical modeling ', ' Math Models ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' clinical investigation ', ' Pegylated Interferon Alfa ', ' PEG-interferon alfa ', ' PEG-IFN-a ', ' Combined Modality Therapy ', ' multimodality therapy ', ' combined treatment ', ' combined modality treatment ', ' combination therapy ', ' Multimodality Treatment ', ' Multimodal Treatment ', ' Multimodal Therapy ', ' Treatment Efficacy ', ' therapy efficacy ', ' therapeutically effective ', ' therapeutic efficacy ', ' intervention efficacy ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' Resistance ', ' resistant ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Etiology ', ' disease causation ', ' causation ', ' Causality ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Polymerase ', ' Address ', ' Dose ', ' RNA Polymerase Inhibitor ', ' trend ', ' Rate ', ' Exhibits ', ' Cirrhosis ', ' Future ', ' Genotype ', ' Aftercare ', ' post treatment ', ' After-Treatment ', ' After Care ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Primary carcinoma of the liver cells ', ' Liver Cells Carcinoma ', ' Hepatoma ', ' Hepatocellular cancer ', ' Hepatocellular Carcinoma ', ' Area ', ' Chronic ', ' Incidence ', ' Infection ', ' Interferons ', ' IFN ', ' Interferon-alpha ', ' Lymphoblastoid Interferon ', ' Lymphoblast Interferon ', ' Leukocyte Interferon ', ' Interferon Alfa-n3 ', ' IFNa ', ' IFN Alpha ', ' Ginterferon ', ' G-interferon ', ' Alferon ', ' Hepatitis C virus ', ' Hepatitus C ', ' HCV ', ' caucasian American ', ' white American ', ' Kinetics ', ' Serum ', ' Blood Serum ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Numbers ', ' Liver Cirrhosis ', ' Hepatic Cirrhosis ', ' Liver diseases ', ' liver disorder ', ' hepatopathy ', ' Hepatic Disorder ', ' Relative Risks ', ' Maryland ', ' hepatitis C virus NS3 protein ', ' p70(NS3) ', ' hepatitis C virus NS3 protease ', ' HCV-Hunan NS3 protein ', ' HCV-Hun NS3 protein ', ' HCV NS3 protein ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Mortality ', ' Anemia ', ' Patients ', ' Drug Kinetics ', ' Pharmacokinetics ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Plasma ', ' Reticuloendothelial System, Serum, Plasma ', ' Plasma Serum ', ' Blood Plasma ', ' Probability ', ' Prospective Studies ', ' Protease Inhibitor ', ' Proteinase Inhibitors ', ' Protease Antagonists ', ' Peptide Peptidohydrolase Inhibitors ', ' Peptide Hydrolase Inhibitors ', ' Peptidase Inhibitors ', ' Endopeptidase Inhibitors ', ' Antiproteases ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Relapse ', ' Ribavirin ', ' Tribavirin ', ' Ribovirin ', ' RTCA ', ' 1-Beta-D-ribofuranosyl-1H-1,2,4-triazole-3-carboxamide ', ' 1-Beta-D-ribofuranosyl-1,2,4-triazolo-3-carboxamide ', ' Risk Factors ', ' viral RNA ', ' virus RNA ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' Virus ', ' General Viruses ', ' day ', ' Week ', ' treatment duration ', ' treatment days ', ' Treatment Period ', ' Viral ', ' ']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND BALTIMORE,R21,2007,222750,0.21158123605662027
"Race and Health Outcomes Associated with Obesity    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Two overarching goals of Healthy People 2010 are to increase years and quality of healthy life and to eliminate health disparities. Because obesity disproportionately affects African and Hispanic Americans, understanding the influence of race on obesity's impact on different health outcomes is especially vital to achieving these goals. Interestingly, although African Americans (AAs) continue to have substantially lower life-expectancy than whites, observational studies suggest that obesity may have a lower impact on mortality in AAs than in whites even though healthcare expenditures in obese AAs are lower than in obese white Americans. Racial differences in obesity-related mortality and cost may be a reflection of differences on several fronts: higher rates of competing health risks such as smoking, HIV, and trauma in AAs; a reduced association between obesity and cardiovascular risk factors in AAs; and delays in diagnosis and treatment of risk factors in normal-weight AAs. Using data from 3 national databases -the Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey (MCBS), National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), and Medical Expenditures Panel Survey (MEPS)- this study will examine the interplay of race and body mass index (BMI) as they relate to 4 important outcomes: 1) mortality; 2) cardiovascular risk factors; 3) delays in diagnosis and treatment of cardiovascular risk factors; and 4) healthcare expenditures. Previous studies examining obesity-related mortality have not been able to adequately address the issue of competing health risks and residual confounding from smoking and preclinical illness, which can obscure an association between obesity and higher mortality. Because MCBS data are linked to Medicare claims longitudinally, this study will be able to limit uncontrolled confounding from smoking and pre-clinical disease and competing health risks. Furthermore, the studies proposed in this application will address several important questions: Is the association between obesity and novel cardiovascular risk factors reduced compared to whites? Are leaner minority adults, who may be at higher risk for some cardiovascular risk factors than predicted by their body mass index, more susceptible to having delays in diagnosis and treatment of these risk factors? What are the different types of care and medical conditions that drive racial differences in obesity-related healthcare expenditures? In clarifying these relationships, our findings could shed light on mechanisms underlying racial differences in obesity-related risk and cost. Our findings could also guide the setting of public health priorities and the targeting of specific initiatives to reduce racial disparities in healthcare and mortality.         ",Race and Health

"Prenatal Care for African American Women: Effect of Client-Provider Interaction    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Evidence suggests that poor communication with providers and problematic client-provider relationships among racial and ethnic minorities are associated with disparities in health care. The long -term objectives are to improve the quality of prenatal care, specifically for African American (AA) women through improving client-provider communication and ultimately to reduce racial/ethnic disparities in pregnancy outcomes. The purpose of this exploratory, descriptive, cross-sectional study is to describe client-provider interaction and its influence on African American (AA) women's satisfaction with prenatal care. In this study, we will recruit 18- 35 year old AA women (N=130) who are in their first trimester and their female providers, OB/GYN or advanced practice nurse providers, (N=10-12) from prenatal care clinics at two tertiary care, urban hospitals in Southeastern Michigan. Client-provider interaction will be described using two different methods, audio recordings and post-visit questionnaires. The modified version of Interaction Model of Client Health Behavior (IMCHB) will be used as the framework for this study. We will address three Specific Aims: 1). Describe client-provider interaction (affective support, health information, decisional control, and discrimination) among AA women and providers during the initial prenatal care visit; 2). Examine whether client-provider interaction predicts AA women's satisfaction with prenatal care 3). Compare differences and similarities in client-provider interaction when providers are racially concordant and discordant with AA women. This study is foundational to the development of interventions that will improve client-provider communication, enhance both satisfaction with and quality of prenatal care, and ultimately reduce healthcare disparities for African American pregnant women. The impact of quality client-provider communication in improving quality of care and the health status of individuals is recognized in Healthy People 2010. Specific recommendations include improving provider- client relationships through effective communication skills training and increasing the proportion of clients who are satisfied with their providers' communication skills. In addition, this research addresses NINR scientific goals of reducing health disparities and improving quality of care, and is congruent with the mission of AHRQ which includes improving the outcomes and quality of health care.           ",Prenatal Care for African American Women: Effect of Client-Provider Interaction,7277891,F31NR010320,"['Cross-Sectional Studies ', ' Disease Frequency Surveys ', ' Cross-Sectional Survey ', ' Cross-Sectional Analyses ', ' Cross Sectional Analysis ', ' Healthy People 2010 ', ' Provider ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Discrimination (Psychology) ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Purpose ', ' Low income ', ' Roter ', ' Address ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Client ', ' Communication ', ' Outcome ', ' tertiary care ', ' Affective ', ' therapy development ', ' treatment development ', ' intervention development ', ' develop therapy ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' Advanced Practice Nurse ', ' APN ', ' Process ', ' Female ', ' base ', ' Goals ', ' improved ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' Health Status ', ' Level of Health ', ' Pelvic Examination ', ' Pelvic Exam ', ' Urban Hospitals ', ' Metropolitan Hospitals ', ' City Hospitals ', ' Hypertension ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' high blood pressure ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Ensure ', ' Screening procedure ', ' screenings ', ' screening ', ' Individual ', ' Gynecologist ', ' satisfaction ', ' Methods ', ' Michigan ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' Mission ', ' Amniocentesis ', ' Pregnancy Outcome ', ' First Pregnancy Trimester ', ' First Trimester ', ' Early Placental Phase ', ' Pregnant Women ', ' Prenatal care ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' health care quality ', ' healthcare quality ', ' Questionnaires ', ' Recommendation ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' recruit ', ' Research ', ' Research Design ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Risk ', ' programs ', ' Testing ', ' Tocolysis ', ' Tocolytic Treatment ', ' Tocolytic Therapy ', ' Ultrasonography ', ' ultrasound scanning ', ' ultrasound imaging ', ' ultrasound ', ' sound measurement ', ' sonography ', ' sonogram ', ' diagnostic ultrasound ', ' Ultrasound Test ', ' Ultrasound Medical Imaging ', ' Ultrasound Diagnosis ', ' Ultrasonogram ', ' Ultrasonic Imaging ', ' Medical Ultrasound ', ' Echotomography ', ' Echography ', ' Urine ', ' Urine Urinary System ', ' Woman ', ' Clinic ', ' Visit ', ' skills training ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' skills ', ' Prevention ', ' United States Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality ', ' United States Agency for Health Care Policy and Research ', ' Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality ', ' Agency for Health Care Policy and Research ', ' AHRQ ', ' AHCPR ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Modeling ', ' Quality of Care ', ' QOC ', ' ']",NINR,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,F31,2007,29663,0.11361278581159984
"Assessing depression in African American cancer patients    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): African Americans (AA) have the highest incidence and death rates from all cancers in the U.S. Adequate assessment and treatment of depression in AA cancer patients is essential to reduce this unequal burden of cancer and health disparity. Current knowledge of AA cancer patients' depression is extremely limited. A few existing studies suggest inadequate recognition of the extent of depression in this population. Currently no available instrument has been validated for screening depression of AA cancer patients, despite increasing evidence of cultural insensitivity of depression measures for African Americans. It is imperative to develop a culturally sensitive screening instrument for AA cancer patients' depression, in order to provide adequate referral and needed care. The development of this instrument would require a deep understanding of AA depressive experience. This application is the first study of the lived experience of depression in AA cancer patients. It is significant because of the large size of AA cancer population, the need to combat cancer disparity, and its implication for quality of life and long-term survival of AA cancer patients. Using a mixed design, the study will provide baseline knowledge of AA depressive experience and identify AA depressive symptoms as an initial step of the instrument construction. The specific aims are as follows: 1) Describe the meaning and structure of AA depressive experience in the context of living with cancer; 2) Compare depressed and nondepressed AA cancer patients to identify beliefs and attitudes about having cancer, which are associated with depression; and 3) Identify manifestations of AA depression and create a symptom catalogue that can be developed into a culturally sensitive screening instrument for assessing AA cancer patient's depression in a future study. The interview sample will consist of 80 cancer patients-20 patients in each of four groups: 3 AA groups and a white group consisting of two subgroups, varying by degree of depression. The group members will be further stratified by age and cancer diagnosis for an unstructured individual interview that will be audiotaped, transcribed, and analyzed verbatim. In the validation phase, an additional 10 AA cancer patients will be recruited to determine the credibility of study outcomes. Qualitative data analysis using the NUDIST software will identify themes and their relationships to describe: 1) meanings and structure of the lived depressive experience of AA cancer patients; 2) beliefs and attitudes about having cancer; and 3) self- explanations of depressive experiences. The mixed method analysis using statistical and qualitative methods will be used to identify AA depressive symptoms. Consequently, a symptom catalogue that inventories the identified AA depressive symptoms will be constructed so that a culturally sensitive screening instrument for assessing depression in AA cancer patients can be developed in a future study.           ",Assessing depression in African American cancer patients,7261933,R03CA115191,"['Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Compliance behavior ', ' therapy cooperation ', ' therapy compliance ', ' patient adherence ', ' compliance cooperation ', ' Treatment Compliance ', ' Patient Cooperation ', ' Patient Compliance ', ' Address ', ' Length ', ' Symptoms ', ' Caring ', ' Qualitative Methods ', ' Detection ', ' Device or Instrument Development ', ' instrument development ', ' device development ', ' High Prevalence ', ' Prognostic Factor ', ' Prognostic/Survival Factor ', ' General Prognostic Factor ', ' Subgroup ', ' Cancer Patient ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Tumor Biology ', ' Validation ', ' Process ', ' Facility Construction Funding Category ', ' Fatigue ', ' Lack of Energy ', ' Guidelines ', ' Practice Guidelines ', ' Future ', ' Standards of Weights and Measures ', ' Age ', ' Hospitals ', ' Depth ', ' Specific qualifier value ', ' Specified ', ' Phase ', ' Medical ', ' Death Rate ', ' Incidence ', ' Interview ', ' Equipment and supply inventories ', ' Inventory ', ' Evaluation ', ' Screening procedure ', ' screenings ', ' screening ', ' caucasian American ', ' white American ', ' Distress ', ' Life Experience ', ' Individual ', ' African ', ' single episode major depressive disorder ', ' single episode Major Depression ', ' major depressive episode ', ' Single major depressive episode ', ' Single major depression ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Methods ', ' Reliance ', ' Pain ', ' Painful ', ' Patients ', ' Poverty ', ' Staging ', ' tool ', ' Psychometrics ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Depressed mood ', ' sadness ', ' depressed ', ' Anxiety ', ' instrument ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Condition ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' recruit ', ' Research Design ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Computer software ', ' computer program/software ', ' Software ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Catalogs ', ' Stress ', ' Survival Rate ', ' Time ', ' Well in self ', ' self wellness ', ' psychological wellness ', ' Sense of well-being ', ' Psychological Well Being ', ' Normal psyche ', ' Normal mental state ', ' Normal mental condition ', ' Mental well-being ', ' Feels well ', ' Emotional well being ', ' Attitude ', ' Audiotape ', ' Woman ', ' size ', ' Belief ', ' psychosocial ', ' Outcome Study ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' stressor ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' Structure ', ' member ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Reporting ', ' Cataloging ', ' Depression screen ', ' depression screening ', ' County ', ' Measures ', ' psychological distress ', ' Emotional ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' depressive symptoms ', ' depressive ', ' depression symptom ', ' Emotional Depression ', ' Sampling ', ' Property ', ' LOINC Axis 2 Property ', ' cancer site ', ' cancer location ', ' cancer diagnosis ', ' Accounting ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' cancer disparity ', ' ']",NCI,CASE WESTERN RESERVE UNIVERSITY,R03,2007,75010,0.06065609299245478
"African American Weight Control Registry DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   Professional Goal: The purpose of this Mentored-Patient Oriented Career Development proposal is to enhance the research development of Dr. Ann Smith Barnes. In addition to the establishment of a descriptive database of African Americans (AA) successful at weight-loss maintenance, Dr. Smith Barnes will acquire research training at the University of Texas School of Public Health. She will complete academic requirements for a Master's degree in public health and will obtain an understanding of research design, data collection and analysis. Under the mentorship of Dr. Kenneth Goodrick, Dr. Smith Barnes will use the award to broaden general understanding of elements of successful weight-loss maintenance in AA. The support will establish her as a leader in obesity management in minority populations. Specific Aims of African American Weight Control Registry: The project will use focus groups and a cross sectional study design to: a) identify relevant variables for weight loss and maintenance in AA using the theoretical framework of Theory of Planned Behavior; b) using information from focus groups, develop an instrument to assess weight loss and maintenance in AA; c) establish a registry of AA who are successful at weight loss (defined as 10 percent of their body weight) and weight-loss maintenance for (1 year and those who have been successful at weight loss but not maintenance; d)survey individuals selected from the registry to validate the instrument and to compare characteristics of AA who are successful at weight loss and maintenance to AA who are not successful at maintenance. This study will have four stages: I) Focus groups II) Instrument development III) Registry establishment and IV) Psycohometric analysis of the survey instrument and comparison of responses of successful versus unsuccessful weight-loss maintainers. Hypotheses: 1. The three constructs, attitude, subjective norm, and perceived behavioral control, will be significantly correlated to intention to adopt weight-loss maintenance practices in AA. 2. Successful weight-loss maintainers will differ from weight re-gainers in the TPB constructs of attitude, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control. Conclusions: This descriptive, comparative study of weight-loss maintainers and re-gainers will provide critical information for development of appropriate weight-loss interventions in AA. Adoption of successful practices in weight-loss maintenance in AA will begin to eliminate disparities in health.

"Prenatal Care for African American Women: Effect of Client-Provider Interaction    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Evidence suggests that poor communication with providers and problematic client-provider relationships among racial and ethnic minorities are associated with disparities in health care. The long -term objectives are to improve the quality of prenatal care, specifically for African American (AA) women through improving client-provider communication and ultimately to reduce racial/ethnic disparities in pregnancy outcomes. The purpose of this exploratory, descriptive, cross-sectional study is to describe client-provider interaction and its influence on African American (AA) women's satisfaction with prenatal care. In this study, we will recruit 18- 35 year old AA women (N=130) who are in their first trimester and their female providers, OB/GYN or advanced practice nurse providers, (N=10-12) from prenatal care clinics at two tertiary care, urban hospitals in Southeastern Michigan. Client-provider interaction will be described using two different methods, audio recordings and post-visit questionnaires. The modified version of Interaction Model of Client Health Behavior (IMCHB) will be used as the framework for this study. We will address three Specific Aims: 1). Describe client-provider interaction (affective support, health information, decisional control, and discrimination) among AA women and providers during the initial prenatal care visit; 2). Examine whether client-provider interaction predicts AA women's satisfaction with prenatal care 3). Compare differences and similarities in client-provider interaction when providers are racially concordant and discordant with AA women. This study is foundational to the development of interventions that will improve client-provider communication, enhance both satisfaction with and quality of prenatal care, and ultimately reduce healthcare disparities for African American pregnant women. The impact of quality client-provider communication in improving quality of care and the health status of individuals is recognized in Healthy People 2010. Specific recommendations include improving provider- client relationships through effective communication skills training and increasing the proportion of clients who are satisfied with their providers' communication skills. In addition, this research addresses NINR scientific goals of reducing health disparities and improving quality of care, and is congruent with the mission of AHRQ which includes improving the outcomes and quality of health care.           ",Prenatal Care for African American Women: Effect of Client-Provider Interaction,7449649,F31NR010320,"['Cross-Sectional Studies ', ' Disease Frequency Surveys ', ' Cross-Sectional Survey ', ' Cross-Sectional Analyses ', ' Cross Sectional Analysis ', ' Healthy People 2010 ', ' Provider ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Discrimination (Psychology) ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Purpose ', ' Low income ', ' Roter ', ' Address ', ' Advanced Practice Nurse ', ' APN ', ' Process ', ' Female ', ' base ', ' Goals ', ' improved ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' Health Status ', ' Level of Health ', ' Pelvic Examination ', ' Pelvic Exam ', ' Urban Hospitals ', ' Metropolitan Hospitals ', ' City Hospitals ', ' Hypertension ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' high blood pressure ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Ensure ', ' Screening procedure ', ' screenings ', ' screening ', ' Individual ', ' Gynecologist ', ' satisfaction ', ' Methods ', ' Michigan ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' Mission ', ' Amniocentesis ', ' Pregnancy Outcome ', ' First Pregnancy Trimester ', ' First Trimester ', ' Early Placental Phase ', ' Pregnant Women ', ' Prenatal care ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' health care quality ', ' healthcare quality ', ' Questionnaires ', ' Recommendation ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' recruit ', ' Research ', ' Research Design ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Risk ', ' programs ', ' Testing ', ' Tocolysis ', ' Tocolytic Treatment ', ' Tocolytic Therapy ', ' Ultrasonography ', ' ultrasound scanning ', ' ultrasound imaging ', ' ultrasound ', ' sound measurement ', ' sonography ', ' sonogram ', ' diagnostic ultrasound ', ' Ultrasound Test ', ' Ultrasound Medical Imaging ', ' Ultrasound Diagnosis ', ' Ultrasonogram ', ' Ultrasonic Imaging ', ' Medical Ultrasound ', ' Echotomography ', ' Echography ', ' Urine ', ' Urine Urinary System ', ' Woman ', ' Clinic ', ' Visit ', ' skills training ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' skills ', ' Prevention ', ' United States Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality ', ' United States Agency for Health Care Policy and Research ', ' Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality ', ' Agency for Health Care Policy and Research ', ' AHRQ ', ' AHCPR ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Modeling ', ' Quality of Care ', ' QOC ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Client ', ' Communication ', ' Outcome ', ' tertiary care ', ' Affective ', ' therapy development ', ' treatment development ', ' intervention development ', ' develop therapy ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' ']",NINR,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,F31,2008,29663,0.11361278581159984
"Ribavirin Pharmacokinetics, Race and HCV Treatment    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) is the most common cause for liver cirrhosis and a major risk factor for primary hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in the United States. In the absence of highly effective treatment, the number of patients with decompensated liver cirrhosis and primary HCC related to HCV is projected to increase by 200% and the number of deaths by 300% by the year 2030. HCV is 2 times more prevalent and is associated with worse outcome in African Americans (AA) than in Caucasian Americans (CA). Ironically, AA infected with HCV genotype 1 exhibit significantly lower rates of HCV clearance following treatment pegylated interferon alfa (PEGIFNa) in combination with ribavirin. More effective treatments for HCV genotype 1 infections in AA are needed to reduce the future health disparity between AA and CA with HCV. When combined with IFN ribavirin decreases HCV relapse rate following treatment resulting in a 2-3 higher sustained virological rate by compared to IFN alone. Several recent studies lead us to hypothesize that ribavirin pharmacokinetics is different in AA and CA HCV genotype 1 patients and that this difference contributes to the lower efficacy of PEGIFN and ribavirin in AA: 1) there is a significant correlation between both the ribavirin dose and ribavirin serum concentration during treatment and virologic response rates in patients receiving PEGIFN combination therapy; 2) a recent mathematical model HCV RNA kinetics suggests ribavirin treatment is more important to HCV clearance in patients in whom IFN therapy is less effective such as AA infected with HCV genotype 1; 3) a pilot study by Brennan et al. found increased ribavirin clearance and lower ribavirin serum levels in AA compared to CA HCV patients. The long-term objective of this project is to reduce the disparity in the efficacy of treatment for HCV between AA and CA. The project has 2 specific aims: 1) to determine the relationship between ribavirin plasma levels and virologic response and anemia in AA and CA HCV genotype 1 patients during PEGIFN alfa-2a and ribavirin treatment in the Virahep-C study; and 2) to determine ribavirin pharmacokinetics in AA and CA infected with HCV genotype 1. In all probability, PEGIFN and ribavirin or a ribavirin-like drug will remain a component of future HCV treatments that include HCV polymerase and protease inhibitors. The results of this study will clarify the importance of ribavirin pharmacokinetics during PEGIFN and ribavirin treatment, help to optimize ribavirin dose, and ultimately improve the efficacy of HCV genotype 1 treatment in AA as well as in CA patients. This proposed study seeks to improve the efficacy of current therapy for chronic hepatitis C (HCV) in African Americans infected with genotype 1 of the virus, the most resistant to treatment. More effective treatments are necessary to reduce the disparities between African Americans and Caucasian Americans in sickness and deaths related to HCV liver disease.          ","Ribavirin Pharmacokinetics, Race and HCV Treatment",7440199,R21DK078100,"['Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Etiology ', ' disease causation ', ' causation ', ' Causality ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Polymerase ', ' Address ', ' Dose ', ' RNA Polymerase Inhibitor ', ' trend ', ' Rate ', ' Exhibits ', ' Cirrhosis ', ' Future ', ' Genotype ', ' Aftercare ', ' post treatment ', ' After-Treatment ', ' After Care ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Primary carcinoma of the liver cells ', ' Liver Cells Carcinoma ', ' Hepatoma ', ' Hepatocellular cancer ', ' Hepatocellular Carcinoma ', ' Area ', ' Chronic ', ' Incidence ', ' Infection ', ' Interferons ', ' IFN ', ' Interferon-alpha ', ' Lymphoblastoid Interferon ', ' Lymphoblast Interferon ', ' Leukocyte Interferon ', ' Interferon Alfa-n3 ', ' IFNa ', ' IFN Alpha ', ' Ginterferon ', ' G-interferon ', ' Alferon ', ' Hepatitis C virus ', ' Hepatitus C ', ' HCV ', ' caucasian American ', ' white American ', ' Kinetics ', ' Serum ', ' Blood Serum ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Numbers ', ' Liver Cirrhosis ', ' Hepatic Cirrhosis ', ' Liver diseases ', ' liver disorder ', ' hepatopathy ', ' Hepatic Disorder ', ' Relative Risks ', ' Maryland ', ' hepatitis C virus NS3 protein ', ' p70(NS3) ', ' hepatitis C virus NS3 protease ', ' HCV-Hunan NS3 protein ', ' HCV-Hun NS3 protein ', ' HCV NS3 protein ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Mortality ', ' Anemia ', ' Patients ', ' Drug Kinetics ', ' Pharmacokinetics ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Plasma ', ' Reticuloendothelial System, Serum, Plasma ', ' Plasma Serum ', ' Blood Plasma ', ' Probability ', ' Prospective Studies ', ' Protease Inhibitor ', ' Proteinase Inhibitors ', ' Protease Antagonists ', ' Peptide Peptidohydrolase Inhibitors ', ' Peptide Hydrolase Inhibitors ', ' Peptidase Inhibitors ', ' Endopeptidase Inhibitors ', ' Antiproteases ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Relapse ', ' Ribavirin ', ' Tribavirin ', ' Ribovirin ', ' RTCA ', ' 1-Beta-D-ribofuranosyl-1H-1,2,4-triazole-3-carboxamide ', ' 1-Beta-D-ribofuranosyl-1,2,4-triazolo-3-carboxamide ', ' Risk Factors ', ' viral RNA ', ' virus RNA ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' Virus ', ' General Viruses ', ' day ', ' Week ', ' treatment duration ', ' treatment days ', ' Treatment Period ', ' Viral ', ' Chronic Hepatitis C ', ' chronic hepatitis C virus infection ', ' chronic HCV infection ', ' Chronic viral hepatitis C ', ' Chronic type C viral hepatitis ', ' American ', ' Toxic effect ', ' Toxicities ', ' novel ', ' Measures ', ' Relative (related person) ', ' Relative ', ' Hospital Mortality ', ' Inhospital Mortality ', ' In-house Mortalities ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' response ', ' mathematical model ', ' mathematical modeling ', ' Math Models ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' clinical investigation ', ' Pegylated Interferon Alfa ', ' PEG-interferon alfa ', ' PEG-IFN-a ', ' Combined Modality Therapy ', ' multimodality therapy ', ' combined treatment ', ' combined modality treatment ', ' combination therapy ', ' Multimodality Treatment ', ' Multimodal Treatment ', ' Multimodal Therapy ', ' Treatment Efficacy ', ' therapy efficacy ', ' therapeutically effective ', ' therapeutic efficacy ', ' intervention efficacy ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' Resistance ', ' resistant ', ' ']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND BALTIMORE,R21,2008,181912,0.21158123605662027
"Race and Preference for Knee Replacement:  A Patient-Centered Intervention    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Abstract Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most prevalent form of arthritis and is among the most prevalent chronic conditions in the US. The prevalence of knee OA increases with age. With the aging of the US population, the burden of OA is expected to increase. The prevalence of knee OA among older African-Americans (AAs) is higher than that reported for whites. Yet numerous studies have documented the existence of marked racial/ethnic disparities in the utilization of knee replacement, an effective and highly utilized treatment option for advanced knee OA. Our research team conducted one of the first studies to examine the reasons why AA and white patients differ in utilization of joint replacement. We have published evidence demonstrating that, compared to similar white patients, AA potential candidates for joint replacement differ in their preferences for joint replacement, and that these differences are in part shaped by differences in knowledge about the risks/benefits of the treatment and consequently in expectations on surgical outcome. There are national calls to act on this information by testing interventions to reduce this disparity. The proposed trial is one of the first in the nation to directly assess the effect of a patient-centered intervention on AA patient's preferences for and access to knee replacement. The immediate goal of this randomized controlled trial is to assess the impact of a high quality, evidence-based, patient-centered educational intervention supplemented with targeted counseling (motivational interviewing) on AA patient preferences, expectations, and likelihood of achieving a referral for orthopedic evaluation. AA primary care patients who are potential candidates for joint replacement based on clinical severity of their disease who have no clear contra-indications for surgical intervention will be randomized to either intervention or attention control. We will assess the effect of the intervention on patient preference, expectations, and likelihood of receiving a referral for orthopedic evaluation within 12 months of the intervention. The long-term goal of this research is to implement effective interventions targeting AAs who are clinical candidates for joint replacement in a national effort to improve access to reduce and ultimately eliminate disparities in the utilization of this effective treatment option. Therefore, the specific aims are: (1) to examine the effect of the knee osteoarthritis decision aid supplemented by counseling on AA patient preferences and expectations regarding surgical outcome for knee joint replacement; (2) to examine the effect of the intervention on orthopedic surgery referral rates for AA patients; and (3) To examine the mechanism of action of the intervention (combined decision aid and counseling using motivational interviewing). A secondary aim of the proposed research is to examine the effect of the intervention on AA patients' rate of knee replacement.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Numerous studies have documented the existence of marked racial/ethnic disparities in the utilization of knee replacement, an effective and highly utilized treatment option for advanced knee osteoarthritis. This study will provide one of the first interventions in the nation designed to mitigate racial/ethnic disparity in access to joint replacement for patients who meet clinical indications for the treatment. The results of this study will not only inform the nation on strategies to reduce or eliminate one of most marked disparities in chronic disease management, but will also provide opportunities to improve quality of care for large segment of our society.          ",Race and Preference for Knee Replacement:  A Patient-Centered Intervention,7525579,R01AR054474,"['Counseling ', ' Decision Making ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Effectiveness of Interventions ', ' Improve Access ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Rate ', ' Orthopedic Surgery procedures ', ' Orthopedic Surgery ', ' Foundations ', ' Age ', ' base ', ' Goals ', ' Aging ', ' improved ', ' Replacement Arthroplasty ', ' joint replacement ', ' Joint Prosthesis Implantation ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Medical ', ' Evaluation ', ' Knee joint ', ' disability ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lower Extremity ', ' Membrum inferius ', ' Lower Limb ', ' Educational Intervention ', ' instructional intervention ', ' Training Intervention ', ' Instruction Intervention ', ' Education for Intervention ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Orthopedics ', ' Orthopedic Surgical Profession ', ' Orthopedic ', ' Degenerative polyarthritis ', ' hypertrophic arthritis ', ' degenerative joint disease ', ' Osteoarthrosis ', ' Osteoarthritis ', ' Degenerative Arthritis ', ' Patients ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Primary Care ', ' Staging ', ' Shapes ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' preference ', ' expectation ', ' motivational enhancement therapy ', ' motivational interview ', ' Benefits and Risks ', ' Reporting ', ' abstracting ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Decision Aid ', ' Arthroplasty, Replacement, Knee ', ' Total Knee Replacement ', ' Total Arthroplasty of the Knee ', ' TKR - Total knee replacement ', ' Prosthetic total arthroplasty of the knee ', ' Knee replacement ', ' Knee joint replacement operation ', ' Knee arthroplasty ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' chronic disorder ', ' chronic disease/disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Quality of Care ', ' QOC ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' administrative database ', ' administrative data base ', ' patient oriented ', ' patient centered ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' Control Groups ', ' Publishing ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Condition ', ' Research ', ' Research Design ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Societies ', ' Patient Preferences ', ' Knowledge ', ' Disease Management ', ' Disorder Management ', ' Arthritis ', ' joint inflammation ', ' arthritic ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Knee Osteoarthritis ', ' Attention ', ' Severities ', ' Techniques ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' surgery ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' ']",NIAMS,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2008,276760,0.1441398467113052
"Peer-support motivational interviewing PA intervention for African American women    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The health benefits of PA are widely accepted, aiding in reducing the risk of cardiovascular disease, diabetes, stroke, obesity, and some cancers. Recommendations are to engage in 30 minutes a day on most days of the week, however, < of adults are inactive with higher rates of inactivity among racial and ethnic minority women. The Guide to Community Preventive Service found social support interventions to be effective in increasing PA. Therefore, the proposed study seeks to examine the feasibility and efficacy of a novel ""Culturally-Appropriate Peer-based Motivational Interviewing"" (CAPMI) intervention that targets behavioral skills, communication and social support for increasing PA in sedentary African American (AA) women. The overarching theoretical rationale for CAPMI centers on the role of social influence in the behavior change process. Family, friends and supportive others exert influence on one's motives, preferences, behaviors, and outcomes. As such, there is a clear need to target natural networks in behavior change studies. Motivational Interviewing (MI) is an approach that may help individuals enhance the quality of support given and received from their supportive others. MI focuses on helping individuals increase motivation by reducing barriers to change and resolving ambivalence for a given behavior by using empathy, encouragement, and non- confrontational methods. This method has been used extensively in addiction studies, but is showing promise for improving other health behaviors such as diet and PA, and among minority populations. The primary goal of the proposed intervention is to examine the efficacy of using motivational interviewing techniques to foster better reciprocal social support. Specific aims are: (1) to conduct formative research using semi-structured in- depth interviews and focus groups with sedentary AA women to investigate the role and importance of social support for PA; (2) to determine the feasibility of recruiting and implementing CAPMI in sedentary AA women; and (3) to pilot test and evaluate the efficacy of the CAPMI in increasing PA, social support, self-efficacy and reducing barriers to PA at post-intervention compared to an attention control group. Women (N=80; 40 dyads) recruited in natural non-intimate dyads (i.e., family members or friends) will be randomly assigned to either the CAPMI: (1) peer-based MI and behavioral skills (e.g., goal setting and problem solving) training; (2) self-help materials (e.g., workbook, training DVD and PA newsletters); (3) pedometer; or Attention Control (AC): (1) self- help materials (PA newsletter only); (2) pedometer. Prior to the start of the intervention, focus groups and paired semi-structured in-depth interviews will be conducted with AA women to examine sources of social support for PA. Intervention and control participants will be compared on minutes of self-report moderate- intensity PA, social support, and PA barriers at four time-points: baseline and Weeks 4, 8, and 12 post-baseline. We also propose a brief plan of process evaluation using the RE-AIM framework to determine reach, efficacy, and implementation of the intervention. Public Health Relevance: Non-intimate natural networks, i.e., family members/friends, can play a major role in increasing physical activity (PA) in African American women. The proposed culturally- appropriate peer-delivered MI intervention (CAPMI) is designed to address this issue by enhancing the type of motivation and support that peers provide for PA. The goal of this study is to ultimately reduce racial/ethnic disparities in cancer by developing prevention interventions that address AA women's' social resources, and to enhance our knowledge of how to move women from being sedentary to meeting PA recommendations for cancer prevention.          ",Peer-support motivational interviewing PA intervention for African American women,7510690,R21CA134961,"['Professional counselor ', ' Counselor ', ' cardiovascular disorder risk ', ' cardiovascular disease risk ', ' Provider ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Diet ', ' Purpose ', ' Empathy ', ' Address ', ' Preventive ', ' Data ', ' Effectiveness of Interventions ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Statistically Significant ', ' Cognitive ', ' Validation ', ' Rate ', ' Process ', ' Behavioral ', ' Family ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Affect ', ' base ', ' Goals ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Health behavior ', ' Depth ', ' sedentary ', ' indexing ', ' Interview ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Physical activity ', ' Individual ', ' Fostering ', ' Maintenance ', ' Methods ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' Motivation ', ' Newsletter ', ' Educational Intervention ', ' instructional intervention ', ' Training Intervention ', ' Instruction Intervention ', ' Education for Intervention ', ' cancer prevention ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Obesity ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Play ', ' Asses ', ' Equus asinus ', ' Donkey ', ' Problem Solving ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' Recommendation ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' recruit ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Social support ', ' social support network ', ' Knowledge ', ' stroke ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' brain attack ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Apoplexy ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Attention ', ' Woman ', ' day ', ' Week ', ' Source ', ' Techniques ', ' size ', ' Behavior ', ' behavior change ', ' Services ', ' preference ', ' Church ', ' American ', ' self help ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' Structure ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' peer ', ' member ', ' Agreement ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Self-Report ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' motivational enhancement therapy ', ' motivational interview ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' Reporting ', ' Touch sensation ', ' Touch ', ' social ', ' Friends ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Family member ', ' Health Benefit ', ' Sampling ', ' theories ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Cognition ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Population ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' racial/ethnic ', ' addiction ', ' addictive disorder ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' Control Groups ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF TX MD ANDERSON CAN CTR,R21,2008,220189,0.0505942828914594
"Behavioral and Physiological Responses to Race-Related Stress in Diabetic Women    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): African American (AA) women carry a disproportionate burden of T2DM and some of its complications. The stress of exposure to discrimination may contribute to altered blood pressure, glycemia, insulin resistance, and self-care behaviors, thereby increasing risk for complications. Our aims are to: 1) Establish proof of principle that cumulative lifetime exposure to perceived discrimination is related to baseline behavioral and physiological factors that underlie complications in AA women with T2DM; 2) Establish proof of principal that cumulative lifetime exposure to perceived discrimination primes individuals for heightened reactivity to acute stressors. 3) Explore candidate modifiers of the relationship between cumulative lifetime exposure to perceived discrimination and stress reactivity; and 4) Refine and expand plans for a daily process study of these variables with diabetic AA women to support an R01 application. Forty AA women and 40 White women with T2DM will participate. On day 1, participants will perform 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring. On day 2, participants will complete baseline measures of exposure to discrimination, fasting glucose, insulin resistance, and blood pressure. Then we will expose the participants to a public speaking task in the laboratory to detect metabolic and cardiovascular reactivity to the acute stressor. On day 3, participants will again perform 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring. Five hypotheses will be tested. Ha1: There will be an effect for race on cumulative lifetime exposure to perceived discrimination. AA women will report greater cumulative lifetime exposure to perceived discrimination than White women. Ha2: There will be an effect for cumulative lifetime exposure to perceived discrimination on resting blood pressure, insulin resistance, and diabetes self- care behaviors. Higher cumulative lifetime exposure to perceived discrimination will be associated with higher resting blood pressure, higher insulin resistance, and lower diabetes self-care behaviors. Ha3: There will be an effect for stressor period on blood pressure and glycemia. Post-stressor blood pressure and glycemia will be higher than baseline levels. Ha4: There will be an effect for cumulative lifetime exposure to perceived discrimination on reactivity to experimental stressor. Higher lifetime exposure to perceived discrimination will predict greater glycemic and blood pressure reactivity to an acute experimental stressor. Ha5: There will be an effect for cumulative lifetime exposure to perceived discrimination on delayed recovery from an experimental stressor. Higher levels of lifetime exposure to perceived discrimination will predict less nighttime blood pressure dipping in response to an acute experimental stressor. Ha6: There will be trends for modifiers of the association between cumulative lifetime exposure to perceived discrimination and stress reactivity. Social support, SES, and coping will be explored. If successful, this R21 will lead to an R01 application for a daily process study with greater ecological validity. Eventually, this line of research will inform interventions to help AA women with T2DM manage racial stress, thereby reducing disparities in diabetes outcomes. African American (AA) women carry a disproportionate burden of T2DM and some of its complications. Exposure to the mental stress of racial discrimination may contribute to altered blood pressure, glycemia, insulin resistance, and self-care behaviors, thereby increasing risk for complications. This study will establish proof of principle that cumulative lifetime exposure to perceived discrimination is related to behavioral and physiological factors that underlie complications in AA women with T2DM. Eventually this line of research may lead to interventions to help AA women with T2DM better manage the stress of racial discrimination, thereby decreasing risk for diabetes complications and attenuating gender and racial disparities in diabetes complications.          ",Behavioral and Physiological Responses to Race-Related Stress in Diabetic Women,7460750,R21DK074468,"['Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' type II DM ', ' type 2 DM ', ' maturity onset diabetes ', ' ketosis resistant diabetes ', ' adult onset diabetes ', ' Type II diabetes ', ' Type II Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Type 2 diabetes ', ' Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus ', ' T2DM ', ' T2D ', ' T2 DM ', ' Stable Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Slow-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Noninsulin Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Non-Insulin Dependent Diabetes ', ' NIDDM ', ' Maturity-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' MODY ', ' Ketosis-Resistant Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Adult-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Discrimination (Psychology) ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' trend ', ' Rate ', ' Process ', ' Behavioral ', ' Fasting ', ' fasts ', ' fasted ', ' Female ', ' Glucose ', ' Dextrose ', ' D-Glucose ', ' Goals ', ' improved ', ' Acute ', ' Hypertension ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' high blood pressure ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Link ', ' Insulin Resistance ', ' insulin resistant ', ' racial discrimination ', ' race discrimination ', ' caucasian American ', ' white American ', ' Laboratories ', ' Psyche structure ', ' mental ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Individual ', ' Recovery ', ' diabetic ', ' Ambulatory Blood Pressure Monitoring ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Mortality ', ' Persons ', ' Metabolic ', ' Prejudice ', ' Exposure to ', ' Attenuated ', ' Daily ', ' Complications of Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Diabetic Complications ', ' Diabetes-Related Complications ', ' Diabetes Complications ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Research ', ' Rest ', ' Risk ', ' Self Care ', ' personal care ', ' Social support ', ' social support network ', ' Stress ', ' Psychological Stress ', ' Public Speaking ', ' Testing ', ' Woman ', ' Hour ', ' day ', ' Source ', ' Behavior ', ' Blood Pressure ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' stressor ', ' Participant ', ' Reporting ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' circulatory system ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' Cardiovascular system (all sites) ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' High Blood Pressure ', ' response ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' insulin sensitivity ', ' glycemic control ', ' Outcome ', ' coping ', ' Resistance ', ' resistant ', ' non-diabetic ', ' nondiabetic ', ' ']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF CONNECTICUT SCH OF MED/DNT,R21,2008,181300,0.022978556635123635
"TRIAD Center for Health Disparities    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Teamwork in Research and Intervention to Alleviate Disparities (TRIAD) EXPORT Center goal is to implement intervention research to address major health disparities of African-Americans, Hispanics, rural and low-income children and adults in central North Carolina, and, in particular, test interventions that can be tailored to geographic populations to address health disparities across the nation. African-Americans (AAs) constitute more than 30% of the population and the Hispanic population has increased >400% over the past decade. AA and Hispanic disparities exceed national [HP 2010] and state [Healthy Carolinians 2010] targets for HIV/AIDS, cardiovascular disease (CVD), and diabetes and related risk factors. Through this P20 center we propose to conduct research that will provide better understanding of how these disparities can be alleviated, and thus direction for ultimately eliminating the selected disparities in AAs, Hispanics, rural and low-income populations. AIMS are to 1) Increase the number and capacity of health disparity researchers that are from ethnic or racial minorities and female gender, 2) Enhance the infrastructure for interdisciplinary health disparity research focused on testing interventions and methods to prevent risk behaviors and improve self-management of health problems among African, Hispanics, rural and low income Americans 3) Expand involvement of the community in research, 4) Disseminate information on health disparities research. Administrative, Research, Training and Engagement Cores are interactive and synergistic and will be used to achieve the aims through efficacy studies. This is a collaborative effort of Nursing, Public Health Education, Exercise and Sports Science, Nutrition, Education, Anthropology, Mathematics, Human Development and Family Studies, the Center for Biotechnology, Genetics and Health Research, the Center for Youth, Family and Community Partnerships, health systems, school systems, free clinics and community and lay organizations. The long-term goal is for this EXPORT Center to assist the community, region and state and nation in meeting the health needs of a diverse citizenry through effective interventions and methods. Public statement: This Center will test ways to help minorities, rural and poor persons prevent and   deal with health problems. The major health problems we are concerned with are heart disease, diabetes and HIV/AIDS. The community will be a partner in these activities.          ",TRIAD Center for Health Disparities,7504028,P20MD002289,[''],NIMHD,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA GREENSBORO,P20,2008,1776279,0.03652926345090911
"Fit Body and Soul: A Lifestyle Intervention for Diabetes Prevention Conducted Thr    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our long-term goal is to reduce obesity & type 2 diabetes (T2D). The immediate goal of our proposed study is to reduce diabetes risk factors by promoting the adoption of healthy lifestyles. In this R-18 proposal, we plan to assess the ""effectiveness"" and ""cost-effectiveness"" of a lifestyle intervention, the Fit Body and Soul for African Americans (AAs) through faith-based activities and settings. The Fit Body and Soul uses ""Body and Soul"" study approaches to deliver the lifestyle component of the highly successful clinically based ""Diabetes Prevention Program"" (DPP) which has been modified with group participation. The Fit body and Soul program will be offered in AA churches in partnership with their pastors and church officials along with guidance from experts from both DPP and Body and Soul programs. We will see if the proposed intervention is effective in reducing excess weight, physical inactivity, and elevated blood sugar (risk factors for T2D). We will focus on AAs, a group with more T2D and more T2D risk factors including more pre-diabetes, obesity and physical inactivity. Fortunately, recent clinical trials have shown that intensive lifestyle modification programs can be ""efficacious"" diabetes prevention interventions for adults at high risk for T2D. Through improving dietary behaviors and increasing physical activity (PA), these programs lead to modest weight loss, lowered blood sugar and reduce future risk of T2D. One such trial, the DPP was efficacious - it led to a 58% reduction in diabetes. However, its effectiveness & sustainability in a community setting needs further investigation. Our proposed study is designed to fill this gap. We will implement the Fit Body and soul intervention in AA church congregations. This strategy is consistent with a growing trend to involve community organizations, especially churches, in health promotion. We propose a cluster randomized community trial of AA church participants who are overweight (BMIe25). This builds on our previous research in the AA community, our recent identification of 20 AA churches eager to participate, and on our pilot study results. Aim 1: To assess the effectiveness of a 3-month Fit Body and Soul intervention for those at high risk for T2D. Aim 2: To determine if the Fit Body and Soul intervention is more cost-effective than control arm. Controls will be given currently acceptable and scientifically sound health education programs, derived from the CDC-Community Guide. Both intervention and control programs will be delivered by expert-led church health advisors and supported by church pastors. The primary outcome is weight loss (at least 7% of baseline body weight). Secondary outcomes are increased PA (at least 150 minutes of moderate intensity exercise/ week) improved dietary choices, and reduction in blood sugar (e3mg/dL). Data collection will be done at baseline and 6 & 12 months post-intervention. If the Fit Body and soul intervention is found effective, it would lead to a future effectiveness study that would determine whether this intervention reduces the incidence of T2D and the associated mortality and morbidity. Project Narrative It has been shown that promoting the adoption of healthy lifestyles, ones that involve best practices of diet and exercise and lots of expert support, can, in a healthcare setting, reduce the incidence of type 2 diabetes in those who are at high risk. In the proposed study, we hope to show that the same or similar programs are effective in the community setting (African American communities in our study), outside of the healthcare arena. If successful, our study would provide a scientific basis for a future effectiveness study in which we would determine whether not just risk factors but diabetes itself (and its associated mortality and morbidity) can be reduced with behavioral lifestyle program (Fit Body and Soul) that has been modified for social cultural faith-based settings.       ",Fit Body and Soul: A Lifestyle Intervention for Diabetes Prevention Conducted Thr,7560284,R18DK082401,"['cost effectiveness ', ' Costs and Benefits ', ' Data Collection ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' diabetes risk ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' type II DM ', ' type 2 DM ', ' maturity onset diabetes ', ' ketosis resistant diabetes ', ' adult onset diabetes ', ' Type II diabetes ', ' Type II Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Type 2 diabetes ', ' Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus ', ' T2DM ', ' T2D ', ' T2 DM ', ' Stable Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Slow-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Noninsulin Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Non-Insulin Dependent Diabetes ', ' NIDDM ', ' Maturity-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' MODY ', ' Ketosis-Resistant Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Adult-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Purpose ', ' Elements ', ' Epidemic ', ' Equilibrium ', ' balance function ', ' balance ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Effectiveness of Interventions ', ' Multi-Institutional Clinical Trial ', ' multi site clinical trial ', ' multi site clinical study ', ' multi center clinical trial ', ' multi center clinical study ', ' Multi-site clinical trial ', ' Multi-site clinical study ', ' Multi-center clinical trial ', ' Multi-center clinical study ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Range ', ' Community Trial ', ' trend ', ' Rate ', ' Modification ', ' Exercise ', ' Physical Exercise ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Behavioral ', ' Fasting ', ' fasts ', ' fasted ', ' Adoption ', ' Diabetes prevention ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Future ', ' Age ', ' base ', ' Goals ', ' improved ', ' Health ', ' Health education ', ' Health Tutoring ', ' Health Instruction ', ' Health Promotion ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' Area ', ' Randomized Controlled Clinical Trials ', ' Incidence ', ' Institutes ', ' Training ', ' Physical activity ', ' Kidney Diseases ', ' renal disorder ', ' kidney disorder ', ' Renal Disease ', ' Nephropathy ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Life Style ', ' Lifestyle ', ' Individual ', ' Numbers ', ' Funding ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Mortality ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' nutrition ', ' Nutritional Science ', ' Obesity ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' programs ', ' sound ', ' statistics ', ' Testing ', ' Training Support ', ' Translating ', ' United States ', ' Adopted ', ' Investigation ', ' Body Weight decreased ', ' wt-loss ', ' body weight loss ', ' Weight Reduction ', ' Weight Loss ', ' Weight ', ' Work ', ' Week ', ' Upper arm ', ' Behavior ', ' Overweight ', ' Over weight ', ' behavior change ', ' Church ', ' Blood Glucose ', ' Blood Sugar ', ' Body Weight ', ' American ', ' behavioral/social science ', ' success ', ' intervention program ', ' Participant ', ' Prevention ', ' social ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', ' Relative (related person) ', ' Relative ', ' Walking ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' chronic disorder ', ' chronic disease/disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Modeling ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' clinical investigation ', ' Communities ', ' diabetes prevention program ', ' opportunity cost ', ' cost ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' diet and exercise ', ' efficacy trial ', ' Outcome ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Prevalence ', ' aged ', ' lifestyle intervention ', ' life style intervention ', ' community organizations ', ' ']",NIDDK,AUGUSTA UNIVERSITY,R18,2008,613352,0.053558016152313336
"Predictors of Hemodialysis Access Dysfunction    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   Hemodialysis vascular access dysfunction accounts for extensive morbidity, and is the greatest contributor to cost among patients with renal failure. Diabetics and African Americans (AA's) are disproportionately affected; however, reasons for this are unclear.   The primary aims of the proposed study are 1) estimate the association between diabetes and AA race and arteriovenous fistula (AVF) survival; 2) explore whether factors associated with vessel location and primary cause of renal disease account for the relationship between diabetes and AA race and AVF survival; 3) determine if vein caliber and arterial resistance account for the association between diabetes and AA race and AVF survival, and 4) determine if inflammation accounts for the association between diabetes and AA race and AVF failure.   Two parallel activities will be conducted to address our scientific aims. First we will use data from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid end-stage renal disease (ESRD) Clinical Performance Measures (CPM) Project, United States Renal Data System (USRDS) and an established cohort from a Veterans' Affairs sponsored study of dialysis patients undergoing AVF placement to identify factors that might account for the association between diabetes and race and AVF survival. Second, we will recruit a cohort of 180 pre-dialysis patients preparing to undergo access placement from the clinics at Emory University, Emory Crawford Long Hospital, Grady Memorial Hospital and the Dialysis Access Center of Atlanta to ascertain if serum markers of inflammation account for the association between diabetes and AA race and access survival.

"Factors Influencing the Racial Disparity in SIDS.    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The incidence of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) in the US has declined 50% since 1992, when the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) first recommended that infants be placed in a non-prone position for sleep. Despite the tremendous success of the subsequent Back to Sleep campaign, African-American (AA) infants remain twice as likely to be placed prone, and twice as likely to die from SIDS. The racial disparity exists across all educational and income categories, and the extent of the racial disparity has increased rather than decreased. The NICHD, in both its 2000 general Strategic Plan (From Cells to Selves) and its 2000 Strategic Plan for SIDS research (Targeting Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS): A Strategic Plan), highlighted the need to understand mechanisms leading to racial, ethnic, and social disparities as a research priority.      Very little is known about the reasons why AA parents use the prone position. Further, no studies have taken advantage of the observed socioeconomic status(SES)-associated variability in SIDS and prone sleeping within the AA community. By examining within-group differences, it is possible to move beyond comparative racial descriptions to identification of potentially modifiable factors. The overall purpose of these investigations, therefore, is to better understand factors contributing to the comparatively high incidence of prone sleep positioning in AA infants. In order to achieve this, will address the following Specific Aims: 1) To compare knowledge, attitudes, and practices regarding infant sleep position in AA parents of higher and lower SES. 2) To identify risk factors for non-use of the recommended supine sleep position in AA families with higher and lower SES. 3) To develop a phenomenological understanding of the decisions made by AA parents of higher and lower SES who do not use recommended supine sleep position, through qualitative methods. 4) To develop, implement, and evaluate an appropriate intervention program based on the knowledge gained through Specific Aims 1-3.      This study addresses important gaps in our understanding of factors informing parental decision regarding infant sleep positioning in AAs. By understanding the social and cultural factors, it should be possible to design more effective interventions, thereby potentially decreasing the rate of SIDS in AA infants.         ",Factors Influencing the Racial Disparity in SIDS.,7463891,K24RR023681,"['Decision Making ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Purpose ', ' low socioeconomic status ', ' low socioeconomic position ', ' low socio-economic status ', ' low socio-economic position ', ' Address ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Qualitative Methods ', ' National Institute of Child Health and Human Development ', ' NICHD ', ' Strategic Planning ', ' Targeted Research ', ' Rate ', ' socioeconomics ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomic ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio economic ', ' Family ', ' base ', ' Happiness ', ' positive attitude ', ' Health Personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Hospitals ', ' Household ', ' Incidence ', ' Income ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Infant ', ' Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice ', ' Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice ', ' Knowledge, Attitudes, Behaviors ', ' Funding ', ' Epidemiologic Studies ', ' epidemiologic investigation ', ' Epidemiology Research ', ' Epidemiological Studies ', ' Epidemiologic Research ', ' Parents ', ' Pediatrics ', ' Prone Position ', ' grandparent ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Sleep ', ' Research Priority ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Sudden infant death syndrome ', ' Sudden Unexpected Infant Death ', ' Sudden Infant Death ', ' SIDS ', ' Crib Death ', ' Cot Death ', ' Testing ', ' Investigation ', ' Work ', ' Techniques ', ' Birth ', ' Parturition ', ' American ', ' success ', ' intervention program ', ' Categories ', ' social ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' Cells ', ' Measures ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Academy ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Communities ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Back to Sleep ', ' infant sleep position ', ' infantile sleep position ', ' social disparities ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' racial/ethnic ', ' comparative ', ' ']",NCRR,CHILDREN'S RESEARCH INSTITUTE,K24,2008,161633,0.08022772078108067
"Ethnic Differences in Media Response and Recruitment ETHNIC DIFFERENCES IN MEDIA RESPONSE & RECRUITMENT Ethnic diversity in recruitment is a vital prerequisite to eliminating the health disparity in cancer control trials and health promotion programs. Although recruitment campaigns are sometimes guided by learning models, little attention is paid to a critical requirement: how to reach key target audiences with persuasive messages and hold their attention long enough for the messages to be processed. Little scientific rigor has been applied to the study of methods to increase information seeking and to improve the recruitment of minorities into cancer control or treatment trials. Even the most innovative research is stymied by the lack of representative samples of the population the research is designed to serve. The goals of this study are: 1) to develop and prospectively test, theory-driven, ethnically appropriate health-related messages to promote information seeking and recruitment; 2) to test methods for marketing/communication of the messages and; 3) to assess differences in response (in terms of information seeking and recruitment), between African American (AA) and Caucasian males into a prostate cancer control program. To accomplish these goals, direct response radio (DRR) and direct response newspaper (DRN), guided by a framework that includes Social Marketing, will be tested as methods to improve information seeking and recruitment. Our preliminary data has shown a differential response by ethnicity (AA and Caucasian) to DRR and DRN information seeking and recruitment. It is our hypotheses that, guided by our integrated Marketing and Cognitive-Affective conceptual framework, and our pilot work: 1) AA men will be more responsive to a DRR campaign than Caucasian men, 2) Caucasian men will be more responsive to a DRN campaign than AA men, 3) DRR will be more cost-effective for the recruitment of AA men than for Caucasian men, and 4) specific cognitive-affective factors will be associated with response. The significance of this work would be the advancement of knowledge of risk communications research via the study of a theory-driven process that may improve information seeking and recruitment of AA men to cancer control protocols. It would also serve as a potential model for improved information seeking and recruitment of AA men to be tested in other cancer control and treatment trials and potentially as a model for other minorities.

"Localized Aggressive Periodontitis: Microbial & Host Markers for Susceptibility    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Localized Aggressive Periodontitis (LAP) affects approximately 70,000 U.S. children, largely from underserved groups. If untreated, LAP can lead to loss of first molars and central incisors. The proposal expands on preliminary data and surveys microbial and host factors indicative of LAP risk. This study will screen 3,000 periodontally healthy children from Newark for the presence of Actinobacillus actiinomycetemcomitans (Aa). 205 test (Aa+) and 410 control (Aa-) will be recalled at 6-month intervals for 4-5 yrs to identify factors predictive of disease onset. Screening and recall exams include a periodontal examination, collection of saliva and buccal cells as well as crevicular fluid and subgingival plaque from pocketed sites and the mesial of all 1st molars. Samples will be stored for future analysis. Horizontal bite- wing radiographs are used to establish the LAP diagnosis. When bone loss is detected, stored site-specific samples will be analyzed. The revised proposal includes 2 aims: 1. to determine whether Aa, clones of Aa, or 200 members of the flora associated with Aa could be predictive of the onset of LAP; 2. to examine host factors that can affect Aa colonization, persistence, subgingival migration and subsequent activation of innate and acquired immune factors associated with disease onset. These factors include: iron-saturation of lactoferrin, IgA antibody titers to Aa adhesins, a Growth Modifying Factor (GMF) that killls Gram+ pioneer plaque microbes that compete with Aa, IgG antibody levels to leukotoxin and levels of 21 cytokines that can affect disease initiation. Comparison of data from Aa+ (test) and Aa- (control) groups should provide information with which to determine the combination of microbial and host markers predictive of risk for LAP onset. To date in those recalled for 1yr or more, 7 of 36 Aa+ students have developed LAP, while none of the Aa- conrols have LAP (p <.01). Pilot data from saliva obtained from students recalled indicates the following; 1. GMF from Aa+ students can kill pioneer plaque microbes in vitro (p < .01), 2. lower IgA levels are found in students repeatedly colonized by Aa, and 3. a specific cytokine, MIP 1a, is significantly elevated in Aa+/LAP subjects prior to bone loss (p <.01). The knowledge gained from this prospective study should identify markers required to develop a salivary-based diagnostic test that can be used to design preventive strategies to reduce oral health disparities in this predominantly African American and Hispanic population.           ",Localized Aggressive Periodontitis: Microbial & Host Markers for Susceptibility,7468418,R01DE017968,"['health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Actinobacillus ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Small Inducible Cytokine A3 ', ' Stem Cell Inhibitor ', ' MIP-1a ', ' MIP-1 Alpha ', ' MIP 1alpha ', ' Chemokine (C-C motif) Ligand 3 ', ' microbial host ', ' Environment ', ' Microarray Analysis ', ' microarray technology ', ' Microarray-Based Analysis ', ' Epithelial Cells ', ' All Sites ', ' Data ', ' Collection ', ' sex ', ' Exhibits ', ' Killings ', ' Future ', ' Affect ', ' Gingival Crevicular Fluid ', ' Gingival Exudate ', ' Age ', ' base ', ' Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Growth Factor ', ' Proteins Growth Factors ', ' Growth Substances ', ' Growth Agents ', ' GFAC ', ' sample collection ', ' specimen collection ', ' Site ', ' Surface ', ' Immunoglobulin A ', ' IgA ', ' Immunoglobulin G ', ' IgG ', ' 7S Gamma Globulin ', ' In Vitro ', ' Incidence ', ' Incisor ', ' incisor (dental) ', ' Evaluation ', ' Predisposition ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Screening procedure ', ' screenings ', ' screening ', ' Oral cavity ', ' Mouth ', ' Cavitas Oris ', ' Buccal Cavity Head and Neck ', ' Buccal Cavity ', ' Lactoferrin ', ' Lactotransferrin ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Numbers ', ' Bacterial Adhesins ', ' adhesin ', ' Methods ', ' Movement ', ' body movement ', ' Onset of illness ', ' disorder onset ', ' disease onset ', ' Integration Host Factors ', ' Host Factor Protein ', ' Host Factor ', ' Oral health ', ' dental health ', ' Organism ', ' living system ', ' Iron ', ' Fe element ', ' Liquid substance ', ' liquid ', ' fluid ', ' Periodontitis ', ' Chronic Periodontitis ', ' Antibodies ', ' Bacterial Antigens ', ' Inflammatory ', ' Prospective Studies ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Risk ', ' Saliva ', ' Knowledge ', ' Students ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Localized ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Tooth structure ', ' teeth ', ' Tooth ', ' Wing ', ' Immune ', ' Contralateral ', ' Oral ', ' Salivary ', ' Salivary immunoglobulin A ', ' salivary IgA ', ' microorganism ', ' tooth surface ', ' Bacteria ', ' Bite ', ' Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction ', ' reverse transcriptase PCR ', ' RTPCR ', ' RT-PCR ', ' microbial ', ' bone loss ', ' leukotoxin ', ' Prevention strategy ', ' Preventive strategy ', ' member ', ' Predictive Factor ', ' Cells ', ' cytokine ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans ', ' Bacterium comitans ', ' Bacterium actinomycetem comitans ', ' A. actinomycetemcomitans ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Diagnostic tests ', ' Hispanics ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Prevalence ', ' migration ', ' Microbe ', ' human disease ', ' Control Groups ', ' ']",NIDCR,UNIV OF MED/DENT OF NJ-NJ DENTAL SCHOOL,R01,2008,665390,0.15203844389894752
"Family Violence in Older African American Women    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   Dr. Paranjape's goal for this proposal is to acquire the tools necessary to become a leader in the field of FV and to improve the healthcare of older women. Building upon an excellent training in primary care and basic epidemiological skills, Dr. Paranjape proposes a career development plan that (1) integrates mentoring by an inter-disciplinary sponsor team with didactic coursework and tutorials designed to expand her theoretical and methodological horizons and (2) includes a series of focused research projects to amplify and reinforce existing and acquired methodological skills. Family Violence (FV) is a major public health problem; injury and violence are among the top ten high public health priority areas identified in the Healthy People 2010 report.  Although the health effects of FV in women have been well documented, the prevalence and health effects of FV, risk factors and screening methods for FV in older African American (AA) women, are still poorly understood. Thus, to begin to address this gap in our knowledge base, the specific aims of the research proposal are to: 1) develop and validate a scale that measures FV in older AA women 2) to identify the correlates of FV in this population, including individual factors, coping efforts and adjustment outcomes and 3) to develop a simple screening tool for FV in this population. This study will provide preliminary data for further research on the health effects of FV in older minority women. Dr. Kaslow, who is an extremely well-established and well funded investigator in the area of FV in AA women, will mentor Dr. Paranjape for the duration of this award, guiding her through the research and career development plan. An advisory council made up of Drs Ouslander, Kutner, Jacobson, Thompson, Rodriguez, Corbie-Smith, and Flacker, with complementary areas of expertise in aging, statistics, research in primary care, research in minority communities, and elder abuse research will also provide instruction in areas critical to Dr. Paranjape's career development plan. The research and training activities proposed herein will allow Dr. Paranjape to submit an R01 grant towards the end of the award period, providing a timely catalyst for her as she progresses towards attaining her career goal of being a leader in FV research.           ",Family Violence in Older African American Women,7456418,K23RR023364,"['Testing ', ' Time ', ' Training Activity ', ' assault ', ' Treatment Protocols ', ' Treatment Schedule ', ' Treatment Regimen ', ' Violence ', ' violent behavior ', ' violent ', ' Caucasians ', ' Woman ', ' Week ', ' Severities ', ' Dependence ', ' Clinic ', ' Award ', ' Pattern ', ' Score ', ' psychosocial ', ' Visit ', ' Patient currently pregnant ', ' gravid Pregnancy ', ' Pregnancy not delivered ', ' Gravid ', ' inner city ', ' Birth ', ' Parturition ', ' Accident and Emergency department ', ' Emergency room ', ' Emergency Department ', ' bone ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' functional status ', ' cohort ', ' knowledge base ', ' knowledgebase ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' Buffers ', ' skills ', ' case finding ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Self-Report ', ' help-seeking behavior ', ' help seeking ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' Reporting ', ' emotional abuse ', ' mental abuse ', ' Psychological abuse ', ' Substance abuse problem ', ' substance abuse ', ' abuse of substances ', ' Caucasoid Race ', ' white race ', ' Occidental ', ' Caucasoid ', ' Caucasian Race ', ' Caucasian ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', "" Women's Health "", ' Female Health ', ' Emotional ', ' Caregivers ', ' Care Givers ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Coping Skills ', ' depressive symptoms ', ' depressive ', ' depression symptom ', ' Emotional Depression ', ' Family member ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' chronic disorder ', ' chronic disease/disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Modeling ', ' perpetrators ', ' Property ', ' LOINC Axis 2 Property ', ' Unmarried ', ' Accounting ', ' Communities ', ' Instruction ', ' geriatric depression ', ' late life depression ', ' Elderly depression ', ' intimate partner violence ', ' neglect ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Minority ', ' Violent injury ', ' Violence injury ', ' Outcome ', ' relationship abuse ', ' abusive relationship ', ' coping ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' older women ', ' service utilization ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Healthy People 2010 ', ' Provider ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' low socioeconomic status ', ' low socioeconomic position ', ' low socio-economic status ', ' low socio-economic position ', ' Elder Abuse ', ' senior abuse ', ' elderly abuse ', ' abuse of older adults ', ' Elements ', ' Address ', ' Caring ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Independent Scientist Award ', ' K02 Award ', ' Research Training ', ' Stress and Coping ', ' Child Abuse and Neglect ', ' child maltreatment ', ' Childhood maltreatment ', ' Rate ', ' Principal Investigator ', ' follow-up ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' Face ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Family ', ' Female ', ' physical abuse ', ' physical maltreatment ', ' Spouses ', ' Married Persons ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Affect ', ' Injury ', ' catalyst ', ' Age ', ' career ', ' Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' improved ', ' Health ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Health care facility ', ' Healthcare Facility ', ' Health Facilities ', ' Health Priorities ', ' Health Services ', ' health care service ', ' Health Status ', ' Level of Health ', ' Hospitals ', ' Area ', ' Acute ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Medical ', ' Series ', ' Family Violence ', ' Survivors ', ' indexing ', ' Screening procedure ', ' screenings ', ' screening ', ' Training ', ' Life Expectancy ', ' Individual ', ' Numbers ', ' health care service utilization ', ' healthcare utilization ', ' healthcare service utilization ', ' health services utilization ', ' Health Care Utilization ', ' Family history of ', ' Family Medical History Epidemiology ', ' Family Medical History ', ' Living Arrangement ', ' Development Plans ', ' Inequality ', ' Battered Women ', ' abuse of women ', ' abuse of females ', ' Abused women ', ' Abused females ', ' Funding ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Minor ', ' Morbidity -

"Race and Health Outcomes Associated with Obesity Two overarching goals of Healthy People 2010 are to increase years and quality of healthy life and to eliminate health disparities. Because obesity disproportionately affects African and Hispanic Americans, understanding the influence of race on obesity's impact on different health outcomes is especially vital to achieving these goals. Interestingly, although African Americans (AAs) continue to have substantially lower life-expectancy than whites, observational studies suggest that obesity may have a lower impact on mortality in AAs than in whites even though healthcare expenditures in obese AAs are lower than in obese white Americans.  Racial differences in obesity-related mortality and cost may be a reflection of differences on several fronts: higher rates of competing health risks such as smoking, HIV, and trauma in AAs; a reduced association between obesity and cardiovascular risk factors in AAs; and delays in diagnosis and treatment of risk factors in normal-weight AAs. Using data from 3 national databases -the Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey (MCBS), National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), and Medical Expenditures Panel Survey (MEPS)- this study will examine the interplay of race and body mass index (BMI) as they relate to 4 important outcomes: 1) mortality; 2) cardiovascular risk factors; 3) delays in diagnosis and treatment of cardiovascular risk factors; and 4) healthcare expenditures. Previous studies examining obesity-related mortality have not been able to adequately address the issue of competinghealth risks and residual confounding from smoking and preclinical illness, which can obscure an association between obesity and higher mortality. Because MCBS data are linked to Medicare claims longitudinally, this study will be able to limit uncontrolled confounding from smoking and pre-clinical disease and competing health risks. Furthermore, the studies proposed in this application will address several important questions: Is the association between obesity and novel cardiovascular risk factors reduced compared to whites? Are leaner minority adults, who may be at higher risk for some cardiovascular risk factors than predicted by their body mass index, more susceptible to having delays in diagnosis and treatment of these risk factors? What are the different types of care and medical conditions that drive racial differences in obesity-related healthcare expenditures? In clarifying these relationships, our findings could shed light on mechanisms underlying racial differences in obesity-related risk and cost. Our findings could also guide the setting of public health priorities and the targeting of specific initiatives to reduce racial disparities in healthcare and mortality.

"Ethnic/Racial Minorities in the Colon CFR DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a common malignancy in Western countries. However, its frequency varies four-fold among US ethnic/racial minorities, with Japanese Americans (JAs) and African Americans (AAs) having a marked excess risk for the disease. Moreover, in contrast to JA patients who experience a better survival than whites, AAs with CRC present at a later stage and have a shorter, stage-adjusted survival than whites. The poor outcome of AA patients is not completely explained by their reduced access to medical care. These ethnic/racial disparities constitute an important public health challenge and also offer unique opportunities for etiologic research. This collaborative application will build upon the existing colorectal cancer Cooperative Family Registry (CFR) resource by recruiting additional families of AA (N=979) and Japanese (N=448) descent in Northern California, Southern California, North Carolina and Hawaii, using the CFR core protocol. We will then use the data and samples collected from a total of 1,514 AA, 745 JA and 750 white population-based families in the CFR to test the following hypotheses: 1) DNA mismatch repair deficiency is a more common pathogenic pathway to CRC in AAs, compared to whites, as reflected by a greater prevalence of tumor microsatellite instability (MSI); 2) Functional gene variants  and environmental exposures related to chemical carcinogenesis and methyl group metabolism are associated with an increased risk of MSI-high CRC, particularly in AAs and JAs; 3) Functional variants in cell proliferation- and angiogenesis-related genes are associated with risk of advanced-stage CRC and poor overall survival, particularly in AAs; 4) Functional variants in genes related to response to 5-fluorouracil/oxaliplatin chemotherapy are associated with shorter disease-free and overall survival, especially in AA s; 5) Other gene variants that are rare in whites but relatively common in AAs and JAs are associated with CRC and may significantly contribute to the etiology of the disease in these groups. The power to test these hypotheses will not be adequate without the proposed expanded recruitment. The insight into biological pathways gained by this project may lead to new means of prevention and treatment that may help not only to alleviate health disparities in the US but also better control CRC among all ethnic/racial groups.

"Localized Aggressive Periodontitis: Microbial & Host Markers for Susceptibility    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Localized Aggressive Periodontitis (LAP) affects approximately 70,000 U.S. children, largely from underserved groups. If untreated, LAP can lead to loss of first molars and central incisors. The proposal expands on preliminary data and surveys microbial and host factors indicative of LAP risk. This study will screen 3,000 periodontally healthy children from Newark for the presence of Actinobacillus actiinomycetemcomitans (Aa). 205 test (Aa+) and 410 control (Aa-) will be recalled at 6-month intervals for 4-5 yrs to identify factors predictive of disease onset. Screening and recall exams include a periodontal examination, collection of saliva and buccal cells as well as crevicular fluid and subgingival plaque from pocketed sites and the mesial of all 1st molars. Samples will be stored for future analysis. Horizontal bite- wing radiographs are used to establish the LAP diagnosis. When bone loss is detected, stored site-specific samples will be analyzed. The revised proposal includes 2 aims: 1. to determine whether Aa, clones of Aa, or 200 members of the flora associated with Aa could be predictive of the onset of LAP; 2. to examine host factors that can affect Aa colonization, persistence, subgingival migration and subsequent activation of innate and acquired immune factors associated with disease onset. These factors include: iron-saturation of lactoferrin, IgA antibody titers to Aa adhesins, a Growth Modifying Factor (GMF) that killls Gram+ pioneer plaque microbes that compete with Aa, IgG antibody levels to leukotoxin and levels of 21 cytokines that can affect disease initiation. Comparison of data from Aa+ (test) and Aa- (control) groups should provide information with which to determine the combination of microbial and host markers predictive of risk for LAP onset. To date in those recalled for 1yr or more, 7 of 36 Aa+ students have developed LAP, while none of the Aa- conrols have LAP (p <.01). Pilot data from saliva obtained from students recalled indicates the following; 1.

"Prenatal Care for African American Women: Effect of Client-Provider Interaction    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Evidence suggests that poor communication with providers and problematic client-provider relationships among racial and ethnic minorities are associated with disparities in health care. The long -term objectives are to improve the quality of prenatal care, specifically for African American (AA) women through improving client-provider communication and ultimately to reduce racial/ethnic disparities in pregnancy outcomes. The purpose of this exploratory, descriptive, cross-sectional study is to describe client-provider interaction and its influence on African American (AA) women's satisfaction with prenatal care. In this study, we will recruit 18- 35 year old AA women (N=130) who are in their first trimester and their female providers, OB/GYN or advanced practice nurse providers, (N=10-12) from prenatal care clinics at two tertiary care, urban hospitals in Southeastern Michigan. Client-provider interaction will be described using two different methods, audio recordings and post-visit questionnaires. The modified version of Interaction Model of Client Health Behavior (IMCHB) will be used as the framework for this study. We will address three Specific Aims: 1). Describe client-provider interaction (affective support, health information, decisional control, and discrimination) among AA women and providers during the initial prenatal care visit; 2). Examine whether client-provider interaction predicts AA women's satisfaction with prenatal care 3). Compare differences and similarities in client-provider interaction when providers are racially concordant and discordant with AA women. This study is foundational to the development of interventions that will improve client-provider communication, enhance both satisfaction with and quality of prenatal care, and ultimately reduce healthcare disparities for African American pregnant women. The impact of quality client-provider communication in improving quality of care and the health status of individuals is recognized in Healthy People 2010. Specific recommendations include improving provider- client relationships through effective communication skills training and increasing the proportion of clients who are satisfied with their providers' communication skills. In addition, this research addresses NINR scientific goals of reducing health disparities and improving quality of care, and is congruent with the mission of AHRQ which includes improving the outcomes and quality of health care.           ",Prenatal Care for African American Women: Effect of Client-Provider Interaction,7630495,F31NR010320,"['Cross-Sectional Studies ', ' Disease Frequency Surveys ', ' Cross-Sectional Survey ', ' Cross-Sectional Analyses ', ' Cross Sectional Analysis ', ' Healthy People 2010 ', ' Provider ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Discrimination (Psychology) ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Low income ', ' Roter ', ' Address ', ' Advanced Practice Nurse ', ' APN ', ' Process ', ' Female ', ' base ', ' Goals ', ' improved ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' Health Status ', ' Level of Health ', ' Pelvic Examination ', ' Pelvic Exam ', ' Urban Hospitals ', ' Metropolitan Hospitals ', ' City Hospitals ', ' Hypertension ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' high blood pressure ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Ensure ', ' Screening procedure ', ' screenings ', ' screening ', ' Individual ', ' Gynecologist ', ' satisfaction ', ' Methods ', ' Michigan ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' Mission ', ' Amniocentesis ', ' Pregnancy Outcome ', ' First Pregnancy Trimester ', ' First Trimester ', ' Early Placental Phase ', ' Pregnant Women ', ' Prenatal care ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' health care quality ', ' healthcare quality ', ' Questionnaires ', ' Recommendation ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' recruit ', ' Research ', ' Research Design ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Risk ', ' programs ', ' Testing ', ' Tocolysis ', ' Tocolytic Treatment ', ' Tocolytic Therapy ', ' Ultrasonography ', ' ultrasound scanning ', ' ultrasound imaging ', ' ultrasound ', ' sound measurement ', ' sonography ', ' sonogram ', ' diagnostic ultrasound ', ' Ultrasound Test ', ' Ultrasound Medical Imaging ', ' Ultrasound Diagnosis ', ' Ultrasonogram ', ' Ultrasonic Imaging ', ' Medical Ultrasound ', ' Echotomography ', ' Echography ', ' Urine ', ' Urine Urinary System ', ' Woman ', ' Clinic ', ' Visit ', ' skills training ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' skills ', ' Prevention ', ' United States Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality ', ' United States Agency for Health Care Policy and Research ', ' Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality ', ' Agency for Health Care Policy and Research ', ' AHRQ ', ' AHCPR ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Modeling ', ' Quality of Care ', ' QOC ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Client ', ' Communication ', ' Outcome ', ' tertiary care ', ' Affective ', ' therapy development ', ' treatment development ', ' intervention development ', ' develop therapy ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' ']",NINR,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,F31,2009,28410,0.11361278581159984
"Peer-support motivational interviewing PA intervention for African American women    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The health benefits of PA are widely accepted, aiding in reducing the risk of cardiovascular disease, diabetes, stroke, obesity, and some cancers. Recommendations are to engage in 30 minutes a day on most days of the week, however, < of adults are inactive with higher rates of inactivity among racial and ethnic minority women. The Guide to Community Preventive Service found social support interventions to be effective in increasing PA. Therefore, the proposed study seeks to examine the feasibility and efficacy of a novel ""Culturally-Appropriate Peer-based Motivational Interviewing"" (CAPMI) intervention that targets behavioral skills, communication and social support for increasing PA in sedentary African American (AA) women. The overarching theoretical rationale for CAPMI centers on the role of social influence in the behavior change process. Family, friends and supportive others exert influence on one's motives, preferences, behaviors, and outcomes. As such, there is a clear need to target natural networks in behavior change studies. Motivational Interviewing (MI) is an approach that may help individuals enhance the quality of support given and received from their supportive others. MI focuses on helping individuals increase motivation by reducing barriers to change and resolving ambivalence for a given behavior by using empathy, encouragement, and non- confrontational methods. This method has been used extensively in addiction studies, but is showing promise for improving other health behaviors such as diet and PA, and among minority populations. The primary goal of the proposed intervention is to examine the efficacy of using motivational interviewing techniques to foster better reciprocal social support. Specific aims are: (1) to conduct formative research using semi-structured in- depth interviews and focus groups with sedentary AA women to investigate the role and importance of social support for PA; (2) to determine the feasibility of recruiting and implementing CAPMI in sedentary AA women; and (3) to pilot test and evaluate the efficacy of the CAPMI in increasing PA, social support, self-efficacy and reducing barriers to PA at post-intervention compared to an attention control group. Women (N=80; 40 dyads) recruited in natural non-intimate dyads (i.e., family members or friends) will be randomly assigned to either the CAPMI: (1) peer-based MI and behavioral skills (e.g., goal setting and problem solving) training; (2) self-help materials (e.g., workbook, training DVD and PA newsletters); (3) pedometer; or Attention Control (AC): (1) self- help materials (PA newsletter only); (2) pedometer. Prior to the start of the intervention, focus groups and paired semi-structured in-depth interviews will be conducted with AA women to examine sources of social support for PA. Intervention and control participants will be compared on minutes of self-report moderate- intensity PA, social support, and PA barriers at four time-points: baseline and Weeks 4, 8, and 12 post-baseline. We also propose a brief plan of process evaluation using the RE-AIM framework to determine reach, efficacy, and implementation of the intervention. Public Health Relevance: Non-intimate natural networks, i.e., family members/friends, can play a major role in increasing physical activity (PA) in African American women. The proposed culturally- appropriate peer-delivered MI intervention (CAPMI) is designed to address this issue by enhancing the type of motivation and support that peers provide for PA. The goal of this study is to ultimately reduce racial/ethnic disparities in cancer by developing prevention interventions that address AA women's' social resources, and to enhance our knowledge of how to move women from being sedentary to meeting PA recommendations for cancer prevention.          ",Peer-support motivational interviewing PA intervention for African American women,7673817,R21CA134961,"['Professional counselor ', ' Counselor ', ' cardiovascular disorder risk ', ' cardiovascular disease risk ', ' Provider ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Diet ', ' Empathy ', ' Address ', ' Preventive ', ' Data ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Cognitive ', ' Validation ', ' Process ', ' Behavioral ', ' Family ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Affect ', ' base ', ' Goals ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Health behavior ', ' sedentary ', ' indexing ', ' Interview ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Physical activity ', ' post intervention ', ' Individual ', ' Fostering ', ' Maintenance ', ' Methods ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' Motivation ', ' Newsletter ', ' Educational Intervention ', ' instructional intervention ', ' Training Intervention ', ' Instruction Intervention ', ' Education for Intervention ', ' cancer prevention ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Obesity ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Play ', ' Asses ', ' Equus asinus ', ' Donkey ', ' Problem Solving ', ' Recommendation ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' recruit ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Social support ', ' social support network ', ' Knowledge ', ' stroke ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' brain attack ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Apoplexy ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Attention ', ' Woman ', ' Source ', ' Techniques ', ' Behavior ', ' behavior change ', ' meetings ', ' Services ', ' preference ', ' Church ', ' American ', ' self help ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' Structure ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' peer ', ' member ', ' Agreement ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Self-Report ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' motivational enhancement therapy ', ' motivational interview ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' Reporting ', ' Touch sensation ', ' Touch ', ' social ', ' Friends ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Family member ', ' Health Benefit ', ' Sampling ', ' effective intervention ', ' intervention effect ', ' Control Groups ', ' theories ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Cognition ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' racial/ethnic ', ' addiction ', ' addictive disorder ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' public health relevance ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF TX MD ANDERSON CAN CTR,R21,2009,185567,0.0505942828914594
"Race and Preference for Knee Replacement:  A Patient-Centered Intervention    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Abstract Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most prevalent form of arthritis and is among the most prevalent chronic conditions in the US. The prevalence of knee OA increases with age. With the aging of the US population, the burden of OA is expected to increase. The prevalence of knee OA among older African-Americans (AAs) is higher than that reported for whites. Yet numerous studies have documented the existence of marked racial/ethnic disparities in the utilization of knee replacement, an effective and highly utilized treatment option for advanced knee OA. Our research team conducted one of the first studies to examine the reasons why AA and white patients differ in utilization of joint replacement. We have published evidence demonstrating that, compared to similar white patients, AA potential candidates for joint replacement differ in their preferences for joint replacement, and that these differences are in part shaped by differences in knowledge about the risks/benefits of the treatment and consequently in expectations on surgical outcome. There are national calls to act on this information by testing interventions to reduce this disparity. The proposed trial is one of the first in the nation to directly assess the effect of a patient-centered intervention on AA patient's preferences for and access to knee replacement. The immediate goal of this randomized controlled trial is to assess the impact of a high quality, evidence-based, patient-centered educational intervention supplemented with targeted counseling (motivational interviewing) on AA patient preferences, expectations, and likelihood of achieving a referral for orthopedic evaluation. AA primary care patients who are potential candidates for joint replacement based on clinical severity of their disease who have no clear contra-indications for surgical intervention will be randomized to either intervention or attention control. We will assess the effect of the intervention on patient preference, expectations, and likelihood of receiving a referral for orthopedic evaluation within 12 months of the intervention. The long-term goal of this research is to implement effective interventions targeting AAs who are clinical candidates for joint replacement in a national effort to improve access to reduce and ultimately eliminate disparities in the utilization of this effective treatment option. Therefore, the specific aims are: (1) to examine the effect of the knee osteoarthritis decision aid supplemented by counseling on AA patient preferences and expectations regarding surgical outcome for knee joint replacement; (2) to examine the effect of the intervention on orthopedic surgery referral rates for AA patients; and (3) To examine the mechanism of action of the intervention (combined decision aid and counseling using motivational interviewing). A secondary aim of the proposed research is to examine the effect of the intervention on AA patients' rate of knee replacement.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Numerous studies have documented the existence of marked racial/ethnic disparities in the utilization of knee replacement, an effective and highly utilized treatment option for advanced knee osteoarthritis. This study will provide one of the first interventions in the nation designed to mitigate racial/ethnic disparity in access to joint replacement for patients who meet clinical indications for the treatment. The results of this study will not only inform the nation on strategies to reduce or eliminate one of most marked disparities in chronic disease management, but will also provide opportunities to improve quality of care for large segment of our society.          ",Race and Preference for Knee Replacement:  A Patient-Centered Intervention,8062841,R01AR054474,"['Counseling ', ' Decision Making ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Improve Access ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Randomized ', ' Orthopedic Surgery ', ' Orthopedic Surgery procedures ', ' Foundations ', ' Age ', ' base ', ' Goals ', ' Aging ', ' improved ', ' joint replacement ', ' Joint Prosthesis Implantation ', ' Replacement Arthroplasty ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Medical ', ' Evaluation ', ' Knee joint ', ' disability ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Membrum inferius ', ' Lower Limb ', ' Lower Extremity ', ' musculoskeletal disorder ', ' Musculoskeletal Diseases ', ' instructional intervention ', ' Training Intervention ', ' Instruction Intervention ', ' Education for Intervention ', ' Educational Intervention ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' Orthopedic Surgical Profession ', ' Orthopedic ', ' Orthopedics ', ' hypertrophic arthritis ', ' degenerative joint disease ', ' Osteoarthrosis ', ' Osteoarthritis ', ' Degenerative Arthritis ', ' Degenerative polyarthritis ', ' Patients ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Primary Care ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Staging ', ' Shapes ', ' Publishing ', ' QOL ', ' Quality of life ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Research ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Research Design ', ' Patient Preferences ', ' Knowledge ', ' joint inflammation ', ' arthritic ', ' Arthritis ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Knee Osteoarthritis ', ' Attention ', ' Severities ', ' Techniques ', ' surgery ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' meetings ', ' preference ', ' empowered ', ' American ', ' expectation ', ' empowerment ', ' motivational interview ', ' motivational enhancement therapy ', ' Benefits and Risks ', ' Reporting ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' Decision Aid ', ' Total Knee Replacement ', ' Total Arthroplasty of the Knee ', ' TKR - Total knee replacement ', ' Prosthetic total arthroplasty of the knee ', ' Knee replacement ', ' Knee joint replacement operation ', ' Knee arthroplasty ', ' Arthroplasty, Replacement, Knee ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' administrative data base ', ' administrative database ', ' patient centered ', ' patient oriented ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' effective intervention ', ' evidence base ', ' effective treatment ', ' effective therapy ', ' intervention effect ', ' Control Groups ', ' ']",NIAMS,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2009,276760,0.1441398467113052
"TRIAD Center for Health Disparities    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Teamwork in Research and Intervention to Alleviate Disparities (TRIAD) EXPORT Center goal is to implement intervention research to address major health disparities of African-Americans, Hispanics, rural and low-income children and adults in central North Carolina, and, in particular, test interventions that can be tailored to geographic populations to address health disparities across the nation. African-Americans (AAs) constitute more than 30% of the population and the Hispanic population has increased >400% over the past decade. AA and Hispanic disparities exceed national [HP 2010] and state [Healthy Carolinians 2010] targets for HIV/AIDS, cardiovascular disease (CVD), and diabetes and related risk factors. Through this P20 center we propose to conduct research that will provide better understanding of how these disparities can be alleviated, and thus direction for ultimately eliminating the selected disparities in AAs, Hispanics, rural and low-income populations. AIMS are to 1) Increase the number and capacity of health disparity researchers that are from ethnic or racial minorities and female gender, 2) Enhance the infrastructure for interdisciplinary health disparity research focused on testing interventions and methods to prevent risk behaviors and improve self-management of health problems among African, Hispanics, rural and low income Americans 3) Expand involvement of the community in research, 4) Disseminate information on health disparities research.

"Fit Body and Soul: A Lifestyle Intervention for Diabetes Prevention Conducted Thr    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our long-term goal is to reduce obesity & type 2 diabetes (T2D). The immediate goal of our proposed study is to reduce diabetes risk factors by promoting the adoption of healthy lifestyles. In this R-18 proposal, we plan to assess the ""effectiveness"" and ""cost-effectiveness"" of a lifestyle intervention, the Fit Body and Soul for African Americans (AAs) through faith-based activities and settings. The Fit Body and Soul uses ""Body and Soul"" study approaches to deliver the lifestyle component of the highly successful clinically based ""Diabetes Prevention Program"" (DPP) which has been modified with group participation. The Fit body and Soul program will be offered in AA churches in partnership with their pastors and church officials along with guidance from experts from both DPP and Body and Soul programs. We will see if the proposed intervention is effective in reducing excess weight, physical inactivity, and elevated blood sugar (risk factors for T2D). We will focus on AAs, a group with more T2D and more T2D risk factors including more pre-diabetes, obesity and physical inactivity. Fortunately, recent clinical trials have shown that intensive lifestyle modification programs can be ""efficacious"" diabetes prevention interventions for adults at high risk for T2D. Through improving dietary behaviors and increasing physical activity (PA), these programs lead to modest weight loss, lowered blood sugar and reduce future risk of T2D. One such trial, the DPP was efficacious - it led to a 58% reduction in diabetes. However, its effectiveness & sustainability in a community setting needs further investigation. Our proposed study is designed to fill this gap. We will implement the Fit Body and soul intervention in AA church congregations. This strategy is consistent with a growing trend to involve community organizations, especially churches, in health promotion. We propose a cluster randomized community trial of AA church participants who are overweight (BMIe25). This builds on our previous research in the AA community, our recent identification of 20 AA churches eager to participate, and on our pilot study results. Aim 1: To assess the effectiveness of a 3-month Fit Body and Soul intervention for those at high risk for T2D. Aim 2: To determine if the Fit Body and Soul intervention is more cost-effective than control arm. Controls will be given currently acceptable and scientifically sound health education programs, derived from the CDC-Community Guide. Both intervention and control programs will be delivered by expert-led church health advisors and supported by church pastors. The primary outcome is weight loss (at least 7% of baseline body weight). Secondary outcomes are increased PA (at least 150 minutes of moderate intensity exercise/ week) improved dietary choices, and reduction in blood sugar (e3mg/dL). Data collection will be done at baseline and 6 & 12 months post-intervention. If the Fit Body and soul intervention is found effective, it would lead to a future effectiveness study that would determine whether this intervention reduces the incidence of T2D and the associated mortality and morbidity. Project Narrative It has been shown that promoting the adoption of healthy lifestyles, ones that involve best practices of diet and exercise and lots of expert support, can, in a healthcare setting, reduce the incidence of type 2 diabetes in those who are at high risk. In the proposed study, we hope to show that the same or similar programs are effective in the community setting (African American communities in our study), outside of the healthcare arena. If successful, our study would provide a scientific basis for a future effectiveness study in which we would determine whether not just risk factors but diabetes itself (and its associated mortality and morbidity) can be reduced with behavioral lifestyle program (Fit Body and Soul) that has been modified for social cultural faith-based settings.       ",Fit Body and Soul: A Lifestyle Intervention for Diabetes Prevention Conducted Thr,7691407,R18DK082401,"['cost effectiveness ', ' Costs and Benefits ', ' Data Collection ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' diabetes risk ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' type II DM ', ' type 2 DM ', ' maturity onset diabetes ', ' ketosis resistant diabetes ', ' adult onset diabetes ', ' Type II diabetes ', ' Type II Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Type 2 diabetes ', ' Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus ', ' T2DM ', ' T2D ', ' T2 DM ', ' Stable Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Slow-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Noninsulin Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Non-Insulin Dependent Diabetes ', ' NIDDM ', ' Maturity-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' MODY ', ' Ketosis-Resistant Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Adult-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Elements ', ' Epidemic ', ' Equilibrium ', ' balance function ', ' balance ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Effectiveness of Interventions ', ' Multi-Institutional Clinical Trial ', ' multi site clinical trial ', ' multi site clinical study ', ' multi center clinical trial ', ' multi center clinical study ', ' Multi-site clinical trial ', ' Multi-site clinical study ', ' Multi-center clinical trial ', ' Multi-center clinical study ', ' National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases ', ' NIDDK ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Community Trial ', ' trend ', ' Modification ', ' Exercise ', ' Physical Exercise ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Behavioral ', ' Fasting ', ' fasts ', ' fasted ', ' Adoption ', ' Diabetes prevention ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Future ', ' Age ', ' base ', ' Goals ', ' improved ', ' Health ', ' Health education ', ' Health Tutoring ', ' Health Instruction ', ' Health Promotion ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' Area ', ' Randomized Controlled Clinical Trials ', ' Incidence ', ' Training ', ' Physical activity ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' post intervention ', ' Life Style ', ' Lifestyle ', ' Individual ', ' Funding ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Mortality ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' nutrition ', ' Nutritional Science ', ' Obesity ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Prediabetes syndrome ', ' syndrome x ', ' pre-diabetes ', ' Prediabetic State ', ' Prediabetes ', ' programs ', ' sound ', ' statistics ', ' Testing ', ' Training Support ', ' Translating ', ' United States ', ' Adopted ', ' Investigation ', ' Body Weight decreased ', ' wt-loss ', ' body weight loss ', ' Weight Reduction ', ' Weight Loss ', ' Weight ', ' Work ', ' Upper arm ', ' Behavior ', ' Overweight ', ' Over weight ', ' behavior change ', ' Church ', ' empowered ', ' Blood Glucose ', ' Blood Sugar ', ' Body Weight ', ' American ', ' behavioral/social science ', ' success ', ' intervention program ', ' Participant ', ' Prevention ', ' social ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', ' Relative (related person) ', ' Relative ', ' Walking ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' chronic disorder ', ' chronic disease/disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Modeling ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' clinical investigation ', ' Communities ', ' diabetes prevention program ', ' opportunity cost ', ' cost ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' diet and exercise ', ' efficacy trial ', ' Outcome ', ' Prevalence ', ' aged ', ' lifestyle intervention ', ' life style intervention ', ' 20 year old ', ' twenty year old ', ' age 20 years ', ' community organizations ', ' high risk ', ' community setting ', ' primary outcome ', ' secondary outcome ', ' social science research ', ' ']",NIDDK,AUGUSTA UNIVERSITY,R18,2009,607747,0.053558016152313336
"Factors Influencing the Racial Disparity in SIDS.    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The incidence of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) in the US has declined 50% since 1992, when the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) first recommended that infants be placed in a non-prone position for sleep. Despite the tremendous success of the subsequent Back to Sleep campaign, African-American (AA) infants remain twice as likely to be placed prone, and twice as likely to die from SIDS. The racial disparity exists across all educational and income categories, and the extent of the racial disparity has increased rather than decreased. The NICHD, in both its 2000 general Strategic Plan (From Cells to Selves) and its 2000 Strategic Plan for SIDS research (Targeting Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS): A Strategic Plan), highlighted the need to understand mechanisms leading to racial, ethnic, and social disparities as a research priority.      Very little is known about the reasons why AA parents use the prone position. Further, no studies have taken advantage of the observed socioeconomic status(SES)-associated variability in SIDS and prone sleeping within the AA community. By examining within-group differences, it is possible to move beyond comparative racial descriptions to identification of potentially modifiable factors. The overall purpose of these investigations, therefore, is to better understand factors contributing to the comparatively high incidence of prone sleep positioning in AA infants. In order to achieve this, will address the following Specific Aims: 1) To compare knowledge, attitudes, and practices regarding infant sleep position in AA parents of higher and lower SES. 2) To identify risk factors for non-use of the recommended supine sleep position in AA families with higher and lower SES. 3) To develop a phenomenological understanding of the decisions made by AA parents of higher and lower SES who do not use recommended supine sleep position, through qualitative methods. 4) To develop, implement, and evaluate an appropriate intervention program based on the knowledge gained through Specific Aims 1-3.      This study addresses important gaps in our understanding of factors informing parental decision regarding infant sleep positioning in AAs. By understanding the social and cultural factors, it should be possible to design more effective interventions, thereby potentially decreasing the rate of SIDS in AA infants.         ",Factors Influencing the Racial Disparity in SIDS.,7632042,K24RR023681,"['Decision Making ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' low socioeconomic status ', ' low socioeconomic position ', ' low socio-economic status ', ' low socio-economic position ', ' Address ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Qualitative Methods ', ' National Institute of Child Health and Human Development ', ' NICHD ', ' Strategic Planning ', ' Targeted Research ', ' Family ', ' base ', ' Happiness ', ' positive attitude ', ' Health Personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Hospitals ', ' Household ', ' Incidence ', ' Income ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Infant ', ' Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice ', ' Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice ', ' Knowledge, Attitudes, Behaviors ', ' Funding ', ' Epidemiologic Studies ', ' epidemiologic investigation ', ' Epidemiology Research ', ' Epidemiological Studies ', ' Epidemiologic Research ', ' Parents ', ' Pediatrics ', ' Prone Position ', ' grandparent ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Sleep ', ' Research Priority ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Sudden infant death syndrome ', ' Sudden Unexpected Infant Death ', ' Sudden Infant Death ', ' SIDS ', ' Crib Death ', ' Cot Death ', ' Testing ', ' Investigation ', ' Work ', ' Techniques ', ' Birth ', ' Parturition ', ' American ', ' success ', ' intervention program ', ' Categories ', ' social ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' Cells ', ' Measures ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Academy ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Communities ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Back to Sleep ', ' infant sleep position ', ' infantile sleep position ', ' social disparities ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' racial/ethnic ', ' comparative ', ' effective intervention ', ' sleep position ', ' supine sleep ', ' non-prone sleep ', ' ']",NCRR,CHILDREN'S RESEARCH INSTITUTE,K24,2009,164862,0.08022772078108067
"Predictors of Hemodialysis Access Dysfunction    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   Hemodialysis vascular access dysfunction accounts for extensive morbidity, and is the greatest contributor to cost among patients with renal failure. Diabetics and African Americans (AA's) are disproportionately affected; however, reasons for this are unclear.   The primary aims of the proposed study are 1) estimate the association between diabetes and AA race and arteriovenous fistula (AVF) survival; 2) explore whether factors associated with vessel location and primary cause of renal disease account for the relationship between diabetes and AA race and AVF survival; 3) determine if vein caliber and arterial resistance account for the association between diabetes and AA race and AVF survival, and 4) determine if inflammation accounts for the association between diabetes and AA race and AVF failure.   Two parallel activities will be conducted to address our scientific aims. First we will use data from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid end-stage renal disease (ESRD) Clinical Performance Measures (CPM) Project, United States Renal Data System (USRDS) and an established cohort from a Veterans' Affairs sponsored study of dialysis patients undergoing AVF placement to identify factors that might account for the association between diabetes and race and AVF survival. Second, we will recruit a cohort of 180 pre-dialysis patients preparing to undergo access placement from the clinics at Emory University, Emory Crawford Long Hospital, Grady Memorial Hospital and the Dialysis Access Center of Atlanta to ascertain if serum markers of inflammation account for the association between diabetes and AA race and access survival. The proposed studies aim to elucidate reasons for the disparities in vascular access survival among diabetics and AA's.       ",Predictors of Hemodialysis Access Dysfunction,7610967,K23DK065634,"['Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Dialysis procedure ', ' dialysis therapy ', ' Dialysis ', ' End stage renal failure ', ' End-Stage Renal Disease ', ' End-Stage Kidney Disease ', ' ESRD ', ' Caliber ', ' Diameter ', ' Address ', ' Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha ', ' Tumor Necrosis Factor ', ' TNF-alpha ', ' Cachectin-Tumor Necrosis Factor ', ' Cachectin ', ' Data ', ' Fibrinogen ', ' Factor One ', ' Factor I ', ' Coagulation Factor One ', ' Coagulation Factor I ', ' Blood Factor One ', ' Blood Coagulation Factor One ', ' Blood Coagulation Factor I ', ' Fistula ', ' Serum Markers ', ' Affect ', ' Hemodialysis ', ' Hemodialyses ', ' Hospitals ', ' Clinical ', ' Inflammation ', ' Information Systems ', ' Information Technology Systems ', ' IT Systems ', ' Data Systems ', ' Interleukin-6 ', ' IFNB2 ', ' IFN-beta 2 ', ' Hybridoma Growth Factor ', ' Hepatocyte-Stimulating Factor ', ' HPGF ', ' BSF2 (B cell stimulating factor 2) ', ' BSF2 ', ' BSF-2 ', ' BCDF ', ' B-Cell Stimulatory Factor-2 ', ' B-Cell Differentiation Factor-2 ', ' B-Cell Differentiation Factor ', ' B cell stimulating factor 2 ', ' B cell differentiation factor ', ' interferon beta 2 ', ' Plasmacytoma Growth Factor ', ' Myeloid Differentiation-Inducing Protein ', ' MGI-2 ', ' Interleukin 6 (Interferon, Beta 2) ', ' IL6 Protein ', ' IL-6 ', ' Interleukins ', ' Kidney ', ' renal ', ' Kidney Urinary System ', ' Kidney Diseases ', ' renal disorder ', ' kidney disorder ', ' Renal Disease ', ' Nephropathy ', ' Failure (biologic function) ', ' failure ', ' FLR ', ' diabetic ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' Functional disorder ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Physiopathology ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Patients ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Venous ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' recruit ', ' Kidney Failure ', ' Renal Insufficiency ', ' Renal Failure ', ' Kidney Insufficiency ', ' Risk ', ' Arteriovenous fistula ', ' Arteriovenous Aneurysm ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' Veins ', ' Veterans ', ' Caucasians ', ' Clinic ', ' Location ', ' Blood Vessels ', ' vascular ', ' American ', ' Medicare/Medicaid ', ' Performance ', ' cohort ', ' C-reactive protein ', ' Proteins, specific or class, C-reactive ', ' Caucasoid Race ', ' white race ', ' Occidental ', ' Caucasoid ', ' Caucasian Race ', ' Caucasian ', ' Measures ', ' Relative (related person) ', ' Relative ', ' Interleukin-10 ', ' Interleukin 10 Precursor ', ' IL10A ', ' IL10 ', ' IL-10 ', ' Cytokine formation-inhibiting factor (mouse clone F115 protein moiety reduced) ', ' Cytokine Synthesis Inhibitory Factor ', ' CSIF-10 ', ' CSIF ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Accounting ', ' cost ', ' Dialysis patients ', ' Resistance ', ' resistant ', ' non-diabetic ', ' nondiabetic ', ' high risk ', ' ']",NIDDK,EMORY UNIVERSITY,K23,2009,127116,0.04561307111362382
"Localized Aggressive Periodontitis: Microbial & Host Markers for Susceptibility    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Localized Aggressive Periodontitis (LAP) affects approximately 70,000 U.S. children, largely from underserved groups. If untreated, LAP can lead to loss of first molars and central incisors. The proposal expands on preliminary data and surveys microbial and host factors indicative of LAP risk. This study will screen 3,000 periodontally healthy children from Newark for the presence of Actinobacillus actiinomycetemcomitans (Aa). 205 test (Aa+) and 410 control (Aa-) will be recalled at 6-month intervals for 4-5 yrs to identify factors predictive of disease onset. Screening and recall exams include a periodontal examination, collection of saliva and buccal cells as well as crevicular fluid and subgingival plaque from pocketed sites and the mesial of all 1st molars. Samples will be stored for future analysis. Horizontal bite- wing radiographs are used to establish the LAP diagnosis. When bone loss is detected, stored site-specific samples will be analyzed. The revised proposal includes 2 aims: 1. to determine whether Aa, clones of Aa, or 200 members of the flora associated with Aa could be predictive of the onset of LAP; 2. to examine host factors that can affect Aa colonization, persistence, subgingival migration and subsequent activation of innate and acquired immune factors associated with disease onset. These factors include: iron-saturation of lactoferrin, IgA antibody titers to Aa adhesins, a Growth Modifying Factor (GMF) that killls Gram+ pioneer plaque microbes that compete with Aa, IgG antibody levels to leukotoxin and levels of 21 cytokines that can affect disease initiation. Comparison of data from Aa+ (test) and Aa- (control) groups should provide information with which to determine the combination of microbial and host markers predictive of risk for LAP onset. To date in those recalled for 1yr or more, 7 of 36 Aa+ students have developed LAP, while none of the Aa- conrols have LAP (p <.01). Pilot data from saliva obtained from students recalled indicates the following; 1. GMF from Aa+ students can kill pioneer plaque microbes in vitro (p < .01), 2. lower IgA levels are found in students repeatedly colonized by Aa, and 3. a specific cytokine, MIP 1a, is significantly elevated in Aa+/LAP subjects prior to bone loss (p <.01). The knowledge gained from this prospective study should identify markers required to develop a salivary-based diagnostic test that can be used to design preventive strategies to reduce oral health disparities in this predominantly African American and Hispanic population.           ",Localized Aggressive Periodontitis: Microbial & Host Markers for Susceptibility,7644510,R01DE017968,"['health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Actinobacillus ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Small Inducible Cytokine A3 ', ' Stem Cell Inhibitor ', ' MIP-1a ', ' MIP-1 Alpha ', ' MIP 1alpha ', ' Chemokine (C-C motif) Ligand 3 ', ' microbial host ', ' Environment ', ' Microarray Analysis ', ' microarray technology ', ' Microarray-Based Analysis ', ' Epithelial Cells ', ' Data ', ' Collection ', ' sex ', ' Exhibits ', ' Killings ', ' Future ', ' Affect ', ' Gingival Crevicular Fluid ', ' Gingival Exudate ', ' Age ', ' base ', ' Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Growth Factor ', ' Proteins Growth Factors ', ' Growth Substances ', ' Growth Agents ', ' GFAC ', ' sample collection ', ' specimen collection ', ' Site ', ' Surface ', ' Immunoglobulin A ', ' IgA ', ' Immunoglobulin G ', ' IgG ', ' 7S Gamma Globulin ', ' In Vitro ', ' Incidence ', ' Incisor ', ' incisor (dental) ', ' Evaluation ', ' Predisposition ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Screening procedure ', ' screenings ', ' screening ', ' Oral cavity ', ' Mouth ', ' Cavitas Oris ', ' Buccal Cavity Head and Neck ', ' Buccal Cavity ', ' Lactoferrin ', ' Lactotransferrin ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Bacterial Adhesins ', ' adhesin ', ' Methods ', ' Movement ', ' body movement ', ' Onset of illness ', ' disorder onset ', ' disease onset ', ' Integration Host Factors ', ' Host Factor Protein ', ' Host Factor ', ' Oral health ', ' dental health ', ' Organism ', ' living system ', ' Iron ', ' Fe element ', ' Liquid substance ', ' liquid ', ' fluid ', ' Periodontitis ', ' Chronic Periodontitis ', ' Antibodies ', ' Bacterial Antigens ', ' Inflammatory ', ' Prospective Studies ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Risk ', ' Saliva ', ' Knowledge ', ' Students ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Tooth structure ', ' teeth ', ' Tooth ', ' Wing ', ' Immune ', ' Contralateral ', ' Oral ', ' Salivary ', ' Salivary immunoglobulin A ', ' salivary IgA ', ' microorganism ', ' tooth surface ', ' Bacteria ', ' Bite ', ' Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction ', ' reverse transcriptase PCR ', ' RTPCR ', ' RT-PCR ', ' microbial ', ' bone loss ', ' leukotoxin ', ' Prevention strategy ', ' Preventive strategy ', ' member ', ' Predictive Factor ', ' Cells ', ' cytokine ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans ', ' Bacterium comitans ', ' Bacterium actinomycetem comitans ', ' A. actinomycetemcomitans ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Diagnostic tests ', ' Hispanics ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Prevalence ', ' migration ', ' Microbe ', ' human disease ', ' Control Groups ', ' ']",NIDCR,UNIV OF MED/DENT OF NJ-NJ DENTAL SCHOOL,R01,2009,686183,0.15203844389894752
"Race and Health Outcomes Associated with Obesity Two overarching goals of Healthy People 2010 are to increase years and quality of healthy life and to eliminate health disparities. Because obesity disproportionately affects African and Hispanic Americans, understanding the influence of race on obesity's impact on different health outcomes is especially vital to achieving these goals. Interestingly, although African Americans (AAs) continue to have substantially lower life-expectancy than whites, observational studies suggest that obesity may have a lower impact on mortality in AAs than in whites even though healthcare expenditures in obese AAs are lower than in obese white Americans.  Racial differences in obesity-related mortality and cost may be a reflection of differences on several fronts: higher rates of competing health risks such as smoking, HIV, and trauma in AAs; a reduced association between obesity and cardiovascular risk factors in AAs; and delays in diagnosis and treatment of risk factors in normal-weight AAs. Using data from 3 national databases -the Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey (MCBS), National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), and Medical Expenditures Panel Survey (MEPS)- this study will examine the interplay of race and body mass index (BMI) as they relate to 4 important outcomes: 1) mortality; 2) cardiovascular risk factors; 3) delays in diagnosis and treatment of cardiovascular risk factors; and 4) healthcare expenditures. Previous studies examining obesity-related mortality have not been able to adequately address the issue of competinghealth risks and residual confounding from smoking and preclinical illness, which can obscure an association between obesity and higher mortality. Because MCBS data are linked to Medicare claims longitudinally, this study will be able to limit uncontrolled confounding from smoking and pre-clinical disease and competing health risks. Furthermore, the studies proposed in this application will address several important questions: Is the association between obesity and novel cardiovascular risk factors reduced compared to whites? Are leaner minority adults, who may be at higher risk for some cardiovascular risk factors than predicted by their body mass index, more susceptible to having delays in diagnosis and treatment of these risk factors? What are the different types of care and medical conditions that drive racial differences in obesity-related healthcare expenditures? In clarifying these relationships, our findings could shed light on mechanisms underlying racial differences in obesity-related risk and cost. Our findings could also guide the setting of public health priorities and the targeting of specific initiatives to reduce racial disparities in healthcare and mortality.

"Behavioral and Social Science Research on Understanding and Reducing Health Dispa    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Numerous studies have documented the existence of marked racial/ethnic disparities in the utilization of joint replacement in the management of osteoarthritis (OA). African-Americans (AA) are about 40 percent less likely than white patients to receive joint replacement for lower extremity OA, and this disparity is enduring based on the latest report from the CDC. Our research team published evidence demonstrating that, compared to similar white patients, AA candidates for joint replacement differ in their preferences for joint replacement and that these differences are primarily shaped by differences in knowledge and understanding about the treatment risks/benefits and expectations about surgical outcomes. Furthermore, doctor-patient communication for preference-sensitive treatments such as joint replacement is bi-directional and the content of the communication and the decisions are influenced by patient's baseline attitudes and preferences as well as their ability to engage in the discussion. There is preliminary evidence that baseline differences in preference, knowledge, and expectations regarding this treatment impact the quality of communication between AA patients and orthopaedic surgeons and consequently reduce AA patients' likelihood of receiving a recommendation for joint replacement. More research is needed to assess specific interventions to help empower AA patients in their communication with orthopaedic surgeons and improve their likelihood of receiving a recommendation for knee replacement when clinically indicated. We propose a randomized controlled trial is to assess the effect of a high-quality, evidence-based, patient-centered educational intervention supplemented with targeted counseling on the quality of communication between AA patients and orthopaedic surgeons and on the likelihood of receiving a recommendation for knee joint replacement when clinically indicated. AA patients who are potential candidates for knee joint replacement who have been referred to orthopaedic surgery will be randomized to undergo either an educational intervention using the Knee OA Decision Aid (DA) supplemented with brief counseling using the Motivational Interviewing (MI) technique or an attention control treatment. We will assess the effect of the intervention on quality of doctor- patient communication and likelihood of receiving a recommendation for knee joint replacement within 6 months of the intervention. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that orthopaedic surgeon-patient communication and decision-making about joint replacement can be improved by better informing the patients using a high quality, evidence-based, patient-centered educational intervention delivered at the time of decision-making. Therefore, the primary specific aims of this proposal are: 1) To examine the effect of the intervention on the AA patient's quality of communication with the orthopaedic surgeon, and 2) To examine the effect of the intervention on the likelihood of receiving a recommendation for knee joint replacement when clinically indicated.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Numerous studies have documented the existence of marked racial/ethnic disparities in the utilization of knee replacement, an effective and highly utilized treatment option for advanced knee osteoarthritis. This study will provide one of the first patient-centered interventions in the orthopedic setting designed to mitigate racial/ethnic disparity in access to joint replacement for patients who meet clinical indications for the treatment. The results of this study will not only inform the nation on strategies to reduce or eliminate one of most marked disparities in chronic disease management, but will also provide opportunities to improve quality of care for large segment of our society.           Numerous studies have documented the existence of marked racial/ethnic disparities in the utilization of knee replacement, an effective and highly utilized treatment option for advanced knee osteoarthritis.

AA and Hispanic disparities exceed national [HP 2010] and state [Healthy Carolinians 2010] targets for HIV/AIDS, cardiovascular disease (CVD), and diabetes and related risk factors. Through this P20 center we propose to conduct research that will provide better understanding of how these disparities can be alleviated, and thus direction for ultimately eliminating the selected disparities in AAs, Hispanics, rural and low-income populations. AIMS are to 1) Increase the number and capacity of health disparity researchers that are from ethnic or racial minorities and female gender, 2) Enhance the infrastructure for interdisciplinary health disparity research focused on testing interventions and methods to prevent risk behaviors and improve self-management of health problems among African, Hispanics, rural and low income Americans 3) Expand involvement of the community in research, 4) Disseminate information on health disparities research. Administrative, Research, Training and Engagement Cores are interactive and synergistic and will be used to achieve the aims through efficacy studies. This is a collaborative effort of Nursing, Public Health Education, Exercise and Sports Science, Nutrition, Education, Anthropology, Mathematics, Human Development and Family Studies, the Center for Biotechnology, Genetics and Health Research, the Center for Youth, Family and Community Partnerships, health systems, school systems, free clinics and community and lay organizations. The long-term goal is for this EXPORT Center to assist the community, region and state and nation in meeting the health needs of a diverse citizenry through effective interventions and methods. Public statement: This Center will test ways to help minorities, rural and poor persons prevent and   deal with health problems. The major health problems we are concerned with are heart disease, diabetes and HIV/AIDS. The community will be a partner in these activities.          ",TRIAD Center for Health Disparities,7858063,P20MD002289,[''],NIMHD,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA GREENSBORO,P20,2010,1706768,0.03652926345090911
"Race and Preference for Knee Replacement:  A Patient-Centered Intervention    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Abstract Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most prevalent form of arthritis and is among the most prevalent chronic conditions in the US. The prevalence of knee OA increases with age. With the aging of the US population, the burden of OA is expected to increase. The prevalence of knee OA among older African-Americans (AAs) is higher than that reported for whites. Yet numerous studies have documented the existence of marked racial/ethnic disparities in the utilization of knee replacement, an effective and highly utilized treatment option for advanced knee OA. Our research team conducted one of the first studies to examine the reasons why AA and white patients differ in utilization of joint replacement. We have published evidence demonstrating that, compared to similar white patients, AA potential candidates for joint replacement differ in their preferences for joint replacement, and that these differences are in part shaped by differences in knowledge about the risks/benefits of the treatment and consequently in expectations on surgical outcome. There are national calls to act on this information by testing interventions to reduce this disparity. The proposed trial is one of the first in the nation to directly assess the effect of a patient-centered intervention on AA patient's preferences for and access to knee replacement. The immediate goal of this randomized controlled trial is to assess the impact of a high quality, evidence-based, patient-centered educational intervention supplemented with targeted counseling (motivational interviewing) on AA patient preferences, expectations, and likelihood of achieving a referral for orthopedic evaluation. AA primary care patients who are potential candidates for joint replacement based on clinical severity of their disease who have no clear contra-indications for surgical intervention will be randomized to either intervention or attention control. We will assess the effect of the intervention on patient preference, expectations, and likelihood of receiving a referral for orthopedic evaluation within 12 months of the intervention. The long-term goal of this research is to implement effective interventions targeting AAs who are clinical candidates for joint replacement in a national effort to improve access to reduce and ultimately eliminate disparities in the utilization of this effective treatment option. Therefore, the specific aims are: (1) to examine the effect of the knee osteoarthritis decision aid supplemented by counseling on AA patient preferences and expectations regarding surgical outcome for knee joint replacement; (2) to examine the effect of the intervention on orthopedic surgery referral rates for AA patients; and (3) To examine the mechanism of action of the intervention (combined decision aid and counseling using motivational interviewing). A secondary aim of the proposed research is to examine the effect of the intervention on AA patients' rate of knee replacement.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Numerous studies have documented the existence of marked racial/ethnic disparities in the utilization of knee replacement, an effective and highly utilized treatment option for advanced knee osteoarthritis. This study will provide one of the first interventions in the nation designed to mitigate racial/ethnic disparity in access to joint replacement for patients who meet clinical indications for the treatment. The results of this study will not only inform the nation on strategies to reduce or eliminate one of most marked disparities in chronic disease management, but will also provide opportunities to improve quality of care for large segment of our society.          ",Race and Preference for Knee Replacement:  A Patient-Centered Intervention,7827989,R01AR054474,"['Counseling ', ' Decision Making ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Improve Access ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Orthopedic Surgery procedures ', ' Orthopedic Surgery ', ' Foundations ', ' Age ', ' base ', ' Goals ', ' improved ', ' Replacement Arthroplasty ', ' joint replacement ', ' Joint Prosthesis Implantation ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Medical ', ' Evaluation ', ' Knee joint ', ' disability ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lower Extremity ', ' Membrum inferius ', ' Lower Limb ', ' Educational Intervention ', ' instructional intervention ', ' Training Intervention ', ' Instruction Intervention ', ' Education for Intervention ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Orthopedics ', ' Orthopedic Surgical Profession ', ' Orthopedic ', ' Degenerative polyarthritis ', ' hypertrophic arthritis ', ' degenerative joint disease ', ' Osteoarthrosis ', ' Osteoarthritis ', ' Degenerative Arthritis ', ' Patients ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Primary Care ', ' Staging ', ' Shapes ', ' Publishing ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Research ', ' Research Design ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Societies ', ' Patient Preferences ', ' Knowledge ', ' Disease Management ', ' Disorder Management ', ' Arthritis ', ' joint inflammation ', ' arthritic ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Knee Osteoarthritis ', ' Attention ', ' Severities ', ' Techniques ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' surgery ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' meetings ', ' preference ', ' empowered ', ' expectation ', ' empowerment ', ' motivational enhancement therapy ', ' motivational interview ', ' Benefits and Risks ', ' Reporting ', ' abstracting ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Decision Aid ', ' Arthroplasty, Replacement, Knee ', ' Total Knee Replacement ', ' Total Arthroplasty of the Knee ', ' TKR - Total knee replacement ', ' Prosthetic total arthroplasty of the knee ', ' Knee replacement ', ' Knee joint replacement operation ', ' Knee arthroplasty ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' chronic disorder ', ' chronic disease/disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Quality of Care ', ' QOC ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' administrative database ', ' administrative data base ', ' patient oriented ', ' patient centered ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' public health relevance ', ' effective intervention ', ' evidence base ', ' effective therapy ', ' effective treatment ', ' intervention effect ', ' Control Groups ', ' ']",NIAMS,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2010,328130,0.1441398467113052
"Prosaposin: A Novel Biomarker of Prostate Cancer Progression in African Americans    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Prostate cancer (PCa), the second leading cause of cancer-related death in US men, presents the greatest racial disparity of any malignant disease in African Americans, with a 1.6-1.9 times higher incidence rate and 2 - 3 times higher mortality rate than Caucasians. PCa in African Americans presents with more advanced clinical stages and aggressive tumors. PCa biomarkers are needed to improve early detection of clinically significant tumors and to distinguish indolent or slow growing tumors from more aggressive ones. In our search for tumor markers, we cloned prosaposin (PSAP) as a secreted protein and discovered its overexpression in metastatic PCa cells and tissues. Previously, we demonstrated that PSAP and/or its active molecular derivatives increase migration and invasion and up regulate matrix-degrading proteolytic enzymes expression in PCa cells. In Caucasians, serum-PSAP levels are increased in metastatic PCa when compared to primary PCa or normal prostate tissues. In addition, there was no difference in serum-PSAP levels between organ-confined and locally-invasive tumors. In contrast to Caucasians, our pilot study in African Americans shows that a) tissue expression of PSAP is significantly higher in undifferentiated tumors with Gleason grade 4/5 pattern than in the differentiated tumors with Gleason grade d 3 or benign glands (BPH) and b) serum-PSAP levels are higher in locally invasive (stage III/IV) tumors than in the organ-confined (stage I/II) tumors which positively correlates with disease progression. Based on these observations, we hypothesized that PSAP contributes to PCa progression and has the characteristics of a novel biomarker discriminating the aggressive tumors from non- aggressive ones in African American patients. To test our hypothesis, we propose the following Aims: 1) Define the clinical significance of serum-PSAP as a marker of PCa progression or aggressiveness in African Americans; 2) Determine the association between tissue expression of PSAP and clinical and histopathological predictors or prognosticators of PCa progression or aggressiveness in African Americans; and 3) Determine the association between PSAP and invasive and metastatic phenotypes in PSAP-over expressed or -silenced African American PCa cells. We will use immunohistochemical analysis and sandwich-ELISA assays to quantify PSAP expression levels in a large pool of tissue and serum samples and to determine their association with clinicohistopathological predictors or prognosticators of PCa aggressiveness and progression in African Americans. We will also test the effect of increased or decreased PSAP expression on tumor growth rate and spontaneous metastatic ability in subcutaneous and orthotopic tumor xenografts in African American- derived PCa cells. At the conclusion of this proposal, we will have defined the clinical and histopathological significance of PSAP as a biomarker of PCa progression and/or aggressiveness in African Americans that could be further utilized in clinical development.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The incidences, mortality, and aggressiveness of prostate cancer (PCa) in African American (AA) men are higher than in Caucasians. To improve early detection of clinically significant tumors and to discriminate indolent or slow growing tumors from more aggressive ones, reliable prognostic factors or biomarkers are needed. An in-depth investigation of our preliminary discovery of a high expression of prosaposin (PSAP) levels in locally invasive and/or metastatic PCa cells, tissues, and serum samples from AA men would provide us with the clinical and histopathological values of this molecule as a biomarker for PCa screenings, diagnoses, or post-treatment follow up in AAs.           The incidences, mortality, and aggressiveness of prostate cancer (PCa) in African American (AA) men are higher than in Caucasians.

"Factors Influencing the Racial Disparity in SIDS.    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The incidence of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) in the US has declined 50% since 1992, when the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) first recommended that infants be placed in a non-prone position for sleep. Despite the tremendous success of the subsequent Back to Sleep campaign, African-American (AA) infants remain twice as likely to be placed prone, and twice as likely to die from SIDS. The racial disparity exists across all educational and income categories, and the extent of the racial disparity has increased rather than decreased. The NICHD, in both its 2000 general Strategic Plan (From Cells to Selves) and its 2000 Strategic Plan for SIDS research (Targeting Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS): A Strategic Plan), highlighted the need to understand mechanisms leading to racial, ethnic, and social disparities as a research priority.      Very little is known about the reasons why AA parents use the prone position. Further, no studies have taken advantage of the observed socioeconomic status(SES)-associated variability in SIDS and prone sleeping within the AA community. By examining within-group differences, it is possible to move beyond comparative racial descriptions to identification of potentially modifiable factors. The overall purpose of these investigations, therefore, is to better understand factors contributing to the comparatively high incidence of prone sleep positioning in AA infants. In order to achieve this, will address the following Specific Aims: 1) To compare knowledge, attitudes, and practices regarding infant sleep position in AA parents of higher and lower SES. 2) To identify risk factors for non-use of the recommended supine sleep position in AA families with higher and lower SES. 3) To develop a phenomenological understanding of the decisions made by AA parents of higher and lower SES who do not use recommended supine sleep position, through qualitative methods. 4) To develop, implement, and evaluate an appropriate intervention program based on the knowledge gained through Specific Aims 1-3.      This study addresses important gaps in our understanding of factors informing parental decision regarding infant sleep positioning in AAs. By understanding the social and cultural factors, it should be possible to design more effective interventions, thereby potentially decreasing the rate of SIDS in AA infants.         ",Factors Influencing the Racial Disparity in SIDS.,7870432,K24RR023681,"['Decision Making ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' low socioeconomic status ', ' low socioeconomic position ', ' low socio-economic status ', ' low socio-economic position ', ' Address ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Qualitative Methods ', ' National Institute of Child Health and Human Development ', ' NICHD ', ' Strategic Planning ', ' Targeted Research ', ' Family ', ' base ', ' Happiness ', ' positive attitude ', ' Health Personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Hospitals ', ' Household ', ' Incidence ', ' Income ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Infant ', ' Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice ', ' Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice ', ' Knowledge, Attitudes, Behaviors ', ' Funding ', ' Epidemiologic Studies ', ' epidemiologic investigation ', ' Epidemiology Research ', ' Epidemiological Studies ', ' Epidemiologic Research ', ' Parents ', ' Pediatrics ', ' Prone Position ', ' grandparent ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Sleep ', ' Research Priority ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Sudden infant death syndrome ', ' Sudden Unexpected Infant Death ', ' Sudden Infant Death ', ' SIDS ', ' Crib Death ', ' Cot Death ', ' Testing ', ' Investigation ', ' Work ', ' Techniques ', ' Birth ', ' Parturition ', ' American ', ' success ', ' intervention program ', ' Categories ', ' social ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' Cells ', ' Measures ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Academy ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Communities ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Back to Sleep ', ' infant sleep position ', ' infantile sleep position ', ' social disparities ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' racial/ethnic ', ' comparative ', ' effective intervention ', ' sleep position ', ' supine sleep ', ' non-prone sleep ', ' ']",NCRR,CHILDREN'S RESEARCH INSTITUTE,K24,2010,168187,0.08022772078108067
"Prognostic value of AR mutation in primary African American prostate cancer    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Prostate cancer (PCa) incidence and mortality rate is higher in African American (AA) men than in Caucasian Americans (CAs). AA men with PCa also present with higher tumor volume, more advanced tumor stage, and higher Gleason grade. Prostate carcinogenesis and tumor progression are related strongly to the expression and activity of the androgen receptor (AR). Mutations and genomic amplification of AR also can increase AR expression and/or activity. In CAs, AR mutations are infrequent (<1%) in localized tumors, but occur at a higher frequency in advanced, metastatic, or hormone-refractory disease. In AAs, the prevalence of AR mutations and their prognostic significances in primary PCa are unknown. We discovered genomic amplification and somatic mutation of AR in a PCa cell line established by our laboratory from an AA patient with localized PCa. We analyzed a set of 91 radical prostatectomy samples (57 AAs and 34 CAs) in which we identified 8 AR mutations (7 somatic and 1 germline) in AA patients, but found no mutations in CA patients. These data led us to hypothesize that AR mutations in primary African Americans PCa is more frequent than expected and may contribute to disease aggressiveness or serve as a prognostic factor. Our Specific Aims are: Aim 1: Determine the prevalence of AR mutations in primary African Americans PCa. Exon-specific primers of the AR gene will be used to sequence genomic-DNA extracted from laser-captured cells of paraffin- embedded tissue sections of radical prostatectomy specimens in order to determine the prevalence of somatic AR mutations in 400 AA patients with primary untreated PCa, and compare this frequency of mutation with that observed in 100 equivalent CA patients. Aim 2: Determine the contribution of AR mutation to PCa heterogeneity in African Americans. Clinical and histopathological heterogeneity of PCa present a major challenge to therapeutic interventions. Differences in AR expression and microvascular density are considered as the two major contributors to PCa heterogeneity. We will use flow cytometry and immunohistochemical staining to examine AR and microvessel density in AA PCa with mutated AR. Aim 3: Define the prognostic significance of AR mutations in primary African American PCa. We will determine the prognostic significance of AR mutations alone or in combination with AR density or microvessel density in relation to clinical or histopathological variables including age, PSA, Gleason score, pathological stage, biochemical recurrence, and family history, with a focus on Gleason sum or pattern as a central prognostic marker. Significance: The results of this exploratory project will provide new knowledge about both the prevalence and prognostic value of AR mutations and may help us to understand better and address more effectively the potential racial disparity between PCa aggressiveness in AAs and CAs.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The incidences, mortality, and aggressiveness of prostate cancer (PCa) in African-American (AA) men are higher than in Caucasians.

"Predictors of Hemodialysis Access Dysfunction    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   Hemodialysis vascular access dysfunction accounts for extensive morbidity, and is the greatest contributor to cost among patients with renal failure. Diabetics and African Americans (AA's) are disproportionately affected; however, reasons for this are unclear.   The primary aims of the proposed study are 1) estimate the association between diabetes and AA race and arteriovenous fistula (AVF) survival; 2) explore whether factors associated with vessel location and primary cause of renal disease account for the relationship between diabetes and AA race and AVF survival; 3) determine if vein caliber and arterial resistance account for the association between diabetes and AA race and AVF survival, and 4) determine if inflammation accounts for the association between diabetes and AA race and AVF failure.   Two parallel activities will be conducted to address our scientific aims. First we will use data from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid end-stage renal disease (ESRD) Clinical Performance Measures (CPM) Project, United States Renal Data System (USRDS) and an established cohort from a Veterans' Affairs sponsored study of dialysis patients undergoing AVF placement to identify factors that might account for the association between diabetes and race and AVF survival. Second, we will recruit a cohort of 180 pre-dialysis patients preparing to undergo access placement from the clinics at Emory University, Emory Crawford Long Hospital, Grady Memorial Hospital and the Dialysis Access Center of Atlanta to ascertain if serum markers of inflammation account for the association between diabetes and AA race and access survival.

"Fit Body and Soul: A Lifestyle Intervention for Diabetes Prevention Conducted Thr    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our long-term goal is to reduce obesity & type 2 diabetes (T2D). The immediate goal of our proposed study is to reduce diabetes risk factors by promoting the adoption of healthy lifestyles. In this R-18 proposal, we plan to assess the ""effectiveness"" and ""cost-effectiveness"" of a lifestyle intervention, the Fit Body and Soul for African Americans (AAs) through faith-based activities and settings. The Fit Body and Soul uses ""Body and Soul"" study approaches to deliver the lifestyle component of the highly successful clinically based ""Diabetes Prevention Program"" (DPP) which has been modified with group participation. The Fit body and Soul program will be offered in AA churches in partnership with their pastors and church officials along with guidance from experts from both DPP and Body and Soul programs. We will see if the proposed intervention is effective in reducing excess weight, physical inactivity, and elevated blood sugar (risk factors for T2D). We will focus on AAs, a group with more T2D and more T2D risk factors including more pre-diabetes, obesity and physical inactivity. Fortunately, recent clinical trials have shown that intensive lifestyle modification programs can be ""efficacious"" diabetes prevention interventions for adults at high risk for T2D. Through improving dietary behaviors and increasing physical activity (PA), these programs lead to modest weight loss, lowered blood sugar and reduce future risk of T2D. One such trial, the DPP was efficacious - it led to a 58% reduction in diabetes. However, its effectiveness & sustainability in a community setting needs further investigation. Our proposed study is designed to fill this gap. We will implement the Fit Body and soul intervention in AA church congregations. This strategy is consistent with a growing trend to involve community organizations, especially churches, in health promotion. We propose a cluster randomized community trial of AA church participants who are overweight (BMIe25). This builds on our previous research in the AA community, our recent identification of 20 AA churches eager to participate, and on our pilot study results. Aim 1: To assess the effectiveness of a 3-month Fit Body and Soul intervention for those at high risk for T2D. Aim 2: To determine if the Fit Body and Soul intervention is more cost-effective than control arm. Controls will be given currently acceptable and scientifically sound health education programs, derived from the CDC-Community Guide. Both intervention and control programs will be delivered by expert-led church health advisors and supported by church pastors. The primary outcome is weight loss (at least 7% of baseline body weight). Secondary outcomes are increased PA (at least 150 minutes of moderate intensity exercise/ week) improved dietary choices, and reduction in blood sugar (e3mg/dL). Data collection will be done at baseline and 6 & 12 months post-intervention. If the Fit Body and soul intervention is found effective, it would lead to a future effectiveness study that would determine whether this intervention reduces the incidence of T2D and the associated mortality and morbidity. Project Narrative It has been shown that promoting the adoption of healthy lifestyles, ones that involve best practices of diet and exercise and lots of expert support, can, in a healthcare setting, reduce the incidence of type 2 diabetes in those who are at high risk. In the proposed study, we hope to show that the same or similar programs are effective in the community setting (African American communities in our study), outside of the healthcare arena. If successful, our study would provide a scientific basis for a future effectiveness study in which we would determine whether not just risk factors but diabetes itself (and its associated mortality and morbidity) can be reduced with behavioral lifestyle program (Fit Body and Soul) that has been modified for social cultural faith-based settings.       ",Fit Body and Soul: A Lifestyle Intervention for Diabetes Prevention Conducted Thr,7897902,R18DK082401,"['Relative (related person) ', ' Relative ', ' Walking ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' chronic disorder ', ' chronic disease/disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Modeling ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' clinical investigation ', ' Communities ', ' diabetes prevention program ', ' opportunity cost ', ' cost ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' diet and exercise ', ' efficacy trial ', ' Outcome ', ' Prevalence ', ' aged ', ' lifestyle intervention ', ' life style intervention ', ' 20 year old ', ' twenty year old ', ' age 20 years ', ' community organizations ', ' high risk ', ' community setting ', ' primary outcome ', ' secondary outcome ', ' social science research ', ' randomized trial ', ' arm ', ' cost effectiveness ', ' Costs and Benefits ', ' Data Collection ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' diabetes risk ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' type II DM ', ' type 2 DM ', ' maturity onset diabetes ', ' ketosis resistant diabetes ', ' adult onset diabetes ', ' Type II diabetes ', ' Type II Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Type 2 diabetes ', ' Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus ', ' T2DM ', ' T2D ', ' T2 DM ', ' Stable Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Slow-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Noninsulin Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Non-Insulin Dependent Diabetes ', ' NIDDM ', ' Maturity-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' MODY ', ' Ketosis-Resistant Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Adult-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Elements ', ' Epidemic ', ' Equilibrium ', ' balance function ', ' balance ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Effectiveness of Interventions ', ' Multi-Institutional Clinical Trial ', ' multi site clinical trial ', ' multi site clinical study ', ' multi center clinical trial ', ' multi center clinical study ', ' Multi-site clinical trial ', ' Multi-site clinical study ', ' Multi-center clinical trial ', ' Multi-center clinical study ', ' National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases ', ' NIDDK ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Community Trial ', ' trend ', ' Exercise ', ' Physical Exercise ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Behavioral ', ' Fasting ', ' fasts ', ' fasted ', ' Adoption ', ' Diabetes prevention ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Future ', ' Age ', ' base ', ' Goals ', ' improved ', ' Health ', ' Health education ', ' Health Tutoring ', ' Health Instruction ', ' Health Promotion ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' Area ', ' Incidence ', ' Training ', ' Physical activity ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' post intervention ', ' Life Style ', ' Lifestyle ', ' Individual ', ' Funding ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' Morbidity -

"Behavioral and Social Science Research on Understanding and Reducing Health Dispa    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Numerous studies have documented the existence of marked racial/ethnic disparities in the utilization of joint replacement in the management of osteoarthritis (OA). African-Americans (AA) are about 40 percent less likely than white patients to receive joint replacement for lower extremity OA, and this disparity is enduring based on the latest report from the CDC. Our research team published evidence demonstrating that, compared to similar white patients, AA candidates for joint replacement differ in their preferences for joint replacement and that these differences are primarily shaped by differences in knowledge and understanding about the treatment risks/benefits and expectations about surgical outcomes. Furthermore, doctor-patient communication for preference-sensitive treatments such as joint replacement is bi-directional and the content of the communication and the decisions are influenced by patient's baseline attitudes and preferences as well as their ability to engage in the discussion. There is preliminary evidence that baseline differences in preference, knowledge, and expectations regarding this treatment impact the quality of communication between AA patients and orthopaedic surgeons and consequently reduce AA patients' likelihood of receiving a recommendation for joint replacement. More research is needed to assess specific interventions to help empower AA patients in their communication with orthopaedic surgeons and improve their likelihood of receiving a recommendation for knee replacement when clinically indicated. We propose a randomized controlled trial is to assess the effect of a high-quality, evidence-based, patient-centered educational intervention supplemented with targeted counseling on the quality of communication between AA patients and orthopaedic surgeons and on the likelihood of receiving a recommendation for knee joint replacement when clinically indicated. AA patients who are potential candidates for knee joint replacement who have been referred to orthopaedic surgery will be randomized to undergo either an educational intervention using the Knee OA Decision Aid (DA) supplemented with brief counseling using the Motivational Interviewing (MI) technique or an attention control treatment. We will assess the effect of the intervention on quality of doctor- patient communication and likelihood of receiving a recommendation for knee joint replacement within 6 months of the intervention. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that orthopaedic surgeon-patient communication and decision-making about joint replacement can be improved by better informing the patients using a high quality, evidence-based, patient-centered educational intervention delivered at the time of decision-making. Therefore, the primary specific aims of this proposal are: 1) To examine the effect of the intervention on the AA patient's quality of communication with the orthopaedic surgeon, and 2) To examine the effect of the intervention on the likelihood of receiving a recommendation for knee joint replacement when clinically indicated.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Numerous studies have documented the existence of marked racial/ethnic disparities in the utilization of knee replacement, an effective and highly utilized treatment option for advanced knee osteoarthritis. This study will provide one of the first patient-centered interventions in the orthopedic setting designed to mitigate racial/ethnic disparity in access to joint replacement for patients who meet clinical indications for the treatment. The results of this study will not only inform the nation on strategies to reduce or eliminate one of most marked disparities in chronic disease management, but will also provide opportunities to improve quality of care for large segment of our society.           Numerous studies have documented the existence of marked racial/ethnic disparities in the utilization of knee replacement, an effective and highly utilized treatment option for advanced knee osteoarthritis.

"TRIAD Center for Health Disparities    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Teamwork in Research and Intervention to Alleviate Disparities (TRIAD) EXPORT Center goal is to implement intervention research to address major health disparities of African-Americans, Hispanics, rural and low-income children and adults in central North Carolina, and, in particular, test interventions that can be tailored to geographic populations to address health disparities across the nation. African-Americans (AAs) constitute more than 30% of the population and the Hispanic population has increased >400% over the past decade. AA and Hispanic disparities exceed national [HP 2010] and state [Healthy Carolinians 2010] targets for HIV/AIDS, cardiovascular disease (CVD), and diabetes and related risk factors. Through this P20 center we propose to conduct research that will provide better understanding of how these disparities can be alleviated, and thus direction for ultimately eliminating the selected disparities in AAs, Hispanics, rural and low-income populations. AIMS are to 1) Increase the number and capacity of health disparity researchers that are from ethnic or racial minorities and female gender, 2) Enhance the infrastructure for interdisciplinary health disparity research focused on testing interventions and methods to prevent risk behaviors and improve self-management of health problems among African, Hispanics, rural and low income Americans 3) Expand involvement of the community in research, 4) Disseminate information on health disparities research.

"Decreased Fat Oxidation - Metabolic Inflexibility in African-American Women    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Mechanisms responsible for the racial disparity in obesity and Type 2 diabetes (T2DM) that are particularly apparent in African-American (AA) women compared to Caucasian women are not understood. While factors such as socioeconomic status and dietary habits likely play a role, emerging data suggests that differences in substrate utilization may contribute to these disparities. Evidence suggests that AA women are metabolically inflexible after an overnight fast, during exercise, or during high fat feeding, and do not increase fat oxidation to levels observed in Caucasian women. Low fat oxidation could result in redirection of lipid into adipose tissue for storage, as well as increased storage of triglyceride and lipotoxic metabolites within skeletal muscle, leading to insulin resistance (IR) and increased risk for development of diabetes. Greater insulin resistance is observed in AA women. These observations in AA compared to Caucasian women are similar to the metabolic inflexibility observed in obese insulin resistant compared to lean individuals. While AA women demonstrate IR, they have lower levels of visceral and hepatic lipid accumulation. This is a paradoxical finding as visceral and hepatic lipid stores are strong risk factors for IR and metabolic diseases. Taken together, the data suggests that IR is phenotypically distinct in AA compared to Caucasian women, and that the lower insulin sensitivity may be due differences in skeletal muscle, leading to peripheral IR. However, we could find no reports comparing hepatic and peripheral insulin sensitivity, and very limited data in AA women for skeletal muscle characteristics that have been demonstrated to be related to insulin resistance in obese and T2DM subjects. Limited data supports a role for increased muscle lipid accumulation in skeletal muscle and insulin resistance in AA women, but we could find no data on lipotoxic lipid levels or mitochondrial content in AA women. Based on these observations, our hypothesis is that inherent differences in skeletal muscle in AA women results in impaired fat oxidation and accumulation of lipid and lipid metabolites within skeletal muscle, and is a link between the development of obesity, insulin resistance and Type 2 diabetes in AA women.  To address this hypothesis we have developed 3 Aims: 1) Determine fat oxidation during sub-maximal exercise in AA and Caucasian women; 2) Determine lipid accumulation and skeletal muscle characteristics (e.g. muscle fiber type, capillary density, oxidative capacity, mitochondrial content) that have been shown to be related to insulin sensitivity; and 3) Assess insulin sensitivity (peripheral and hepatic), and examine the relationship between insulin sensitivity, fat oxidation and skeletal muscle characteristics. Before we can begin to tease apart environmental and genetic factors that play a role in racial differences in fat oxidation and insulin sensitivity, we need to gain a better understanding of the underlying physiology. The detailed in vivo and ex vivo evaluations we propose using state of the art techniques will provide detailed phenotype information that will provide valuable insight into the increased prevalence of Type II diabetes observed in AA women.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The likelihood of being obese or having diabetes is twice as high in African-American women compared to Caucasian women. Reasons for these health disparities are not understood, but growing evidence suggests that lower fat oxidation in AA women leads to accumulation of fat within skeletal muscle which can lead to the development of insulin resistance and diabetes. Before we can begin to understand the environmental and genetic factors that play a role in racial differences in obesity and diabetes, we need to gain a better understanding of the metabolism and skeletal muscle characteristics related to fat oxidation which may lead to the increased risk of development of metabolic diseases in AA women.           The likelihood of being obese or having diabetes is twice as high in African-American women compared to Caucasian women.

"Factors Affecting Hypertension Treatment Adherence among African Americans    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cardiovascular disease (CVD) kills more Americans every year than any other cause of death and the highest rates of mortality from CVD are in the poorest areas of the country. African- Americans (AAs) have a 4.6-fold higher risk of death from CVD than Whites, largely due to uncontrolled hypertension (HTN) and possibly genetic influences. AAs have lower rates of adherence than Whites to HTN treatment but the reasons for this are unknown. An understanding of AAs' perceptions of adherence to HTN treatment and genetic risk factors could be useful in developing tailored, culturally sensitive interventions to improve adherence to treatments and reduce the devastating complications of CVD. Few studies, however, have focused on AAs' perceptions of adherence to HTN treatment. The objective of this study therefore is to gain a better understanding of poor AAs' perceptions of HTN, adherence to treatment, and facilitators and barriers to treatment. Specific aims are to: 1) examine male and female AAs' perceptions of HTN and the ways in which their perceptions influence adherence decisions, 2) examine the influences of AA culture and family history on HTN adherence decisions, and 3) examine the feasibility of developing a CVD genogram for AAs in primary care. Focused ethnography will be used to examine AAs' perceptions of adherence to treatment for HTN and surrounding issues. Thirty participants (15 of each gender) will be recruited from a clinic that provides free medications in Pulaski County, Arkansas. Information on current medications and clinician recommended lifestyle changes will be obtained from participants' medical records. Demographic data will be obtained as well as a self-reported family history, and individual, semi-structured interviews will be conducted with all participants. Also, a CVD genogram will be developed for each participant. Content analysis and constant comparison will be used to examine issues surrounding HTN, and factors influencing adherence to HTN treatment in AA males and females. This study will provide the foundation for the development of culturally sensitive tailored interventions to reduce CVD in this high-risk group.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This research will help health care professionals learn what it is like for poor African-Americans to be treated for high blood pressure. Findings will help us develop culturally sensitive interventions to treat high blood pressure more effectively in African-Americans and thus reduce cardiovascular disease.        This research will help health care professionals learn what it is like for poor African-Americans to be treated for high blood pressure.

"AAS Courses to Increase Women and Minorities in Academic Surgery    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): According to NIH statistics, the number of funded surgical scientists has been steadily decreasing over the last decade as has the number of medical students pursuing surgical training. In addition, there remains disparity in the number of women and minorities in academic medicine; this disparity is even more severe in surgical fields.  The Association for Academic Surgery (AAS) strives to stimulate young surgeons and surgical scientists to pursue careers in academic surgery and support them in establishing themselves as investigators and educators. AAS organizes two courses, the Career Development Course and Fundamentals of Surgical Research Course which aim to better prepare surgeons-in-training as well as junior faculty for successful academic surgery careers. These well established courses offer an excellent venue to encourage more women and minorities to pursue academic surgery careers as well as an opportunity to develop longstanding mentored relationships with the goal of grooming women and minorities to become academic surgery leaders in the years to come.  The specific aims of this conference grant are to: 1) Increase the attendance of women and minorities at the Association for Academic Surgery Career Development Course and Fundamental of Surgical Research Course through the creation of targeted travel awards, 2) Improve collaboration with the Association of Women in Surgery and the Association of Black Academic Surgeons and encourage course attendance by their membership through increased collaborative marketing efforts and reduced registration fees, and 3) Improve likelihood of success for women and minorities in academic surgery careers by establishing mentored relationships with select attendees/speakers and senior members of AAS.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This conference grant proposes to enhance existing courses in career development and fundamentals of surgical research offered by the Association of Academic Surgery with the long-term goal of increasing the number of women and minorities leading successful academic surgery careers.

"Prosaposin: A Novel Biomarker of Prostate Cancer Progression in African Americans    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Prostate cancer (PCa), the second leading cause of cancer-related death in US men, presents the greatest racial disparity of any malignant disease in African Americans, with a 1.6-1.9 times higher incidence rate and 2 - 3 times higher mortality rate than Caucasians. PCa in African Americans presents with more advanced clinical stages and aggressive tumors. PCa biomarkers are needed to improve early detection of clinically significant tumors and to distinguish indolent or slow growing tumors from more aggressive ones. In our search for tumor markers, we cloned prosaposin (PSAP) as a secreted protein and discovered its overexpression in metastatic PCa cells and tissues. Previously, we demonstrated that PSAP and/or its active molecular derivatives increase migration and invasion and up regulate matrix-degrading proteolytic enzymes expression in PCa cells. In Caucasians, serum-PSAP levels are increased in metastatic PCa when compared to primary PCa or normal prostate tissues. In addition, there was no difference in serum-PSAP levels between organ-confined and locally-invasive tumors. In contrast to Caucasians, our pilot study in African Americans shows that a) tissue expression of PSAP is significantly higher in undifferentiated tumors with Gleason grade 4/5 pattern than in the differentiated tumors with Gleason grade d 3 or benign glands (BPH) and b) serum-PSAP levels are higher in locally invasive (stage III/IV) tumors than in the organ-confined (stage I/II) tumors which positively correlates with disease progression. Based on these observations, we hypothesized that PSAP contributes to PCa progression and has the characteristics of a novel biomarker discriminating the aggressive tumors from non- aggressive ones in African American patients. To test our hypothesis, we propose the following Aims: 1) Define the clinical significance of serum-PSAP as a marker of PCa progression or aggressiveness in African Americans; 2) Determine the association between tissue expression of PSAP and clinical and histopathological predictors or prognosticators of PCa progression or aggressiveness in African Americans; and 3) Determine the association between PSAP and invasive and metastatic phenotypes in PSAP-over expressed or -silenced African American PCa cells. We will use immunohistochemical analysis and sandwich-ELISA assays to quantify PSAP expression levels in a large pool of tissue and serum samples and to determine their association with clinicohistopathological predictors or prognosticators of PCa aggressiveness and progression in African Americans. We will also test the effect of increased or decreased PSAP expression on tumor growth rate and spontaneous metastatic ability in subcutaneous and orthotopic tumor xenografts in African American- derived PCa cells. At the conclusion of this proposal, we will have defined the clinical and histopathological significance of PSAP as a biomarker of PCa progression and/or aggressiveness in African Americans that could be further utilized in clinical development.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The incidences, mortality, and aggressiveness of prostate cancer (PCa) in African American (AA) men are higher than in Caucasians. To improve early detection of clinically significant tumors and to discriminate indolent or slow growing tumors from more aggressive ones, reliable prognostic factors or biomarkers are needed. An in-depth investigation of our preliminary discovery of a high expression of prosaposin (PSAP) levels in locally invasive and/or metastatic PCa cells, tissues, and serum samples from AA men would provide us with the clinical and histopathological values of this molecule as a biomarker for PCa screenings, diagnoses, or post-treatment follow up in AAs.           The incidences, mortality, and aggressiveness of prostate cancer (PCa) in African American (AA) men are higher than in Caucasians.

"Gender Power and HIV-Related Sexual Risk Behavior in Older African American Women    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Heterosexual transmission of Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) affects older African American (AA) women in epidemic proportions; AIDS is now the fifth leading cause of death among AA women ages 50 and older. Yet, there is a paucity of research and risk reduction interventions that target this vulnerable population. Older urban AA women living in poverty face a disproportionately higher risk of becoming infected with HIV. Although some studies of HIV- related sexual risk have included older AA women in small numbers, the findings of these studies did not address the social normative roles and gender power related factors that may influence condom use intentions. Older AA women's ability to effectively negotiate condom use maybe influenced by their sexual risk behaviors and protective strategies including perceptions, attitudes, and beliefs about condoms as well as by their power beliefs in their sexual relationships. Most HIV research and public health interventions target white women and younger AA women. Thus, our understanding of the influences of HIV sexual risk among older AA women is limited. The proposed prospective quantitative study seeks to examine factors that influence older urban AA women's HIV-related sexual risk and protective behaviors, including condom use. The aims for the proposed study are to: (1) prospectively examine the influence of HIV-related behavioral beliefs, normative beliefs, control beliefs, relationship factors and relationship power with condom use intentions at 3-month follow-up among older urban AA women; and (2) prospectively examine the influence of HIV-related behavioral beliefs, normative beliefs, control beliefs, relationship factors and relationship power with condom use frequency at 3-month follow-up among older urban AA women. A sample of 228 AA women over age 50 will be recruited from community health centers in the Brooklyn and Queens boroughs of New York City and asked to complete questionnaires at baseline and 3-month follow-up. These sites provide care for a large number of patients from culturally diverse and medically underserved populations. Participants will be questioned regarding their demographic background, employment, SES, condom use and sexual risk-related beliefs and attitudes, relationships and relationship power, and their intentions and actual use of condoms. Multiple logistic regression and/or relative risk techniques will be used to analyze the data. The findings of the study will inform the development of theory-based, age- and culture-specific HIV risk reduction interventions for older urban AA women.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Older African American women face a disproportionately high risk for becoming infected with HIV. However, our understanding of the influences of HIV sexual risk among older African American women is very limited as most HIV prevention research and interventions have targeted younger women. The proposed quantitative study seeks to address this gap in the literature by prospectively examining the influence of individual factors (beliefs and attitudes) and socio-cultural factors (gender/relationship power) on older urban African American women's condom use intentions and behaviors.              Older African American women face a disproportionately high risk for becoming infected with HIV.

"An Integrated HIV Prevention Model for African American Mothers and Daughters    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Disproportionate rates of mental illness and HIV/AIDS/STIs among African Americans (AA), especially females, reflect significant health disparities. AA women accounted for 66% of new AIDS cases among women in 2006, and AA girls account for 64% of new HIV infections among youth. Mental health is linked to HIV-risk in important ways, yet few families- based, gender-specific, Afrocentric programs address mental health and HIV. Simultaneously targeting multiple levels in an integrated approach - the mother-daughter dyad, women, and girls - addresses HIV in the broader social context and capitalizes on the reciprocal impact of mothers and daughters, facilitating mutual reinforcement of HIV prevention attitudes and behavior, and thereby reducing intervention decay and sustaining positive outcomes over protracted time periods. IMARA (Informed, Motivated, Aware, and Responsible about AIDS) is a culturally-tailored, gender-specific, individual PLUS family-based HIV prevention program designed for two high risk groups -- AA women and AA girls. Based on the Theory of Gender and Power and the Social-Personal Framework, IMARA blends SISTA for women, SiHLE for girls, and a highly promising (Project STYLE) family-based program for teens in psychiatric care to simultaneously reduce women's and girls' risky sexual behavior and delay girls' sexual debut. IMARA incorporates components of Project STYLE that are specific to families and teens in psychiatric care (affect management, conflict resolution, parental monitoring, parent-teen communication) with aspects of SISTA and SiHLE that address gender, power, and ethnic pride. Pilot testing (N=22 mother-daughter dyads) supported IMARA's feasibility, tolerability, and acceptability, and despite the small sample size, outcome data indicate promising trends and changes in targeted mediators (increased parental monitoring, more open mother-daughter communication, greater intentions to use condoms, more relationship power) and sexual risk (increased condom use, fewer partners) separately for mothers and daughters from baseline to 2-month follow up. This study proposes a 2-arm RCT to test and compare the efficacy of IMARA to a health promotion control group in reducing risky sexual behavior among 300 women and their 14 - 18 year old AA daughters in psychiatric care. Mothers and daughters will complete baseline, 6-, and 12-month follow-up assessments. We will use an intent-to-treat analysis and a combination of SEM procedures, regression techniques, and other inferential statistical tests for contrasting means and proportions. We will analyze treatment outcomes using logistic and linear multiple regression models examining effects at 6- and 12- months separately, as well as a combined model with random effects for repeated measurements across time. This proposal answers a compelling need for innovative prevention programs that address the intersecting health disparities of mental illness and HIV/AIDS/STIs among African American girls and women. Effective family-based programs can alter negative developmental trajectories of this very high-risk population and begin to redress existing health disparities.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: African Americans (AA) account for more HIV/AIDS cases, people living with HIV/AIDS, and HIV-related deaths than any other racial group in the United States.1, 2 In 2004, AA women accounted for the largest proportion (66%) of new AIDS cases among women in 2006,3-5 and in 2005, AA youth ages 13 - 19 accounted for 69% of new AIDS cases.3 AAs also experience significant mental health disparities,6, 7 and mental illness exacerbates risk for HIV among adults8, 9 and youth.10 Teens in psychiatric care engage in the same HIV-risk behaviors as their school age peers but at higher rates.11-13 The diversity of risk factors associated with these trends is complex, multi-level, and go beyond an individual woman or girl, yet few family-based, gender-specific, Afrocentric programs exist to address their needs. Simultaneously targeting multiple levels in an integrated program -- the mother-daughter dyad, women, and girls -- capitalizes on the reciprocal impact of mothers and daughters, and facilitates mutual reinforcement of HIV prevention attitudes and behavior, thereby reducing intervention decay and sustaining positive outcomes over time. The long-term goal of the study is to reduce health disparities in HIV/AIDS/STIs and mental health among African American women and girls by improving healthy sexual decision-making, empowering mothers to become effective role models, strengthening mother-daughter communication and emotion regulation skills, and building stronger mother-daughter relationships that sustain behavior change.           African Americans (AA) account for more HIV/AIDS cases, people living with HIV/AIDS, and HIV-related deaths than any other racial group in the United States.1, 2 In 2004, AA women accounted for the largest proportion (66%) of new AIDS cases among women in 2006,3-5 and in 2005, AA youth ages 13 - 19 accounted for 69% of new AIDS cases.3 AAs also experience significant mental health disparities,6, 7 and mental illness exacerbates risk for HIV among adults8, 9 and youth.10 Teens in psychiatric care engage in the same HIV-risk behaviors as their school age peers but at higher rates.11-13 The diversity of risk factors associated with these trends is complex, multi-level, and go beyond an individual woman or girl, yet few family-based, gender-specific, Afrocentric programs exist to address their needs.

"Lifestyle Change to Prevent Diabetes via African-American Churches    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our long-term goal is to reduce obesity & type 2 diabetes (T2D). The immediate goal of our proposed study is to reduce diabetes risk factors by promoting the adoption of healthy lifestyles. In this R-18 proposal, we plan to assess the ""effectiveness"" and ""cost-effectiveness"" of a lifestyle intervention, the Fit Body and Soul for African Americans (AAs) through faith-based activities and settings. The Fit Body and Soul uses ""Body and Soul"" study approaches to deliver the lifestyle component of the highly successful clinically based ""Diabetes Prevention Program"" (DPP) which has been modified with group participation. The Fit body and Soul program will be offered in AA churches in partnership with their pastors and church officials along with guidance from experts from both DPP and Body and Soul programs. We will see if the proposed intervention is effective in reducing excess weight, physical inactivity, and elevated blood sugar (risk factors for T2D). We will focus on AAs, a group with more T2D and more T2D risk factors including more pre-diabetes, obesity and physical inactivity. Fortunately, recent clinical trials have shown that intensive lifestyle modification programs can be ""efficacious"" diabetes prevention interventions for adults at high risk for T2D. Through improving dietary behaviors and increasing physical activity (PA), these programs lead to modest weight loss, lowered blood sugar and reduce future risk of T2D. One such trial, the DPP was efficacious - it led to a 58% reduction in diabetes. However, its effectiveness & sustainability in a community setting needs further investigation. Our proposed study is designed to fill this gap. We will implement the Fit Body and soul intervention in AA church congregations. This strategy is consistent with a growing trend to involve community organizations, especially churches, in health promotion. We propose a cluster randomized community trial of AA church participants who are overweight (BMIe25). This builds on our previous research in the AA community, our recent identification of 20 AA churches eager to participate, and on our pilot study results. Aim 1: To assess the effectiveness of a 3-month Fit Body and Soul intervention for those at high risk for T2D. Aim 2: To determine if the Fit Body and Soul intervention is more cost-effective than control arm. Controls will be given currently acceptable and scientifically sound health education programs, derived from the CDC-Community Guide. Both intervention and control programs will be delivered by expert-led church health advisors and supported by church pastors. The primary outcome is weight loss (at least 7% of baseline body weight). Secondary outcomes are increased PA (at least 150 minutes of moderate intensity exercise/ week) improved dietary choices, and reduction in blood sugar (e3mg/dL). Data collection will be done at baseline and 6 & 12 months post-intervention. If the Fit Body and soul intervention is found effective, it would lead to a future effectiveness study that would determine whether this intervention reduces the incidence of T2D and the associated mortality and morbidity. Project Narrative It has been shown that promoting the adoption of healthy lifestyles, ones that involve best practices of diet and exercise and lots of expert support, can, in a healthcare setting, reduce the incidence of type 2 diabetes in those who are at high risk.

"AAS Courses to Increase Women and Minorities in Academic Surgery    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): According to NIH statistics, the number of funded surgical scientists has been steadily decreasing over the last decade as has the number of medical students pursuing surgical training. In addition, there remains disparity in the number of women and minorities in academic medicine; this disparity is even more severe in surgical fields.  The Association for Academic Surgery (AAS) strives to stimulate young surgeons and surgical scientists to pursue careers in academic surgery and support them in establishing themselves as investigators and educators. AAS organizes two courses, the Career Development Course and Fundamentals of Surgical Research Course which aim to better prepare surgeons-in-training as well as junior faculty for successful academic surgery careers. These well established courses offer an excellent venue to encourage more women and minorities to pursue academic surgery careers as well as an opportunity to develop longstanding mentored relationships with the goal of grooming women and minorities to become academic surgery leaders in the years to come.  The specific aims of this conference grant are to: 1) Increase the attendance of women and minorities at the Association for Academic Surgery Career Development Course and Fundamental of Surgical Research Course through the creation of targeted travel awards, 2) Improve collaboration with the Association of Women in Surgery and the Association of Black Academic Surgeons and encourage course attendance by their membership through increased collaborative marketing efforts and reduced registration fees, and 3) Improve likelihood of success for women and minorities in academic surgery careers by establishing mentored relationships with select attendees/speakers and senior members of AAS.        This conference grant proposes to enhance existing courses in career development and fundamentals of surgical research offered by the Association of Academic Surgery with the long-term goal of increasing the number of women and minorities leading successful academic surgery careers. Travel awards, targeted marketing efforts and a mentor program are proposed to increase women and minority attendance and improve the learning experience for these targeted groups.

"Lifestyle Change to Prevent Diabetes via African-American Churches    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our long-term goal is to reduce obesity & type 2 diabetes (T2D). The immediate goal of our proposed study is to reduce diabetes risk factors by promoting the adoption of healthy lifestyles. In this R-18 proposal, we plan to assess the ""effectiveness"" and ""cost-effectiveness"" of a lifestyle intervention, the Fit Body and Soul for African Americans (AAs) through faith-based activities and settings. The Fit Body and Soul uses ""Body and Soul"" study approaches to deliver the lifestyle component of the highly successful clinically based ""Diabetes Prevention Program"" (DPP) which has been modified with group participation. The Fit body and Soul program will be offered in AA churches in partnership with their pastors and church officials along with guidance from experts from both DPP and Body and Soul programs. We will see if the proposed intervention is effective in reducing excess weight, physical inactivity, and elevated blood sugar (risk factors for T2D). We will focus on AAs, a group with more T2D and more T2D risk factors including more pre-diabetes, obesity and physical inactivity. Fortunately, recent clinical trials have shown that intensive lifestyle modification programs can be ""efficacious"" diabetes prevention interventions for adults at high risk for T2D. Through improving dietary behaviors and increasing physical activity (PA), these programs lead to modest weight loss, lowered blood sugar and reduce future risk of T2D. One such trial, the DPP was efficacious - it led to a 58% reduction in diabetes. However, its effectiveness & sustainability in a community setting needs further investigation. Our proposed study is designed to fill this gap. We will implement the Fit Body and soul intervention in AA church congregations. This strategy is consistent with a growing trend to involve community organizations, especially churches, in health promotion. We propose a cluster randomized community trial of AA church participants who are overweight (BMIe25). This builds on our previous research in the AA community, our recent identification of 20 AA churches eager to participate, and on our pilot study results. Aim 1: To assess the effectiveness of a 3-month Fit Body and Soul intervention for those at high risk for T2D. Aim 2: To determine if the Fit Body and Soul intervention is more cost-effective than control arm. Controls will be given currently acceptable and scientifically sound health education programs, derived from the CDC-Community Guide. Both intervention and control programs will be delivered by expert-led church health advisors and supported by church pastors. The primary outcome is weight loss (at least 7% of baseline body weight). Secondary outcomes are increased PA (at least 150 minutes of moderate intensity exercise/ week) improved dietary choices, and reduction in blood sugar (e3mg/dL). Data collection will be done at baseline and 6 & 12 months post-intervention. If the Fit Body and soul intervention is found effective, it would lead to a future effectiveness study that would determine whether this intervention reduces the incidence of T2D and the associated mortality and morbidity. Project Narrative It has been shown that promoting the adoption of healthy lifestyles, ones that involve best practices of diet and exercise and lots of expert support, can, in a healthcare setting, reduce the incidence of type 2 diabetes in those who are at high risk. In the proposed study, we hope to show that the same or similar programs are effective in the community setting (African American communities in our study), outside of the healthcare arena. If successful, our study would provide a scientific basis for a future effectiveness study in which we would determine whether not just risk factors but diabetes itself (and its associated mortality and morbidity) can be reduced with behavioral lifestyle program (Fit Body and Soul) that has been modified for social cultural faith-based settings.

"Behavioral and Social Science Research on Understanding and Reducing Health Dispa    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Numerous studies have documented the existence of marked racial/ethnic disparities in the utilization of joint replacement in the management of osteoarthritis (OA). African-Americans (AA) are about 40 percent less likely than white patients to receive joint replacement for lower extremity OA, and this disparity is enduring based on the latest report from the CDC. Our research team published evidence demonstrating that, compared to similar white patients, AA candidates for joint replacement differ in their preferences for joint replacement and that these differences are primarily shaped by differences in knowledge and understanding about the treatment risks/benefits and expectations about surgical outcomes. Furthermore, doctor-patient communication for preference-sensitive treatments such as joint replacement is bi-directional and the content of the communication and the decisions are influenced by patient's baseline attitudes and preferences as well as their ability to engage in the discussion. There is preliminary evidence that baseline differences in preference, knowledge, and expectations regarding this treatment impact the quality of communication between AA patients and orthopaedic surgeons and consequently reduce AA patients' likelihood of receiving a recommendation for joint replacement. More research is needed to assess specific interventions to help empower AA patients in their communication with orthopaedic surgeons and improve their likelihood of receiving a recommendation for knee replacement when clinically indicated. We propose a randomized controlled trial is to assess the effect of a high-quality, evidence-based, patient-centered educational intervention supplemented with targeted counseling on the quality of communication between AA patients and orthopaedic surgeons and on the likelihood of receiving a recommendation for knee joint replacement when clinically indicated. AA patients who are potential candidates for knee joint replacement who have been referred to orthopaedic surgery will be randomized to undergo either an educational intervention using the Knee OA Decision Aid (DA) supplemented with brief counseling using the Motivational Interviewing (MI) technique or an attention control treatment. We will assess the effect of the intervention on quality of doctor- patient communication and likelihood of receiving a recommendation for knee joint replacement within 6 months of the intervention. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that orthopaedic surgeon-patient communication and decision-making about joint replacement can be improved by better informing the patients using a high quality, evidence-based, patient-centered educational intervention delivered at the time of decision-making. Therefore, the primary specific aims of this proposal are: 1) To examine the effect of the intervention on the AA patient's quality of communication with the orthopaedic surgeon, and 2) To examine the effect of the intervention on the likelihood of receiving a recommendation for knee joint replacement when clinically indicated.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Numerous studies have documented the existence of marked racial/ethnic disparities in the utilization of knee replacement, an effective and highly utilized treatment option for advanced knee osteoarthritis. This study will provide one of the first patient-centered interventions in the orthopedic setting designed to mitigate racial/ethnic disparity in access to joint replacement for patients who meet clinical indications for the treatment. The results of this study will not only inform the nation on strategies to reduce or eliminate one of most marked disparities in chronic disease management, but will also provide opportunities to improve quality of care for large segment of our society.

"Improving Resection Rates among African Americans with NSCLC     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Surgical resection is the standard-of-care for patients with early stage lung cancer, and multiple published studies have shown that improvements in resection rates translate into improvements in overall survival. African Americans (AAs) with early stage, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) are significantly less likely than European Americans (EAs) to undergo resection, even when controlling for age, co-morbidity, tumor stage, socioeconomic status, insurance status, and surgical consultation. This racial disparity is particularly pronounced in South Carolina (SC). Investigators at the National Cancer Institute-designated Medical University of South Carolina Hollings Cancer Center (MUSC HCC) hypothesize that a dynamic, [statewide], patient navigation intervention will reduce potential barriers to surgical cancer care and improve resection rates among AAs with early stage NSCLC. The patient navigation intervention will be tested in a two-arm, cluster- randomized trial comparing the intervention versus [usual care] in a sample of 200 AAs in SC with Stage I or II NSCLC. Study participants will be recruited from six geographically diverse study sites within a [statewide] cancer Clinical Trials Network (CTN) coordinated by MUSC, and participants will be cluster-randomized by CTN site. The investigators will further evaluate the modifying effects of income and urban-rural residence on the relationships between the intervention and the main study outcome (receipt of surgery), as well as [receipt of surgical consultation], time to resection, [time to death (survival)], health-related quality of life, state anxiety, perceived sel-efficacy in patient-physician interaction, trust in physicians, and satisfaction with the treatment decision made. The proposed research is highly significant for many reasons. First, lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death in the United States (US) and SC. Second, less than half of AAs in SC with early stage NSCLC undergo surgical resection, and the median survival of AAs with early stage NSCLC is consistently lower than that of EAs. Third, SC has a large AA population (approximately 30%), has urban as well as large rural geographic areas, and has wide income distributions. A [statewide] patient navigation intervention to enhance access to surgical therapy for AAs with NSCLC could lead to significant improvements in care and reductions in racial disparities in lung cancer outcomes [across wide geographic and socioeconomic strata] in SC, as well as in other communities across the US.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer deaths in the US; however, while surgical resection is the optimal treatment for localized, early stage lung cancer, less than half of the African Americans (AAs) diagnosed with this disease undergo surgical resection. This study will test whether a [statewide] patient navigation intervention improves receipt of surgical resection, [receipt of surgical consultation], reduces time to surgery and [improves survival] in AAs with early stage disease, and it may uncover modifiable root causes underlying underuse of lung cancer surgery among AAs. The patient navigation intervention may prove to be a practical but powerful strategy for use by other health care providers, institutions, and communities seeking to reduce persistent racial disparities in lung cancer surgery and outcomes.              Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer deaths in the US; however, while surgical resection is the optimal treatment for localized, early stage lung cancer, less than half of the African Americans (AAs) diagnosed with this disease undergo surgical resection.

"Factors Affecting Hypertension Treatment Adherence among African Americans    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cardiovascular disease (CVD) kills more Americans every year than any other cause of death and the highest rates of mortality from CVD are in the poorest areas of the country. African- Americans (AAs) have a 4.6-fold higher risk of death from CVD than Whites, largely due to uncontrolled hypertension (HTN) and possibly genetic influences. AAs have lower rates of adherence than Whites to HTN treatment but the reasons for this are unknown. An understanding of AAs' perceptions of adherence to HTN treatment and genetic risk factors could be useful in developing tailored, culturally sensitive interventions to improve adherence to treatments and reduce the devastating complications of CVD. Few studies, however, have focused on AAs' perceptions of adherence to HTN treatment. The objective of this study therefore is to gain a better understanding of poor AAs' perceptions of HTN, adherence to treatment, and facilitators and barriers to treatment. Specific aims are to: 1) examine male and female AAs' perceptions of HTN and the ways in which their perceptions influence adherence decisions, 2) examine the influences of AA culture and family history on HTN adherence decisions, and 3) examine the feasibility of developing a CVD genogram for AAs in primary care. Focused ethnography will be used to examine AAs' perceptions of adherence to treatment for HTN and surrounding issues. Thirty participants (15 of each gender) will be recruited from a clinic that provides free medications in Pulaski County, Arkansas. Information on current medications and clinician recommended lifestyle changes will be obtained from participants' medical records. Demographic data will be obtained as well as a self-reported family history, and individual, semi-structured interviews will be conducted with all participants. Also, a CVD genogram will be developed for each participant. Content analysis and constant comparison will be used to examine issues surrounding HTN, and factors influencing adherence to HTN treatment in AA males and females. This study will provide the foundation for the development of culturally sensitive tailored interventions to reduce CVD in this high-risk group.

"Gender Power and HIV-Related Sexual Risk Behavior in Older African American Women    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Heterosexual transmission of Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) affects older African American (AA) women in epidemic proportions; AIDS is now the fifth leading cause of death among AA women ages 50 and older. Yet, there is a paucity of research and risk reduction interventions that target this vulnerable population. Older urban AA women living in poverty face a disproportionately higher risk of becoming infected with HIV. Although some studies of HIV- related sexual risk have included older AA women in small numbers, the findings of these studies did not address the social normative roles and gender power related factors that may influence condom use intentions. Older AA women's ability to effectively negotiate condom use maybe influenced by their sexual risk behaviors and protective strategies including perceptions, attitudes, and beliefs about condoms as well as by their power beliefs in their sexual relationships. Most HIV research and public health interventions target white women and younger AA women. Thus, our understanding of the influences of HIV sexual risk among older AA women is limited. The proposed prospective quantitative study seeks to examine factors that influence older urban AA women's HIV-related sexual risk and protective behaviors, including condom use. The aims for the proposed study are to: (1) prospectively examine the influence of HIV-related behavioral beliefs, normative beliefs, control beliefs, relationship factors and relationship power with condom use intentions at 3-month follow-up among older urban AA women; and (2) prospectively examine the influence of HIV-related behavioral beliefs, normative beliefs, control beliefs, relationship factors and relationship power with condom use frequency at 3-month follow-up among older urban AA women. A sample of 228 AA women over age 50 will be recruited from community health centers in the Brooklyn and Queens boroughs of New York City and asked to complete questionnaires at baseline and 3-month follow-up. These sites provide care for a large number of patients from culturally diverse and medically underserved populations. Participants will be questioned regarding their demographic background, employment, SES, condom use and sexual risk-related beliefs and attitudes, relationships and relationship power, and their intentions and actual use of condoms. Multiple logistic regression and/or relative risk techniques will be used to analyze the data. The findings of the study will inform the development of theory-based, age- and culture-specific HIV risk reduction interventions for older urban AA women.        Older African American women face a disproportionately high risk for becoming infected with HIV. However, our understanding of the influences of HIV sexual risk among older African American women is very limited as most HIV prevention research and interventions have targeted younger women. The proposed quantitative study seeks to address this gap in the literature by prospectively examining the influence of individual factors (beliefs and attitudes) and socio-cultural factors (gender/relationship power) on older urban African American women's condom use intentions and behaviors.

"Technology Intensified Diabetes Education Study in AA with T2DM (TIDES)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposed K24 application is designed to support the career and research trajectory of the candidate by providing protected time to conduct patient-oriented research on interventions to reduce complications and deaths from diabetes in ethnic minority groups and mentor the next generation of women and minority clinical investigators in health disparities research. The specific aims of the proposed K24 application will be accomplished by completing the following three objectives: Mentoring Objective: To increase the pool of clinical researchers who can conduct patient-oriented research and successfully compete for peer-reviewed grants, as well as mentor the next generation of women and minority clinical investigators, who are engaged in the national effort to reduce and eliminate health care disparities. This will be accomplished by mentoring 2 women/minority investigators each year for 5 years. Career Development Objective: To obtain additional training in clinical trials methodology, comparative effectiveness research and community-based participatory research, that would greatly enhance the candidate's research capability and make him a more effective mentor to trainees in clinical research. This will be accomplished by taking 2 courses a year in advanced statistics, decision analysis, informatics, bioethics, responsible conduct of research, and health economics. Research Objective: The primary objective is to test the efficacy of a technology-intensified diabetes education/skills training (TIDES) intervention using the FORA 2-in-1 Telehealth System for diabetes in improving HbA1c levels in AAs with poorly controlled T2DM. The secondary objectives are to test the efficacy of a technology-intensified diabetes education/skills training (TIDES) intervention using the FORA 2-in-1 and Telehealth System for diabetes in improving BP control and quality of life in AAs with poorly controlled T2DM. Exploratory analyses will examine improvements in self-care behaviors (i.e. diet, physical activity, self glucose monitoring, and medication adherence) and the role of self-care as mediators of metabolic control.     Mentorship is an important component of career advancement in academic medicine. Several studies have established that lack of mentoring is a reason for poor career advancement and attrition, particularly among women and minority faculty. The candidate who has a track record of mentoring women and minority faculty would benefit from the protected time for mentoring afforded by the proposed K24 award, while allowing continued research to eliminate disparities in diabetes. The proposed K24 application is designed to support the career and research trajectory of the candidate by providing protected time to conduct patient-oriented research on interventions to reduce complications and deaths from diabetes in ethnic minority groups and mentor the next generation of women and minority clinical investigators in health disparities research.

"Culture, Social Support & Quality of Life: Asian American Breast Cancer Survivors DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Little is known about the impact of health related quality of life on the well being of Asian American (AA) breast cancer survivors. This five-year mixed-methods study entitled: ""Culture, Support and Quality of Life: Asian American Breast Cancer Survivors"", proposes to identify and define how culture may modify the definitions of self-integrity and quality of life (QOL) for Asian American (AA) breast cancer (BC) survivors. Each culture defines self-esteem and the proper behavior required to achieve a positive sense of self for its members, and these definitions vary. Differing cultural definitions might explain why few ethnic minorities, like AAs, use mainstream survivorship services. AABC survivors have been reported to suffer significant emotional and social problems, but European American (EA) based mainstream designed services do not seem to adequately meet their needs. Two major barriers may hinder more effective interventions. First, dissonance between the beliefs and values upon which these mainstream services are based and AA constructions of self esteem and rules for relationships may reduce the acceptability of mainstream services. For example, most mainstream services emphasize the integrity of individuality and personhood, and accordingly, address the women alone. Yet, AA culture identifies the family as the unit of analysis, not the individual. This study proposes to utilize a more holistic operationalization of culture as a concept that could establish a new avenue of research to move the science of health disparities research forward. Identification of the salient unmet cultural needs of AA women would potentially expand Western based theories of positive survivorship and provide directions to develop more culturally relevant support services to improve their QOL. Second, no consensus exists on what actually comprises the construct of culture. This study proposes to develop a more holistic conceptual framework. Therefore, our four study aims are to: 1) Characterize how women in each of the four ethnic groups define self-integrity and well-being, 2) Identify if and how ethnic specific support services address the culturally formed expectations of integrity and well-being of AA BC survivors, and how this may differ by ethnic group, 3) Explore how the breast cancer experience impacts family members, and 4) Identify the impact of the cancer experience on the women's quality of life, and if it differs by ethnicity. In-depth ethnographic interviews will be conducted with 180 BC survivors and 96 family members for all 4 Aims. We will also survey 800 BC survivors (200 from each ethnic group), and triangulate the quantitative and qualitative findings to increase the validity of our results. We will use CBPR to collaborate with our community partners, Northern and Southern CA and Houston, TX to conduct the study. The 3 sites will enable us to also assess geographic and within group cultural variations. the quantitative and qualitative findings to increase the validity of our results. We will use CBPR to collaborate with our community partners Northern and Southern CA and Houston, TX to conduct the study. The 3 sites will enable us to also assess geographic and within group variations on cultural beliefs and patterns. The outcomes of this study are likely to inform both the science and practice of survivorship in the Asian American community in particular, and among diverse ethnic populations as well, by illuminating the culturally constructed modes and outcomes for managing the cancer experience. The findings are anticipated to provide direction to better meet the needs of cancer survivors and contribute the to the elimination of health disparities. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Little attention has been paid to the growing cancer control needs of Asian Americans (AAs), the ethnic group with the fastest growing rate of all ethnic groups in the U.S., and will double in size to 25 million by 2050. AA also are experiencing the fast increase in new cancer cases of all ethnic groups. The cancer incidence rate for AAs isis predicted to increase by 132 percent among this diverse population compared with 31 percent for non-Hispanic whites. Currenlty, unlike all other ethnicities, cancer is the number one cause of death for AA men and women. Notably, several AA subgroups currently show rates of cancer, including breast cancer (BC), that are higher than or equal to non-Hispanic white women. For some groups, a greater proportion of women with breast cancer are living through and beyond cancer. Studies show, however, that AABC survivors experience emotional and physical needs that are largely unmet, and despite the growing need and the unnecessary suffering borne by this community, too few studies have been conducted on the needs of AA cancer survivors. Of the 362,238 studies found in a Pub-Med search on cancer survivorship or social support, we found only 65 studies published between 1966 and 2010 that investigate the needs of AAs. Moreover, few support services exist to address the needs of AA cancer survivors in the entire nation. Evaluation of the impact of cancer on the social support needs of AA cancer survivors and their families, and in particular, the health related quality of life (HRQOL) of AA cancer survivorship, remains essentially unexamined. Thus, this is the first study to explore cultural explanations for the cross-cultural differences found in quality of life studies among Asian and Asian American populations compared with Western countries. Our study proposes to investigate both between and within group differences among three Asian-American (AA) subgroups (Chinese-American, Japanese-American, and Vietnamese-American) and a comparison group of European-American (EA) breast cancer (BC) survivors. The majority of studies in cancer survivorship have assumed a universality of the assumptions of positive coping strategies and goals. The differences in the performance of standardized scales noted among Asian Americans have not been explained. Relevance: The paucity of support groups and resources that are culturally salient for the growing number of AAs suffering with cancer makes a compelling public health argument for this innovative, mixed-paradigm and mixed-method study. Moreover, this study will forge a new path to evaluate the validity of the assumptions regarding the universality of Western European-American based values of individualism and autonomy that underlie the types of mainstream support services, and identify how, beyond Asian-language concordance, ethnic specific AA support groups assist their members along the survivorship journey through more familial based values and strategies. Investigation of these two areas would potentially expand the theoretical framework currently applied in HRQOL work with culturally-based modifications that are used in AABC support services so that other AA as well as mainstream health service professionals could better meet the needs of this rapidly growing population of AA cancer survivors and their families. This new path would also more accurately and effectively operationalize culture as a concept and construct to identify more relevant aspects of cultural differences that could move the science of health disparities research forward. We also utilize the strength of the community based participatory research approach to promote the validity of the findings to include the reality of the community.","Culture, Social Support & Quality of Life: Asian American Breast Cancer Survivors",8261084,R01CA158314,"['Asian Americans ', ' Attention ', ' Dorsum ', ' Back ', ' Behavior ', ' Belief ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cause of Death ', ' youngster ', ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Chinese American ', ' Communities ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Family ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' health care service ', ' Health Services ', ' Incidence ', ' Individuality ', ' Interview ', ' Japanese American ', ' Language ', ' achievement Mainstream Education ', ' Mainstreaming ', ' Educational Mainstreaming ', ' Mainstreaming (Education) ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Methods ', ' Perception ', ' well-being ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Publishing ', ' QOL ', ' Quality of life ', ' Research ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Science ', ' self esteem ', ' self help organization ', ' Self-Help Groups ', ' Support Groups ', ' Social Interaction ', ' social disturbance ', ' Social Problems ', ' social support network ', ' Social support ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' survivorship ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' oriental ', ' Asians ', ' Friends ', ' Measures ', ' Family member ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' diverse populations ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' ethnographic ', ' Ethnography ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Survivors ', ' Individual ', ' European ', ' Personhood ', ' satisfaction ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Immigrant ', ' tool ', ' sadness ', ' depressed ', ' Depressed mood ', ' Consensus ', ' Life ', ' Investigation ', ' Home ', ' Home environment ', ' Pattern ', ' Country ', ' Outcome Study ', ' meetings ', ' Services ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' expectation ', ' member ', ' Adult Sons ', ' Adult Offspring ', ' Adult Daughters ', ' Adult Children ', ' cultural values ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' Emotional ', ' Modeling ', ' stigma ', ' social stigma ', ' theories ', ' cancer diagnosis ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Subgroup ', ' Cancer Control Science ', ' Cancer Control ', ' Cancer Survivor ', ' Cancer Survivorship ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' SF-36 ', ' Modification ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' comparison group ', ' forging ', ' health related quality of life ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' coping ', ' Population ', ' Impact evaluation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' ethnic minority ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' community based participatory research ', ' emotional experience ', ' effective intervention ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R01,2012,410161,0.02019502360684519
"Social Context and Inflammatory Risk for Stroke in African American Women     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Despite declines in age-adjusted cardiovascular (CVD) mortality, the incidence of coronary heart disease (CHD)/ stroke is almost twice as high in African American (AA) women compared to non-Hispanic White (NHW) women. The additional burden of CHD/stroke disease borne by AA women is attributed to factors such as socioeconomic status, psychosocial stress, and greater number of risk factors. Economically disadvantaged AA women experience higher levels of chronic stress than NHW women. Yet, little is known about how prior life adversity, such as childhood maltreatment, chronic/perceived stress, perceived discrimination, subjective socio-economic status (SSS), and socioeconomic status (SES) contribute to the disparity in CHD/stroke disease between AA and NHW women. Further, proinflammatory processes are known to contribute to CHD/stroke and compelling evidence demonstrates that adverse prior life experiences result in epigenetic alterations (i.e., changes in DNA methylation), which, in turn, increase stress reactivity and proinflammatory cytokine production. The purpose of this three-year mentored research development application is to provide the necessary training and experience to allow for an independent career in which the psychosocial and proinflammatory mechanisms that underlie CHD/stroke disease disparities can be identified. The training objectives are to: (1) Expand knowledge of the relationships among prior life adversity, proinflammatory stress response, and global DNA methylation status in relation to CHD/stroke disease disparities; (2) Acquire new knowledge and research skills in study design, recruitment, data collection, and interpretation of data as it relates to prior life adversity, proinflammatory stress response, and global DNA methylation in minority women at risk for CHD/stroke; (3) Obtain hands-on training and gain knowledge in the laboratory analysis and interpretation of salivary cortisol, proinflammatory cytokines, and global DNA methylation; and (4) Develop advanced statistical expertise in modeling. To accomplish these objectives and provide a foundation for a sustained research career, the candidate will conduct a study comparing 46 AA and 46 NHW at risk for CHD/stroke in order to (1) Determine the extent to which prior life adversity contributes to CHD/stroke risk and the proinflammatory response (IL-6) to acute stress in AA compared to NHW women at risk for CHD/stroke, (2) Determine the degree to which prior life adversity predicts global DNA methylation status in AA and NHW women at risk for CHD/stroke, and (3) Evaluate global DNA methylation status as a predictor of the proinflammatory response (IL-6) to acute stress in AA and NHW women at risk for CHD/stroke. The significance of this study lies in its potential to clarify mechanisms of CHD/stroke disease susceptibility and to determine the possible basis for the health disparity exhibited by disadvantaged, minority women. Findings will inform the development of novel risk profiles to identify those at most risk for CHD/stroke burden.          PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: African American women suffer twice as many ischemic cardiac events and strokes as do non-Hispanic White women. Prior life adversity is linked to increased proinflammatory risk and may contribute to CHD/stroke disease disparities. It is expected that findings from this study will inform the development of novel risk profiles for CHD/stroke and lead to earlier identification and targeting of interventions to reduce disease burden.              African American women suffer twice as many ischemic cardiac events and strokes as do non-Hispanic White women.

"Prosaposin: A Novel Biomarker of Prostate Cancer Progression in African Americans  Prostate cancer (PCa), the second leading cause of cancer-related death in US men, presents the greatest racial disparity of any malignant disease in African Americans, with a 1.6-1.9 times higher incidence rate and 2- 3 times higher mortality rate than Caucasians. PCa in African Americans presents with more advanced clinical stages and aggressive tumors. PCa biomarkers are needed to improve early detection of clinically significant tumors and to distinguish indolent or slow growing tumors from more aggressive ones. In our search for tumor markers, we cloned prosaposin (PSAP) as a secreted protein and discovered its overexpression in metastatic PCa cells and tissues. Previously, we demonstrated that PSAP and/or its active molecular derivatives increase migration and invasion and upregulate matrix-degrading proteolytic enzymes expression in PCa cells. In Caucasians, serum-PSAP levels are increased in metastatic PCa when compared to primary PCa or normal prostate tissues. In addition, there was no difference in serum-PSAP levels between organ-confined and locally-invasive tumors. In contrast to Caucasians, our pilot study in African Americans shows that a) tissue expression of PSAP is significantly higher in undifferentiated tumors with Gleason grade 4/5 pattern than in the differentiated tumors with Gleason grade d 3 or benign glands (BPH) and b) serum-PSAP levels are higher in locally invasive (stage III/IV) tumors than in the organ-confined (stage I/II) tumors which positively correlates with disease progression. Based on these observations, we hypothesized that PSAP contributes to PCa progression and has the characteristics of a novel biomarker discriminating the aggressive tumors from non- aggressive ones in African American patients. To test our hypothesis, we propose the following Aims: 1) Define the clinical significance of serum-PSAP as a marker of PCa progression or aggressiveness in African Americans; 2) Determine the association between tissue expression of PSAP and clinical and histopathological predictors or prognosticators of PCa progression or aggressiveness in African Americans; and 3) Determine the association between PSAP and invasive and metastatic phenotypes in PSAP-overexpressed or -silenced African American PCa cells. We will use immunohistochemical analysis and sandwich-ELISA assays to quantify PSAP expression levels in a large pool of tissue and serum samples and to determine their association with clinicohistopathological predictors or prognosticators of PCa aggressiveness and progression in African Americans. We will also test the effect of increased or decreased PSAP expression on tumor growth rate and spontaneous metastatic ability in subcutaneous and orthotopic tumor xenografts in African American- derived PCa cells. At the conclusion of this proposal, we will have defined the clinical and histopathological significance of PSAP as a biomarker of PCa progression and/or aggressiveness in African Americans that could be further utilized in clinical development.  The incidences, mortality, and aggressiveness of prostate cancer (PCa) in African American (AA) men are higher than in Caucasians. To improve early detection of clinically significant tumors and to discriminate indolent or slow growing tumors from more aggressive ones, reliable prognostic factors or biomarkers are needed. An in-depth investigation of our preliminary discovery of a high expression of prosaposin (PSAP) levels in locally invasive and/or metastatic PCa cells, tissues, and serum samples from AA men would provide us with the clinical and histopathological values of this molecule as a biomarker for PCa screenings, diagnoses, or post-treatment follow up in AAs.",Prosaposin: A Novel Biomarker of Prostate Cancer Progression in African Americans,8288659,R01MD005824,"['Affect ', ' post treatment ', ' After-Treatment ', ' After Care ', ' Aftercare ', ' Age ', ' Behavior ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Biological Assay ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' white race ', ' Occidental ', ' Caucasoid ', ' Caucasian Race ', ' Caucasian ', ' Caucasoid Race ', ' cultured cell line ', ' Strains Cell Lines ', ' CellLine ', ' Cell Line ', ' Motility ', ' Cellular Motility ', ' Cellular Migration ', ' Cell Movement ', ' Cell Migration ', ' Cell Locomotion ', ' cell motility ', ' Cell Viability ', ' Cell Survival ', ' Cells ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Diagnosis ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' ELISA ', ' Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay ', ' ECM ', ' Cell-Extracellular Matrix ', ' Extracellular Matrix ', ' healthcare service availability ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare access availability ', ' health services availability ', ' health care service availability ', ' health care service access ', ' health care availability ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Availability of Health Services ', ' Accessibility of health care ', ' Access to Healthcare ', ' Access to Health Care ', ' Access to Care ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' In Vitro ', ' Incidence ', ' Laboratories ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Athymic Nude Mouse ', ' Athymic Mice ', ' Nude Mice ', ' Mortality ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' tumor cell metastasis ', ' cancer metastasis ', ' Tumor Cell Migration ', ' Secondary Tumor ', ' Secondary Neoplasm ', ' Metastatic Tumor ', ' Metastatic Neoplasm ', ' Metastasize ', ' Metastasis ', ' Neoplasm Metastasis ', ' Patients ', ' Proteolytic Enzymes ', ' Proteinases ', ' Proteases ', ' Peptidases ', ' Esteroproteases ', ' Peptide Hydrolases ', ' Phenotype ', ' pilot study ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' Prostatic Gland ', ' Prostate Gland ', ' Prostate ', ' gene product ', ' Proteins ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Stains ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Tissues ', ' TM-MKR ', ' Tumor Markers ', ' Caucasians ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' base ', ' Organ ', ' neoplastic progression ', ' neoplasm progression ', ' cancer progression ', ' tumor progression ', ' improved ', ' Prostatovesiculectomy ', ' Radical Prostatectomy ', ' Benign ', ' Clinical ', ' Malignant ', ' Malignant -

"A Follow-up Study for Causes of Cancer in Black Women     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Black Women's Health Study (BWHS), the largest follow-up study for cancer in African American (AA) women, began in 1995 when 59,000 women (median age, 38) from across the U.S. enrolled. The BWHS has successfully followed participants with biennial questionnaires for data on incident disease and medical, reproductive, behavioral, psychosocial, and socioeconomic factors, linked addresses to U.S. census data, and are currently linking to air pollution data. Cancer diagnoses are validated by pathology data from hospitals and cancer registries. A DNA bio repository was established through collection of cheek cell samples from 26,800 participants. Despite initial slow accrual of cancers due to the young age of participants at entry, the BWHS has published extensively on risk factors for breast cancer; sufficient cases of lung cancer, colorectal cancer, and colon adenomas are now available. We propose to (1) continue follow-up/data collection; (2) establish a repository of 17,800 blood samples; (3) share data/samples in consortia projects. Continuation of the BWHS is highly desirable: 90% of participants are still cancer-free; follow-up has been successful and unbiased; the cohort has reached ages at which cancer incidence increases markedly; effects of exposures (e.g., severe obesity, racism) that are less common in other populations can be studied; the DNA has made valuable contributions to genetic cancer studies and is a major replication source for studies of breast cancer and related phenotypes in AA and other groups; the BWHS is a key contributor to consortia projects of rarer cancers in /\As; and the BWHS has been highly productive. Because levels of many blood markers are unfavorable among AAs and few studies of blood biomarkers in relation to cancer incidence have been carried out specifically in /\As, we propose to establish a repository of blood samples in the BWHS. A successful pilot study demonstrated the feasibility of our methods and participation was unbiased and similar to that in other large follow-up studies. The repository will increase by 60% the limited number of AA women with available blood samples being followed in U.S. cancer cohort studies. AA women continue to be disproportionately affected by many cancers. Continuation of the BWHS will permit continuation of its valuable contributions to understanding cancer etiology in this understudied group. A blood repository will greatly increase the value of the BWHS resource by permitting studies that help to fill the knowledge gap about the relation of biomarkers to cancer incidence and survival in AAs. The assessment of serious nonmalignant illnesses in the BWHS enhances the value of this resource at no cost to the study of cancer.              Incidence and mortality rates of many cancers and other illnesses confinue to be disproportionately high  among AA women. The Black Women's Health Study, a follow-up study of 59,000 AA women, has  contributed important information on risk factors for cancer. Continued follow-up, the collection of blood  samples, and participation of the BWHS in collaborafive studies, including studies of rare cancers, will  produce valuable informafion on risk factors for cancers and other illnesses that burden AA women.",A Follow-up Study for Causes of Cancer in Black Women,8383511,UM1CA164974,"['abstracting ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' Air Pollution ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Blood ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Cells ', ' Censuses ', ' Cheek ', ' Bucca ', ' Cheek structure ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Collection ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' DNA ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Genotype ', ' Health ', ' Hospitals ', ' Incidence ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Income ', ' Laboratories ', ' Mails ', ' Medical Records ', ' Methods ', ' Mortality ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Newsletter ', ' extreme obesity ', ' Severe obesity ', ' Morbid Obesity ', ' web based ', ' online computer ', ' On-Line Systems ', ' Online Systems ', ' Pathology ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' pilot study ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' Publishing ', ' Quality Control ', ' Questionnaires ', ' Research ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Ships ', ' Socioeconomic Factors ', ' Woman ', ' Female Health ', "" Women's Health "", ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' Nonrespondent ', ' Blood Sample ', ' Blood specimen ', ' Specified ', ' Specific qualifier value ', ' Medical ', ' racism ', ' Link ', ' lung cancer ', ' Pulmonary malignant Neoplasm ', ' Pulmonary Cancer ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Lung ', ' Malignant neoplasm of lung ', ' Funding ', ' Collaborations ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Knowledge ', ' Scanning ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Source ', ' psychosocial ', ' Services ', ' success ', ' cohort ', ' Manuscripts ', ' Participant ', ' payment ', ' cancer genetics ', ' reproductive ', ' cancer registry ', ' neoplasm registry ', ' inherited factor ', ' genetic risk factor ', ' colon adenomatous polyp ', ' colon adenoma ', ' Colonic Adenomatous Polyp ', ' Colonic Adenoma ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' repository ', ' cancer diagnosis ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Large Intestine Adenoma ', ' Large Bowel Adenomatous Polyp ', ' Large Bowel Adenoma ', ' Colorectal Adenomatous Polyp ', ' Colorectal Adenoma ', ' Address ', ' Aliquot ', ' Breast Cancer Risk Factor ', ' Consent ', ' Data ', ' Cancer Cause ', ' Cancer Etiology ', ' Collection ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' nonmalignant ', ' Non-Malignant ', "" Nurses' Health Study "", ' Preparation ', ' Process ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' Shipping ', ' Colorectal Cancer ', ' Behavioral ', ' cost ', ' years of life lost to disease ', ' years of life lost to disability ', ' disease burden ', ' burden of disease ', ' burden of illness ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' twenty-one year old ', ' age 21 years ', ' age 21 ', ' 21 year old ', ' biomarker ', ' nongenetic ', ' non-genetic ', ' biorepository ', ' biobank ', ' sharing data ', ' ']",NCI,BOSTON UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CAMPUS,UM1,2012,2574349,0.10153798357887506
"IBD Gene Mapping by Clinical and Population Subset     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) are complex genetic disorders of the gastrointestinal tract, and a major health burden to patients and society. Tremendous progress has been made in dissecting IBD genetic etiology with identification of over 100 IBD loci by genome wide association studies (GWAS) but mainly limited to persons of European ancestry. The IBD Genetics Consortium (IBDGC) was established to facilitate multicenter collaborative studies of 6 Genetics Research Centers (GRCs) organized with a Data Coordinating Center (DCC). Our GRC at Johns Hopkins (JHGRC) has contributed to all IBDGC studies, led the largest genome wide linkage study in IBD and has led the IBDGC in a focus on African American (AA) IBD genetics (recruiting 88% of study subjects). We published the first large clinical characterization of AA IBD, serological associations of AA CD, clinical disparity studies, and most recently evaluation of admixture in AA CD, NOD2 the other four most well characterized CD genetic loci. More research in AA IBD is needed to understand the etiology of IBD in this ancestrally distinct, major American population, and also because diverse allelic and haplotype structure, and potential for unique functional variants will yield benefits for all populations. Additionally, a major challenge, especially for non- coding associations, is to know which SNPs are causative vs. those in linkage disequilibrium. Comparing association patterns across populations and evaluating function of associated SNPs that map to potential transcription factor (TF) sites active in IBD related cells will be beneficial. Our Aims in the next funding period are to (1) facilitate more comprehensive IBD gene discovery and evaluation in the AA population, and (2) to characterize the epigenome relevant to IBD and evaluate the most provocative non-coding SNPs across populations that map to potential TF binding sites for alterning genomic function. For the first Aim, we have enlarged our recruitment to12 satellite recruitment centers and will recruit 1000 AA IBD cases (with potential of 2600 cases) over the next five years. Immunochip IBD genotyping in AA's and a first stage AA CD GWAS IBD are underway, with facilitation of a 2nd stage ancillary R01 AA CD GWAS with Emory University planned for Year 3. We will perform an IBDGC AA UC GWAS of 1000 cases in year 4. We will compare IBD associations across ethnic groups to define most consistent non-coding SNPs. For Aim 2, we've assembled a team to help us characterize IBD relevant epigenomic annotation. We will purify immune cells from resected colon of patients, perform ChIP-Seq, and evaluate SNPs that map to TF binding sites using in-vitro enhancer assays in transfected cell lines. We will play a major role in all IBDGC activities, with our team of genetic statistical, genomic, immunology, and microbiome co-investigators, by our ability to obtain biological materials (including blood, biopsy, resection, and stool) and to recall patients for re-sampling, and by working cooperatively to maximize productivity of the IBDGC and its GRCs and DCC.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: According to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention, an estimated 1.4 million Americans suffer from Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD), a chronic debilitating disorder with no cure that includes Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis.

"Health Literacy and Cancer Screening Disparities in Asian American Populations     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cancer is the leading cause of death among Asian Americans (AA), yet screening rates for breast, colorectal, and cervical cancer are lower for AA than for many other racial/ethnic groups. Adult health literacy (HL), defined in Healthy People 2010 as the ""the degree to which individuals have the capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services for appropriate health decisions"" is an established correlate to cancer screening that is not well studied in AA. Understanding the relationship of HL to cancer screening in AA is particularly important due to the high prevalence of limited English proficiency (LEP) in many AA populations. LEP is associated with less cancer screening in AA, and may contribute to and exacerbate the consequences of low HL in AA. Contextual factors, such as screening facility availability and neighborhood ethnic density, are also associated with health behaviors. Contextual factors are understudied in HL research, but may impact the relationship of individual HL to cancer screening, especially in AA with LEP. Currently, our core knowledge base: 1) lacks population-based rates of, and individual and contextual-level correlates to, cancer screening by HL for AA overall and within diverse AA subpopulations; 2) has not established if low HL explains health disparities among AA as it does in other populations; and 3) has not specified the interaction of HL with individual or contextual-level linguistic access variables. This R03 will use the Behavioral Model of Health Services Utilization as a conceptual guide to fill in these critical knowledge gaps through a secondary data analysis of the 2007 California Health Interview Survey (CHIS), a population-based study with rich data on AA populations, merged with contextual-level data from Census and CMS at the policy-relevant level of the Medical Service Study Area. Specifically we will: (1) Determine if breast, cervical, and colon cancer screening rates differ by HL in AA generally and in AA subpopulations when relevant individual and contextual-level factors are considered; (2) Test if HL explains cancer screening disparities a) for AA compared to non-Hispanic whites, and b) within AA subpopulations; and (3) Quantify the interaction of HL with individual LEP as well as contextual linguistic access variables (doctor- patient language concordance, community LEP, AA ethnic density) for cancer screening in AA. This study is an important addition to, and a novel synthesis of, four emerging streams of research with distinct implications for improving cancer morbidity/mortality and reducing health disparities: 1) the role of HL in explaining health disparities; 2) the importance of LEP to health and health care access; 3) variation in cancer correlates and outcomes in AA subpopulations, and 4) contextual/individual-level interactions in health. We address the stated NCI/NIH goals of improving HL, reducing cancer screening disparities, and gaining detailed portraits of AA subpopulations using a novel combination of NCI-funded data. This study also provides key background for our future research to reduce cancer incidence, mortality, and health disparities among AA. 1      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Cancer is the leading cause of death among Asian Americans (AA), yet screening rates for breast, colorectal, and cervical cancer are lower for AA than for many other racial/ethnic groups.

"An Integrated HIV Prevention Model for African American Mothers and Daughters    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Disproportionate rates of mental illness and HIV/AIDS/STIs among African Americans (AA), especially females, reflect significant health disparities. AA women accounted for 66% of new AIDS cases among women in 2006, and AA girls account for 64% of new HIV infections among youth. Mental health is linked to HIV-risk in important ways, yet few families- based, gender-specific, Afrocentric programs address mental health and HIV. Simultaneously targeting multiple levels in an integrated approach - the mother-daughter dyad, women, and girls - addresses HIV in the broader social context and capitalizes on the reciprocal impact of mothers and daughters, facilitating mutual reinforcement of HIV prevention attitudes and behavior, and thereby reducing intervention decay and sustaining positive outcomes over protracted time periods. IMARA (Informed, Motivated, Aware, and Responsible about AIDS) is a culturally-tailored, gender-specific, individual PLUS family-based HIV prevention program designed for two high risk groups -- AA women and AA girls. Based on the Theory of Gender and Power and the Social-Personal Framework, IMARA blends SISTA for women, SiHLE for girls, and a highly promising (Project STYLE) family-based program for teens in psychiatric care to simultaneously reduce women's and girls' risky sexual behavior and delay girls' sexual debut. IMARA incorporates components of Project STYLE that are specific to families and teens in psychiatric care (affect management, conflict resolution, parental monitoring, parent-teen communication) with aspects of SISTA and SiHLE that address gender, power, and ethnic pride. Pilot testing (N=22 mother-daughter dyads) supported IMARA's feasibility, tolerability, and acceptability, and despite the small sample size, outcome data indicate promising trends and changes in targeted mediators (increased parental monitoring, more open mother-daughter communication, greater intentions to use condoms, more relationship power) and sexual risk (increased condom use, fewer partners) separately for mothers and daughters from baseline to 2-month follow up. This study proposes a 2-arm RCT to test and compare the efficacy of IMARA to a health promotion control group in reducing risky sexual behavior among 300 women and their 14 - 18 year old AA daughters in psychiatric care. Mothers and daughters will complete baseline, 6-, and 12-month follow-up assessments. We will use an intent-to-treat analysis and a combination of SEM procedures, regression techniques, and other inferential statistical tests for contrasting means and proportions. We will analyze treatment outcomes using logistic and linear multiple regression models examining effects at 6- and 12- months separately, as well as a combined model with random effects for repeated measurements across time. This proposal answers a compelling need for innovative prevention programs that address the intersecting health disparities of mental illness and HIV/AIDS/STIs among African American girls and women. Effective family-based programs can alter negative developmental trajectories of this very high-risk population and begin to redress existing health disparities.        African Americans (AA) account for more HIV/AIDS cases, people living with HIV/AIDS, and HIV-related deaths than any other racial group in the United States.1, 2 In 2004, AA women accounted for the largest proportion (66%) of new AIDS cases among women in 2006,3-5 and in 2005, AA youth ages 13 - 19 accounted for 69% of new AIDS cases.3 AAs also experience significant mental health disparities,6, 7 and mental illness exacerbates risk for HIV among adults8, 9 and youth.10 Teens in psychiatric care engage in the same HIV-risk behaviors as their school age peers but at higher rates.11-13 The diversity of risk factors associated with these trends is complex, multi-level, and go beyond an individual woman or girl, yet few family-based, gender-specific, Afrocentric programs exist to address their needs. Simultaneously targeting multiple levels in an integrated program -- the mother-daughter dyad, women, and girls -- capitalizes on the reciprocal impact of mothers and daughters, and facilitates mutual reinforcement of HIV prevention attitudes and behavior, thereby reducing intervention decay and sustaining positive outcomes over time. The long-term goal of the study is to reduce health disparities in HIV/AIDS/STIs and mental health among African American women and girls by improving healthy sexual decision-making, empowering mothers to become effective role models, strengthening mother-daughter communication and emotion regulation skills, and building stronger mother-daughter relationships that sustain behavior change.

"Decreased Fat Oxidation - Metabolic Inflexibility in African-American Women    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Mechanisms responsible for the racial disparity in obesity and Type 2 diabetes (T2DM) that are particularly apparent in African-American (AA) women compared to Caucasian women are not understood. While factors such as socioeconomic status and dietary habits likely play a role, emerging data suggests that differences in substrate utilization may contribute to these disparities. Evidence suggests that AA women are metabolically inflexible after an overnight fast, during exercise, or during high fat feeding, and do not increase fat oxidation to levels observed in Caucasian women. Low fat oxidation could result in redirection of lipid into adipose tissue for storage, as well as increased storage of triglyceride and lipotoxic metabolites within skeletal muscle, leading to insulin resistance (IR) and increased risk for development of diabetes. Greater insulin resistance is observed in AA women. These observations in AA compared to Caucasian women are similar to the metabolic inflexibility observed in obese insulin resistant compared to lean individuals. While AA women demonstrate IR, they have lower levels of visceral and hepatic lipid accumulation. This is a paradoxical finding as visceral and hepatic lipid stores are strong risk factors for IR and metabolic diseases. Taken together, the data suggests that IR is phenotypically distinct in AA compared to Caucasian women, and that the lower insulin sensitivity may be due differences in skeletal muscle, leading to peripheral IR. However, we could find no reports comparing hepatic and peripheral insulin sensitivity, and very limited data in AA women for skeletal muscle characteristics that have been demonstrated to be related to insulin resistance in obese and T2DM subjects. Limited data supports a role for increased muscle lipid accumulation in skeletal muscle and insulin resistance in AA women, but we could find no data on lipotoxic lipid levels or mitochondrial content in AA women. Based on these observations, our hypothesis is that inherent differences in skeletal muscle in AA women results in impaired fat oxidation and accumulation of lipid and lipid metabolites within skeletal muscle, and is a link between the development of obesity, insulin resistance and Type 2 diabetes in AA women.  To address this hypothesis we have developed 3 Aims: 1) Determine fat oxidation during sub-maximal exercise in AA and Caucasian women; 2) Determine lipid accumulation and skeletal muscle characteristics (e.g. muscle fiber type, capillary density, oxidative capacity, mitochondrial content) that have been shown to be related to insulin sensitivity; and 3) Assess insulin sensitivity (peripheral and hepatic), and examine the relationship between insulin sensitivity, fat oxidation and skeletal muscle characteristics. Before we can begin to tease apart environmental and genetic factors that play a role in racial differences in fat oxidation and insulin sensitivity, we need to gain a better understanding of the underlying physiology. The detailed in vivo and ex vivo evaluations we propose using state of the art techniques will provide detailed phenotype information that will provide valuable insight into the increased prevalence of Type II diabetes observed in AA women.        The likelihood of being obese or having diabetes is twice as high in African-American women compared to Caucasian women. Reasons for these health disparities are not understood, but growing evidence suggests that lower fat oxidation in AA women leads to accumulation of fat within skeletal muscle which can lead to the development of insulin resistance and diabetes. Before we can begin to understand the environmental and genetic factors that play a role in racial differences in obesity and diabetes, we need to gain a better understanding of the metabolism and skeletal muscle characteristics related to fat oxidation which may lead to the increased risk of development of metabolic diseases in AA women.

"Enhancing Kidney Donation Through Live Organ Video Educated Donors (LOVED)     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Chronic Kidney Disease is diagnosed in four times as many African Americans (AAs) as Whites and nearly twice as many AAs perish from the condition. Kidney transplantation offers the best outcomes for patients with End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) but rates of procurement far outnumber cadaver organ availability, especially among AAs. A superior option is living donor kidney transplantation (LDKT). Since AAs comprise only 18.5% of LDKT recipients, innovative and culturally preferred strategies are needed to increase LDKT within the AA community. We hypothesize that a patient-centered, two tiered culturally sensitive education/motivation intervention targeting AA ESRD patients and potential donors (PDs) using mobile health (mHealth) technology will result in: 1) increased ESRD patients' willingness to ask for donation; 2) increased number of PDs who complete medical evaluation; and, 3) increased number of LDKTs. We will leverage mHealth technology as the delivery mechanism to maximize large scale dissemination potential. Guided by behavioral change and technology acceptability theories, the Live Organ Video Educated Donor [LOVED] program will be developed to address two domains. LOVED I will be tailored for AA ESRD patients and navigated by an AA LDKT recipient. LOVED II will be tailored for potential LDKT donors and navigated by an AA LDKT donor. iPad program delivery will include testimonial audio/video clips, home-work assignments, videoconferencing, chat room sessions, and text/emails. The proposed mixed methods research utilizes qualitative and quantitative studies in a 3 phase process of development that will involve: 1) Development of LOVED I and II technical content and delivery formats guided by behavioral and technological theories using 9 focus groups (8 per group) of AA LDKT recipients/donors, ESRD LDKT eligible patients, PDs who failed to complete screening and transplant healthcare provider team. 2) Conduct 3 month LOVED I and II proof of concept studies (LOVED I = 24 LDKT eligible patients; LOVED II = 24 PDs who did not complete screening) to assess program acceptability, feasibility, changes in self efficacy and attitudes.

"Personalized Bio-behavioral Weight Loss Intervention for African American Women     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This K01 Mentored Research Scientist Development Award proposal is designed to provide the scholarly training, mentorship, and resources necessary for the candidate to develop expertise in bio-behavioral research. The candidate's primary career goal is to become a funded independent investigator and recognized leader in the field of obesity prevention/treatment with expertise in developing personalized bio-behavioral weight loss interventions for African American (AA) women. To achieve this goal, a focused career development plan is proposed to: 1) Obtain knowledge and skills in understanding how genetic variants may be related to adiposity; modulate influence of lifestyle behaviors (i.e.PA, diet) upon changes in adiposity, and how these genotypes may eventually be used to help personalize behavioral interventions for obese AA women; 2) Obtain knowledge and skills in complex quantitative research methods, including bio-behavioral research designs and analyses, and advanced intervention development; and, 3) Enhance grant and scholarly writing skills, and manuscript production while continuing to build interdisciplinary collaboration with other researchers in the field of genetics, obesity and prevention research. The Medical University of South Carolina provides a comprehensive training environment that includes senior scientists with expertise in bio-behavioral interventions, genetics, and health disparities research. The candidate has a strong inter-professional and inter-institutional mentoring team with complementary expertise in the development of community based randomized controlled trials (RCT), genetics, obesity prevention and treatment, bio-behavioral interventions, biostatistics and epidemiology. The research plan, which builds on the training objectives, is directly responsive to the National Institute of Nursing Research's (NINR) mission of integrating the biological and behavioral sciences, employing new technologies to research questions, improving research methods, and developing the scientists of the future. The broad goal of this research is to identify key components for development of efficacious socio-culturally tailored behavioral interventions for long-term weight loss in low socioeconomic status (SES) obese AA women. The socio-cultural preferences will be incorporated into behavioral change strategies, the communication of genetic information, and the adaptation of the format and delivery of the evidence-based Diabetes Prevention Program materials and approaches to promote weight loss. To meet this goal, the candidate will conduct an exploratory study using genetic database secondary data analyses. Secondly, an intervention development phase, with 80 obese AA women living in public housing neighborhoods in the Charleston, SC region, to integrate new knowledge and skills from genetics while advancing skills in bio- behavioral research intervention development and methodology. The results of the proposed preliminary studies will inform a larger, adequately powered and resourced community based RCT for obese AA women that incorporates the use of genetic information and socio-cultural preferences to prescribe tailored weight loss strategies and promote long-term weight loss outcomes.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This innovative research plan addresses the need to integrate genetics, socio-environmental, and behavioral factors into promising multi-level community based interventions for disparate minority communities. Demonstrating that genetic and social-environmental components are important in designing and delivering obesity interventions is crucial. Further, gaining better understanding of predictors of obesity and obesity promoting behaviors in AA women could lead to changes in the selection and personalization of treatment approaches for obese AA women, and ultimately, improved outcomes for this population.              This innovative research plan addresses the need to integrate genetics, socio-environmental, and behavioral factors into promising multi-level community based interventions for disparate minority communities.

"Biobehavioral Determinants of the Microbiome and Preterm Birth in Black Women     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goals of this study are to elucidate the bio behavioral determinants that govern the structure and dynamics of the microbiome of African American (AA) women during pregnancy and to investigate whether microbiome composition is associated with PTB. The proposed study will contribute to a bio psychosocial understanding of within-race risk for PTB, providing insight into important risk and protective factors relevant to AA women who disproportionately experience PTB compared to any other US population. Our research is consistent with frameworks for eliminating racial disparities, which recognize the importance of studying potential risk factors within-race as a vital first step, and is congruent with the National Institute of Nursing Research goal of promoting and improving the health of individuals, families, and communities across the lifespan in a variety of clinical settings and within diverse populations. The study will prospectively enroll a socioeconomically diverse cohort of H 960 pregnant AA women and follow them through delivery, collecting data at three time points: twice via direct participant contact during prenatal care appointments (at 10-14 and 26-30 weeks' gestation), and once via review of the medical records from the delivery hospitalization. Using a nested case-control approach, we will designate as cases all women who experience PTB (an estimated 125 cases); an equal number of controls will be selected from among those who deliver a term infant. Using this study design we will: (1) Characterize the vaginal, oral, and gut microbiome during early and later pregnancy; (2) Examine whether bio behavioral factors linked with PTB - including biological indicators and experiences of stress, nutritional status, and health behaviors - influence the composition of the microbiome; (3) Determine whether the composition of the vaginal, oral, and gut microbiome in early and/or later pregnancy is associated with PTB; and (4) Investigate whether symptom patterns are associated with microbiomic milieu that increase the risk of PTB among AA women. The success of this research is supported by several factors. First, we have assembled a multidisciplinary collaboration of clinicians and basic and translational scientists representing expertise in infectious disease, obstetrics-gynecology, nutrition, genetics and epigenetics, stress physiology, epidemiology and informatics under the leadership of a nurse-scientist. Second, we have the support of the Atlanta Clinical and Translational Science Institute (CTSA award # NIH UL1TR000454); Emory's Interdisciplinary Training for Nurse Scientists Award (T32 NR012715), Emory's Reproductive and Perinatal Epidemiology Fellowship Award, and the Emory Integrated Genomics Core Laboratory. Third, Atlanta is home to AA women of broad SES, many of whom are served by Emory's affiliated delivery hospitals, enabling us to sample a diverse group of AA women, allowing for sufficient variation in the bio behavioral determinants under study to distinguish their independent and interactive effects on the microbiome and, ultimately, on the risk of PTB.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Preterm birth (PTB) occurs at unacceptably high rates within the United States, with African American women disproportionately affected. The composition of the microbiome during pregnancy may be a key mechanism for PTB. Our study will characterize the structure and dynamics of the vaginal, oral, and gut microbiome within the population most affected by PTB - African American women - in order to evaluate whether particular microbiome patterns are linked with PTB and to identify bio behavioral factors that impact microbiome structure and dynamics during pregnancy.                ",Biobehavioral

"Culture, Social Support & Quality of Life: Asian American Breast Cancer Survivors DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Little is known about the impact of health related quality of life on the well being of Asian American (AA) breast cancer survivors. This five-year mixed-methods study entitled: ""Culture, Support and Quality of Life: Asian American Breast Cancer Survivors"", proposes to identify and define how culture may modify the definitions of self-integrity and quality of life (QOL) for Asian American (AA) breast cancer (BC) survivors. Each culture defines self-esteem and the proper behavior required to achieve a positive sense of self for its members, and these definitions vary. Differing cultural definitions might explain why few ethnic minorities, like AAs, use mainstream survivorship services. AABC survivors have been reported to suffer significant emotional and social problems, but European American (EA) based mainstream designed services do not seem to adequately meet their needs. Two major barriers may hinder more effective interventions. First, dissonance between the beliefs and values upon which these mainstream services are based and AA constructions of self esteem and rules for relationships may reduce the acceptability of mainstream services. For example, most mainstream services emphasize the integrity of individuality and personhood, and accordingly, address the women alone. Yet, AA culture identifies the family as the unit of analysis, not the individual. This study proposes to utilize a more holistic operationalization of culture as a concept that could establish a new avenue of research to move the science of health disparities research forward. Identification of the salient unmet cultural needs of AA women would potentially expand Western based theories of positive survivorship and provide directions to develop more culturally relevant support services to improve their QOL. Second, no consensus exists on what actually comprises the construct of culture. This study proposes to develop a more holistic conceptual framework. Therefore, our four study aims are to: 1) Characterize how women in each of the four ethnic groups define self-integrity and well-being, 2) Identify if and how ethnic specific support services address the culturally formed expectations of integrity and well-being of AA BC survivors, and how this may differ by ethnic group, 3) Explore how the breast cancer experience impacts family members, and 4) Identify the impact of the cancer experience on the women's quality of life, and if it differs by ethnicity. In-depth ethnographic interviews will be conducted with 180 BC survivors and 96 family members for all 4 Aims. We will also survey 800 BC survivors (200 from each ethnic group), and triangulate the quantitative and qualitative findings to increase the validity of our results. We will use CBPR to collaborate with our community partners, Northern and Southern CA and Houston, TX to conduct the study. The 3 sites will enable us to also assess geographic and within group cultural variations. the quantitative and qualitative findings to increase the validity of our results. We will use CBPR to collaborate with our community partners Northern and Southern CA and Houston, TX to conduct the study. The 3 sites will enable us to also assess geographic and within group variations on cultural beliefs and patterns. The outcomes of this study are likely to inform both the science and practice of survivorship in the Asian American community in particular, and among diverse ethnic populations as well, by illuminating the culturally constructed modes and outcomes for managing the cancer experience. The findings are anticipated to provide direction to better meet the needs of cancer survivors and contribute the to the elimination of health disparities. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Little attention has been paid to the growing cancer control needs of Asian Americans (AAs), the ethnic group with the fastest growing rate of all ethnic groups in the U.S., and will double in size to 25 million by 2050. AA also are experiencing the fast increase in new cancer cases of all ethnic groups. The cancer incidence rate for AAs isis predicted to increase by 132 percent among this diverse population compared with 31 percent for non-Hispanic whites. Currenlty, unlike all other ethnicities, cancer is the number one cause of death for AA men and women. Notably, several AA subgroups currently show rates of cancer, including breast cancer (BC), that are higher than or equal to non-Hispanic white women. For some groups, a greater proportion of women with breast cancer are living through and beyond cancer. Studies show, however, that AABC survivors experience emotional and physical needs that are largely unmet, and despite the growing need and the unnecessary suffering borne by this community, too few studies have been conducted on the needs of AA cancer survivors. Of the 362,238 studies found in a Pub-Med search on cancer survivorship or social support, we found only 65 studies published between 1966 and 2010 that investigate the needs of AAs. Moreover, few support services exist to address the needs of AA cancer survivors in the entire nation. Evaluation of the impact of cancer on the social support needs of AA cancer survivors and their families, and in particular, the health related quality of life (HRQOL) of AA cancer survivorship, remains essentially unexamined. Thus, this is the first study to explore cultural explanations for the cross-cultural differences found in quality of life studies among Asian and Asian American populations compared with Western countries. Our study proposes to investigate both between and within group differences among three Asian-American (AA) subgroups (Chinese-American, Japanese-American, and Vietnamese-American) and a comparison group of European-American (EA) breast cancer (BC) survivors. The majority of studies in cancer survivorship have assumed a universality of the assumptions of positive coping strategies and goals. The differences in the performance of standardized scales noted among Asian Americans have not been explained. Relevance: The paucity of support groups and resources that are culturally salient for the growing number of AAs suffering with cancer makes a compelling public health argument for this innovative, mixed-paradigm and mixed-method study. Moreover, this study will forge a new path to evaluate the validity of the assumptions regarding the universality of Western European-American based values of individualism and autonomy that underlie the types of mainstream support services, and identify how, beyond Asian-language concordance, ethnic specific AA support groups assist their members along the survivorship journey through more familial based values and strategies. Investigation of these two areas would potentially expand the theoretical framework currently applied in HRQOL work with culturally-based modifications that are used in AABC support services so that other AA as well as mainstream health service professionals could better meet the needs of this rapidly growing population of AA cancer survivors and their families. This new path would also more accurately and effectively operationalize culture as a concept and construct to identify more relevant aspects of cultural differences that could move the science of health disparities research forward. We also utilize the strength of the community based participatory research approach to promote the validity of the findings to include the reality of the community.","Culture, Social Support & Quality of Life: Asian American Breast Cancer Survivors",8449740,R01CA158314,"['Asian Americans ', ' Attention ', ' Dorsum ', ' Back ', ' Behavior ', ' Belief ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cause of Death ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Chinese American ', ' Communities ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Family ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' health care service ', ' Health Services ', ' Incidence ', ' Individuality ', ' Interview ', ' Japanese American ', ' Language ', ' achievement Mainstream Education ', ' Mainstreaming ', ' Educational Mainstreaming ', ' Mainstreaming (Education) ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Methods ', ' Perception ', ' well-being ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Publishing ', ' QOL ', ' Quality of life ', ' Research ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Science ', ' self esteem ', ' self help organization ', ' Self-Help Groups ', ' Support Groups ', ' Social Interaction ', ' social disturbance ', ' Social Problems ', ' social support network ', ' Social support ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' survivorship ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' oriental ', ' Asians ', ' Friends ', ' Measures ', ' Family member ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' diverse populations ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' ethnographic ', ' Ethnography ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Survivors ', ' Individual ', ' European ', ' Personhood ', ' satisfaction ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Immigrant ', ' tool ', ' sadness ', ' depressed ', ' Depressed mood ', ' Consensus ', ' Life ', ' Investigation ', ' Home ', ' Home environment ', ' Pattern ', ' Country ', ' Outcome Study ', ' meetings ', ' Services ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' expectation ', ' member ', ' Adult Sons ', ' Adult Offspring ', ' Adult Daughters ', ' Adult Children ', ' cultural values ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' Emotional ', ' Modeling ', ' stigma ', ' social stigma ', ' theories ', ' cancer diagnosis ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Subgroup ', ' Cancer Control Science ', ' Cancer Control ', ' Cancer Survivor ', ' Cancer Survivorship ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' SF-36 ', ' Modification ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' comparison group ', ' forging ', ' health related quality of life ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' coping ', ' Population ', ' Impact evaluation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' ethnic minority ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' community based participatory research ', ' emotional experience ', ' effective intervention ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R01,2013,220165,0.02019502360684519
"An Integrated HIV Prevention Model for African American Mothers and Daughters    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Disproportionate rates of mental illness and HIV/AIDS/STIs among African Americans (AA), especially females, reflect significant health disparities. AA women accounted for 66% of new AIDS cases among women in 2006, and AA girls account for 64% of new HIV infections among youth. Mental health is linked to HIV-risk in important ways, yet few families- based, gender-specific, Afrocentric programs address mental health and HIV. Simultaneously targeting multiple levels in an integrated approach - the mother-daughter dyad, women, and girls - addresses HIV in the broader social context and capitalizes on the reciprocal impact of mothers and daughters, facilitating mutual reinforcement of HIV prevention attitudes and behavior, and thereby reducing intervention decay and sustaining positive outcomes over protracted time periods. IMARA (Informed, Motivated, Aware, and Responsible about AIDS) is a culturally-tailored, gender-specific, individual PLUS family-based HIV prevention program designed for two high risk groups -- AA women and AA girls. Based on the Theory of Gender and Power and the Social-Personal Framework, IMARA blends SISTA for women, SiHLE for girls, and a highly promising (Project STYLE) family-based program for teens in psychiatric care to simultaneously reduce women's and girls' risky sexual behavior and delay girls' sexual debut. IMARA incorporates components of Project STYLE that are specific to families and teens in psychiatric care (affect management, conflict resolution, parental monitoring, parent-teen communication) with aspects of SISTA and SiHLE that address gender, power, and ethnic pride. Pilot testing (N=22 mother-daughter dyads) supported IMARA's feasibility, tolerability, and acceptability, and despite the small sample size, outcome data indicate promising trends and changes in targeted mediators (increased parental monitoring, more open mother-daughter communication, greater intentions to use condoms, more relationship power) and sexual risk (increased condom use, fewer partners) separately for mothers and daughters from baseline to 2-month follow up. This study proposes a 2-arm RCT to test and compare the efficacy of IMARA to a health promotion control group in reducing risky sexual behavior among 300 women and their 14 - 18 year old AA daughters in psychiatric care. Mothers and daughters will complete baseline, 6-, and 12-month follow-up assessments. We will use an intent-to-treat analysis and a combination of SEM procedures, regression techniques, and other inferential statistical tests for contrasting means and proportions. We will analyze treatment outcomes using logistic and linear multiple regression models examining effects at 6- and 12- months separately, as well as a combined model with random effects for repeated measurements across time. This proposal answers a compelling need for innovative prevention programs that address the intersecting health disparities of mental illness and HIV/AIDS/STIs among African American girls and women. Effective family-based programs can alter negative developmental trajectories of this very high-risk population and begin to redress existing health disparities.        African Americans (AA) account for more HIV/AIDS cases, people living with HIV/AIDS, and HIV-related deaths than any other racial group in the United States.1, 2 In 2004, AA women accounted for the largest proportion (66%) of new AIDS cases among women in 2006,3-5 and in 2005, AA youth ages 13 - 19 accounted for 69% of new AIDS cases.3 AAs also experience significant mental health disparities,6, 7 and mental illness exacerbates risk for HIV among adults8, 9 and youth.10 Teens in psychiatric care engage in the same HIV-risk behaviors as their school age peers but at higher rates.11-13 The diversity of risk factors associated with these trends is complex, multi-level, and go beyond an individual woman or girl, yet few family-based, gender-specific, Afrocentric programs exist to address their needs. Simultaneously targeting multiple levels in an integrated program -- the mother-daughter dyad, women, and girls -- capitalizes on the reciprocal impact of mothers and daughters, and facilitates mutual reinforcement of HIV prevention attitudes and behavior, thereby reducing intervention decay and sustaining positive outcomes over time. The long-term goal of the study is to reduce health disparities in HIV/AIDS/STIs and mental health among African American women and girls by improving healthy sexual decision-making, empowering mothers to become effective role models, strengthening mother-daughter communication and emotion regulation skills, and building stronger mother-daughter relationships that sustain behavior change.

"Race - adiposity interactions regulate mechanisms determining insulin sensitivity     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Project summary. Insulin resistance plays a major role in the etiology of chronic metabolic diseases, many of which differ with race/ethnicity. Previous studies using mainly indirect methods suggest that insulin sensitivity is lower in African-Americans (AA) vs. European-Americans (EA). However, results are discrepant, differing with the method used and the obesity status of the participants. Our preliminary data using the reference standard glucose clamp indicate that in lean individuals, insulin sensitivity i lower among AA, while in obese individuals, insulin sensitivity is higher among AA. We hypothesize that this race/body mass index (BMI) interaction may be explained in part by significantly lower visceral/hepatic adiposity in AA that results in less impairment of insulin sensitivity among obese AA individuals. Conversely, we hypothesize that inherently greater oxidative stress impairs insulin sensitivity in AA, explaining lower insulin sensitivity in lean AA vs. EA. This is based on our preliminary data indicating that a circulating marker of cumulative oxidative stress was significantly associated with insulin-stimulated glucose disposal in AA but not EA, and that production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in vitro was greater in AA vs. EA. We propose to test these hypotheses by prospectively comparing skeletal muscle and hepatic insulin sensitivity in healthy lean, overweight, and obese AA and EA using the hyperinsulinemic isoglycemic glucose clamp with tracer-labeled glucose. Analysis of ancestral genetic admixture will permit simultaneous assessment of the contribution of ancestry to main outcomes. With our first aim, we will test the hypothesis that a significant race-by-BMI interaction will be detected n skeletal muscle and hepatic insulin sensitivity, such that at low BMI AA are less insulin sensitive but at high BMI AA are more insulin sensitive, when compared with EA. The second aim will test the hypothesis that at high BMI, AA will have greater hepatic and skeletal muscle insulin sensitivity due to lower hepatic and visceral fat. The third aim will test the hypothesis that greater bioenergetic efficiency and ROS production within skeletal muscle mitochondria will be associated with lower skeletal muscle insulin sensitivity in lean AA. A secondary aim will test the hypothesis that skeletal muscle and hepatic insulin sensitivity are better associated with adipokines, cytokines, lipids, blood pressure, and vascular function in EA than in AA. Relevance. Results from this study elucidating why the underlying pathophysiology of insulin resistance differs with genetic background may guide development of personalized treatment strategies with implications for several chronic metabolic diseases (e.g., type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and cancer).         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We will test the hypothesis that the underlying pathophysiology of insulin resistance differs with genetic background. We predict that insulin resistance will occur secondary to visceral and hepatic obesity in European Americans, but is driven by inherently greater oxidative stress in African Americans. Results from this study may guide the development of individualized treatment strategies for prevention and reversal of insulin resistance, and may have implications for a race-specific role of insulin resistance in the etiology of chronic metabolic disease.            ",Race - adiposity interactions regulate mechanisms determining insulin sensitivity,8504840,R01DK096388,"['adulthood ',

"Health Literacy and Cancer Screening Disparities in Asian American Populations     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cancer is the leading cause of death among Asian Americans (AA), yet screening rates for breast, colorectal, and cervical cancer are lower for AA than for many other racial/ethnic groups. Adult health literacy (HL), defined in Healthy People 2010 as the ""the degree to which individuals have the capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services for appropriate health decisions"" is an established correlate to cancer screening that is not well studied in AA. Understanding the relationship of HL to cancer screening in AA is particularly important due to the high prevalence of limited English proficiency (LEP) in many AA populations. LEP is associated with less cancer screening in AA, and may contribute to and exacerbate the consequences of low HL in AA. Contextual factors, such as screening facility availability and neighborhood ethnic density, are also associated with health behaviors. Contextual factors are understudied in HL research, but may impact the relationship of individual HL to cancer screening, especially in AA with LEP. Currently, our core knowledge base: 1) lacks population-based rates of, and individual and contextual-level correlates to, cancer screening by HL for AA overall and within diverse AA subpopulations; 2) has not established if low HL explains health disparities among AA as it does in other populations; and 3) has not specified the interaction of HL with individual or contextual-level linguistic access variables. This R03 will use the Behavioral Model of Health Services Utilization as a conceptual guide to fill in these critical knowledge gaps through a secondary data analysis of the 2007 California Health Interview Survey (CHIS), a population-based study with rich data on AA populations, merged with contextual-level data from Census and CMS at the policy-relevant level of the Medical Service Study Area. Specifically we will: (1) Determine if breast, cervical, and colon cancer screening rates differ by HL in AA generally and in AA subpopulations when relevant individual and contextual-level factors are considered; (2) Test if HL explains cancer screening disparities a) for AA compared to non-Hispanic whites, and b) within AA subpopulations; and (3) Quantify the interaction of HL with individual LEP as well as contextual linguistic access variables (doctor- patient language concordance, community LEP, AA ethnic density) for cancer screening in AA. This study is an important addition to, and a novel synthesis of, four emerging streams of research with distinct implications for improving cancer morbidity/mortality and reducing health disparities: 1) the role of HL in explaining health disparities; 2) the importance of LEP to health and health care access; 3) variation in cancer correlates and outcomes in AA subpopulations, and 4) contextual/individual-level interactions in health. We address the stated NCI/NIH goals of improving HL, reducing cancer screening disparities, and gaining detailed portraits of AA subpopulations using a novel combination of NCI-funded data. This study also provides key background for our future research to reduce cancer incidence, mortality, and health disparities among AA. 1        Cancer is the leading cause of death among Asian Americans (AA), yet screening rates for breast, colorectal, and cervical cancer are lower for AA than for many other racial/ethnic groups. Adult health literacy is known to predict cancer screening in other racial/ethnic groups, but this topic has not been studied in AA. This research project will: (1) Determine if breast, cervical, and colon cancer screening rates differ by health literacy in AA generally and in AA subpopulations when relevant individual and contextual level factors are considered; (2) Test if health literacy explains cancer screening disparities a) for AA compared to non-Hispanic whites, and b) within AA subpopulations; and (3) Quantify the interaction of low health literacy with individual and contextual linguistic access variables for cancer screening rates in AA.

"Community-led Policies and Leadership to Eliminate Disparities for Asian Ame     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Tobacco control policy change has contributed tremendously to decreasing tobacco use and represents one of public health's top 10 achievements in the 20th century. Despite the great success of tobacco policy change, the decline in tobacco use prevalence has stalled with still high rates particularly among marginalized communities of color, Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders (AA and NHPIs) are one of the fastest growing populations in the U.S., yet we understand very little about the most effective processes and pathways for engaging AAs and NHPIs in policy change that result in successful compliance and eventual community norm change on tobacco. We propose to conduct a three-year community-based participatory research (CBPR) study titled Community-led Policies and Leadership to Eliminate Disparities for Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders on Tobacco (Com-PLEAT). The overall goal of this research is to identify and understand the pathways to successful tobacco control policy change among two AA and NHPI communities: Cambodians in Long Beach County and Pacific Islanders (including Native Hawaiians, Samoans and Chamorros) in San Diego County. The specific aims of this study are twofold: 1) to develop, and test a 4-prong policy change framework and its effect in helping to mobilize Asian American and Pacific Islander (AA and NHPI) (Cambodian and Chamorro) communities on tobacco control using key informant interviews, community readiness indices and Guttman scalogram analysis; and 2) to study the pathways to successful policy change on tobacco for AAs and NHPIs including the role of capacity building. This proposed Com-PLEAT Study will include key informant interviews, community readiness assessments and Guttman scalogram analysis methodologies and will make a significant contribution to the field of tobacco prevention and control by identifying alternative and more successfully sustained pathways to policy change for AAs and NHPIs. The proposed Com-PLEAT Study seeks to challenge the current framework that policy change will trickle down to all communities equally and the phasing out of culturally-tailored strategies to eliminate health disparities. Using a community-based participatory approach that involves communities in every aspect of the research design, data collection, analysis and dissemination, this study will engage communities to understand perception and motivation about policies and elements critical for full participation in a wide-range of policy interventions.         RELEVANCE (See instructions): The proposed Com-PLEAT Study will contribute not only to the better understanding of effective pathways for tobacco control policy change for Asian American, Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander (NHPI) communities, but also to the replication of this study in other AA and NHPI communities across the U.S. By using innovative research methods, the Com-PLEAT Study will hopefully translate into more effective and sustainable implementation of policy initiatives that include and serve AA and NHPI communities and help reduce health disparities.                  ",Community-led Policies and Leadership to Eliminate Disparities for Asian Ame,8500695,R24MD008041,"['Achievement Attainment ', ' Achievement ', ' Asian Americans ', ' California ', ' Color ', ' Communities ', ' Data Collection ', ' development policy ', ' Elements ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' indexing ', ' Interview ', ' Justice ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Leadership ', ' Method LOINC Axis 6 ', ' Methodology ', ' Mission ', ' Motivation ', ' body movement ', ' Movement ', ' Pacific Islands ', ' parity ', ' Perception ', ' Program Development ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Research ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Research Design ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Testing ', ' Tobacco ', ' Translating ', ' Universities ', ' oriental ', ' Asians ', ' County ', ' Research Methods ', ' Research Methodology ', ' Advocacy ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Phase ', ' Individual ', ' Pacific Islander American ', ' Pacific Islander ', ' Pacific Island Americans ', ' Policy Developments ', ' Policies ', ' Collaborations ', ' Staging ', ' Hawaiian ', ' Hawaiian population ', ' Samoan ', ' Tobacco Consumption ', ' Tobacco use ', ' Visit ', ' success ', ' empowerment ', ' member ', ' tobacco policy ', ' tobacco control policy ', ' public policy on tobacco ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' research study ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' US State ', ' Geographic state ', ' Preparedness ', ' Readiness ', ' Address ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' informant ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' minority health ', ' tobacco control ', ' tobacco use prevention ', ' prevent tobacco use ', ' tobacco prevention ', ' Instruction ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' community based participatory research ', ' ']",NIMHD,ASIAN PACIFIC PARTNERS/EMPOWER/ADV/LDSHP,R24,2013,313281,0.011634859381690012
"Social Context and Inflammatory Risk for Stroke in African American Women     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Despite declines in age-adjusted cardiovascular (CVD) mortality, the incidence of coronary heart disease (CHD)/ stroke is almost twice as high in African American (AA) women compared to non-Hispanic White (NHW) women. The additional burden of CHD/stroke disease borne by AA women is attributed to factors such as socioeconomic status, psychosocial stress, and greater number of risk factors. Economically disadvantaged AA women experience higher levels of chronic stress than NHW women. Yet, little is known about how prior life adversity, such as childhood maltreatment, chronic/perceived stress, perceived discrimination, subjective socio-economic status (SSS), and socioeconomic status (SES) contribute to the disparity in CHD/stroke disease between AA and NHW women. Further, proinflammatory processes are known to contribute to CHD/stroke and compelling evidence demonstrates that adverse prior life experiences result in epigenetic alterations (i.e., changes in DNA methylation), which, in turn, increase stress reactivity and proinflammatory cytokine production. The purpose of this three-year mentored research development application is to provide the necessary training and experience to allow for an independent career in which the psychosocial and proinflammatory mechanisms that underlie CHD/stroke disease disparities can be identified. The training objectives are to: (1) Expand knowledge of the relationships among prior life adversity, proinflammatory stress response, and global DNA methylation status in relation to CHD/stroke disease disparities; (2) Acquire new knowledge and research skills in study design, recruitment, data collection, and interpretation of data as it relates to prior life adversity, proinflammatory stress response, and global DNA methylation in minority women at risk for CHD/stroke; (3) Obtain hands-on training and gain knowledge in the laboratory analysis and interpretation of salivary cortisol, proinflammatory cytokines, and global DNA methylation; and (4) Develop advanced statistical expertise in modeling. To accomplish these objectives and provide a foundation for a sustained research career, the candidate will conduct a study comparing 46 AA and 46 NHW at risk for CHD/stroke in order to (1) Determine the extent to which prior life adversity contributes to CHD/stroke risk and the proinflammatory response (IL-6) to acute stress in AA compared to NHW women at risk for CHD/stroke, (2) Determine the degree to which prior life adversity predicts global DNA methylation status in AA and NHW women at risk for CHD/stroke, and (3) Evaluate global DNA methylation status as a predictor of the proinflammatory response (IL-6) to acute stress in AA and NHW women at risk for CHD/stroke. The significance of this study lies in its potential to clarify mechanisms of CHD/stroke disease susceptibility and to determine the possible basis for the health disparity exhibited by disadvantaged, minority women. Findings will inform the development of novel risk profiles to identify those at most risk for CHD/stroke burden.           PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: African American women suffer twice as many ischemic cardiac events and strokes as do non-Hispanic White women. Prior life adversity is linked to increased proinflammatory risk and may contribute to CHD/stroke disease disparities. It is expected that findings from this study will inform the development of novel risk profiles for CHD/stroke and lead to earlier identification and targeting of interventions to reduce disease burden.            ",Social Context and Inflammatory Risk for Stroke in African American Women,8551703,K01NR013478,"['Affect ', ' Age ', ' Age Factors ', ' Behavioral Sciences ', ' cardiovascular

"IBD Gene Mapping by Clinical and Population Subset     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) are complex genetic disorders of the gastrointestinal tract, and a major health burden to patients and society. Tremendous progress has been made in dissecting IBD genetic etiology with identification of over 100 IBD loci by genome wide association studies (GWAS) but mainly limited to persons of European ancestry. The IBD Genetics Consortium (IBDGC) was established to facilitate multicenter collaborative studies of 6 Genetics Research Centers (GRCs) organized with a Data Coordinating Center (DCC). Our GRC at Johns Hopkins (JHGRC) has contributed to all IBDGC studies, led the largest genome wide linkage study in IBD and has led the IBDGC in a focus on African American (AA) IBD genetics (recruiting 88% of study subjects). We published the first large clinical characterization of AA IBD, serological associations of AA CD, clinical disparity studies, and most recently evaluation of admixture in AA CD, NOD2 the other four most well characterized CD genetic loci. More research in AA IBD is needed to understand the etiology of IBD in this ancestrally distinct, major American population, and also because diverse allelic and haplotype structure, and potential for unique functional variants will yield benefits for all populations. Additionally, a major challenge, especially for non- coding associations, is to know which SNPs are causative vs. those in linkage disequilibrium. Comparing association patterns across populations and evaluating function of associated SNPs that map to potential transcription factor (TF) sites active in IBD related cells will be beneficial. Our Aims in the next funding period are to (1) facilitate more comprehensive IBD gene discovery and evaluation in the AA population, and (2) to characterize the epigenome relevant to IBD and evaluate the most provocative non-coding SNPs across populations that map to potential TF binding sites for alterning genomic function. For the first Aim, we have enlarged our recruitment to12 satellite recruitment centers and will recruit 1000 AA IBD cases (with potential of 2600 cases) over the next five years. Immunochip IBD genotyping in AA's and a first stage AA CD GWAS IBD are underway, with facilitation of a 2nd stage ancillary R01 AA CD GWAS with Emory University planned for Year 3. We will perform an IBDGC AA UC GWAS of 1000 cases in year 4. We will compare IBD associations across ethnic groups to define most consistent non-coding SNPs. For Aim 2, we've assembled a team to help us characterize IBD relevant epigenomic annotation. We will purify immune cells from resected colon of patients, perform ChIP-Seq, and evaluate SNPs that map to TF binding sites using in-vitro enhancer assays in transfected cell lines. We will play a major role in all IBDGC activities, with our team of genetic statistical, genomic, immunology, and microbiome co-investigators, by our ability to obtain biological materials (including blood, biopsy, resection, and stool) and to recall patients for re-sampling, and by working cooperatively to maximize productivity of the IBDGC and its GRCs and DCC.          According to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention, an estimated 1.4 million Americans suffer from Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD), a chronic debilitating disorder with no cure that includes Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. IBD ranks in the top 5 in prevalence for gastrointestinal disorders and represents a significant financial burden to society requiring a lifetime of medical care. This proposed research aims to determine the genetic variations that cause IBD which will aid in developing preventive measures, improving the quality of care with better treatments and educating patients through genetic counseling.

"Targeted Analyses of Jackson Heart Study Data     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Jackson Heart Study (JHS) was designed to collect clinical, laboratory, imaging, genetic, and environmental data that could provide insights into the determinants and development of cardiovascular and related diseases in African Americans (AA) residing in the Jackson, MS community.  Between 2000 and 2012, 5301 AA men and women participated at a baseline and two additional clinic examinations.  Obesity and diabetes are important contributors to cardiovascular outcomes and the overall health disparities observed between AAs and whites in the United States. Both conditions are highly prevalent among those enrolled in JHS. The overall goal of this proposal is to enhance the scientific output of the JHS with respect to obesity/diabetes and its cardiometabolic and vascular outcomes.  We propose to conduct in-depth cross- sectional and longitudinal analyses of obesity and glucometabolic parameters, and select outcomes (incident diabetes, subclinical and clinical cardiovascular disease) by engaging scientists in the newly established JHS Obesity Diabetes Working Group (ODWG).  The ODWG will function as a virtual team, utilizing a combination of teleconferences, in person meetings, and internet-based file sharing tools, and will include Wake Forest, JHS and other interested investigators and trainees. The investigative team includes expertise in epidemiology, biostatistics, imaging, diabetes, obesity, and cardiovascular disease.  We also have an extant relationship with JHS as Wake Forest served as the reading center for the CT and MRI studies performed at exams 2 and 3. A focus of ODWG activities includes mentoring junior investigators and trainees. We also expect that analysis and dissemination of these data will spur the application for separate funding for ancillary studies.                PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This research seeks to better understand obesity and diabetes in African American adults by establishing a  working group to analyze obesity and diabetes-related data collected by the Jackson Heart Study in 5301  African American men and women. Through monthly conference calls and yearly in-person meetings with  Jackson Heart scientists we will write papers using these data, and mentor junior faculty and trainees.              ",Targeted

"Behaviors Related to Cancer Risk Among African-American College Students     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): African Americans (AAs) experience profound health disparities in cancer-related risk factors, incidence, and mortality compared to non-Hispanic whites. Cancer risk-related behaviors that are adopted during adolescence and young adulthood, including among college students, are more likely to be sustained later in life. There has been limited attention given to factors that influence the adoption of cancer-related health risk behaviors in AAs attending Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU's), despite evidence that AAs are at greater risk for adopting health risk behaviors such as smoking, alcohol use, risky sexual behaviors, and illicit drug use during college years in comparison to students attending majority institutions. The overall goal of this R03 feasibility study is to determine the incidence of cancer risk-related behaviors among first-year students attending an HBCU and to examine predictors of adoption of those behaviors, including mental health indicators (i.e., depression and stress), religiosity/spirituality, risk perceptions, health literay, peer and familial influences and access to care. First-year students (n=300) will complete study measures that assess these variables during the fall semester (baseline) and at 6 months post-baseline. The prevalence and adoption of health risk behaviors will be evaluated longitudinally, and factors that predict or correlate with those behaviors will be examined. Results will help guide much needed basic behavioral research in this target population, including the development of sustainable interventions to prevent the adoption of health risk behaviors by young AAs. Importantly, this study will establish an ongoing research partnership with Prairie View A&M University that will facilitate future studies on this campus, which ultimately can be disseminated to other HBCU populations, both public and private.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The aims of this R03 feasibility study are to assess the adoption of health risk behaviors related to cancer among a cohort of African American college students attending a rural Historically Black College, Prairie View A&M University, and to examine factors associated with behavior adoption including mental health indicators (i.e., depression, stress), religiosity/spirituality, risk perceptions, health literacy, peer, familial an neighborhood influences, and access to care. Survey data (n=300) will be collected at the beginning of their first semester of freshman year (baseline) and 6 months later. This study will generate baseline indicators for incidence of health risk behaviors among AA college students, and lead to a better understanding of predictors which may increase adoption of health risk behaviors. Results will contribute to the future development of novel health risk behavior interventions for AA college students, an understudied population.            ",Behaviors Related to Cancer Risk Among African-American College Students,8494187,R03CA171835,"['teenage ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' Adolescence ', ' Adoption ', ' etoh use ', ' ethanol use ', ' ethanol product use ', ' ethanol intake ', ' ethanol ingestion ', ' ethanol drinking ', ' ethanol consumption ', ' alcoholic drink intake ', ' alcoholic beverage consumption ', ' alcohol use ', ' alcohol product use ', ' alcohol intake ', ' alcohol ingestion ', ' alcohol consumed ', ' EtOH drinking ', ' Alcohol Drinking ', ' Alcohol consumption ', ' Attention ', ' Behavior ', ' lifestyle modification ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' behavior intervention ', ' Life Style Modification ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' Behavioral Research ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Communities ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' dietary ', ' Diet ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Ethnic group ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' Family ', ' Feasibility Studies ', ' Female ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' healthcare service availability ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare access availability ', ' health services availability ', ' health care service availability ', ' health care service access ', ' health care availability ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Availability of Health Services ', ' Accessibility of health care ', ' Access to Healthcare ', ' Access to Health Care ', ' Access to Care ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' Incidence ', ' Infection ', ' wart virus ', ' Infectious Human Wart Virus ', ' Human Papilloma Virus ', ' HPV ', ' Human Papillomavirus ', ' Health Insurance ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity -

"Enhancing Kidney Donation Through Live Organ Video Educated Donors (LOVED)     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Chronic Kidney Disease is diagnosed in four times as many African Americans (AAs) as Whites and nearly twice as many AAs perish from the condition. Kidney transplantation offers the best outcomes for patients with End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) but rates of procurement far outnumber cadaver organ availability, especially among AAs. A superior option is living donor kidney transplantation (LDKT). Since AAs comprise only 18.5% of LDKT recipients, innovative and culturally preferred strategies are needed to increase LDKT within the AA community. We hypothesize that a patient-centered, two tiered culturally sensitive education/motivation intervention targeting AA ESRD patients and potential donors (PDs) using mobile health (mHealth) technology will result in: 1) increased ESRD patients' willingness to ask for donation; 2) increased number of PDs who complete medical evaluation; and, 3) increased number of LDKTs. We will leverage mHealth technology as the delivery mechanism to maximize large scale dissemination potential. Guided by behavioral change and technology acceptability theories, the Live Organ Video Educated Donor [LOVED] program will be developed to address two domains. LOVED I will be tailored for AA ESRD patients and navigated by an AA LDKT recipient. LOVED II will be tailored for potential LDKT donors and navigated by an AA LDKT donor. iPad program delivery will include testimonial audio/video clips, home-work assignments, videoconferencing, chat room sessions, and text/emails. The proposed mixed methods research utilizes qualitative and quantitative studies in a 3 phase process of development that will involve: 1) Development of LOVED I and II technical content and delivery formats guided by behavioral and technological theories using 9 focus groups (8 per group) of AA LDKT recipients/donors, ESRD LDKT eligible patients, PDs who failed to complete screening and transplant healthcare provider team. 2) Conduct 3 month LOVED I and II proof of concept studies (LOVED I = 24 LDKT eligible patients; LOVED II = 24 PDs who did not complete screening) to assess program acceptability, feasibility, changes in self efficacy and attitudes. Also assessed will be % ESRD patients who identify PDs, % PDs who complete screening, % LDKTs and participants' perceptions of cultural competence of intervention including levels of trust, discrimination, shared decision making and literacy. 3) Conduct two 6 month 2-arm randomized control trials (LOVED I vs. standard of care, N=60; LOVED II vs. standard of care, N=80) to generate estimates needed for design of a large scale RCT.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Culturally sensitive programs are needed to increase African Americans' (AAs) LDKT rate.

"Improving Resection Rates among African Americans with NSCLC  PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT. Surgical resection is the standard-of-care for patients with early stage lung cancer, and multiple published studies have shown that improvements in resection rates translate into improvements in overall survival. African Americans (AAs) with early stage, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) are significantly less likely than European Americans (EAs) to undergo resection, even when controlling for age, comorbidity, tumor stage, socioeconomic status, insurance status, and surgical consultation. This racial disparity is particularly pronounced in South Carolina (SC). Investigators at the National Cancer Institute-designated Medical University of South Carolina Hollings Cancer Center (MUSC HCC) hypothesize that a dynamic, [statewide], patient navigation intervention will reduce potential barriers to surgical cancer care and improve resection rates among AAs with early stage NSCLC. The patient navigation intervention will be tested in a two-arm, cluster- randomized trial comparing the intervention versus [usual care] in a sample of 200 AAs in SC with Stage I or II NSCLC. Study participants will be recruited from six geographically diverse study sites within a [statewide] cancer Clinical Trials Network (CTN) coordinated by MUSC, and participants will be cluster-randomized by CTN site. The investigators will further evaluate the modifying effects of income and urban-rural residence on the relationships between the intervention and the main study outcome (receipt of surgery), as well as [receipt of surgical consultation], time to resection, [time to death (survival)], health-related quality of life, state anxiety, perceived self-efficacy in patient-physician interaction, trust in physicians, and satisfaction with the treatment decision made. The proposed research is highly significant for many reasons. First, lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death in the United States (US) and SC. Second, less than half of AAs in SC with early stage NSCLC undergo surgical resection, and the median survival of AAs with early stage NSCLC is consistently lower than that of EAs. Third, SC has a large AA population (approximately 30%), has urban as well as large rural geographic areas, and has wide income distributions. A [statewide] patient navigation intervention to enhance access to surgical therapy for AAs with NSCLC could lead to significant improvements in care and reductions in racial disparities in lung cancer outcomes [across wide geographic and socioeconomic strata] in SC, as well as in other communities across the US.  PROJECT NARRATIVE. Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer deaths in the US; however, while surgical resection is the optimal treatment for localized, early stage lung cancer, less than half of the African Americans (AAs) diagnosed with this disease undergo surgical resection. This study will test whether a [statewide] patient navigation intervention improves receipt of surgical resection, [receipt of surgical consultation], reduces time to surgery and [improves survival] in AAs with early stage disease, and it may uncover modifiable root causes underlying underuse of lung cancer surgery among AAs. The patient navigation intervention may prove to be a practical but powerful strategy for use by other health care providers, institutions, and communities seeking to reduce persistent racial disparities in lung cancer surgery and outcomes.",Improving Resection Rates among African Americans with NSCLC,8448104,R01MD005892,"['abstracting ', ' Age ', ' Anxiety ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' nonsmall cell lung cancer ', ' Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer ', ' NSCLC - Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer ', ' NSCLC ', ' Non-Small-Cell Lung Carcinoma ', ' Communities ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Comorbidity ', ' Consultations ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Decision Making ', ' Diagnosis ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Patient Care ', ' geographic site ', ' MeSH Descriptors Class 4 ', ' Geographical Location ', ' Geographic Region ', ' Geographic Area ', ' Geographic Locations ', ' Goals ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Health Personnel ', ' Health Services Needs ', ' Level of Health ', ' Health Status ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Income ', ' Income Distributions ', ' interventions research ', ' intervention research ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Tumor Staging ', ' Neoplasm Staging ', ' Cancer Staging ', ' Diagnostic Neoplasm Staging ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Publishing ', ' recruit ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' social support network ', ' Social support ', ' South Carolina ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' Woman ', ' Relative ', ' Relative (related person) ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' Caring ', ' rural area ', ' urban area ', ' improved ', ' early cancer detection ', ' Cancer Screening for Patients ', ' Screening for cancer ', ' Site ', ' Medical ', ' Randomized Clinical Trials ', ' Ensure ', ' residence ', ' Trust ', ' European ', ' Rural ', ' lung cancer ', ' Pulmonary malignant Neoplasm ', ' Pulmonary Cancer ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Lung ', ' Malignant neoplasm of lung ', ' satisfaction ', ' root ', ' Plant Roots ', ' Staging ', ' Insurance Status ', ' Insurance Coverage ', ' surgery ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' Outcome Study ', ' American ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' resection ', ' Surgical Removal ', ' Removal ', ' Extirpation ', ' Abscission ', ' Excision ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' theories ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' cancer surgery ', ' cancer care ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Institution ', ' Effectiveness ', ' T-Stage ', ' Tumor stage ', ' Low income ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' mammary cancer detection ', ' Breast cancer screening ', ' Breast Cancer Detection ', ' NCI Organization ', ' National Cancer Institute ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Randomized ', ' Cancer Center ', ' Cancer Cause ', ' Cancer Etiology ', ' Cancer Patient ', ' trial design ', ' Clinical Trials Design ', ' Newly Diagnosed ', ' Principal Investigator ', ' Process ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomic ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio economic ', ' socioeconomics ', ' health related quality of life ', ' Clinical Trials Network ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' cancer type ', ' trial comparing ', ' tumor ', ' community setting ', ' evidence base ', ' group intervention ', ' standard of care ', ' usual care ', ' treatment as usual ', ' randomized trial ', ' arm ', ' ']",NIMHD,MEDICAL UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA,R01,2013,344781,0.09667747765201604
"Technology Intensified Diabetes Education Study in AA with T2DM (TIDES)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposed K24 application is designed to support the career and research trajectory of the candidate by providing protected time to conduct patient-oriented research on interventions to reduce complications and deaths from diabetes in ethnic minority groups and mentor the next generation of women and minority clinical investigators in health disparities research. The specific aims of the proposed K24 application will be accomplished by completing the following three objectives: Mentoring Objective: To increase the pool of clinical researchers who can conduct patient-oriented research and successfully compete for peer-reviewed grants, as well as mentor the next generation of women and minority clinical investigators, who are engaged in the national effort to reduce and eliminate health care disparities. This will be accomplished by mentoring 2 women/minority investigators each year for 5 years. Career Development Objective: To obtain additional training in clinical trials methodology, comparative effectiveness research and community-based participatory research, that would greatly enhance the candidate's research capability and make him a more effective mentor to trainees in clinical research. This will be accomplished by taking 2 courses a year in advanced statistics, decision analysis, informatics, bioethics, responsible conduct of research, and health economics. Research Objective: The primary objective is to test the efficacy of a technology-intensified diabetes education/skills training (TIDES) intervention using the FORA 2-in-1 Telehealth System for diabetes in improving HbA1c levels in AAs with poorly controlled T2DM. The secondary objectives are to test the efficacy of a technology-intensified diabetes education/skills training (TIDES) intervention using the FORA 2-in-1 and Telehealth System for diabetes in improving BP control and quality of life in AAs with poorly controlled T2DM. Exploratory analyses will examine improvements in self-care behaviors (i.e. diet, physical activity, self glucose monitoring, and medication adherence) and the role of self-care as mediators of metabolic control.     Mentorship is an important component of career advancement in academic medicine. Several studies have established that lack of mentoring is a reason for poor career advancement and attrition, particularly among women and minority faculty. The candidate who has a track record of mentoring women and minority faculty would benefit from the protected time for mentoring afforded by the proposed K24 award, while allowing continued research to eliminate disparities in diabetes.

"A Follow-up Study for Causes of Cancer in Black Women     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Black Women's Health Study (BWHS), the largest follow-up study for cancer in African American (AA) women, began in 1995 when 59,000 women (median age, 38) from across the U.S. enrolled. The BWHS has successfully followed participants with biennial questionnaires for data on incident disease and medical, reproductive, behavioral, psychosocial, and socioeconomic factors, linked addresses to U.S. census data, and are currently linking to air pollution data. Cancer diagnoses are validated by pathology data from hospitals and cancer registries. A DNA bio repository was established through collection of cheek cell samples from 26,800 participants. Despite initial slow accrual of cancers due to the young age of participants at entry, the BWHS has published extensively on risk factors for breast cancer; sufficient cases of lung cancer, colorectal cancer, and colon adenomas are now available. We propose to (1) continue follow-up/data collection; (2) establish a repository of 17,800 blood samples; (3) share data/samples in consortia projects. Continuation of the BWHS is highly desirable: 90% of participants are still cancer-free; follow-up has been successful and unbiased; the cohort has reached ages at which cancer incidence increases markedly; effects of exposures (e.g., severe obesity, racism) that are less common in other populations can be studied; the DNA has made valuable contributions to genetic cancer studies and is a major replication source for studies of breast cancer and related phenotypes in AA and other groups; the BWHS is a key contributor to consortia projects of rarer cancers in /\As; and the BWHS has been highly productive. Because levels of many blood markers are unfavorable among AAs and few studies of blood biomarkers in relation to cancer incidence have been carried out specifically in /\As, we propose to establish a repository of blood samples in the BWHS. A successful pilot study demonstrated the feasibility of our methods and participation was unbiased and similar to that in other large follow-up studies. The repository will increase by 60% the limited number of AA women with available blood samples being followed in U.S. cancer cohort studies. AA women continue to be disproportionately affected by many cancers. Continuation of the BWHS will permit continuation of its valuable contributions to understanding cancer etiology in this understudied group. A blood repository will greatly increase the value of the BWHS resource by permitting studies that help to fill the knowledge gap about the relation of biomarkers to cancer incidence and survival in AAs. The assessment of serious nonmalignant illnesses in the BWHS enhances the value of this resource at no cost to the study of cancer.              Incidence and mortality rates of many cancers and other illnesses confinue to be disproportionately high  among AA women. The Black Women's Health Study, a follow-up study of 59,000 AA women, has  contributed important information on risk factors for cancer. Continued follow-up, the collection of blood  samples, and participation of the BWHS in collaborafive studies, including studies of rare cancers, will  produce valuable informafion on risk factors for cancers and other illnesses that burden AA women.",A Follow-up Study for Causes of Cancer in Black Women,8549170,UM1CA164974,"['abstracting ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' Air Pollution ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Blood ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Cells ', ' Censuses ', ' Cheek ', ' Bucca ', ' Cheek structure ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Collection ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' DNA ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Genotype ', ' Health ', ' Hospitals ', ' Incidence ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Income ', ' Laboratories ', ' Mails ', ' Medical Records ', ' Methods ', ' Mortality ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Newsletter ', ' extreme obesity ', ' Severe obesity ', ' Morbid Obesity ', ' web based ', ' online computer ', ' On-Line Systems ', ' Online Systems ', ' Pathology ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' pilot study ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' Publishing ', ' Quality Control ', ' Questionnaires ', ' Research ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Ships ', ' Socioeconomic Factors ', ' Woman ', ' Female Health ', "" Women's Health "", ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' Nonrespondent ', ' Blood Sample ', ' Blood specimen ', ' Specified ', ' Specific qualifier value ', ' Medical ', ' racism ', ' Link ', ' lung cancer ', ' Pulmonary malignant Neoplasm ', ' Pulmonary Cancer ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Lung ', ' Malignant neoplasm of lung ', ' Funding ', ' Collaborations ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Knowledge ', ' Scanning ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Source ', ' psychosocial ', ' Services ', ' success ', ' cohort ', ' Manuscripts ', ' Participant ', ' payment ', ' cancer genetics ', ' reproductive ', ' cancer registry ', ' neoplasm registry ', ' inherited factor ', ' genetic risk factor ', ' colon adenomatous polyp ', ' colon adenoma ', ' Colonic Adenomatous Polyp ', ' Colonic Adenoma ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' repository ', ' cancer diagnosis ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Large Intestine Adenoma ', ' Large Bowel Adenomatous Polyp ', ' Large Bowel Adenoma ', ' Colorectal Adenomatous Polyp ', ' Colorectal Adenoma ', ' Address ', ' Aliquot ', ' Breast Cancer Risk Factor ', ' Consent ', ' Data ', ' Cancer Cause ', ' Cancer Etiology ', ' Collection ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' nonmalignant ', ' Non-Malignant ', "" Nurses' Health Study "", ' Preparation ', ' Process ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' Shipping ', ' Colorectal Cancer ', ' Behavioral ', ' cost ', ' years of life lost to disease ', ' years of life lost to disability ', ' disease burden ', ' burden of disease ', ' burden of illness ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' twenty-one year old ', ' age 21 years ', ' age 21 ', ' 21 year old ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' nongenetic ', ' non-genetic ', ' biorepository ', ' biobank ', ' sharing data ', ' DNA Repository ', ' ']",NCI,BOSTON UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CAMPUS,UM1,2013,2686982,0.10153798357887506
"MULTILEVEL HEALTH PROMOTION IN AFRICAN AMERICAN CHURCHES     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposed study focuses on African Americans (AAs) - a population experiencing multiple health disparities. Promotion of healthy behaviors among AAs across the continuum of care from prevention to diagnosis and treatment services is critical to addressing AA health disparities. Black churches may be an ideal setting for health promotion interventions as they have extensive influence and reach in AA communities, high AA attendance rates, and a strong emphasis on health. Yet, limited studies exist on AA church-based health interventions that support a continuum of health services from prevention to linkage to care with church members and community members using church outreach services. This study focuses on planning, developing, and pilot testing an AA church-based multilevel health promotion intervention to address an AA health disparity. Using community-based participatory (CBPR) principles, our faith-health- community-academic partnership's (Heartland Health Network) CAB will assist in engaging faith and other community partners in all aspects of this study from setting the research agenda to pilot intervention development, implementation, evaluation, and dissemination of findings. In Year 1, the planning phase will consist of: a) conducting a needs assessment survey with 10 churches (n=450 adult church members total) and 10 health and community-based organizations (n=50 key stakeholders) to identify a health condition that disproportionately impacts AAs and feasible multilevel intervention strategies; b) holding a church/community forum to review needs assessment survey findings and explore facilitators/barriers and a plausible multilevel intervention strategies; and c) guided by the CAB and needs assessment findings, developing a culturally/religiously tailored, multilevel health promotion intervention that engages church health liaisons and health providers in promoting prevention, health screening, and linkage to care. In Years 2 and 3, a 2- or 3- arm pilot intervention will be tested with 6 AA churches (N=400 church and community members) assessed at baseline and 12-months. Post study focus groups will be conducted with church leaders and CAB members (n=40 total) to assess the CBPR process used in the study.         RELEVANCE: This study is the first to test a multilevel health promotion intervention in African American (AA) churches through delivery of prevention, health screening, and linkage to care services to AA church and community members. This model could have a significant public health impact by providing a faith community engagement model for implementing scalable, wide-reaching socio-ecological interventions and supporting AA faith leaders with a religiously and culturally-appropriate church-based intervention strategies and tools.                  ",MULTILEVEL HEALTH PROMOTION IN AFRICAN AMERICAN

"Decreased Fat Oxidation - Metabolic Inflexibility in African-American Women    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Mechanisms responsible for the racial disparity in obesity and Type 2 diabetes (T2DM) that are particularly apparent in African-American (AA) women compared to Caucasian women are not understood. While factors such as socioeconomic status and dietary habits likely play a role, emerging data suggests that differences in substrate utilization may contribute to these disparities. Evidence suggests that AA women are metabolically inflexible after an overnight fast, during exercise, or during high fat feeding, and do not increase fat oxidation to levels observed in Caucasian women. Low fat oxidation could result in redirection of lipid into adipose tissue for storage, as well as increased storage of triglyceride and lipotoxic metabolites within skeletal muscle, leading to insulin resistance (IR) and increased risk for development of diabetes. Greater insulin resistance is observed in AA women. These observations in AA compared to Caucasian women are similar to the metabolic inflexibility observed in obese insulin resistant compared to lean individuals. While AA women demonstrate IR, they have lower levels of visceral and hepatic lipid accumulation. This is a paradoxical finding as visceral and hepatic lipid stores are strong risk factors for IR and metabolic diseases. Taken together, the data suggests that IR is phenotypically distinct in AA compared to Caucasian women, and that the lower insulin sensitivity may be due differences in skeletal muscle, leading to peripheral IR. However, we could find no reports comparing hepatic and peripheral insulin sensitivity, and very limited data in AA women for skeletal muscle characteristics that have been demonstrated to be related to insulin resistance in obese and T2DM subjects. Limited data supports a role for increased muscle lipid accumulation in skeletal muscle and insulin resistance in AA women, but we could find no data on lipotoxic lipid levels or mitochondrial content in AA women. Based on these observations, our hypothesis is that inherent differences in skeletal muscle in AA women results in impaired fat oxidation and accumulation of lipid and lipid metabolites within skeletal muscle, and is a link between the development of obesity, insulin resistance and Type 2 diabetes in AA women.  To address this hypothesis we have developed 3 Aims: 1) Determine fat oxidation during sub-maximal exercise in AA and Caucasian women; 2) Determine lipid accumulation and skeletal muscle characteristics (e.g. muscle fiber type, capillary density, oxidative capacity, mitochondrial content) that have been shown to be related to insulin sensitivity; and 3) Assess insulin sensitivity (peripheral and hepatic), and examine the relationship between insulin sensitivity, fat oxidation and skeletal muscle characteristics. Before we can begin to tease apart environmental and genetic factors that play a role in racial differences in fat oxidation and insulin sensitivity, we need to gain a better understanding of the underlying physiology. The detailed in vivo and ex vivo evaluations we propose using state of the art techniques will provide detailed phenotype information that will provide valuable insight into the increased prevalence of Type II diabetes observed in AA women.        The likelihood of being obese or having diabetes is twice as high in African-American women compared to Caucasian women. Reasons for these health disparities are not understood, but growing evidence suggests that lower fat oxidation in AA women leads to accumulation of fat within skeletal muscle which can lead to the development of insulin resistance and diabetes. Before we can begin to understand the environmental and genetic factors that play a role in racial differences in obesity and diabetes, we need to gain a better understanding of the metabolism and skeletal muscle characteristics related to fat oxidation which may lead to the increased risk of development of metabolic diseases in AA women.

Furthermore, PCa in AA men is characterized by poor prognosis and dismal therapeutic outcomes. However, the mechanism/s associated with this health disparity remain unclear. Thus, identification of molecular mechanisms underlying such disparity is greatly desired in order to develop effective therapeutic and management approaches. It is becoming well appreciated that the chemokine-ligand axis is crucially involved in tumor cell trafficking and the development of organ-specific metastases, which is the major cause of PCa associated deaths. Our laboratory is the first to show that CC chemokine receptor 9 (CCR9) is selectively overexpressed in prostate cancers with negligible expression in normal prostate epithelia. Our exciting preliminary data show significantly higher expression of CCR9 in AA PCa cell lines and clinical samples compared to cell lines and clinical samples derived from EA. Furthermore, serum CCL25, which is natural ligand for CCR9 was higher in AA and PCa cell lines from AA (MDA-PCa-2b) and showed higher invasive and migratory potential as well as less response to chemotherapeutics in vitro compared to EA cell lines (C4-2b). Based upon these encouraging data, we hypothesize that CCR9-CCL25 axis underlies the poor prognosis and therapeutic outcome in AA men with PCa. To test our hypothesis, we propose to investigate the CCR9- CCL25 mediated mechanism associated with (i) aggressive cell phenotype in AA samples, (ii) homing and tumor growth in bone and the potential role of this chemokine-receptor axis in improving chemotherapeutic efficacy of clinical regimens in AA patients. We further aim to establish CCR9 as a biomarker for PCa progression and aggressive disease. To accomplish our aims, we have generated CCR9 anti-body against CCR9 and CCL25, which will be used to block this axis during in vitro assays to determine its role in migration, invasion, survival and chemoresistance; determining its potential role in metastasis as well as determining therapeutic efficacy of Docetaxel in vivo using AA and EA cell lines. In addition, siRNA duplexes or specific pharmacological inhibitors against CCR9 driven signaling molecules will be used to dissect the CCR9 mediated mechanism involved in migration, invasion, survival and chemoresistance. We are optimistic that the successful completion of these studies will define the role of this newly identified chemokine in PCa health disparity. Furthermore, it will enable the design and development of rational therapies directed against the CCR9-CCL25 to reduce/eliminate disparity in therapeutic outcomes.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Our goal is to determine the potential involvement of CC chemokine receptor-9 in disparity associated with poor disease and therapeutic outcome in African American patients. The outcomes of our study will (i) allow to determine the CCR9-mediated molecular pathways involved in PCa graveness and chemo resistant phenotypes, (ii) determine the CCR9-mediated mechanisms metastasis and (iii) establish the clinico- pathological significance of CCR9 in PCa health disparity. Our project will impact 1) development CCR9 expression as a new biomarker for aggressive disease and 2) therapeutic outcome of AA patients.            ",Role of chemokine receptor in disparities associated with prostate cancer progres,8585726,U01CA179701,"['Affect ', ' inhibitor ', ' inhibitor/antagonist ', ' Antibodies ', ' Behavior ', ' bone ', ' Surgical Castration ', ' Castration ', ' Cellular Growth ', ' Cellular Expansion ', ' cell growth ', ' cultured cell line ', ' Strains Cell Lines ', ' CellLine ', ' Cell Line ', ' Motility ', ' Cellular Motility ', ' Cellular Migration ', ' Cell Movement ', ' Cell Migration ', ' Cell Locomotion ', ' cell motility ', ' Cell Viability ', ' Cell Survival ', ' Cells ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' alpha-6-Deoxyoxytetracycline ', ' Vibramycin ', ' 2-Naphthacenecarboxamide, 4-(dimethylamino)-1,4,4a,5,5a,6,11,12a-octahydro-3,5,10,12,12a-pentahydroxy-6-methyl-1,11-dioxo-, (4S-(4alpha,4aalpha,5alpha,5aalpha,6alpha,12aalpha))- ', ' Doxycycline ', ' resistant to Drug ', ' resistance to Drug ', ' drug resistant ', ' Drug resistance ', ' Epithelium ', ' Exhibits ', ' Goals ', ' Immigrations ', ' In-Migration ', ' Immunohistochemistry Staining Method ', ' Immunohistochemistry Cell/Tissue ', ' Immunohistochemistry ', ' In Vitro ', ' Incidence ', ' Laboratories ', ' Ligands ', ' Luciferase Immunologic ', ' Luciferases ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Murine ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Mice ', ' Mus ', ' tumor cell metastasis ', ' cancer metastasis ', ' Tumor Cell Migration ', ' Secondary Tumor ', ' Secondary Neoplasm ', ' Metastatic Tumor ', ' Metastatic Neoplasm ', ' Metastasize ', ' Metastasis ', ' Neoplasm Metastasis ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Protein Phosphorylation ', ' Phosphorylation ', ' Play ', ' Prognosis ', ' outcome forecast ', ' Prostatic Gland ', ' Prostate Gland ', ' Prostate ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Testing ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Tissues ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' Mediating ', ' Programmed Cell Death ', ' Apoptosis Pathway ', ' Apoptosis ', ' base ', ' Organ ', ' neoplastic progression ', ' neoplasm progression ', ' cancer progression ', ' tumor progression ', ' improved ', ' Benign ', ' Clinical ', ' Blood Serum ', ' Serum ', ' insight ', ' European ', ' docetaxol ', ' Taxotere ', ' N-Debenzoyl-N-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)-10-deacetyltaxol ', ' docetaxel ', ' chemoattractant cytokine ', ' SIS cytokines ', ' Intercrines ', ' Homologous Chemotactic Cytokines ', ' Chemotactic Cytokines ', ' chemokine ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Staging ', ' Prostatic Cancer ', ' Prostate Cancer ', ' Prostate CA ', ' Malignant prostatic tumor ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Prostate ', ' Malignant neoplasm of prostate ', ' Event ', ' chemokine receptor ', ' interest ', ' American ', ' Tumor Cell ', ' neoplastic cell ', ' tumor growth ', ' trafficking ', ' novel ', ' CCR9 receptor ', ' CC chemokine receptor 9 ', ' GPR-9-6 receptor ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' siRNA ', ' Small Interfering RNA ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' TECK ', ' SCYA25 ', ' Ckb15 ', ' CCL25 ', ' CCL25 gene ', ' Data ', ' Molecular Target ', ' Preclinical Models ', ' Pre-Clinical Model ', ' prognostic indicator ', ' prognostic biomarker ', ' Prognosis Marker ', ' Molecular Marker of Prognosis ', ' Prognostic Marker ', ' in vitro Assay ', ' in vivo ', ' Signaling Molecule ', ' Monitor ', ' Molecular ', ' Knockout ', ' Knock-out ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' preclinical ', ' pre-clinical ', ' prostate cancer cell line ', ' PC3 ', ' PC3 cell line ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' clinical efficacy ', ' LNCaP ', ' therapy efficacy ', ' therapeutically effective ', ' therapeutic efficacy ', ' intervention efficacy ', ' Treatment Efficacy ', ' Outcome ', ' Homing ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' cancer disparity ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' resistant ', ' Resistance ', ' Therapeutic antibodies ', ' clinical relevance ', ' clinically relevant ', ' chemotherapy ', ' mouse model ', ' therapeutic target ', ' tumor ', ' overexpress ', ' overexpression ', ' public health relevance ', ' standard of care ', ' standard treatment ', ' standard care ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' Regimen ', ' prostate cancer cell ', ' castration resistant prostate cancer ', ' ']",NCI,MOREHOUSE SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,U01,2013,212250,0.03287733093380108
"Sustaining palliative care to drug users with HIV/AIDS & health disparities     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): With increasing HIV survival and disability, informal (unpaid) caregivers play a growing role in the well-being of persons living with HIV/AIDS (PLHAs), especially as they enter end of life (EOL). Major goals of palliative care (PC) programs are to enhance the quality of life (QOL) of patients and their families, optimize function, and facilitate patient-family decision making on EOL treatment and discussion with medical providers. African American (AA) injection drug users (IDUs) experience disparities in prevalence and outcomes of HIV, in part due to their suboptimal healthcare and treatment adherence, and have low access to PC. The PI's research indicates most AA IDU PLHAs have caregivers and that they play a key role in their healthcare, treatment adherence and mental health. Our preliminary findings also suggest AA IDU PLHAs' caregivers have major risks for burnout and early cessation of care. Research is needed to understand ways to promote AA IDU PLHAs' HIV care and facilitate discussion and mutual understanding of their treatment goals and EOL care preferences with caregivers and providers to ensure their and their caregivers' QOL. The proposed mixed methods, longitudinal study is based on a social ecological, network resource framework and builds on the study team's novel HIV caregiving research program, pediatric HIV PC clinic program, and research on patient- provider communication on EOL issues. Caregiving can be highly stressful, and costly of financial and social resources, which can lead to caregiver burnout (e.g., role overload, captivity) and cessation of care. Major risks of care cessation include recipients' late stage illness, intensive (personal) care needs, substance abuse and other problem behaviors, and caregivers' lack of social support. Preliminary findings from our recent Beacon study suggest caregivers of were highly involved in AA IDU PLHA care recipients' medical adherence and had a dearth of social support. And 79% of recipients reported pain, which was associated with illicit drug use, posing a potential threat to their caregiving relationship and QOL. The proposed study expands our caregiving research program into new areas of PC, EOL, and caregiver resiliencies. The study will comprise four long- term follow-up assessment of the Beacon sample (up to six years) and new recruits (n=400 dyads, half from Beacon); and a qualitative component exploring PC, EOL, and caregiving resiliencies from caregiver and recipient perspectives. The study will address some of the methodological and theoretical limitations of prior caregiving and PC research. The findings will inform the team's later development of interventions to promote AA IDU PLHA caregivers' and recipients' sustained care and QOL by potentially intervening at the dyad, support network or medical provider level.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Relevance Caregivers provide a range of assistance critical to PLHAs' palliative care (PC) and quality of life (QOL). Research is needed to understand how to sustain caregiving and caregivers' QOL through end of life (EOL) of vulnerable African American, injection drug using (IDU) PLHAs. The study represents an obvious next step to the new team's PC, EOL, and caregiving research by identifying barriers and facilitators to sustained HIV care, its impact on QOL, and implications to adult HIV PC practice.                ",Sustaining palliative care to drug users with HIV/AIDS & health disparities,8447232,R01NR014050,"['Clinic ', ' burn-out ', ' burnout ', ' burn-out ', '

"Social Determinants of Health for African American HIV-infected Mothers     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Significance: The vulnerability of African American HIV-infected mothers functions at the intersection of gender-, race-, and class-inequality; HIV-related stigma; and motherhood, requiring multidimensional and transdisciplinary approaches to address the complex social and economic conditions of their lives, collectively known as the social determinants of health. African American (AA) women suffer significantly higher HIV infection rates and tend to die earlier from their infection than their White counterparts. Poverty is a significant precipitating factor for HIV infection and AA women are disproportionately poorer than other subpopulations in the US. HIV-related stigma is linked to poorer mental and physical health outcomes across a broad range of demographic profiles. Being a mother adds an extra layer of social complexity to the lives of HIV-infected women. This descriptive study of AA HIV-infected mothers' unique social location and the intersection of the social determinants of health they experience is an essential step in understanding and addressing the disparity in their health outcomes. Purpose: This study aims to describe the intersection of gender-, race-, and class-inequality; HIV-related stigma; and motherhood specific to AA HIV-infected mothers and to describe how their unique social identity influences their health-related experiences. Methods: In this qualitative descriptive study I will identify 20-30 AA HIV-infected mothers and use participant- initiated photography in conjunction with in-depth qualitative interviewing to explore the intersection of the social determinants of health they experience. Participants will be recruited from the Infectious Diseases Clinics at Duke University Medical Center; the Durham County Health Department Early Intervention Clinic; the Wake County Health Department; the Infectious Diseases Clinic at the University of North Carolina Hospitals; and the Alliance of AIDS Services - Carolinas, Inc., using provider referral and recruitment flyers for self- referral. Summary: This study will help to generate hypotheses about how the described intersection operates to shape health behaviors and produce health outcomes for AA HIV-infected mothers and will identify what aspects of the problem might be measured, are amenable to change, and can be meaningfully addressed by intervention.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: African American mothers with HIV are sicker and die earlier than other groups with HIV. In order to improve the health of these women and their children, it is important to identify why they are not as healthy. This study will help describe the social and financial factors that shape these mother's lives and affect their health.            ",Social Determinants of Health for African American HIV-infected Mothers,8602619,F31NR014628,"['University Medical Centers ', ' Academic Medical Centers ', ' Acquired Immunologic Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immuno-Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency ', ' AIDS ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome ', ' Affect ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Infectious Disorder ', ' Infectious Diseases and Manifestations ', ' Infectious Diseases ', ' Infectious Disease Pathway ', ' Communicable Diseases ', ' Economical Conditions ', ' Economic Conditions ', ' Economics ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' HIV Infections ', ' Hospitals ', ' Infection ', ' interventions research ', ' intervention research ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' Interview ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Methods ', ' Mothers ', ' Persons ', ' North Carolina ', ' Photography ', ' Poverty ', ' Precipitating Factors ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' recruit ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Societal Conditions ', ' Social Conditions ', ' Social Identity ', ' Social Identification ', ' Stress ', ' Time ', ' Universities ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' World Health Organization ', ' County ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', ' Female Health ', "" Women's Health "", ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Research Methods ', ' Research Methodology ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' improved ', ' Link ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Predisposition ', ' Individual ', ' Inequality ', ' Early Intervention ', ' Shapes ', ' motherhood ', ' Life ', ' Complex ', ' Clinic ', ' Location ', ' physical health ', ' physical conditioning ', ' Services ', ' experience ', ' Participant ', ' Prevention ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' HIV/AIDS problem ', ' HIV/AIDS ', ' AIDS/HIV ', ' AIDS/HIV problem ', ' girls ', ' response ', ' stigma ', ' social stigma ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' Provider ', ' Address ', ' Qualitative Methods ', ' Transmission ', ' transmission process ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomic ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio economic ', ' socioeconomics ', ' violence against women ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' public health relevance ', ' social implication ', ' social health determinants ', ' ']",NINR,DUKE UNIVERSITY,F31,2013,42232,0.07772809314903893
"Personalized Bio-behavioral Weight Loss Intervention for African American Women     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This K01 Mentored Research Scientist Development Award proposal is designed to provide the scholarly training, mentorship, and resources necessary for the candidate to develop expertise in bio-behavioral research. The candidate's primary career goal is to become a funded independent investigator and recognized leader in the field of obesity prevention/treatment with expertise in developing personalized bio-behavioral weight loss interventions for African American (AA) women. To achieve this goal, a focused career development plan is proposed to: 1) Obtain knowledge and skills in understanding how genetic variants may be related to adiposity; modulate influence of lifestyle behaviors (i.e.PA, diet) upon changes in adiposity, and how these genotypes may eventually be used to help personalize behavioral interventions for obese AA women; 2) Obtain knowledge and skills in complex quantitative research methods, including bio-behavioral research designs and analyses, and advanced intervention development; and, 3) Enhance grant and scholarly writing skills, and manuscript production while continuing to build interdisciplinary collaboration with other researchers in the field of genetics, obesity and prevention research. The Medical University of South Carolina provides a comprehensive training environment that includes senior scientists with expertise in bio-behavioral interventions, genetics, and health disparities research. The candidate has a strong inter-professional and inter-institutional mentoring team with complementary expertise in the development of community based randomized controlled trials (RCT), genetics, obesity prevention and treatment, bio-behavioral interventions, biostatistics and epidemiology. The research plan, which builds on the training objectives, is directly responsive to the National Institute of Nursing Research's (NINR) mission of integrating the biological and behavioral sciences, employing new technologies to research questions, improving research methods, and developing the scientists of the future. The broad goal of this research is to identify key components for development of efficacious socio-culturally tailored behavioral interventions for long-term weight loss in low socioeconomic status (SES) obese AA women. The socio-cultural preferences will be incorporated into behavioral change strategies, the communication of genetic information, and the adaptation of the format and delivery of the evidence-based Diabetes Prevention Program materials and approaches to promote weight loss. To meet this goal, the candidate will conduct an exploratory study using genetic database secondary data analyses. Secondly, an intervention development phase, with 80 obese AA women living in public housing neighborhoods in the Charleston, SC region, to integrate new knowledge and skills from genetics while advancing skills in bio- behavioral research intervention development and methodology. The results of the proposed preliminary studies will inform a larger, adequately powered and resourced community based RCT for obese AA women that incorporates the use of genetic information and socio-cultural preferences to prescribe tailored weight loss strategies and promote long-term weight loss outcomes.          This innovative research plan addresses the need to integrate genetics, socio-environmental, and behavioral factors into promising multi-level community based interventions for disparate minority communities. Demonstrating that genetic and social-environmental components are important in designing and delivering obesity interventions is crucial. Further, gaining better understanding of predictors of obesity and obesity promoting behaviors in AA women could lead to changes in the selection and personalization of treatment approaches for obese AA women, and ultimately, improved outcomes for this population.

"Prosaposin: A Novel Biomarker of Prostate Cancer Progression in African Americans  Prostate cancer (PCa), the second leading cause of cancer-related death in US men, presents the greatest racial disparity of any malignant disease in African Americans, with a 1.6-1.9 times higher incidence rate and 2- 3 times higher mortality rate than Caucasians. PCa in African Americans presents with more advanced clinical stages and aggressive tumors. PCa biomarkers are needed to improve early detection of clinically significant tumors and to distinguish indolent or slow growing tumors from more aggressive ones. In our search for tumor markers, we cloned prosaposin (PSAP) as a secreted protein and discovered its overexpression in metastatic PCa cells and tissues. Previously, we demonstrated that PSAP and/or its active molecular derivatives increase migration and invasion and upregulate matrix-degrading proteolytic enzymes expression in PCa cells. In Caucasians, serum-PSAP levels are increased in metastatic PCa when compared to primary PCa or normal prostate tissues. In addition, there was no difference in serum-PSAP levels between organ-confined and locally-invasive tumors. In contrast to Caucasians, our pilot study in African Americans shows that a) tissue expression of PSAP is significantly higher in undifferentiated tumors with Gleason grade 4/5 pattern than in the differentiated tumors with Gleason grade d 3 or benign glands (BPH) and b) serum-PSAP levels are higher in locally invasive (stage III/IV) tumors than in the organ-confined (stage I/II) tumors which positively correlates with disease progression. Based on these observations, we hypothesized that PSAP contributes to PCa progression and has the characteristics of a novel biomarker discriminating the aggressive tumors from non- aggressive ones in African American patients. To test our hypothesis, we propose the following Aims: 1) Define the clinical significance of serum-PSAP as a marker of PCa progression or aggressiveness in African Americans; 2) Determine the association between tissue expression of PSAP and clinical and histopathological predictors or prognosticators of PCa progression or aggressiveness in African Americans; and 3) Determine the association between PSAP and invasive and metastatic phenotypes in PSAP-overexpressed or -silenced African American PCa cells. We will use immunohistochemical analysis and sandwich-ELISA assays to quantify PSAP expression levels in a large pool of tissue and serum samples and to determine their association with clinicohistopathological predictors or prognosticators of PCa aggressiveness and progression in African Americans. We will also test the effect of increased or decreased PSAP expression on tumor growth rate and spontaneous metastatic ability in subcutaneous and orthotopic tumor xenografts in African American- derived PCa cells. At the conclusion of this proposal, we will have defined the clinical and histopathological significance of PSAP as a biomarker of PCa progression and/or aggressiveness in African Americans that could be further utilized in clinical development.  The incidences, mortality, and aggressiveness of prostate cancer (PCa) in African American (AA) men are higher than in Caucasians. To improve early detection of clinically significant tumors and to discriminate indolent or slow growing tumors from more aggressive ones, reliable prognostic factors or biomarkers are needed. An in-depth investigation of our preliminary discovery of a high expression of prosaposin (PSAP) levels in locally invasive and/or metastatic PCa cells, tissues, and serum samples from AA men would provide us with the clinical and histopathological values of this molecule as a biomarker for PCa screenings, diagnoses, or post-treatment follow up in AAs.",Prosaposin: A Novel Biomarker of Prostate Cancer Progression in African Americans,8501024,R01MD005824,"['Affect ', ' post treatment ', ' After-Treatment ', ' After Care ', ' Aftercare ', ' Age ', ' Behavior ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Biological Assay ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' white race ', ' Occidental ', ' Caucasoid ', ' Caucasian Race ', ' Caucasian ', ' Caucasoid Race ', ' cultured cell line ', ' Strains Cell Lines ', ' CellLine ', ' Cell Line ', ' Motility ', ' Cellular Motility ', ' Cellular Migration ', ' Cell Movement ', ' Cell Migration ', ' Cell Locomotion ', ' cell motility ', ' Cell Viability ', ' Cell Survival ', ' Cells ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Diagnosis ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' ELISA ', ' Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay ', ' ECM ', ' Cell-Extracellular Matrix ', ' Extracellular Matrix ', ' healthcare service availability ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare access availability ', ' health services availability ', ' health care service availability ', ' health care service access ', ' health care availability ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Availability of Health Services ', ' Accessibility of health care ', ' Access to Healthcare ', ' Access to Health Care ', ' Access to Care ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' In Vitro ', ' Incidence ', ' Laboratories ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Athymic Nude Mouse ', ' Athymic Mice ', ' Nude Mice ', ' Mortality ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' tumor cell metastasis ', ' cancer metastasis ', ' Tumor Cell Migration ', ' Secondary Tumor ', ' Secondary Neoplasm ', ' Metastatic Tumor ', ' Metastatic Neoplasm ', ' Metastasize ', ' Metastasis ', ' Neoplasm Metastasis ', ' Patients ', ' Proteolytic Enzymes ', ' Proteinases ', ' Proteases ', ' Peptidases ', ' Esteroproteases ', ' Peptide Hydrolases ', ' Phenotype ', ' pilot study ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' Prostatic Gland ', ' Prostate Gland ', ' Prostate ', ' gene product ', ' Proteins ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Stains ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Tissues ', ' TM-MKR ', ' Tumor Markers ', ' Caucasians ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' base ', ' Organ ', ' neoplastic progression ', ' neoplasm progression ', ' cancer progression ', ' tumor progression ', ' improved ', ' Prostatovesiculectomy ', ' Radical Prostatectomy ', ' Benign ', ' Clinical ', ' Malignant ', ' Malignant -

"Racial Disparities in Breast Cancer and the role of micro-RNAs     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There is a racial disparity in the breast cancer outcomes between African-American (AA) and Caucasian (CA) women. For example, mortality rates for breast cancer in AA women can be three times higher than for CA, even though the incidence is lower in AA women (1). AA women develop triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) at earlier age, more often diagnosed with advanced stage, likely to experience metastasis and often unresponsive to treatment compared to CA women (1, 2). Although some patients respond to chemotherapy, initially, tumor recurrence within 1 to 3 years post chemotherapy with high incidence of mortality occurring by 5 years (3). Our research group and others have reported that cancer stem-like cells (CSCs or tumor initiating cells), which are characterized by their self-renewal and resistance to therapy leading to tumor recurrence and metastasis, are particularly abundant in women with TNBC compared to those with other types of breast cancer (4, 5). We have also observed that isolated CSCs in CRL-2335 and MDA-MB468 cell lines derived from AA TNBC patients (i) showed significantly longer survival and the ability to form mammospheres compared to those CSCs in MDA-MB-231 and BT549 cell lines derived from CA TNBC patients (ii) after treatment with cisplatin plus tumor-necrosis factor (TNF)-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL), exhibited decreased expression of miR-100 and miR-23b and significant increase in FZD8, one of the Wnt receptors (also a target for miR-100) which plays a major role in CSC renewal, as compared to those seen in MDA-MB-231 and BT549 cell lines derived from CA TNBC patients. Hence, we hypothesized that differences in the self- renewal of cancer stem cells (CSCs) contributes to the racial disparities in TNBC. In order to test our hypothesis, we have two specific aims: Aim 1: Determine the role of CSCs in TNBC in African-American women compared to Caucasian women. Aim 2: Develop a new tumor model to address the role of microRNAs (miR-100 and miR-23b) in CSCs self- renewal, tumor progression and treatment in vivo. Successful completion of the proposed studies will give insights into the molecular biology of CSCs and their role, if any, in racial differences between AA and CA TNBC patients and, also provide new targets for their elimination for effective therapy.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: There is a racial disparity in the breast cancer outcomes between African-American (AA) and Caucasian (CA) women.

"Epigenetic and Biobehavioral Determinants of Preterm Birth in Black Women     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Preterm birth (PTB, birth prior to 37 weeks' gestation) is a leading cause of infant mortality. Of the known risk factors for PTB, among the strongest is African American (AA) race. Compared to Caucasians, AA women have more than 1.5 times the risk of PTB (16.8% vs. 10.5%). The proposed research will investigate whether specific bio behavioral factors linked to PTB influence the epigenetic regulation of genes to promote PTB in AA women. This research will contribute to a bio psychosocial understanding of within-race risk for PTB, providing insight into important risk and protective factors relevant to AA women. The proposed research is consistent with frameworks for eliminating racial disparities, which recognize the need to study risks within-race as a vital first step, and is congruent with the National Institute of Minority Health and Health Disparities goal of promoting understanding of the biological mechanisms involved in conditions that disproportionately affect health disparity populations.  To evaluate the hypothesis that epigenetic mechanisms mediate the relationship between specific bio behavioral factors and PTB for AA women, the proposed study will leverage bio behavioral and biologic data from an on-going longitudinal study of preterm birth in AA women (R01 NR014800) that is enrolling a socioeconomically diverse cohort of H 960 pregnant AA women and collecting data during prenatal care appointments (at 10-14 and 26-30 weeks' gestation) and at delivery. Using a nested case-control approach, cases are designated as those who experience PTB (an estimated 125 cases) and controls as those who experience a term birth. Building from this study design, we will: (1) characterize PBMC DNA methylation and RNA expression patterns over the course of pregnancy among AA women who deliver preterm and at term; (2) identify bio behavioral factors - including nutritional status, stress, an reproductive tract infections - that influence patterns of peripheral DNA methylation and RNA expression; (3) evaluate associations between PTB and both DNA methylation and RNA expression among AA women that are independent of the bio behavioral factors and (4) determine whether these epigenetic differences can be detected in the second and/or third trimester. The success of this research is supported by a multidisciplinary collaboration of clinicians, basic and translational scientists representing expertise in obstetrical outcomes and maternal-child health, genetics and epigenetics, nutrition, stress, epidemiology and informatics; the overlap of key personnel for the proposed study and the on-going R01 'Bio behavioral Determinants of the Micro biome and Preterm Birth for Black Women'; and support from Emory University's Clinical and Translational Science Institute (CTSA award # NIH UL1TR000454). Finally, Atlanta is home to AA women of broad socioeconomic status who are served by Emory's affiliated delivery hospitals, allowing for sufficient variation in the bio behavioral factrs under study to distinguish independent and interactive effects on DNA methylation and, ultimately, on the risk of PTB.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Preterm birth (PTB) occurs at unacceptably high rates in the United States, with African American (AA) women disproportionately affected. The proposed research will investigate whether bio behavioral factors linked to PTB influence the regulation and expression of genes to promote PTB in AA women. We will focus our investigation on bio behavioral factors that affect the inflammatory pathway - including poor nutritional status, stress and reproductive tract infections -- as, according to the Institute of Medicine, inflammation predominantly contributes to the excessive rates of PTB experienced by AA women. This research will contribute to a bio psychosocial understanding of within-race risk for PTB, providing insight into important risk and protective factors relevant to AA women who disproportionately experience PTB.                ",Epigenetic and Biobehavioral Determinants of Preterm Birth in Black Women,8775415,R01MD009064,"['Accounting ', ' Affect ', ' Appointment ', ' Award ', ' Biology ',

"A Follow-up Study for Causes of Cancer in Black Women     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Black Women's Health Study (BWHS), the largest follow-up study for cancer in African American (AA) women, began in 1995 when 59,000 women (median age, 38) from across the U.S. enrolled. The BWHS has successfully followed participants with biennial questionnaires for data on incident disease and medical, reproductive, behavioral, psychosocial, and socioeconomic factors, linked addresses to U.S. census data, and are currently linking to air pollution data. Cancer diagnoses are validated by pathology data from hospitals and cancer registries. A DNA bio repository was established through collection of cheek cell samples from 26,800 participants. Despite initial slow accrual of cancers due to the young age of participants at entry, the BWHS has published extensively on risk factors for breast cancer; sufficient cases of lung cancer, colorectal cancer, and colon adenomas are now available. We propose to (1) continue follow-up/data collection; (2) establish a repository of 17,800 blood samples; (3) share data/samples in consortia projects. Continuation of the BWHS is highly desirable: 90% of participants are still cancer-free; follow-up has been successful and unbiased; the cohort has reached ages at which cancer incidence increases markedly; effects of exposures (e.g., severe obesity, racism) that are less common in other populations can be studied; the DNA has made valuable contributions to genetic cancer studies and is a major replication source for studies of breast cancer and related phenotypes in AA and other groups; the BWHS is a key contributor to consortia projects of rarer cancers in /\As; and the BWHS has been highly productive. Because levels of many blood markers are unfavorable among AAs and few studies of blood biomarkers in relation to cancer incidence have been carried out specifically in /\As, we propose to establish a repository of blood samples in the BWHS. A successful pilot study demonstrated the feasibility of our methods and participation was unbiased and similar to that in other large follow-up studies. The repository will increase by 60% the limited number of AA women with available blood samples being followed in U.S. cancer cohort studies. AA women continue to be disproportionately affected by many cancers. Continuation of the BWHS will permit continuation of its valuable contributions to understanding cancer etiology in this understudied group. A blood repository will greatly increase the value of the BWHS resource by permitting studies that help to fill the knowledge gap about the relation of biomarkers to cancer incidence and survival in AAs. The assessment of serious nonmalignant illnesses in the BWHS enhances the value of this resource at no cost to the study of cancer.              Incidence and mortality rates of many cancers and other illnesses confinue to be disproportionately high  among AA women. The Black Women's Health Study, a follow-up study of 59,000 AA women, has  contributed important information on risk factors for cancer. Continued follow-up, the collection of blood  samples, and participation of the BWHS in collaborafive studies, including studies of rare cancers, will  produce valuable informafion on risk factors for cancers and other illnesses that burden AA women.",A Follow-up Study for Causes of Cancer in Black Women,8735097,UM1CA164974,"['abstracting ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' Air Pollution ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Blood ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Cells ', ' Censuses ', ' Cheek ', ' Bucca ', ' Cheek structure ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Collection ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' DNA ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Genotype ', ' Health ', ' Hospitals ', ' Incidence ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Income ', ' Laboratories ', ' Mails ', ' Medical Records ', ' Methods ', ' Mortality ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Newsletter ', ' extreme obesity ', ' Severe obesity ', ' Morbid Obesity ', ' web based ', ' online computer ', ' On-Line Systems ', ' Online Systems ', ' Pathology ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' pilot study ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' Publishing ', ' Quality Control ', ' Questionnaires ', ' Research ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Ships ', ' Socioeconomic Factors ', ' Woman ', ' Female Health ', "" Women's Health "", ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' Nonrespondent ', ' Blood Sample ', ' Blood specimen ', ' Specified ', ' Specific qualifier value ', ' Medical ', ' racism ', ' Link ', ' lung cancer ', ' Pulmonary malignant Neoplasm ', ' Pulmonary Cancer ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Lung ', ' Malignant neoplasm of lung ', ' Funding ', ' Collaborations ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Knowledge ', ' Scanning ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Source ', ' psychosocial ', ' Services ', ' success ', ' cohort ', ' Manuscripts ', ' Participant ', ' payment ', ' cancer genetics ', ' reproductive ', ' cancer registry ', ' neoplasm registry ', ' inherited factor ', ' genetic risk factor ', ' colon adenomatous polyp ', ' colon adenoma ', ' Colonic Adenomatous Polyp ', ' Colonic Adenoma ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' repository ', ' cancer diagnosis ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Large Intestine Adenoma ', ' Large Bowel Adenomatous Polyp ', ' Large Bowel Adenoma ', ' Colorectal Adenomatous Polyp ', ' Colorectal Adenoma ', ' Address ', ' Aliquot ', ' Breast Cancer Risk Factor ', ' Consent ', ' Data ', ' Cancer Cause ', ' Cancer Etiology ', ' Collection ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' nonmalignant ', ' Non-Malignant ', "" Nurses' Health Study "", ' Preparation ', ' Process ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' Shipping ', ' Colorectal Cancer ', ' Behavioral ', ' cost ', ' years of life lost to disease ', ' years of life lost to disability ', ' disease burden ', ' burden of disease ', ' burden of illness ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' twenty-one year old ', ' age 21 years ', ' age 21 ', ' 21 year old ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' nongenetic ', ' non-genetic ', ' biorepository ', ' biobank ', ' sharing data ', ' DNA Repository ', ' ']",NCI,BOSTON UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CAMPUS,UM1,2014,2756157,0.10153798357887506
"Behavioral and Social Science Research on Understanding and Reducing Health Dispa    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Numerous studies have documented the existence of marked racial/ethnic disparities in the utilization of joint replacement in the management of osteoarthritis (OA). African-Americans (AA) are about 40 percent less likely than white patients to receive joint replacement for lower extremity OA, and this disparity is enduring based on the latest report from the CDC. Our research team published evidence demonstrating that, compared to similar white patients, AA candidates for joint replacement differ in their preferences for joint replacement and that these differences are primarily shaped by differences in knowledge and understanding about the treatment risks/benefits and expectations about surgical outcomes. Furthermore, doctor-patient communication for preference-sensitive treatments such as joint replacement is bi-directional and the content of the communication and the decisions are influenced by patient's baseline attitudes and preferences as well as their ability to engage in the discussion. There is preliminary evidence that baseline differences in preference, knowledge, and expectations regarding this treatment impact the quality of communication between AA patients and orthopaedic surgeons and consequently reduce AA patients' likelihood of receiving a recommendation for joint replacement. More research is needed to assess specific interventions to help empower AA patients in their communication with orthopaedic surgeons and improve their likelihood of receiving a recommendation for knee replacement when clinically indicated. We propose a randomized controlled trial is to assess the effect of a high-quality, evidence-based, patient-centered educational intervention supplemented with targeted counseling on the quality of communication between AA patients and orthopaedic surgeons and on the likelihood of receiving a recommendation for knee joint replacement when clinically indicated. AA patients who are potential candidates for knee joint replacement who have been referred to orthopaedic surgery will be randomized to undergo either an educational intervention using the Knee OA Decision Aid (DA) supplemented with brief counseling using the Motivational Interviewing (MI) technique or an attention control treatment. We will assess the effect of the intervention on quality of doctor- patient communication and likelihood of receiving a recommendation for knee joint replacement within 6 months of the intervention. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that orthopaedic surgeon-patient communication and decision-making about joint replacement can be improved by better informing the patients using a high quality, evidence-based, patient-centered educational intervention delivered at the time of decision-making. Therefore, the primary specific aims of this proposal are: 1) To examine the effect of the intervention on the AA patient's quality of communication with the orthopaedic surgeon, and 2) To examine the effect of the intervention on the likelihood of receiving a recommendation for knee joint replacement when clinically indicated.        Numerous studies have documented the existence of marked racial/ethnic disparities in the utilization of knee replacement, an effective and highly utilized treatment option for advanced knee osteoarthritis. This study will provide one of the first patient-centered interventions in the orthopedic setting designed to mitigate racial/ethnic disparity in access to joint replacement for patients who meet clinical indications for the treatment. The results of this study will not only inform the nation on strategies to reduce or eliminate one of most marked disparities in chronic disease management, but will also provide opportunities to improve quality of care for large segment of our society.

"Molecular determinant of racial disparity in prostate cancer     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Significant disparity in the incidence and clinical outcome of prostate cancer (PCa) exist between African- American (AA) men and their European American (EA) counterparts. Despite this recognition, we have not made a major leap in our understanding of the molecular causes associated with such disparity. This proposal is built upon our strong preliminary data on a proto-oncogene, Myb, which has remained largely unexplored in PCa. Our novel findings demonstrate that 1) Myb expression is significantly elevated in AA PCa with greater overall incidence as compared to EA PCa, 2) low intensity expression of Myb is also detected in some of the benign prostate tissues (BPH) from AA patients, while no expression is detected in EA BPH, 3) AA PCa cell lines (MDaPCa-2b and RC-77/T) exhibit high Myb expression and significant resistance to hormone-depletion and docetaxel (DTX) toxicity, 4) AA PCa cells also display high growth, migratory and invasive potential, which is associated with Myb overexpression, and 5) Myb interacts with AR and modulates the expression of androgen-responsive gene, KLK3/PSA, suggesting their cooperative role in gene regulation. Based on these promising findings, we hypothesize that relative greater incidence and overall expression of Myb in AA PCa cells underlies their inherently greater propensity to metastasize and evade therapeutic intervention. To test this hypothesis, we are proposing three specific aims. In aim 1, we will investigate the role of Myb in PCa aggressiveness and therapy-resistance. Using luciferase-tagged, Myb-overexpressing or -silenced, paired AA and EA PCa cell lines, we will examine the functional association of Myb with PCa growth and metastasis, and their response to castration- and docetaxel- therapies in an orthotopic mouse model. In Aim 2, we will examine the functional consequences of Myb-AR interaction and identify their downstream consequences. We will specifically examine whether Myb has a role in AR localization and transcriptional activation. Furthermore, we will assess the effect of Myb on transcriptional reprogramming of AR by using state of the art RNA-Seq and ChIP-Seq approaches. We will determine the shared and independent targets of Myb and AR in PCa cells and examine if Myb alters AR target gene specificity. In Aim 3, we will determine the clinical relevance of Myb in racial disparity associated with PCa. We will perform immunohistochemical (IHC) analysis to assess Myb and AR expression and localization (cytoplasmic vs. nuclear) in PCa, adjacent BPH, and uninvolved normal tissues from both AA and EA cases. We will then examine their correlation (alone and in combination) with race, tumor grade, metastasis incidence, PSA levels, and patient's survival. Together, these studies will provide experimental, mechanistic and clinical evidence for the role of Myb in aggressive behavior and therapeutic- resistance of PCa, and support the association of Myb with observed racial disparity. In the long-term, the resulting information will be useful in reducing the racial disparities in clinical outcomes of PCa by establishing the clinical utility of Myb as a risk predictor and/or therapeutic target for effective disease management.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Main barrier in achieving progress toward racial disparities reduction in prostate cancer is our limited understanding of the underlying molecular basis. The proposed research will examine the functional and clinical significance of Myb overexpression in prostate cancer aggressiveness and therapeutic resistance, the two major reasons for the poor clinical outcome of African American (AA) patients. The outcomes of our study will allow distinction between clinically indolent and aggressive prostate tumors, and pave the way for novel target-based therapies, which will ultimately reduce the enhanced burden of prostate cancer on African American population and improve overall survival of prostate cancer patients.            ",Molecular determinant of racial disparity in prostate cancer,8687364,U01CA185490,"['Affect ', ' Aggression ', ' Aggressive behavior ', ' Therapeutic Androgen ', ' Androgenic Compounds ', ' Androgenic Agents ', ' Androgens ', ' Surgical Castration ', ' Castration ', ' Cells ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Exhibits ', ' Gene Regulation Process ', ' Gene Regulation ', ' Gene Action Regulation ', ' Gene Expression Regulation ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Growth ', ' Therapeutic Hormone ', ' Endocrine Gland Secretion ', ' Chemotherapy-Hormones/Steroids ', ' Hormones ', ' Incidence ', ' Ligands ', ' Luciferase Immunologic ', ' Luciferases ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Mortality ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' tumor cell metastasis ', ' cancer metastasis ', ' Tumor Cell Migration ', ' Secondary Tumor ', ' Secondary Neoplasm ', ' Metastatic Tumor ', ' Metastatic Neoplasm ', ' Metastasize ', ' Metastasis ', ' Neoplasm Metastasis ', ' Patients ', ' Play ', ' Prostatic Gland ', ' Prostate Gland ', ' Prostate ', ' Prostatic Neoplasia ', ' Prostate Tumor ', ' Prostate Neoplasms ', ' Prostatic Neoplasms ', ' protooncogene ', ' c-ONC ', ' Cellular Oncogene ', ' Proto-Oncogenes ', ' Publishing ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Androgen Receptor ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Socioeconomic Factors ', ' Specificity ', ' thymus derived lymphocyte ', ' Thymus-Dependent Lymphocytes ', ' T-Cells ', ' T-Lymphocyte ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Tissues ', ' Relative ', ' Relative (related person) ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' hK3 Kallikrein ', ' gamma-Seminoprotein ', ' Seminin ', ' Semenogelase ', ' Prostate Specific Antigen Preproprotein ', ' Plasma Prekallikrein ', ' Plasma Kallikrein Precursor ', ' P-30 Antigen ', ' Kallikrein 3 ', ' EC 3.4.21.34 ', ' Prostate-Specific Antigen ', ' Transcription Activation ', ' Transcriptional Activation ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Benign ', ' Clinical ', ' Malignant ', ' Malignant - descriptor ', ' insight ', ' Indolent ', ' European ', ' Gene Targeting ', ' docetaxol ', ' Taxotere ', ' N-Debenzoyl-N-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)-10-deacetyltaxol ', ' docetaxel ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Normal Tissue ', ' Normal tissue morphology ', ' Prostatic Cancer ', ' Prostate Cancer ', ' Prostate CA ', ' Malignant prostatic tumor ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Prostate ', ' Malignant neoplasm of prostate ', ' Disorder Management ', ' Disease Management ', ' programs ', ' Frequency ', ' Frequencies (time pattern) ', ' Nuclear ', ' American ', ' receptor expression ', ' Toxicities ', ' Toxic effect ', ' novel ', ' nosology ', ' disorder classification ', ' disease classification ', ' Modality ', ' Pathogenesis ', ' Reporting ', ' intervention therapy ', ' Therapeutic Intervention ', ' response ', ' Sequence-Specific Posttranscriptional Gene Silencing ', ' RNAi ', ' RNA Silencing ', ' Quelling ', ' Posttranscriptional Gene Silencing ', ' Post-Transcriptional Gene Silencing ', ' RNA Interference ', ' Tissue Sample ', ' KLKB1 ', ' KLK3 ', ' KLK3 gene ', ' Data ', ' Receptor Signaling ', ' Cancer Patient ', ' Characteristics ', ' Molecular ', ' Process ', ' vector ', ' prostate cancer cell line ', ' PC3 ', ' PC3 cell line ', ' LNCaP ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' cancer disparity ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' resistant ', ' Resistance ', ' clinical relevance ', ' clinically relevant ', ' clinical significance ', ' clinically significant ', ' mouse model ', ' therapeutic target ', ' tumor ', ' overexpress ', ' overexpression ', ' public health relevance ', ' Chip sequencing ', ' Chip seq ', ' RNA-seq ', ' transcriptome sequencing ', ' prostate cancer cell ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH ALABAMA,U01,2014,313325,-0.042979467301040394
"Behaviors Related to Cancer Risk Among African-American College Students     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): African Americans (AAs) experience profound health disparities in cancer-related risk factors, incidence, and mortality compared to non-Hispanic whites. Cancer risk-related behaviors that are adopted during adolescence and young adulthood, including among college students, are more likely to be sustained later in life. There has been limited attention given to factors that influence the adoption of cancer-related health risk behaviors in AAs attending Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU's), despite evidence that AAs are at greater risk for adopting health risk behaviors such as smoking, alcohol use, risky sexual behaviors, and illicit drug use during college years in comparison to students attending majority institutions. The overall goal of this R03 feasibility study is to determine the incidence of cancer risk-related behaviors among first-year students attending an HBCU and to examine predictors of adoption of those behaviors, including mental health indicators (i.e., depression and stress), religiosity/spirituality, risk perceptions, health literay, peer and familial influences and access to care. First-year students (n=300) will complete study measures that assess these variables during the fall semester (baseline) and at 6 months post-baseline. The prevalence and adoption of health risk behaviors will be evaluated longitudinally, and factors that predict or correlate with those behaviors will be examined. Results will help guide much needed basic behavioral research in this target population, including the development of sustainable interventions to prevent the adoption of health risk behaviors by young AAs. Importantly, this study will establish an ongoing research partnership with Prairie View A&M University that will facilitate future studies on this campus, which ultimately can be disseminated to other HBCU populations, both public and private.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The aims of this R03 feasibility study are to assess the adoption of health risk behaviors related to cancer among a cohort of African American college students attending a rural Historically Black College, Prairie View A&M University, and to examine factors associated with behavior adoption including mental health indicators (i.e., depression, stress), religiosity/spirituality, risk perceptions, health literacy, peer, familial an neighborhood influences, and access to care. Survey data (n=300) will be collected at the beginning of their first semester of freshman year (baseline) and 6 months later. This study will generate baseline indicators for incidence of health risk behaviors among AA college students, and lead to a better understanding of predictors which may increase adoption of health risk behaviors. Results will contribute to the future development of novel health risk behavior interventions for AA college students, an understudied population.            ",Behaviors Related to Cancer Risk Among African-American College Students,8656081,R03CA171835,"['teenage ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' Adolescence ', ' Adoption ', ' etoh use ', ' ethanol use ', ' ethanol product use ', ' ethanol intake ', ' ethanol ingestion ', ' ethanol drinking ', ' ethanol consumption ', ' alcoholic drink intake ', ' alcoholic beverage consumption ', ' alcohol use ', ' alcohol product use ', ' alcohol intake ', ' alcohol ingestion ', ' alcohol consumed ', ' EtOH drinking ', ' Alcohol Drinking ', ' Alcohol consumption ', ' Attention ', ' Behavior ', ' lifestyle modification ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' behavior intervention ', ' Life Style Modification ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' Behavioral Research ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Communities ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' dietary ', ' Diet ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Ethnic group ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' Family ', ' Feasibility Studies ', ' Female ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' healthcare service availability ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare access availability ', ' health services availability ', ' health care service availability ', ' health care service access ', ' health care availability ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Availability of Health Services ', ' Accessibility of health care ', ' Access to Healthcare ', ' Access to Health Care ', ' Access to Care ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' Incidence ', ' Infection ', ' wart virus ', ' Infectious Human Wart Virus ', ' Human Papilloma Virus ', ' HPV ', ' Human Papillomavirus ', ' Health Insurance ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity -

"A Faith-Based Partnership to Address Obesity in African American families     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): ABSTRACT Obesity continues to be highly prevalent in the African American (AA) population, affecting nearly 40% of AA men and a staggering 59% of AA women. Unfortunately this trend is also present in AA children and adolescents; recent data indicate obesity prevalence in AA children and adolescents (age 2 - 19) to be 24.3% compared to 16.1% of non-Hispanic whites. Given some evidence that obesity spreads through social ties, including families, such that there is an increased risk of obesity among children when a parent is obese, developing effective family-based approaches to improving obesity and its related behaviors is paramount. Collaborative partnerships between academic institutions and faith-based organizations, specifically churches, may be one of the most optimal mediums for intervention development. The proposed conference grant seeks to lay the groundwork for the development of strategies to address family-based obesity in the AA community by leveraging the faith community. This will be accomplished by expanding an existing research partnership between The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center (MD Anderson) and Windsor Village United Methodist Church (WVUMC) - Creating a Higher Understanding of Cancer Research & Community Health (CHURCH). Specifically, we will: 1) enhance an existing faith-based-academic partnership to address family obesity and obesity- related behaviors in the African American community; 2) strengthen the capacity of partnership stakeholders and the local community to actively participate in the partnership through capacity building opportunities; 3) assess congregational and community interest in obesity and obesity-related behaviors in African Americans; and 4) develop a community-driven research agenda focused on addressing obesity in faith-based settings). To meet these aims we will invite community partners to join an academic-community-faith-based partnership, develop an organizational structure for the partnership and strengthen partnership through capacity building. We will conduct a community needs assessment focused on church- based factors that influence implementation of obesity programs and concerns and needs of AA youth, adults and church leadership with regards to obesity and its related behaviors. We will implement health education derived from community assessments, solicit feedback, and develop a project concept for future development into a grant application. Our goal is that the successful completion of this conference grant series will result in: 1) an expanded academic, faith-based partnership with the capacity to be leaders and a driving force to eliminate disparities in AA obesity in Houston and potentially nationally (Aims  & 2); 2) a comprehensive assessment of the strengths and needs of AA families and faith- based organizations to address obesity (Aim 3); and 3) a community-driven agenda in the form of project concepts, future grants, and sustained Partnership beyond the life of the conference series grant (Aim 4).         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed project builds on a successful community-academic partnership between MD Anderson Cancer Center and Windsor Village United Methodist Church (WVUMC) in Houston, TX. The proposed project plans to use a community- based participatory (CBPR) approach to capitalize on the existing partnership and enhance it to address family obesity and obesity-related behaviors in the African American community This partnership will greatly expand the knowledge base for conducting community-based participatory research with faith-based communities.            ",A Faith-Based Partnership to Address Obesity in African American families,8756592,R13HD080934,"['adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' Anxiety ', ' Behavior ', ' Breast ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Colon ', ' Communities ', ' coronary disorder ', ' Coronary Disease ', ' Coronary heart disease ', ' Data Collection ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' diabetes ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Environment ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' Family ', ' Feedback ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' Health Tutoring ', ' Health Instruction ', ' Health education ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' Health Promotion ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' high blood pressure ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Hypertension ', ' NAS/IOM ', ' Institute of Medicine ', ' Institute of Medicine (U.S.) ', ' Leadership ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Methods ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Obesity ', ' hypertrophic arthritis ', ' degenerative joint disease ', ' Osteoarthrosis ', ' Osteoarthritis ', ' Degenerative Arthritis ', ' Degenerative polyarthritis ', ' Parents ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Stigmatization ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' brain attack ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Apoplexy ', ' stroke ', ' Woman ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' conference ', ' symposium ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Youth ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Series ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Adolescent ', ' Collaborations ', ' Methodists ', ' Methodist Church ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' psychosocial ', ' interest ', ' meetings ', ' Needs Assessment ', ' Church ', ' knowledgebase ', ' knowledge base ', ' novel ', ' disease prevention ', ' disorder prevention ', ' prevention service ', ' Organization Charts ', ' organizational structure ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' cardiovascular risk ', ' cardiovascular risk factor ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Institution ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Grant Proposals ', ' Applications Grants ', ' Media Intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' Cancer Center ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center ', ' MDACC ', ' University of Texas M D Anderson Cancer Center ', ' trend ', ' Community Health ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' obesity prevention ', ' cancer research ', ' anticancer research ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' driving force ', ' obesity risk ', ' family influence ', ' Evidence based intervention ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' community based participatory research ', ' treatment development ', ' intervention development ', ' develop therapy ', ' therapy development ', ' public health relevance ', ' ']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF TX MD ANDERSON CAN CTR,R13,2014,29926,0.12160771785345843

With its affiliate site, University Cancer & Blood Center (UCBC), GRU has enrolled nearly 800 patients to NCI clinical trials: 39% of them African American (AA) and other minorities, with accrual split between treatment trials (48%) and prevention and control trials (52%). Building on this successful track record, GRU Cancer Center (GRUCC) and UCBC are joining forces with Morehouse School of Medicine (MSM) and the Jiann-Ping Hsu College of Public Health (JPHCOPH) at Georgia Southern University to become the NCORP Minority/Underserved Community Site for Georgia. The need to sustain and grow an NCORP that focuses on minority and underserved populations in Georgia is great. Georgia has some of the nation's worst cancer disparities, particularity between African Americans (AA) and Caucasians (CA) and between rural and urban populations. The disparities are glaring for some of the most common cancers. Not only do AA men in Georgia have the highest rate of prostate cancer among AA men in the country, they are almost twice as likely to be diagnosed with the disease as CA men in Georgia and three times as likely to die from it. In Georgia, AA women die of breast cancer 25% more often than CA women, and AA die of colorectal cancer 45% more than CA. The Specific Aims of the proposed NCORP M/U site for Georgia are to: 1) Implement a NCORP M/U Site for Georgia that meets or exceeds all NCI requirements; 2) Contribute to the design, conduct and translation of the national NCORP research agenda, particularity studies that pertain to minority and underserved populations; and 3) expand patient and provider access to-and enrollment/participation in-cancer prevention, control, imaging, treatment and screening/post-surveillance clinical trials and cancer care delivery research throughout Georgia, particularly for minority and underserved populations in urban and rural settings. Key sub-aims include the implementation of a leadership development program to cultivate the next generation of NCORP investigators and leaders and engagement to key stakeholders and community partners in all aspects of the NCORP research agenda.             Georgia represents a unique opportunity to pursue research directed towards cancer disparities and to affect  minority and underserved communities' accrual to clinical trials and cancer care delivery research studies.  30% of its 9.9M residents are AA (vs. 12% in the U.S.) and 75% of its counties are rural, most of them  medically underserved. Georgia's NCORP M/U Site will ensure greater access to state-of-the-art cancer care across the state and broader translation of research findings into public health and clinical practice.",Georgia CaRes,8790592,UG1CA189851,"['Affect ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' Budgets ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' white race ', ' Occidental ', ' Caucasoid ', ' Caucasian Race ', ' Caucasian ', ' Caucasoid Race ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' clinical investigation ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' Diagnosis ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Feedback ', ' Health ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Health Personnel ', ' health care service ', ' Health Services ', ' Institutes ', ' Leadership ', ' male ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Mentors ', ' Patients ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Primary Care ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Program Development ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health Practice ', ' Research ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Research Design ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' rural health clinic ', ' Rural Health Centers ', ' Rural Population ', ' school of medicine ', ' medical college ', ' medical schools ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' Translations ', ' Universities ', ' Urban Population ', ' Caucasians ', ' Woman ', ' County ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' Specialist ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Ensure ', ' Rural ', ' Oncologist ', ' Glare ', ' cancer prevention ', ' Prostatic Cancer ', ' Prostate Cancer ', ' Prostate CA ', ' Malignant prostatic tumor ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Prostate ', ' Malignant neoplasm of prostate ', ' blood cancer ', ' Malignant Hematopoietic Neoplasm ', ' Hematopoietic and Lymphoid Neoplasms ', ' Hematopoietic and Lymphoid Cell Neoplasm ', ' Hematopoietic Tumor ', ' Hematopoietic Neoplasms including Lymphomas ', ' Hematopoietic Malignancies ', ' Hematopoietic Cell Tumor ', ' Hematopoietic Neoplasms ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' Home ', ' Home environment ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Country ', ' interest ', ' meetings ', ' collegiate ', ' college ', ' data management ', ' care delivery ', ' Structure ', ' Prevention Research ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' research study ', ' Prevention ', ' human subject protection ', ' anticancer therapy ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Treatment ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Therapy ', ' Cancer Treatment ', ' cancer therapy ', ' cancer care ', ' Provider ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Institution ', ' Clinical Oncology ', ' Preventive ', ' Health Sciences ', ' Resource Sharing ', ' Cancer Center ', ' Cancer Control Science ', ' Cancer Control ', ' Community Oncology ', ' CCOP ', ' Community Clinical Oncology Program ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Funding Opportunities ', ' translation research enterprise ', ' translation research ', ' Translational Science ', ' Translational Research Enterprise ', ' Translational Research ', ' underserved minority ', ' under-represented minority ', ' Underrepresented Populations ', ' Underrepresented Groups ', ' Underrepresented Minority ', ' Colorectal Cancer ', ' Behavioral ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' working group ', ' treatment trial ', ' cancer research ', ' anticancer research ', ' underserved people ', ' under served population ', ' Underserved Population ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' next generation ', ' Minority ', ' cancer disparity ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' medically underserved ', ' control trial ', ' clinical practice ', ' operation ', ' oncology program ', ' Morehouse School of Medicine ', ' screening ', ' ']",NCI,AUGUSTA UNIVERSITY,UG1,2014,654813,0.021105245287361026
"Using the Exome to Discover Genetic Determinants of Fibroids in African Americans     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Uterine fibroids affect 77% of women by menopause in the U.S. and account for $2.1 billion in healthcare costs each year. Until recently, tumor tissu and cell culture studies investigating fibroid growth have been the primary sources for understanding fibroid pathophysiology. Genetic analysis provides a powerful and cost effective tool to identify etiological and causal factors, especially since a genetic predisposition to fibrods has already been shown from twin studies. As much as 69% of risk is explained by genetic factors. Racial disparities also support a role for genetics in fibroid risk. African American (AA) women have earlier age-of-onset, more numerous and larger fibroids with a greater lifetime incidence compared to European Americans (EAs). Among existing genetic analysis approaches, whole exome genotyping (WEG) is the most cost-effective and efficient compared to genome-wide association studies (GWAS) that focuses on common variants that may themselves not be causal. In this study, we will take advantage of a unique Vanderbilt resource, the BioVU DNA databank. BioVU has over 141,221 adult DNA samples linked to electronic medical records (EMR). From BioVU we have identified 3,535 AA subjects (612 cases and 2,923 controls) who meet our stringent inclusion criteria. Studies have shown that many women with fibroids are asymptomatic and without imaging as many as 51% of women may be misclassified. As a result, we have required pelvic imaging for both cases and controls. 50,000 BioVU subjects are currently being genotyped using Illumina's Exome Chip as part of an institutional initiative, including all AAs (completion summer of 2013). Our first aim is to conduc a WEG study of fibroids using AA BioVU subjects (n = 3,535) using logistic regression (common variants) and gene-based allele collapsing approaches (rare variants) to evaluate associations of SNPs with fibroids risk. Our second aim is to resequence exomes at 50X using AA BioVU extreme fibroid cases (n = 75) and controls (n = 75) to discover novel coding variants associated with fibroid risk. Extreme cases are those with youngest fibroid onset and largest number and size of fibroid. Extreme controls are the oldest subjects with no recorded history of fibroids. Aim 2 will allow us to validate variants discovered in Aim 1, as well as to identify nove variants not included on the genotyping chip. The NIH, NICHD, AHRQ, and the OWHR have made understanding the mechanisms underlying fibroid risk research priorities. This study is the largest and first whole exome experiment of fibroid among AAs. Immediate availability of samples and resources allow us to accomplish these R01 scope Aims within the budgetary and time constraints of an R03. These aims will allow us to identify novel variants associated with fibroids using two distinct approaches (WEG and exome resequencing using extreme phenotypes) and will lay the ground work for a future R01 examining rare variants associated with fibroids across racial groups. Our proposed study will fundamentally change knowledge about fibroids and lead to breakthroughs in understanding mechanisms in fibroid formation.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Even though fibroids are heritable and known to disproportionately impact African Americans (AAs), the literature about the genetics of fibroids remains meager. Little progress has been made relative to other complex diseases, despite federal research agencies including the NIH, NICHD, and AHRQ recognizing fibroids among their priority women's health topics. Our extremely cost-effective and efficient whole exome association study that includes the first exome genotyping experiment among AAs and exome resequencing using an extreme phenotype approach for targeted fine mapping will be a crucial contribution to knowledge about the role of rare variation and genetics in fibroid risk.                ",Using the Exome to Discover Genetic Determinants

"MULTILEVEL HEALTH PROMOTION IN AFRICAN AMERICAN CHURCHES     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposed study focuses on African Americans (AAs) - a population experiencing multiple health disparities. Promotion of healthy behaviors among AAs across the continuum of care from prevention to diagnosis and treatment services is critical to addressing AA health disparities. Black churches may be an ideal setting for health promotion interventions as they have extensive influence and reach in AA communities, high AA attendance rates, and a strong emphasis on health. Yet, limited studies exist on AA church-based health interventions that support a continuum of health services from prevention to linkage to care with church members and community members using church outreach services. This study focuses on planning, developing, and pilot testing an AA church-based multilevel health promotion intervention to address an AA health disparity. Using community-based participatory (CBPR) principles, our faith-health- community-academic partnership's (Heartland Health Network) CAB will assist in engaging faith and other community partners in all aspects of this study from setting the research agenda to pilot intervention development, implementation, evaluation, and dissemination of findings. In Year 1, the planning phase will consist of: a) conducting a needs assessment survey with 10 churches (n=450 adult church members total) and 10 health and community-based organizations (n=50 key stakeholders) to identify a health condition that disproportionately impacts AAs and feasible multilevel intervention strategies; b) holding a church/community forum to review needs assessment survey findings and explore facilitators/barriers and a plausible multilevel intervention strategies; and c) guided by the CAB and needs assessment findings, developing a culturally/religiously tailored, multilevel health promotion intervention that engages church health liaisons and health providers in promoting prevention, health screening, and linkage to care. In Years 2 and 3, a 2- or 3- arm pilot intervention will be tested with 6 AA churches (N=400 church and community members) assessed at baseline and 12-months. Post study focus groups will be conducted with church leaders and CAB members (n=40 total) to assess the CBPR process used in the study.         RELEVANCE: This study is the first to test a multilevel health promotion intervention in African American (AA) churches through delivery of prevention, health screening, and linkage to care services to AA church and community members. This model could have a significant public health impact by providing a faith community engagement model for implementing scalable, wide-reaching socio-ecological interventions and supporting AA faith leaders with a religiously and culturally-appropriate church-based intervention strategies and tools.

"The African American Non-Resident Fatherhood Program  7. Project Summary/Abstract  This proposal requests support for a study to examine the effects of an intervention aimed at increasing paternal involvement in African American non-resident fathers. Although the number of children living without fathers has grown nationally, the greatest percentage of children living apart from their fathers is found among African American (AA) families. Two thirds of all AA children in the United States live in households without their biological father. Father presence is important to the emotional, social and developmental well being of children throughout the child's life. Positive father involvement is also important to the health and wellbeing of fathers themselves. Therefore, the purpose of this project is to test the Building Bridges to Fatherhood (BBTF) program, an innovative video-based fatherhood program developed with the guidance of a Fathers Advisory Council. The purpose of the BBTF program is to increase and sustain paternal involvement among AA fathers and their young children (2-5 years). The BBTF program will be tested in a randomized clinical trial among 180 families of young children across 2 large predominantly African American areas (west-side and south-side) of a large Midwestern city. Fathers will be recruited via key informants from multiple community sites (i.e. churches, barbershops, community centers, schools, day care centers, local business establishments, dry cleaners, and sports venues) and randomly assigned to either the BBTF intervention or a Financial Literacy (FL) attention control group. Participants will be assessed at pre-intervention, 12 weeks and 24 weeks using self-report measures completed by fathers and the child's biological mother and participate in a booster session at 18 weeks. Dependent variables include: paternal involvement (material and in-kind [non-monetary] support and direct father/child interaction), father parenting competence (self-efficacy, satisfaction, parenting skills and knowledge), father psychological wellbeing (self-esteem, general and racial stress), father communication and problem solving, and father and maternal reports of child behavior and development (cognitive, emotional, social). Further, father-mother relationship quality will be examined for its mediating affect on fathers' outcomes and paternal involvement. This proposal builds on our prior research: (1) refining an effective and culturally relevant parent training model so that it has enhanced social and contextual validity for African American non- resident fathers, and (2) providing a real-world intervention for fathers that has as its primary aim to facilitate and sustain father involvement in early childhood, before father estrangement becomes entrenched and intractable. This study is consistent with the NINR goals for the 21st century to address cultural and ethnic disparities in health promotion and intervention activities by developing innovative, culturally responsive, evidence-based interventions that are tailored to the individual. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  This application to test an innovative culturally relevant fatherhood program for increasing and sustaining paternal involvement among African American (AA) non-resident fathers is relevant to public health because over two-thirds of AA children live in homes without their fathers. Children with fathers who are continuously and actively involved have better behavioral, social, and emotional development and fathers who are continuously and actively involved with their children also fare better than fathers who are not. Thus, an effective fatherhood program holds great promise for improving the health outcomes and social well-being of children and fathers.            ",The African American Non-Resident Fatherhood

"Improving Resection Rates among African Americans with NSCLC  PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT. Surgical resection is the standard-of-care for patients with early stage lung cancer, and multiple published studies have shown that improvements in resection rates translate into improvements in overall survival. African Americans (AAs) with early stage, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) are significantly less likely than European Americans (EAs) to undergo resection, even when controlling for age, comorbidity, tumor stage, socioeconomic status, insurance status, and surgical consultation. This racial disparity is particularly pronounced in South Carolina (SC). Investigators at the National Cancer Institute-designated Medical University of South Carolina Hollings Cancer Center (MUSC HCC) hypothesize that a dynamic, [statewide], patient navigation intervention will reduce potential barriers to surgical cancer care and improve resection rates among AAs with early stage NSCLC. The patient navigation intervention will be tested in a two-arm, cluster- randomized trial comparing the intervention versus [usual care] in a sample of 200 AAs in SC with Stage I or II NSCLC. Study participants will be recruited from six geographically diverse study sites within a [statewide] cancer Clinical Trials Network (CTN) coordinated by MUSC, and participants will be cluster-randomized by CTN site. The investigators will further evaluate the modifying effects of income and urban-rural residence on the relationships between the intervention and the main study outcome (receipt of surgery), as well as [receipt of surgical consultation], time to resection, [time to death (survival)], health-related quality of life, state anxiety, perceived self-efficacy in patient-physician interaction, trust in physicians, and satisfaction with the treatment decision made. The proposed research is highly significant for many reasons. First, lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death in the United States (US) and SC. Second, less than half of AAs in SC with early stage NSCLC undergo surgical resection, and the median survival of AAs with early stage NSCLC is consistently lower than that of EAs. Third, SC has a large AA population (approximately 30%), has urban as well as large rural geographic areas, and has wide income distributions. A [statewide] patient navigation intervention to enhance access to surgical therapy for AAs with NSCLC could lead to significant improvements in care and reductions in racial disparities in lung cancer outcomes [across wide geographic and socioeconomic strata] in SC, as well as in other communities across the US.  PROJECT NARRATIVE. Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer deaths in the US; however, while surgical resection is the optimal treatment for localized, early stage lung cancer, less than half of the African Americans (AAs) diagnosed with this disease undergo surgical resection. This study will test whether a [statewide] patient navigation intervention improves receipt of surgical resection, [receipt of surgical consultation], reduces time to surgery and [improves survival] in AAs with early stage disease, and it may uncover modifiable root causes underlying underuse of lung cancer surgery among AAs. The patient navigation intervention may prove to be a practical but powerful strategy for use by other health care providers, institutions, and communities seeking to reduce persistent racial disparities in lung cancer surgery and outcomes.",Improving Resection Rates among African Americans with NSCLC,8598813,R01MD005892,"['abstracting ', ' Age ', ' Anxiety ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' nonsmall cell lung cancer ', ' Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer ', ' NSCLC - Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer ', ' NSCLC ', ' Non-Small-Cell Lung Carcinoma ', ' Communities ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Comorbidity ', ' Consultations ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Decision Making ', ' Diagnosis ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Patient Care ', ' geographic site ', ' MeSH Descriptors Class 4 ', ' Geographical Location ', ' Geographic Region ', ' Geographic Area ', ' Geographic Locations ', ' Goals ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Health Personnel ', ' Health Services Needs ', ' Level of Health ', ' Health Status ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Income ', ' Income Distributions ', ' interventions research ', ' interventional study ', ' interventional research ', ' intervention research ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Tumor Staging ', ' Neoplasm Staging ', ' Cancer Staging ', ' Diagnostic Neoplasm Staging ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Publishing ', ' recruit ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' social support network ', ' Social support ', ' South Carolina ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' Woman ', ' Relative ', ' Relative (related person) ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' Caring ', ' rural area ', ' urban area ', ' improved ', ' early cancer detection ', ' Cancer Screening for Patients ', ' Screening for cancer ', ' Site ', ' Medical ', ' Randomized Clinical Trials ', ' Ensure ', ' residence ', ' Trust ', ' European ', ' Rural ', ' lung cancer ', ' Pulmonary malignant Neoplasm ', ' Pulmonary Cancer ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Lung ', ' Malignant neoplasm of lung ', ' satisfaction ', ' root ', ' Plant Roots ', ' Staging ', ' Insurance Status ', ' Insurance Coverage ', ' surgery ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' Outcome Study ', ' American ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' resection ', ' Surgical Removal ', ' Removal ', ' Extirpation ', ' Abscission ', ' Excision ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' theories ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' cancer surgery ', ' cancer care ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Institution ', ' Effectiveness ', ' T-Stage ', ' Tumor stage ', ' Low income ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' mammary cancer detection ', ' Breast cancer screening ', ' Breast Cancer Detection ', ' NCI Organization ', ' National Cancer Institute ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Randomized ', ' Cancer Center ', ' Cancer Cause ', ' Cancer Etiology ', ' Cancer Patient ', ' trial design ', ' Clinical Trials Design ', ' Newly Diagnosed ', ' Principal Investigator ', ' Process ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomic ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio economic ', ' socioeconomics ', ' health related quality of life ', ' Clinical Trials Network ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' cancer type ', ' trial comparing ', ' tumor ', ' community setting ', ' evidence base ', ' group intervention ', ' standard of care ', ' usual care ', ' treatment as usual ', ' randomized trial ', ' arm ', ' ']",NIMHD,MEDICAL UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA,R01,2014,368750,0.09667747765201604
"Community-led Policies and Leadership to Eliminate Disparities for Asian Ame     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Tobacco control policy change has contributed tremendously to decreasing tobacco use and represents one of public health's top 10 achievements in the 20th century. Despite the great success of tobacco policy change, the decline in tobacco use prevalence has stalled with still high rates particularly among marginalized communities of color, Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders (AA and NHPIs) are one of the fastest growing populations in the U.S., yet we understand very little about the most effective processes and pathways for engaging AAs and NHPIs in policy change that result in successful compliance and eventual community norm change on tobacco. We propose to conduct a three-year community-based participatory research (CBPR) study titled Community-led Policies and Leadership to Eliminate Disparities for Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders on Tobacco (Com-PLEAT). The overall goal of this research is to identify and understand the pathways to successful tobacco control policy change among two AA and NHPI communities: Cambodians in Long Beach County and Pacific Islanders (including Native Hawaiians, Samoans and Chamorros) in San Diego County. The specific aims of this study are twofold: 1) to develop, and test a 4-prong policy change framework and its effect in helping to mobilize Asian American and Pacific Islander (AA and NHPI) (Cambodian and Chamorro) communities on tobacco control using key informant interviews, community readiness indices and Guttman scalogram analysis; and 2) to study the pathways to successful policy change on tobacco for AAs and NHPIs including the role of capacity building. This proposed Com-PLEAT Study will include key informant interviews, community readiness assessments and Guttman scalogram analysis methodologies and will make a significant contribution to the field of tobacco prevention and control by identifying alternative and more successfully sustained pathways to policy change for AAs and NHPIs. The proposed Com-PLEAT Study seeks to challenge the current framework that policy change will trickle down to all communities equally and the phasing out of culturally-tailored strategies to eliminate health disparities. Using a community-based participatory approach that involves communities in every aspect of the research design, data collection, analysis and dissemination, this study will engage communities to understand perception and motivation about policies and elements critical for full participation in a wide-range of policy interventions.         RELEVANCE (See instructions): The proposed Com-PLEAT Study will contribute not only to the better understanding of effective pathways for tobacco control policy change for Asian American, Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander (NHPI) communities, but also to the replication of this study in other AA and NHPI communities across the U.S. By using innovative research methods, the Com-PLEAT Study will hopefully translate into more effective and sustainable implementation of policy initiatives that include and serve AA and NHPI communities and help reduce health disparities.

"Culture, Social Support & Quality of Life: Asian American Breast Cancer Survivors DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Little is known about the impact of health related quality of life on the well being of Asian American (AA) breast cancer survivors. This five-year mixed-methods study entitled: ""Culture, Support and Quality of Life: Asian American Breast Cancer Survivors"", proposes to identify and define how culture may modify the definitions of self-integrity and quality of life (QOL) for Asian American (AA) breast cancer (BC) survivors. Each culture defines self-esteem and the proper behavior required to achieve a positive sense of self for its members, and these definitions vary. Differing cultural definitions might explain why few ethnic minorities, like AAs, use mainstream survivorship services. AABC survivors have been reported to suffer significant emotional and social problems, but European American (EA) based mainstream designed services do not seem to adequately meet their needs. Two major barriers may hinder more effective interventions. First, dissonance between the beliefs and values upon which these mainstream services are based and AA constructions of self esteem and rules for relationships may reduce the acceptability of mainstream services. For example, most mainstream services emphasize the integrity of individuality and personhood, and accordingly, address the women alone. Yet, AA culture identifies the family as the unit of analysis, not the individual. This study proposes to utilize a more holistic operationalization of culture as a concept that could establish a new avenue of research to move the science of health disparities research forward. Identification of the salient unmet cultural needs of AA women would potentially expand Western based theories of positive survivorship and provide directions to develop more culturally relevant support services to improve their QOL. Second, no consensus exists on what actually comprises the construct of culture. This study proposes to develop a more holistic conceptual framework. Therefore, our four study aims are to: 1) Characterize how women in each of the four ethnic groups define self-integrity and well-being, 2) Identify if and how ethnic specific support services address the culturally formed expectations of integrity and well-being of AA BC survivors, and how this may differ by ethnic group, 3) Explore how the breast cancer experience impacts family members, and 4) Identify the impact of the cancer experience on the women's quality of life, and if it differs by ethnicity. In-depth ethnographic interviews will be conducted with 180 BC survivors and 96 family members for all 4 Aims. We will also survey 800 BC survivors (200 from each ethnic group), and triangulate the quantitative and qualitative findings to increase the validity of our results. We will use CBPR to collaborate with our community partners, Northern and Southern CA and Houston, TX to conduct the study. The 3 sites will enable us to also assess geographic and within group cultural variations. the quantitative and qualitative findings to increase the validity of our results. We will use CBPR to collaborate with our community partners Northern and Southern CA and Houston, TX to conduct the study. The 3 sites will enable us to also assess geographic and within group variations on cultural beliefs and patterns. The outcomes of this study are likely to inform both the science and practice of survivorship in the Asian American community in particular, and among diverse ethnic populations as well, by illuminating the culturally constructed modes and outcomes for managing the cancer experience. The findings are anticipated to provide direction to better meet the needs of cancer survivors and contribute the to the elimination of health disparities. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Little attention has been paid to the growing cancer control needs of Asian Americans (AAs), the ethnic group with the fastest growing rate of all ethnic groups in the U.S., and will double in size to 25 million by 2050. AA also are experiencing the fast increase in new cancer cases of all ethnic groups. The cancer incidence rate for AAs isis predicted to increase by 132 percent among this diverse population compared with 31 percent for non-Hispanic whites. Currenlty, unlike all other ethnicities, cancer is the number one cause of death for AA men and women. Notably, several AA subgroups currently show rates of cancer, including breast cancer (BC), that are higher than or equal to non-Hispanic white women. For some groups, a greater proportion of women with breast cancer are living through and beyond cancer. Studies show, however, that AABC survivors experience emotional and physical needs that are largely unmet, and despite the growing need and the unnecessary suffering borne by this community, too few studies have been conducted on the needs of AA cancer survivors. Of the 362,238 studies found in a Pub-Med search on cancer survivorship or social support, we found only 65 studies published between 1966 and 2010 that investigate the needs of AAs. Moreover, few support services exist to address the needs of AA cancer survivors in the entire nation. Evaluation of the impact of cancer on the social support needs of AA cancer survivors and their families, and in particular, the health related quality of life (HRQOL) of AA cancer survivorship, remains essentially unexamined. Thus, this is the first study to explore cultural explanations for the cross-cultural differences found in quality of life studies among Asian and Asian American populations compared with Western countries. Our study proposes to investigate both between and within group differences among three Asian-American (AA) subgroups (Chinese-American, Japanese-American, and Vietnamese-American) and a comparison group of European-American (EA) breast cancer (BC) survivors. The majority of studies in cancer survivorship have assumed a universality of the assumptions of positive coping strategies and goals. The differences in the performance of standardized scales noted among Asian Americans have not been explained. Relevance: The paucity of support groups and resources that are culturally salient for the growing number of AAs suffering with cancer makes a compelling public health argument for this innovative, mixed-paradigm and mixed-method study. Moreover, this study will forge a new path to evaluate the validity of the assumptions regarding the universality of Western European-American based values of individualism and autonomy that underlie the types of mainstream support services, and identify how, beyond Asian-language concordance, ethnic specific AA support groups assist their members along the survivorship journey through more familial based values and strategies. Investigation of these two areas would potentially expand the theoretical framework currently applied in HRQOL work with culturally-based modifications that are used in AABC support services so that other AA as well as mainstream health service professionals could better meet the needs of this rapidly growing population of AA cancer survivors and their families. This new path would also more accurately and effectively operationalize culture as a concept and construct to identify more relevant aspects of cultural differences that could move the science of health disparities research forward. We also utilize the strength of the community based participatory research approach to promote the validity of the findings to include the reality of the community.","Culture, Social Support & Quality of Life: Asian American Breast Cancer Survivors",8631063,R01CA158314,"['Asian Americans ', ' Attention ', ' Dorsum ', ' Back ', ' Behavior ', ' Belief ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cause of Death ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Chinese American ', ' Communities ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Family ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' health care service ', ' Health Services ', ' Incidence ', ' Individuality ', ' Interview ', ' Japanese American ', ' Language ', ' achievement Mainstream Education ', ' Mainstreaming ', ' Educational Mainstreaming ', ' Mainstreaming (Education) ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Methods ', ' Perception ', ' well-being ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Publishing ', ' QOL ', ' Quality of life ', ' Research ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Science ', ' self esteem ', ' self help organization ', ' Self-Help Groups ', ' Support Groups ', ' Social Interaction ', ' social disturbance ', ' Social Problems ', ' social support network ', ' Social support ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' survivorship ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' oriental ', ' Asians ', ' Friends ', ' Measures ', ' Family member ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' diverse populations ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' ethnographic ', ' Ethnography ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Survivors ', ' Individual ', ' European ', ' Personhood ', ' satisfaction ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Immigrant ', ' tool ', ' sadness ', ' depressed ', ' Depressed mood ', ' Consensus ', ' Life ', ' Investigation ', ' Home ', ' Home environment ', ' Pattern ', ' Country ', ' Outcome Study ', ' meetings ', ' Services ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' expectation ', ' member ', ' Adult Sons ', ' Adult Offspring ', ' Adult Daughters ', ' Adult Children ', ' cultural values ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' Emotional ', ' Modeling ', ' stigma ', ' social stigma ', ' theories ', ' cancer diagnosis ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Subgroup ', ' Cancer Control Science ', ' Cancer Control ', ' Cancer Survivor ', ' Cancer Survivorship ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' SF-36 ', ' Modification ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' comparison group ', ' forging ', ' health related quality of life ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' coping ', ' Population ', ' Impact evaluation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' ethnic minority ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' community based participatory research ', ' emotional experience ', ' effective intervention ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R01,2014,174678,0.02019502360684519
"DIDACTIC: Dissemination and Implementation of a Diet and Activity Community Trial     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): South Carolina has some of the largest health disparities in the nation, and these are invariably more extreme in African Americans (AA) compared to European Americans. The chronic diseases that present the greatest public health challenges are now known to be inflammation related, and AAs tend to have greater inherent sensitivity to inflammation modulators. The proposed dissemination and implementation research is based on our efficacious intervention trial, ""Diet & Activity Community Trial: High-Risk Inflammation"" [R24 MD002769- 01], which focused on diet, physical activity, and stress reduction in collaboration with the AA faith community to reduce inflammation (referred to as the HEALS intervention). Extraordinary success in engaging the AA faith and greater AA community allows us to propose to disseminate and implement this intervention. We will ensure that the proposed dissemination and implementation research contributes to achieving our overall goal of reducing health disparities among AAs through the following specific aims: (1) Disseminate and implement the successful HEALS intervention in the AA faith community; (2) Evaluate and monitor the dissemination process for adoption, recruitment, retention, and fidelity to the HEALS intervention trial including testing the effect of the disseminated intervention using a variety of non-invasive measures that are relevant to overall health status, proven to be related to chronic inflammation in the intervention-phase trial, and that can (and will) be employed in a community setting; (3) Conduct a cost-effectiveness analysis of intervention dissemination and implementation to reduce health disparities in parameters associated with inflammation, from both budgetary and societal perspectives; and (4) Enhance the capacity of the target community to sustain the delivery of the evidence-based intervention and for community partners to engage in future research and programming to address health disparities through cultivation of a network of active church and community educators and leadership development activities. We will utilize a community-based participatory research approach to recruit 30 churches and 450 participants using a lay health, train-the-trainer model that decentralizes the research process and is suitable for dissemination and implementation research. We also will engage 30 ""mentor"" lay health educators (members of church education teams) who participated in the intervention trial phase to mentor and train newly recruited lay health educators for church education teams for the proposed dissemination and implementation research. We propose to use non-invasive approaches to measure key variables during dissemination and implementation. Cost-effectiveness analysis is an important component and will yield information on required inputs and outputs. The proposed research offers an opportunity to build upon a history of successful collaboration by disseminating and implementing evidence- based intervention with a focus on sustainability of efforts through capacity-building and leadership development to address health disparities in the AA community to address health disparities.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: African Americans (AA) in South Carolina have some of the most extreme health disparities in the nation and most of these can be traced to the effects of poor diet, low levels of physical activity, and stress in increasing chronic inflammation. We have developed an efficacious intervention for dissemination and implementation in partnership with and by our community stakeholders in the AA community to stem the high rates of inflammation rising tide of chronic disease rates in this community. The proposed research also will include assessing the costs associated with dissemination and implementation and focus on enhancing sustainability through capacity building and leadership development activities.            ",DIDACTIC: Dissemination and Implementation of a Diet and Activity Community Trial,8671141,R01HL122285,"['Adoption ', ' Awareness ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' chronic disorder ', ' chronic disease/disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Communities ', ' Community Participation ', ' dietary ', ' Diet ', ' Food Intake ', ' Eating ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Family ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Level of Health ', ' Health Status ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' Inflammation ', ' Leadership ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Obesity ', ' Ownership ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' recruit ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' Research ', ' South Carolina ', ' Stress ', ' Testing ', ' Translations ', ' Universities ', ' Measures ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Chronic ', ' Phase ', ' Ensure ', ' Training ', ' Physical activity ', ' Trust ', ' European ', ' R24 ', ' R-24 Monoclonal Antibody ', ' MoAb R24 ', ' Monoclonal Antibody R24 ', ' cancer prevention ', ' Collaborations ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' Church ', ' American ', ' cancer risk ', ' success ', ' Participant ', ' member ', ' Intervention Trial ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' theories ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Health Educators ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Commit ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Address ', ' cost-effectiveness analysis ', ' cost-effective analysis ', ' cost efficient analysis ', ' cost effective analysis ', ' Cost Effective Analyses ', ' Cost Effectiveness Analysis ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Cancer Control Science ', ' Cancer Control ', ' Community Trial ', ' Monitor ', ' Process ', ' Community Health ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Output ', ' cost ', ' implementation research ', ' dissemination research ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Evidence based intervention ', ' stem ', ' community based participatory research ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' therapy design ', ' health training ', ' high risk ', ' public health relevance ', ' community setting ', ' evidence base ', ' high standard ', ' inflammation marker ', ' inflammatory marker ', ' ']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA AT COLUMBIA,R01,2014,533149,0.12791418231308868
"Social Determinants of Health for African American HIV-infected Mothers     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Significance: The vulnerability of African American HIV-infected mothers functions at the intersection of gender-, race-, and class-inequality; HIV-related stigma; and motherhood, requiring multidimensional and transdisciplinary approaches to address the complex social and economic conditions of their lives, collectively known as the social determinants of health. African American (AA) women suffer significantly higher HIV infection rates and tend to die earlier from their infection than their White counterparts. Poverty is a significant precipitating factor for HIV infection and AA women are disproportionately poorer than other subpopulations in the US. HIV-related stigma is linked to poorer mental and physical health outcomes across a broad range of demographic profiles. Being a mother adds an extra layer of social complexity to the lives of HIV-infected women. This descriptive study of AA HIV-infected mothers' unique social location and the intersection of the social determinants of health they experience is an essential step in understanding and addressing the disparity in their health outcomes. Purpose: This study aims to describe the intersection of gender-, race-, and class-inequality; HIV-related stigma; and motherhood specific to AA HIV-infected mothers and to describe how their unique social identity influences their health-related experiences. Methods: In this qualitative descriptive study I will identify 20-30 AA HIV-infected mothers and use participant- initiated photography in conjunction with in-depth qualitative interviewing to explore the intersection of the social determinants of health they experience. Participants will be recruited from the Infectious Diseases Clinics at Duke University Medical Center; the Durham County Health Department Early Intervention Clinic; the Wake County Health Department; the Infectious Diseases Clinic at the University of North Carolina Hospitals; and the Alliance of AIDS Services - Carolinas, Inc., using provider referral and recruitment flyers for self- referral. Summary: This study will help to generate hypotheses about how the described intersection operates to shape health behaviors and produce health outcomes for AA HIV-infected mothers and will identify what aspects of the problem might be measured, are amenable to change, and can be meaningfully addressed by intervention.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: African American mothers with HIV are sicker and die earlier than other groups with HIV. In order to improve the health of these women and their children, it is important to identify why they are not as healthy.

"An Integrated HIV Prevention Model for African American Mothers and Daughters    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Disproportionate rates of mental illness and HIV/AIDS/STIs among African Americans (AA), especially females, reflect significant health disparities. AA women accounted for 66% of new AIDS cases among women in 2006, and AA girls account for 64% of new HIV infections among youth. Mental health is linked to HIV-risk in important ways, yet few families- based, gender-specific, Afrocentric programs address mental health and HIV. Simultaneously targeting multiple levels in an integrated approach - the mother-daughter dyad, women, and girls - addresses HIV in the broader social context and capitalizes on the reciprocal impact of mothers and daughters, facilitating mutual reinforcement of HIV prevention attitudes and behavior, and thereby reducing intervention decay and sustaining positive outcomes over protracted time periods. IMARA (Informed, Motivated, Aware, and Responsible about AIDS) is a culturally-tailored, gender-specific, individual PLUS family-based HIV prevention program designed for two high risk groups -- AA women and AA girls. Based on the Theory of Gender and Power and the Social-Personal Framework, IMARA blends SISTA for women, SiHLE for girls, and a highly promising (Project STYLE) family-based program for teens in psychiatric care to simultaneously reduce women's and girls' risky sexual behavior and delay girls' sexual debut. IMARA incorporates components of Project STYLE that are specific to families and teens in psychiatric care (affect management, conflict resolution, parental monitoring, parent-teen communication) with aspects of SISTA and SiHLE that address gender, power, and ethnic pride. Pilot testing (N=22 mother-daughter dyads) supported IMARA's feasibility, tolerability, and acceptability, and despite the small sample size, outcome data indicate promising trends and changes in targeted mediators (increased parental monitoring, more open mother-daughter communication, greater intentions to use condoms, more relationship power) and sexual risk (increased condom use, fewer partners) separately for mothers and daughters from baseline to 2-month follow up. This study proposes a 2-arm RCT to test and compare the efficacy of IMARA to a health promotion control group in reducing risky sexual behavior among 300 women and their 14 - 18 year old AA daughters in psychiatric care. Mothers and daughters will complete baseline, 6-, and 12-month follow-up assessments. We will use an intent-to-treat analysis and a combination of SEM procedures, regression techniques, and other inferential statistical tests for contrasting means and proportions. We will analyze treatment outcomes using logistic and linear multiple regression models examining effects at 6- and 12- months separately, as well as a combined model with random effects for repeated measurements across time. This proposal answers a compelling need for innovative prevention programs that address the intersecting health disparities of mental illness and HIV/AIDS/STIs among African American girls and women. Effective family-based programs can alter negative developmental trajectories of this very high-risk population and begin to redress existing health disparities.        African Americans (AA) account for more HIV/AIDS cases, people living with HIV/AIDS, and HIV-related deaths than any other racial group in the United States.1, 2 In 2004, AA women accounted for the largest proportion (66%) of new AIDS cases among women in 2006,3-5 and in 2005, AA youth ages 13 - 19 accounted for 69% of new AIDS cases.3 AAs also experience significant mental health disparities,6, 7 and mental illness exacerbates risk for HIV among adults8, 9 and youth.10 Teens in psychiatric care engage in the same HIV-risk behaviors as their school age peers but at higher rates.11-13 The diversity of risk factors associated with these trends is complex, multi-level, and go beyond an individual woman or girl, yet few family-based, gender-specific, Afrocentric programs exist to address their needs. Simultaneously targeting multiple levels in an integrated program -- the mother-daughter dyad, women, and girls -- capitalizes on the reciprocal impact of mothers and daughters, and facilitates mutual reinforcement of HIV prevention attitudes and behavior, thereby reducing intervention decay and sustaining positive outcomes over time. The long-term goal of the study is to reduce health disparities in HIV/AIDS/STIs and mental health among African American women and girls by improving healthy sexual decision-making, empowering mothers to become effective role models, strengthening mother-daughter communication and emotion regulation skills, and building stronger mother-daughter relationships that sustain behavior change.

"Enhancing Kidney Donation Through Live Organ Video Educated Donors (LOVED)     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Chronic Kidney Disease is diagnosed in four times as many African Americans (AAs) as Whites and nearly twice as many AAs perish from the condition. Kidney transplantation offers the best outcomes for patients with End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) but rates of procurement far outnumber cadaver organ availability, especially among AAs. A superior option is living donor kidney transplantation (LDKT). Since AAs comprise only 18.5% of LDKT recipients, innovative and culturally preferred strategies are needed to increase LDKT within the AA community. We hypothesize that a patient-centered, two tiered culturally sensitive education/motivation intervention targeting AA ESRD patients and potential donors (PDs) using mobile health (mHealth) technology will result in: 1) increased ESRD patients' willingness to ask for donation; 2) increased number of PDs who complete medical evaluation; and, 3) increased number of LDKTs. We will leverage mHealth technology as the delivery mechanism to maximize large scale dissemination potential. Guided by behavioral change and technology acceptability theories, the Live Organ Video Educated Donor [LOVED] program will be developed to address two domains. LOVED I will be tailored for AA ESRD patients and navigated by an AA LDKT recipient. LOVED II will be tailored for potential LDKT donors and navigated by an AA LDKT donor. iPad program delivery will include testimonial audio/video clips, home-work assignments, videoconferencing, chat room sessions, and text/emails. The proposed mixed methods research utilizes qualitative and quantitative studies in a 3 phase process of development that will involve: 1) Development of LOVED I and II technical content and delivery formats guided by behavioral and technological theories using 9 focus groups (8 per group) of AA LDKT recipients/donors, ESRD LDKT eligible patients, PDs who failed to complete screening and transplant healthcare provider team. 2) Conduct 3 month LOVED I and II proof of concept studies (LOVED I = 24 LDKT eligible patients; LOVED II = 24 PDs who did not complete screening) to assess program acceptability, feasibility, changes in self efficacy and attitudes. Also assessed will be % ESRD patients who identify PDs, % PDs who complete screening, % LDKTs and participants' perceptions of cultural competence of intervention including levels of trust, discrimination, shared decision making and literacy. 3) Conduct two 6 month 2-arm randomized control trials (LOVED I vs. standard of care, N=60; LOVED II vs. standard of care, N=80) to generate estimates needed for design of a large scale RCT.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Culturally sensitive programs are needed to increase African Americans' (AAs) LDKT rate. We will accomplish this with a user centered iterative development approach resulting in a two-tiered LDKT program led by AA LDKT recipients/donors. iPad program delivery will include videoconferencing, chat room sessions and viewing of testimonials from AA LDKT patients/donors relating how barriers and associated issues were resolved and AA celebrities' experiences of the benefits of LDKT.

"Race - adiposity interactions regulate mechanisms determining insulin sensitivity     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Project summary. Insulin resistance plays a major role in the etiology of chronic metabolic diseases, many of which differ with race/ethnicity. Previous studies using mainly indirect methods suggest that insulin sensitivity is lower in African-Americans (AA) vs. European-Americans (EA). However, results are discrepant, differing with the method used and the obesity status of the participants. Our preliminary data using the reference standard glucose clamp indicate that in lean individuals, insulin sensitivity i lower among AA, while in obese individuals, insulin sensitivity is higher among AA. We hypothesize that this race/body mass index (BMI) interaction may be explained in part by significantly lower visceral/hepatic adiposity in AA that results in less impairment of insulin sensitivity among obese AA individuals. Conversely, we hypothesize that inherently greater oxidative stress impairs insulin sensitivity in AA, explaining lower insulin sensitivity in lean AA vs. EA. This is based on our preliminary data indicating that a circulating marker of cumulative oxidative stress was significantly associated with insulin-stimulated glucose disposal in AA but not EA, and that production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in vitro was greater in AA vs. EA. We propose to test these hypotheses by prospectively comparing skeletal muscle and hepatic insulin sensitivity in healthy lean, overweight, and obese AA and EA using the hyperinsulinemic isoglycemic glucose clamp with tracer-labeled glucose. Analysis of ancestral genetic admixture will permit simultaneous assessment of the contribution of ancestry to main outcomes. With our first aim, we will test the hypothesis that a significant race-by-BMI interaction will be detected n skeletal muscle and hepatic insulin sensitivity, such that at low BMI AA are less insulin sensitive but at high BMI AA are more insulin sensitive, when compared with EA. The second aim will test the hypothesis that at high BMI, AA will have greater hepatic and skeletal muscle insulin sensitivity due to lower hepatic and visceral fat. The third aim will test the hypothesis that greater bioenergetic efficiency and ROS production within skeletal muscle mitochondria will be associated with lower skeletal muscle insulin sensitivity in lean AA. A secondary aim will test the hypothesis that skeletal muscle and hepatic insulin sensitivity are better associated with adipokines, cytokines, lipids, blood pressure, and vascular function in EA than in AA. Relevance. Results from this study elucidating why the underlying pathophysiology of insulin resistance differs with genetic background may guide development of personalized treatment strategies with implications for several chronic metabolic diseases (e.g., type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and cancer).         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We will test the hypothesis that the underlying pathophysiology of insulin resistance differs with genetic background. We predict that insulin resistance will occur secondary to visceral and hepatic obesity in European Americans, but is driven by inherently greater oxidative stress in African Americans. Results from this study may guide the development of individualized treatment strategies for prevention and reversal of insulin resistance, and may have implications for a race-specific role of insulin resistance in the etiology of chronic metabolic disease.

"IBD Gene Mapping by Clinical and Population Subset     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) are complex genetic disorders of the gastrointestinal tract, and a major health burden to patients and society. Tremendous progress has been made in dissecting IBD genetic etiology with identification of over 100 IBD loci by genome wide association studies (GWAS) but mainly limited to persons of European ancestry. The IBD Genetics Consortium (IBDGC) was established to facilitate multicenter collaborative studies of 6 Genetics Research Centers (GRCs) organized with a Data Coordinating Center (DCC). Our GRC at Johns Hopkins (JHGRC) has contributed to all IBDGC studies, led the largest genome wide linkage study in IBD and has led the IBDGC in a focus on African American (AA) IBD genetics (recruiting 88% of study subjects). We published the first large clinical characterization of AA IBD, serological associations of AA CD, clinical disparity studies, and most recently evaluation of admixture in AA CD, NOD2 the other four most well characterized CD genetic loci. More research in AA IBD is needed to understand the etiology of IBD in this ancestrally distinct, major American population, and also because diverse allelic and haplotype structure, and potential for unique functional variants will yield benefits for all populations. Additionally, a major challenge, especially for non- coding associations, is to know which SNPs are causative vs. those in linkage disequilibrium. Comparing association patterns across populations and evaluating function of associated SNPs that map to potential transcription factor (TF) sites active in IBD related cells will be beneficial. Our Aims in the next funding period are to (1) facilitate more comprehensive IBD gene discovery and evaluation in the AA population, and (2) to characterize the epigenome relevant to IBD and evaluate the most provocative non-coding SNPs across populations that map to potential TF binding sites for alterning genomic function. For the first Aim, we have enlarged our recruitment to12 satellite recruitment centers and will recruit 1000 AA IBD cases (with potential of 2600 cases) over the next five years. Immunochip IBD genotyping in AA's and a first stage AA CD GWAS IBD are underway, with facilitation of a 2nd stage ancillary R01 AA CD GWAS with Emory University planned for Year 3. We will perform an IBDGC AA UC GWAS of 1000 cases in year 4. We will compare IBD associations across ethnic groups to define most consistent non-coding SNPs. For Aim 2, we've assembled a team to help us characterize IBD relevant epigenomic annotation. We will purify immune cells from resected colon of patients, perform ChIP-Seq, and evaluate SNPs that map to TF binding sites using in-vitro enhancer assays in transfected cell lines. We will play a major role in all IBDGC activities, with our team of genetic statistical, genomic, immunology, and microbiome co-investigators, by our ability to obtain biological materials (including blood, biopsy, resection, and stool) and to recall patients for re-sampling, and by working cooperatively to maximize productivity of the IBDGC and its GRCs and DCC.          According to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention, an estimated 1.4 million Americans suffer from Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD), a chronic debilitating disorder with no cure that includes Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. IBD ranks in the top 5 in prevalence for gastrointestinal disorders and represents a significant financial burden to society requiring a lifetime of medical care. This proposed research aims to determine the genetic variations that cause IBD which will aid in developing preventive measures, improving the quality of care with better treatments and educating patients through genetic counseling.

"Metabotropic Glutamate Receptor 1 in African American Prostate Cancer     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Prostate cancer (PCa) presents with the greatest racial disparity of any cancer in the U.S., with an alarmingly high incidence and mortality rate among African Americans (AAs). AA men with PCa present with higher tumor volume, more advanced stage, higher Gleason grade, higher prostate-specific antigen (PSA), and worse prognosis than Caucasian Americans (CAs). The underlying reasons for such disproportionate ethnic differences may reflect genuine racial differences in cancer biology, socio-cultural differences, or access to health care systems.  Recently, we discovered that serum glutamate levels positively correlate with PCa aggressiveness and Gleason score (e8 versus d6) in AAs and CAs. However, glutamate levels were higher in AAs, with primary or metastatic castrate-resistant (CR) PCa than in CAs. Glutamate deprivation or blockade with a glutamate receptor (i.e., GRM1) antagonist significantly decreased growth, migration and invasion and induced apoptosis in PCa cells. We also demonstrated a higher GRM1 expression in MDA-PCa2b (metastatic AA-PCa cell line) than in the E006AA (primary AA-PCa cell line). GRM1 overexpression increased E006AA cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. Our preliminary data show that GRM1 expression is higher in PCa tissues than in normal or benign glands in AAs.  Based on these data, we hypothesized that GRM1 expression levels contribute to biological and clinical aggressiveness of PCa in AAs. Our hypothesis will be tested in the following Specific Aims: (1) to determine the association between tissue expression of GRM1 and clinicohistopathological predictors or prognosticators of PCa progression or aggressiveness in AAs; and (2) to determine the association between GRM1 expression levels and invasive and metastatic phenotypes in AA-PCa cells.  Data generated from this exploratory study will define biological and/or clinicohistopathological significance or relevance of GRM1 expression in AA-PCa and may prove useful in discriminating clinically or biologically aggressive tumors from indolent (non-aggressive) tumors and minimizing PCa disparity in AAs.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The incidences, mortality, and aggressiveness of prostate cancer (PCa) in African American (AA) men are higher than in Caucasians (CAs). We recently discovered that serum glutamate levels positively correlate with PCa aggressiveness and Gleason score (e8 versus d6) and were higher in AAs, with primary or metastatic castrate-resistant PCa than in CAs. Our data show that glutamate receptor-GRM1 expression is higher in PCa tissues than in normal or benign glands in AAs. In this exploratory study, the biological relevance of alterations in GRM1 expression levels will be examined on tumor growth and metastasis in AA-PCa cell lines. To define the clinical significance, we will determine the association between tissue-expression levels of GRM1 and clinicopathological predictors or prognosticators of PCa aggressiveness in AA-men. Data obtained from the proposed studies may prove diagnostic utilities in discriminating between clinically or biologically aggressive tumors and non-aggressive (indolent) tumors and provide novel opportunities using GRM1-antagonist or blocking agent(s) for PCa therapy in AA men.            ",Metabotropic Glutamate Receptor 1 in African American Prostate Cancer,8675361,R21CA183892,"['Age ', ' Bioenergetics ', ' Natural Products ', ' Biologic Factor ', ' Biological Factors ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Brain ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' white race ', ' Occidental ', ' Caucasoid ', ' Caucasian Race ', ' Caucasian ', ' Caucasoid Race ', ' cultured cell line ', ' Strains Cell Lines ', ' CellLine ', ' Cell Line ', ' Motility ', ' Cellular Motility ', ' Cellular Migration ', ' Cell Movement ', ' Cell Migration ', ' Cell Locomotion ', ' cell motility ', ' Tricarboxylic Acid Cycle ', ' TCA cycle ', ' Krebs Cycle ', ' Citric Acid Cycle ', ' Environment ', ' Epithelial Cells ', ' Family ', ' glutamatergic ', ' L-Glutamate ', ' Glutamates ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Growth ', ' Health ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' healthcare service availability ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare access availability ', ' health services availability ', ' health care service availability ', ' health care service access ', ' health care availability ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Availability of Health Services ', ' Accessibility of health care ', ' Access to Healthcare ', ' Access to Health Care ', ' Access to Care ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' In Vitro ', ' Incidence ', ' melanocyte ', ' Malignant Melanoma ', ' melanoma ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Transgenic Mice ', ' Mortality ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Multivariate Analyses ', ' Multivariate Analysis ', ' tumor cell metastasis ', ' cancer metastasis ', ' Tumor Cell Migration ', ' Secondary Tumor ', ' Secondary Neoplasm ', ' Metastatic Tumor ', ' Metastatic Neoplasm ', ' Metastasize ', ' Metastasis ', ' Neoplasm Metastasis ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Play ', ' Prognosis ', ' outcome forecast ', ' Prostatic Gland ', ' Prostate Gland ', ' Prostate ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Recurrent ', ' Recurrence ', ' Risk Factors ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Signal Pathway ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Stains ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Tissues ', ' Caucasians ', ' Glutamate Receptor ', ' Measures ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' hK3 Kallikrein ', ' gamma-Seminoprotein ', ' Seminin ', ' Semenogelase ', ' Prostate Specific Antigen Preproprotein ', ' Plasma Prekallikrein ', ' Plasma Kallikrein Precursor ', ' P-30 Antigen ', ' Kallikrein 3 ', ' EC 3.4.21.34 ', ' Prostate-Specific Antigen ', ' Programmed Cell Death ', ' Apoptosis Pathway ', ' Apoptosis ', ' base ', ' neoplastic progression ', ' neoplasm progression ', ' cancer progression ', ' tumor progression ', ' Prostatovesiculectomy ', ' Radical Prostatectomy ', ' Benign ', ' Clinical ', ' Malignant ', ' Malignant -

"Sustaining palliative care to drug users with HIV/AIDS & health disparities     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): With increasing HIV survival and disability, informal (unpaid) caregivers play a growing role in the well-being of persons living with HIV/AIDS (PLHAs), especially as they enter end of life (EOL). Major goals of palliative care (PC) programs are to enhance the quality of life (QOL) of patients and their families, optimize function, and facilitate patient-family decision making on EOL treatment and discussion with medical providers. African American (AA) injection drug users (IDUs) experience disparities in prevalence and outcomes of HIV, in part due to their suboptimal healthcare and treatment adherence, and have low access to PC. The PI's research indicates most AA IDU PLHAs have caregivers and that they play a key role in their healthcare, treatment adherence and mental health. Our preliminary findings also suggest AA IDU PLHAs' caregivers have major risks for burnout and early cessation of care. Research is needed to understand ways to promote AA IDU PLHAs' HIV care and facilitate discussion and mutual understanding of their treatment goals and EOL care preferences with caregivers and providers to ensure their and their caregivers' QOL. The proposed mixed methods, longitudinal study is based on a social ecological, network resource framework and builds on the study team's novel HIV caregiving research program, pediatric HIV PC clinic program, and research on patient- provider communication on EOL issues. Caregiving can be highly stressful, and costly of financial and social resources, which can lead to caregiver burnout (e.g., role overload, captivity) and cessation of care. Major risks of care cessation include recipients' late stage illness, intensive (personal) care needs, substance abuse and other problem behaviors, and caregivers' lack of social support. Preliminary findings from our recent Beacon study suggest caregivers of were highly involved in AA IDU PLHA care recipients' medical adherence and had a dearth of social support. And 79% of recipients reported pain, which was associated with illicit drug use, posing a potential threat to their caregiving relationship and QOL. The proposed study expands our caregiving research program into new areas of PC, EOL, and caregiver resiliencies. The study will comprise four long- term follow-up assessment of the Beacon sample (up to six years) and new recruits (n=400 dyads, half from Beacon); and a qualitative component exploring PC, EOL, and caregiving resiliencies from caregiver and recipient perspectives. The study will address some of the methodological and theoretical limitations of prior caregiving and PC research. The findings will inform the team's later development of interventions to promote AA IDU PLHA caregivers' and recipients' sustained care and QOL by potentially intervening at the dyad, support network or medical provider level.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Relevance Caregivers provide a range of assistance critical to PLHAs' palliative care (PC) and quality of life (QOL). Research is needed to understand how to sustain caregiving and caregivers' QOL through end of life (EOL) of vulnerable African American, injection drug using (IDU) PLHAs. The study represents an obvious next step to the new team's PC, EOL, and caregiving research by identifying barriers and facilitators to sustained HIV care, its impact on QOL, and implications to adult HIV PC practice.                ",Sustaining palliative care to drug users with HIV/AIDS & health disparities,8661790,R01NR014050,"['Acquired Immunologic Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immuno-Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency ', ' AIDS ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Affect ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Elderly ', ' Communication ', ' Decision Making ', ' Morphinan-3,6-diol, 7,8-didehydro-4,5-epoxy-17-methyl- (5alpha,6alpha)-, diacetate (ester) ', ' Diamorphine ', ' Diacetylmorphine ', ' Heroin ', ' Information Disclosure ', ' Disclosure ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Expenditure ', ' Family ', ' Goals ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' long-term study ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' Memory ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Methods ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Mortality ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Persons ', ' Painful ', ' Pain ', ' comfort care ', ' Palliative Treatment ', ' Palliative Therapy ', ' Palliative Care ', ' Patients ', ' well-being ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' Play ', ' QOL ', ' Quality of life ', ' recruit ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' Research ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Rewards ', ' Risk ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' personal care ', ' Self Care ', ' social support network ', ' Social support ', ' Testing ', ' Translations ', ' Measures ', ' Care Givers ', ' Caregivers ', ' Intensive Care ', ' Outcomes Assessment ', ' Outcome Assessment (Health Care) ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' depressive ', ' depression symptom ', ' Emotional Depression ', ' depressive symptoms ', ' Illicit Drugs ', ' Health Benefit ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' doubt ', ' Uncertainty ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' Area ', ' Medical ', ' Ensure ', ' disability ', ' drug use ', ' Drug usage ', ' behavioral problem ', ' Problem behavior ', ' Collaborations ', ' Staging ', ' Drug user ', ' cognitively impaired ', ' cognitive loss ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Clinic ', ' burn-out ', ' burnout ', ' Lifestyle-Related Problem ', ' Lifestyle-Related Disorder ', ' Behavior-Related Problem ', ' Behavior-Related Disorder ', ' Lifestyle-related condition ', ' Injection Drug User ', ' Injecting drug user ', ' experience ', ' novel ', ' member ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' HIV/AIDS problem ', ' HIV/AIDS ', ' AIDS/HIV ', ' AIDS/HIV problem ', ' substance abuse ', ' abuse of substances ', ' Substance abuse problem ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' stigma ', ' social stigma ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' highly active anti-retroviral therapy ', ' HAART ', ' Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy ', ' Provider ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' therapy adherence ', ' Address ', ' end-of-life ', ' end of life ', ' Adherence ', ' Adherence (attribute) ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' care giving ', ' caregiving ', ' care preference ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' treatment development ', ' intervention development ', ' develop therapy ', ' therapy development ', ' public health relevance ', ' clinical care ', ' evidence base ', ' pediatric HIV ', ' pediatric human immunodeficiency virus ', ' treatment adherence ', ' clinical practice ', ' cocaine use ', ' injection drug use ', ' ']",NINR,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R01,2014,475757,0.03508098508929571
"Biobehavioral Determinants of the Microbiome and Preterm Birth in Black Women     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goals of this study are to elucidate the bio behavioral determinants that govern the structure and dynamics of the microbiome of African American (AA) women during pregnancy and to investigate whether microbiome composition is associated with PTB. The proposed study will contribute to a bio psychosocial understanding of within-race risk for PTB, providing insight into important risk and protective factors relevant to AA women who disproportionately experience PTB compared to any other US population. Our research is consistent with frameworks for eliminating racial disparities, which recognize the importance of studying potential risk factors within-race as a vital first step, and is congruent with the National Institute of Nursing Research goal of promoting and improving the health of individuals, families, and communities across the lifespan in a variety of clinical settings and within diverse populations. The study will prospectively enroll a socioeconomically diverse cohort of H 960 pregnant AA women and follow them through delivery, collecting data at three time points: twice via direct participant contact during prenatal care appointments (at 10-14 and 26-30 weeks' gestation), and once via review of the medical records from the delivery hospitalization. Using a nested case-control approach, we will designate as cases all women who experience PTB (an estimated 125 cases); an equal number of controls will be selected from among those who deliver a term infant. Using this study design we will: (1) Characterize the vaginal, oral, and gut microbiome during early and later pregnancy; (2) Examine whether bio behavioral factors linked with PTB - including biological indicators and experiences of stress, nutritional status, and health behaviors - influence the composition of the microbiome; (3) Determine whether the composition of the vaginal, oral, and gut microbiome in early and/or later pregnancy is associated with PTB; and (4) Investigate whether symptom patterns are associated with microbiomic milieu that increase the risk of PTB among AA women. The success of this research is supported by several factors. First, we have assembled a multidisciplinary collaboration of clinicians and basic and translational scientists representing expertise in infectious disease, obstetrics-gynecology, nutrition, genetics and epigenetics, stress physiology, epidemiology and informatics under the leadership of a nurse-scientist. Second, we have the support of the Atlanta Clinical and Translational Science Institute (CTSA award # NIH UL1TR000454); Emory's Interdisciplinary Training for Nurse Scientists Award (T32 NR012715), Emory's Reproductive and Perinatal Epidemiology Fellowship Award, and the Emory Integrated Genomics Core Laboratory. Third, Atlanta is home to AA women of broad SES, many of whom are served by Emory's affiliated delivery hospitals, enabling us to sample a diverse group of AA women, allowing for sufficient variation in the bio behavioral determinants under study to distinguish their independent and interactive effects on the microbiome and, ultimately, on the risk of PTB.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Preterm birth (PTB) occurs at unacceptably high rates within the United States, with African American women disproportionately affected. The composition of the microbiome during pregnancy may be a key mechanism for PTB. Our study will characterize the structure and dynamics of the vaginal, oral, and gut microbiome within the population most affected by PTB - African American women - in order to evaluate whether particular microbiome patterns are linked with PTB and to identify bio behavioral factors that impact microbiome structure and dynamics during pregnancy.

"Role of chemokine receptor in disparities associated with prostate cancer progres     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): African-American (AA) men have higher incidence of prostate cancer (PCa) than European American (EA). Furthermore, PCa in AA men is characterized by poor prognosis and dismal therapeutic outcomes. However, the mechanism/s associated with this health disparity remain unclear. Thus, identification of molecular mechanisms underlying such disparity is greatly desired in order to develop effective therapeutic and management approaches. It is becoming well appreciated that the chemokine-ligand axis is crucially involved in tumor cell trafficking and the development of organ-specific metastases, which is the major cause of PCa associated deaths. Our laboratory is the first to show that CC chemokine receptor 9 (CCR9) is selectively overexpressed in prostate cancers with negligible expression in normal prostate epithelia. Our exciting preliminary data show significantly higher expression of CCR9 in AA PCa cell lines and clinical samples compared to cell lines and clinical samples derived from EA. Furthermore, serum CCL25, which is natural ligand for CCR9 was higher in AA and PCa cell lines from AA (MDA-PCa-2b) and showed higher invasive and migratory potential as well as less response to chemotherapeutics in vitro compared to EA cell lines (C4-2b). Based upon these encouraging data, we hypothesize that CCR9-CCL25 axis underlies the poor prognosis and therapeutic outcome in AA men with PCa. To test our hypothesis, we propose to investigate the CCR9- CCL25 mediated mechanism associated with (i) aggressive cell phenotype in AA samples, (ii) homing and tumor growth in bone and the potential role of this chemokine-receptor axis in improving chemotherapeutic efficacy of clinical regimens in AA patients. We further aim to establish CCR9 as a biomarker for PCa progression and aggressive disease. To accomplish our aims, we have generated CCR9 anti-body against CCR9 and CCL25, which will be used to block this axis during in vitro assays to determine its role in migration, invasion, survival and chemoresistance; determining its potential role in metastasis as well as determining therapeutic efficacy of Docetaxel in vivo using AA and EA cell lines. In addition, siRNA duplexes or specific pharmacological inhibitors against CCR9 driven signaling molecules will be used to dissect the CCR9 mediated mechanism involved in migration, invasion, survival and chemoresistance. We are optimistic that the successful completion of these studies will define the role of this newly identified chemokine in PCa health disparity. Furthermore, it will enable the design and development of rational therapies directed against the CCR9-CCL25 to reduce/eliminate disparity in therapeutic outcomes.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Our goal is to determine the potential involvement of CC chemokine receptor-9 in disparity associated with poor disease and therapeutic outcome in African American patients. The outcomes of our study will (i) allow to determine the CCR9-mediated molecular pathways involved in PCa graveness and chemo resistant phenotypes, (ii) determine the CCR9-mediated mechanisms metastasis and (iii) establish the clinico- pathological significance of CCR9 in PCa health disparity. Our project will impact 1) development CCR9 expression as a new biomarker for aggressive disease and 2) therapeutic outcome of AA patients.

"DNA methylation biomarkers of scleroderma-associated interstitial lung disease     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Interstitial lung disease (ILD) is a major complication and the leading cause of mortality in scleroderma (SSc, systemic sclerosis). In addition, patients of African ancestry suffer from higher morbidity and mortality rates. The etiology of SSc, including the reasons underlying the wide variation in disease progression and severity remain unknown. For these reasons, it is important to understand the mechanisms through which SSc-ILD develops that may explain the racial differences in SSc-ILD outcomes. The low concordance rate between monozygotic twins suggests an important role for epigenetic or environmental factors in SSc susceptibility. Since it is influenced by the environment, epigenetic variation, inherited both directly and through shared environmental effects, may play an important role in SSc-ILD risk. Evidence suggests that epigenetic changes play an important role in the development of autoimmunity. These epigenetic markers have the potential to serve as biomarkers for the development and progression of SSc-ILD. The hypothesis of this study is that epigenetic factors are a significant contributor to severity of SSc-ILD in African-American (AA) patients. Its goal is to identify DNA methylation loci as biomarkers of SSc-ILD and its severity, which supports the long-term goal to delineate the role of DNA methylation in SSc risk and severity. This application proposes three specific aims: 1) comprehensive identification of differentially methylated cytosines (DMCs) and regions (DMRs) associated with SSc-ILD and its severity in AAs, 2) test if the most significant DMCs and DMRs are associated with genetic variation, and 3) test if the most significant DMCs and DMRs are associated with gene expression levels. Alveolar macrophages will be isolated from bronchoalveolar lavage on 34 AA SSc-ILD patients and 26 AA controls. Reduced representation bisulfite sequencing will be performed and DMCs and DMRs associated with SSc-ILD and disease severity will be identified. The 5 most significant DMCs/DMRs will be selected for genetic and expression studies. These results have the potential to identify DNA methylation loci as biomarkers of SSc-ILD and disease severity, thus contributing to an increased understanding of the molecular mechanisms of SSc-ILD and ultimately may lead to the development of effective diagnostics, prognostics and therapies.           PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Interstitial lung disease (ILD) is a major complication and the leading cause of mortality in scleroderma (or systemic sclerosis (SSc)). Given the higher morbidity and mortality rates in African American (AA) SSc patients, it is imperative to understand the reasons for this health disparity.

"Black College Students, Health Disparities & Disease Prevention Practices  Project Summary In 2010, about 25.8 million Americans had diabetes, and 27% of those cases were undiagnosed. Type 2 diabetes (T2D) accounts for about 90-95% of diabetes cases; diabetes prevention is a national health objective. T2D disproportionately affects African-Americans (AAs) and Hispanics, compared with non-Hispanic whites. In Texas, 2009 data revealed that 14.4% of AAs had T2D, compared with 9.7% of Hispanics and 8% of Whites. Family history, overweight, and ethnicity are T2D risk factors. Lifestyle modification, including healthy eating, physical activity, and modest weight loss, can prevent T2D. The transition from adolescence to young adulthood can be a time of increased stress, and is associated with increased health risk. Poor diet, obesity and inactivity increase during this time period, particularly among AAs. For those AA students with family history of T2D, this may contribute to the increasing prevalence of T2D diagnosed among younger populations. In 2010, 24% of new T2D cases were in adults 20-39 years of age and 55% were in adults ages 40-59 years. There are over 100 Historically Black Colleges or Universities (HBCUs) in the U.S. While HBCUs have significantly contributed to the educational progress of millions of AA students, there is a lack of empirically- driven descriptive and intervention research in health promotion focused on the HBCU populations. Efforts to identify and mitigate health risk behaviors in these students may help in addressing health disparities among AAs. Therefore, we are submitting this R21 application in response to PAR-10-137, addressing Research Area 3: chronic disease prevention. We will assess the social networks of AA students attending a HBCU, with and without T2D risk, and examine the flow of health related behaviors, attitudes, support, and information across the social networks of students. Our goal is to identify whether there are protective mechanisms within these social networks that might help to explain the differences between those students with T2D risk who report lifestyle behaviors that increase risk for early onset T2D, versus those students with T2D risk who practice lifestyle behaviors protective of T2D. We will also investigate whether a social network communication channel at an HBCU is an effective way to promote chronic disease prevention practices and reduce future risk. This proposed study has tremendous public health significance and is the first step in a program of research to develop and test effective social network-based interventions on HBCU campuses to reduce health disparities among this group. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Historically Black Colleges or Universities (HBCU) have significantly contributed to the educational progress of millions of African-American (AA) students. There is lack of health promotion research on HBCU populations who are at a higher risk of diabetes and other chronic diseases. Thus, we will assess the social networks of AA students attending a HBCU, and examine the flow of health-related behaviors, attitudes, support, and information across their social networks which may help in addressing health disparities among AAs, and investigate whether prevention programs can be disseminated via the college to student social networks.            ","Black College Students, Health Disparities & Disease Prevention Practices",8604921,R21NR014149,"['Accounting ', ' teenage ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' Adolescence ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' Attitude ', ' Awareness ', ' Behavior ', ' lifestyle modification ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' behavior intervention ', ' Life Style Modification ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' chronic disorder ', ' chronic disease/disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Communication ', ' diabetes ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' type II DM ', ' type 2 DM ', ' maturity onset diabetes ', ' ketosis resistant diabetes ', ' adult onset diabetes ', ' Type II diabetes ', ' Type II Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Type 2 diabetes ', ' Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus ', ' T2DM ', ' T2D ', ' T2 DM ', ' Stable Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Slow-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Noninsulin Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Non-Insulin Dependent Diabetes ', ' NIDDM ', ' Maturity-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' MODY ', ' Ketosis-Resistant Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Adult-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Diagnosis ', ' dietary ', ' Diet ', ' Food Intake ', ' Eating ', ' Faculty ', ' Family ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Health Personnel ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' Health Promotion ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' indexing ', ' interventions research ', ' interventional study ', ' interventional research ', ' intervention research ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' Interview ', ' Lifestyle ', ' Life Style ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Obesity ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Stress ', ' Students ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Testing ', ' Texas ', ' Time ', ' Universities ', ' wt-loss ', ' body weight loss ', ' Weight Reduction ', ' Weight Loss ', ' Body Weight decreased ', ' Friends ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Hispanics ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' Social Network ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Physical activity ', ' Individual ', ' young adulthood ', ' adult youth ', ' young adult ', ' Family Medical History Epidemiology ', ' Family Medical History ', ' Family history of ', ' Lifestyle Risk Reduction ', ' Risk Reduction Behavior ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Over weight ', ' Overweight ', ' collegiate ', ' college ', ' Services ', ' American ', ' behavioral/social science ', ' college student ', ' university student ', ' disease prevention ', ' disorder prevention ', ' Prevention program ', ' religious ', ' Religion and Spirituality ', ' Prevention ', ' Reporting ', ' risk perception ', ' Emotional ', ' response ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' diabetes risk ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' Age-Years ', ' Undergraduate Degree ', ' Baccalaureate Degree ', "" Bachelor's Degree "", ' Data ', "" Master's Degree "", ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' Diabetes prevention ', ' early onset ', ' protective behavior ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' Network-based ', ' Historically Black University ', ' Historically Black Institution ', ' Historically Black Colleges ', ' HBCUs ', ' Historically Black Colleges and Universities ', ' high risk ', ' public health relevance ', ' social science research ', ' ']",NINR,BAYLOR COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,R21,2014,227154,0.1397417068308806
"Personalized Bio-behavioral Weight Loss Intervention for African American Women     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This K01 Mentored Research Scientist Development Award proposal is designed to provide the scholarly training, mentorship, and resources necessary for the candidate to develop expertise in bio-behavioral research. The candidate's primary career goal is to become a funded independent investigator and recognized leader in the field of obesity prevention/treatment with expertise in developing personalized bio-behavioral weight loss interventions for African American (AA) women. To achieve this goal, a focused career development plan is proposed to: 1) Obtain knowledge and skills in understanding how genetic variants may be related to adiposity; modulate influence of lifestyle behaviors (i.e.PA, diet) upon changes in adiposity, and how these genotypes may eventually be used to help personalize behavioral interventions for obese AA women; 2) Obtain knowledge and skills in complex quantitative research methods, including bio-behavioral research designs and analyses, and advanced intervention development; and, 3) Enhance grant and scholarly writing skills, and manuscript production while continuing to build interdisciplinary collaboration with other researchers in the field of genetics, obesity and prevention research. The Medical University of South Carolina provides a comprehensive training environment that includes senior scientists with expertise in bio-behavioral interventions, genetics, and health disparities research. The candidate has a strong inter-professional and inter-institutional mentoring team with complementary expertise in the development of community based randomized controlled trials (RCT), genetics, obesity prevention and treatment, bio-behavioral interventions, biostatistics and epidemiology. The research plan, which builds on the training objectives, is directly responsive to the National Institute of Nursing Research's (NINR) mission of integrating the biological and behavioral sciences, employing new technologies to research questions, improving research methods, and developing the scientists of the future. The broad goal of this research is to identify key components for development of efficacious socio-culturally tailored behavioral interventions for long-term weight loss in low socioeconomic status (SES) obese AA women. The socio-cultural preferences will be incorporated into behavioral change strategies, the communication of genetic information, and the adaptation of the format and delivery of the evidence-based Diabetes Prevention Program materials and approaches to promote weight loss. To meet this goal, the candidate will conduct an exploratory study using genetic database secondary data analyses. Secondly, an intervention development phase, with 80 obese AA women living in public housing neighborhoods in the Charleston, SC region, to integrate new knowledge and skills from genetics while advancing skills in bio- behavioral research intervention development and methodology. The results of the proposed preliminary studies will inform a larger, adequately powered and resourced community based RCT for obese AA women that incorporates the use of genetic information and socio-cultural preferences to prescribe tailored weight loss strategies and promote long-term weight loss outcomes.          This innovative research plan addresses the need to integrate genetics, socio-environmental, and behavioral factors into promising multi-level community based interventions for disparate minority communities. Demonstrating that genetic and social-environmental components are important in designing and delivering obesity interventions is crucial. Further, gaining better understanding of predictors of obesity and obesity promoting behaviors in AA women could lead to changes in the selection and personalization of treatment approaches for obese AA women, and ultimately, improved outcomes for this population.

"Targeted Analyses of Jackson Heart Study Data     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Jackson Heart Study (JHS) was designed to collect clinical, laboratory, imaging, genetic, and environmental data that could provide insights into the determinants and development of cardiovascular and related diseases in African Americans (AA) residing in the Jackson, MS community.  Between 2000 and 2012, 5301 AA men and women participated at a baseline and two additional clinic examinations.  Obesity and diabetes are important contributors to cardiovascular outcomes and the overall health disparities observed between AAs and whites in the United States. Both conditions are highly prevalent among those enrolled in JHS. The overall goal of this proposal is to enhance the scientific output of the JHS with respect to obesity/diabetes and its cardiometabolic and vascular outcomes.  We propose to conduct in-depth cross- sectional and longitudinal analyses of obesity and glucometabolic parameters, and select outcomes (incident diabetes, subclinical and clinical cardiovascular disease) by engaging scientists in the newly established JHS Obesity Diabetes Working Group (ODWG).  The ODWG will function as a virtual team, utilizing a combination of teleconferences, in person meetings, and internet-based file sharing tools, and will include Wake Forest, JHS and other interested investigators and trainees. The investigative team includes expertise in epidemiology, biostatistics, imaging, diabetes, obesity, and cardiovascular disease.  We also have an extant relationship with JHS as Wake Forest served as the reading center for the CT and MRI studies performed at exams 2 and 3. A focus of ODWG activities includes mentoring junior investigators and trainees. We also expect that analysis and dissemination of these data will spur the application for separate funding for ancillary studies.                PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This research seeks to better understand obesity and diabetes in African American adults by establishing a  working group to analyze obesity and diabetes-related data collected by the Jackson Heart Study in 5301  African American men and women.

"Integrated genomic analysis of racial disparities in endometrial cancer     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Although the incidence of endometrial cancer in African-American (AA) women is lower than in Caucasian (C) women, a striking racial disparity exists in endometrial cancer survival rates in the United States, with blacks having up to 30% worse survival rates than whites. Socio-demographic factors alone cannot account for this difference because differences in survival still occur when analyses are adjusted for black and white women by stage and by biologically aggressive (i.e., Type II) endometrial tumors. Uterine serous papillary carcinoma (USC), represents the most aggressive histologic subtype of endometrial cancer. This variant of endometrial carcinoma is up to three fold more frequent in AA women when compared to C women. On the basis of our recently published data on the genetic landscape of USC suggesting that genetic and biologic factors may underlie the racial disparity in survival rates and with the ultimate goal to develop novel, more specific and more effective treatment modalities for the diagnosis and therapy of USC so common in AA women, we propose the following: Aim 1: Identify through whole exome sequencing driver mutation candidates, loss of heterozygosity (LOH) patterns and copy number variations (CNV) in 200 USC samples and use bioinformatics strategies to perform a systematic assessment of genetic differences between AA vs C tumors, Aim 2: Evaluate miRNAs and mRNA expression differences in USC from AA and C and perform downstream analysis of pathways influencing disease in different groups of USC (i.e., c-erbB2+ vs negative and PIK3CA and CCNE1 mutants vs wild type) and Aim 3: Evaluate the biochemical properties of a subset of novel PIK3CA mutations and validate the c-erbB2/PIK3CA and CCNE1 pathways as novel targets for USC treatment using primary USC cell lines and targeted agents including trastuzumab and T-DM1 (i.e., mAbs targeting c-erbB2), AZD8055, GDC-0980 and CYC065 (i.e., a mTOR/PI3K/CDK inhibitors) in in vitro and in vivo assays. This proposal encompasses the first integrated analysis of genomic differences in USC developed by AA when compared to C women as well as the validation of the currently identified differentially expressed genes harboring key driver mutations as novel targets for USC therapy in minority. Relevance Definition and functional validation of key driver mutations and downstream signaling pathways differentially active in AA women harboring USC may be used to guide novel, highly effective targeted therapies against these highly aggressive tumors and, therefore, may have immediate clinical relevance on minority health.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Type II endometrial tumors such as uterine serous carcinoma (USC) are more commonly diagnosed in AA women when compared to C women, suggesting a genetic predisposition in black women to develop these biologically aggressive neoplasms. This proposal is designed to perform the first comprehensive analysis of genomic differences in USC developed by AA women when compared to C women. We will search for driver gene mutations, loss of heterozygosity (LOH) and copy number variations (CNV) and identify miRNAs and genes highly differentially expressed in USC developed by AA women when compared to C women. These studies will provide essential information for a better understanding of the genetic cause of the disparity in frequency of this diagnosis in AA women as well as the molecular basis responsible for the unfavorable prognosis more frequent in AA women relative to C women. Finally, our results will provide essential information for the development of USC-specific therapies for preventing progression of advanced/recurrent disease after conventional surgery and chemotherapy.            ",Integrated genomic analysis of racial disparities in endometrial cancer,8687174,U01CA176067,"['Accounting ', ' Animals ', ' inhibitor ', ' inhibitor/antagonist ', '

"Racial Disparities in Breast Cancer and the role of micro-RNAs     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There is a racial disparity in the breast cancer outcomes between African-American (AA) and Caucasian (CA) women. For example, mortality rates for breast cancer in AA women can be three times higher than for CA, even though the incidence is lower in AA women (1). AA women develop triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) at earlier age, more often diagnosed with advanced stage, likely to experience metastasis and often unresponsive to treatment compared to CA women (1, 2). Although some patients respond to chemotherapy, initially, tumor recurrence within 1 to 3 years post chemotherapy with high incidence of mortality occurring by 5 years (3). Our research group and others have reported that cancer stem-like cells (CSCs or tumor initiating cells), which are characterized by their self-renewal and resistance to therapy leading to tumor recurrence and metastasis, are particularly abundant in women with TNBC compared to those with other types of breast cancer (4, 5). We have also observed that isolated CSCs in CRL-2335 and MDA-MB468 cell lines derived from AA TNBC patients (i) showed significantly longer survival and the ability to form mammospheres compared to those CSCs in MDA-MB-231 and BT549 cell lines derived from CA TNBC patients (ii) after treatment with cisplatin plus tumor-necrosis factor (TNF)-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL), exhibited decreased expression of miR-100 and miR-23b and significant increase in FZD8, one of the Wnt receptors (also a target for miR-100) which plays a major role in CSC renewal, as compared to those seen in MDA-MB-231 and BT549 cell lines derived from CA TNBC patients. Hence, we hypothesized that differences in the self- renewal of cancer stem cells (CSCs) contributes to the racial disparities in TNBC. In order to test our hypothesis, we have two specific aims: Aim 1: Determine the role of CSCs in TNBC in African-American women compared to Caucasian women. Aim 2: Develop a new tumor model to address the role of microRNAs (miR-100 and miR-23b) in CSCs self- renewal, tumor progression and treatment in vivo. Successful completion of the proposed studies will give insights into the molecular biology of CSCs and their role, if any, in racial differences between AA and CA TNBC patients and, also provide new targets for their elimination for effective therapy.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: There is a racial disparity in the breast cancer outcomes between African-American (AA) and Caucasian (CA) women. For example, mortality rates for breast cancer in AA women can be three times higher than for CA, even though the incidence is lower in AA women. The overall goal of this project is to determine the mechanism and the role of FZD8 in the regulation of tumor initiating cells (TICs) and drug resistance in AA and CA derived cells.

"African American Elders' Psych-Social-Spiritual Healing across Serious Illness     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Although comprehensive palliative care for patients with serious illness improves quality of life, quality of care and patient satisfaction, the growin population of African American (AA) elders with serious illness experience disparities in the receipt of palliative care, dissatisfaction with that care, and care inconsistent with their wishes leading to decreased quality of life and increased suffering. In addition, little is known about th AA elders' cultural values and beliefs about the psycho-social-spiritual dimensions of palliative and end-of-life care. Disparities in palliative and end-of-life care are due to lack of integrationof culturally sensitive psychological, social and spiritual healing for AA elders with serious illness Patient-centered palliative care focuses on psychological, sociological and spiritual dimensions of healing, as well as the physiological, to decrease suffering and improve quality of life. Healin is conceptualized as generating a ""life transforming positive subjective change"" or what has been described as psychological-social-spiritual healing occurring when one experiences a serious illness. The Principal Investigator has a unique opportunity to collaborate with colleagues at the NIH Clinical Center Pain and Palliative Care Service, who are studying this phenomenon and methods to measure it. The proposed study will investigate psych-social-spiritual healing for seriously ill AA elders to decrease critical gaps in knowledge about culturaly sensitive palliative patient-centered interventions for AA elders with serious illness. It will tak place in Mississippi, which is greatly underserved for palliative care. The long-term goals are to develop and test culturally sensitive interventions that support psych-social- spiritual healing through provision of patient-centered palliative care across a more diverse patient population, contributing to decreased suffering and improved quality of life for the AA elder with serious illness. There are 2 specific aims. Aim 1) Describe categories and patterns of psych-social-spiritual healing from the perspective of AA elders with serious illness. Using the qualitative method of narrative analysis, we will describe psychological, social and spiritual experiences of healing for AA elders with serious illnesses of cancer, stroke, heart failure and/or diabetes. Aim 2) Examine the NIH Clinical Center's psych-social-spiritual healing measure as a valid, culturally appropriate measure for AA elders with serious illnesses. Using a verbal probing, cognitive interviewing methodology for content validity, we will summarize participants' interpretations on each item of the measure. Together, these findings will serve to characterize psych-social-spiritual healing for AA elders. To avoid subject burden, we will enroll separate samples of 10-15 AA elders with serious illness for each aim. Data will be collected through audio-recorded interviews. The outcomes of this study and the training plan will prepare the Principal Investigator to launch a program of research focused on testing culturally sensitive palliative care interventions to improve the quality of life of AA elders with serious illness.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research is relevant to public health because disparities in palliative care for AA elders with serious illness exist due to lack of integration f culturally sensitive psychological, social and spiritual care practices. The expected outcomes of the proposed study will be descriptions of categories and patterns of experiences of psycho-social-spiritual healing from the AA elders' stories about their serious illness and will summaries of individual item analyses, informing decisions about the cultural applicability and content validity of the current National Institutes of Health psych-social-spiritual healing measure. Together, these findings will serve to characterize PSS healing for AA elders. Collectively, these outcomes will provide directions for the next steps in the PI's program of research, namely development and testing of culturally sensitive, patient- centered palliative care interventions to promote psych-social-spiritual healing for AA elders with serious illness.            ",African American Elders' Psych-Social-Spiritual Healing across Serious Illness,8832028,F31NR014964,"['senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Elderly ', ' Belief ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' diabetes ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' spiritual healing ', ' Goals ', ' health insurance for disabled ', ' Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Disabled Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Aged and Disabled, Title 18 ', ' Medicare ', ' cardiac failure ', ' Heart failure ', ' Interview ', ' Methods ', ' Method LOINC Axis 6 ', ' Methodology ', ' Mississippi ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' comfort care ', ' Palliative Treatment ', ' Palliative Therapy ', ' Palliative Care ', ' Patient Satisfaction ', ' Client satisfaction ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' QOL ', ' Quality of life ', ' Research ', ' Research Support ', ' Science ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' brain attack ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Apoplexy ', ' stroke ', ' Testing ', ' Measures ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' Outcome Measure ', ' Caring ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Healed ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' psychological ', ' psychologic ', ' Training ', ' Discipline ', ' Individual ', ' Pain Relief Units ', ' Pain Centers ', ' Pain Clinics ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Dimensions ', ' Pattern ', ' Outcome Study ', ' Services ', ' experience ', ' Participant ', ' Categories ', ' cultural values ', ' social ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' QOC ', ' Quality of Care ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' palliative ', ' end-of-life ', ' end of life ', ' Qualitative Methods ', ' Data ', ' Cognitive ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Principal Investigator ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' beneficiary ', ' healing ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' patient centered ', ' patient oriented ', ' public health relevance ', ' patient population ', ' clinical practice ', ' ']",NINR,UNIVERSITY OF ARIZONA,F31,2014,33177,0.10511033421752308
"Technology Intensified Diabetes Education Study in AA with T2DM (TIDES)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposed K24 application is designed to support the career and research trajectory of the candidate by providing protected time to conduct patient-oriented research on interventions to reduce complications and deaths from diabetes in ethnic minority groups and mentor the next generation of women and minority clinical investigators in health disparities research. The specific aims of the proposed K24 application will be accomplished by completing the following three objectives: Mentoring Objective: To increase the pool of clinical researchers who can conduct patient-oriented research and successfully compete for peer-reviewed grants, as well as mentor the next generation of women and minority clinical investigators, who are engaged in the national effort to reduce and eliminate health care disparities. This will be accomplished by mentoring 2 women/minority investigators each year for 5 years. Career Development Objective: To obtain additional training in clinical trials methodology, comparative effectiveness research and community-based participatory research, that would greatly enhance the candidate's research capability and make him a more effective mentor to trainees in clinical research. This will be accomplished by taking 2 courses a year in advanced statistics, decision analysis, informatics, bioethics, responsible conduct of research, and health economics. Research Objective: The primary objective is to test the efficacy of a technology-intensified diabetes education/skills training (TIDES) intervention using the FORA 2-in-1 Telehealth System for diabetes in improving HbA1c levels in AAs with poorly controlled T2DM. The secondary objectives are to test the efficacy of a technology-intensified diabetes education/skills training (TIDES) intervention using the FORA 2-in-1 and Telehealth System for diabetes in improving BP control and quality of life in AAs with poorly controlled T2DM. Exploratory analyses will examine improvements in self-care behaviors (i.e. diet, physical activity, self glucose monitoring, and medication adherence) and the role of self-care as mediators of metabolic control.     Mentorship is an important component of career advancement in academic medicine. Several studies have established that lack of mentoring is a reason for poor career advancement and attrition, particularly among women and minority faculty. The candidate who has a track record of mentoring women and minority faculty would benefit from the protected time for mentoring afforded by the proposed K24 award, while allowing continued research to eliminate disparities in diabetes. The proposed K24 application is designed to support the career and research trajectory of the candidate by providing protected time to conduct patient-oriented research on interventions to reduce complications and deaths from diabetes in ethnic minority groups and mentor the next generation of women and minority clinical investigators in health disparities research.

"Social Context and Inflammatory Risk for Stroke in African American Women     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Despite declines in age-adjusted cardiovascular (CVD) mortality, the incidence of coronary heart disease (CHD)/ stroke is almost twice as high in African American (AA) women compared to non-Hispanic White (NHW) women. The additional burden of CHD/stroke disease borne by AA women is attributed to factors such as socioeconomic status, psychosocial stress, and greater number of risk factors. Economically disadvantaged AA women experience higher levels of chronic stress than NHW women. Yet, little is known about how prior life adversity, such as childhood maltreatment, chronic/perceived stress, perceived discrimination, subjective socio-economic status (SSS), and socioeconomic status (SES) contribute to the disparity in CHD/stroke disease between AA and NHW women. Further, proinflammatory processes are known to contribute to CHD/stroke and compelling evidence demonstrates that adverse prior life experiences result in epigenetic alterations (i.e., changes in DNA methylation), which, in turn, increase stress reactivity and proinflammatory cytokine production. The purpose of this three-year mentored research development application is to provide the necessary training and experience to allow for an independent career in which the psychosocial and proinflammatory mechanisms that underlie CHD/stroke disease disparities can be identified. The training objectives are to: (1) Expand knowledge of the relationships among prior life adversity, proinflammatory stress response, and global DNA methylation status in relation to CHD/stroke disease disparities; (2) Acquire new knowledge and research skills in study design, recruitment, data collection, and interpretation of data as it relates to prior life adversity, proinflammatory stress response, and global DNA methylation in minority women at risk for CHD/stroke; (3) Obtain hands-on training and gain knowledge in the laboratory analysis and interpretation of salivary cortisol, proinflammatory cytokines, and global DNA methylation; and (4) Develop advanced statistical expertise in modeling. To accomplish these objectives and provide a foundation for a sustained research career, the candidate will conduct a study comparing 46 AA and 46 NHW at risk for CHD/stroke in order to (1) Determine the extent to which prior life adversity contributes to CHD/stroke risk and the proinflammatory response (IL-6) to acute stress in AA compared to NHW women at risk for CHD/stroke, (2) Determine the degree to which prior life adversity predicts global DNA methylation status in AA and NHW women at risk for CHD/stroke, and (3) Evaluate global DNA methylation status as a predictor of the proinflammatory response (IL-6) to acute stress in AA and NHW women at risk for CHD/stroke. The significance of this study lies in its potential to clarify mechanisms of CHD/stroke disease susceptibility and to determine the possible basis for the health disparity exhibited by disadvantaged, minority women. Findings will inform the development of novel risk profiles to identify those at most risk for CHD/stroke burden.           PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: African American women suffer twice as many ischemic cardiac events and strokes as do non-Hispanic White women. Prior life adversity is linked to increased proinflammatory risk and may contribute to CHD/stroke disease disparities. It is expected that findings from this study will inform the development of novel risk profiles for CHD/stroke and lead to earlier identification and targeting of interventions to reduce disease burden.            ",Social Context and Inflammatory Risk for Stroke in African American Women,8700171,K01NR013478,"['Affect ', ' Age ', ' Age Factors ', ' Behavioral Sciences ', ' cardiovascular

"A novel racial disparity marker for risk prediction in triple negative breast cancer patients ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Breast cancers in African American (AA) women are characterized by earlier onset, higher aggressiveness, more extensive metastases, and increased mortality rates compared to those in European American (EA) women. This breast cancer-related health disparity is partly due to the fact that AA women are more likely than EA women to develop a particularly aggressive breast cancer subtype, called Triple-Negative Breast Cancer (TNBC). TNBC is characterized by fast progression to metastasis and high mortality rates. Furthermore, there are no targeted therapies for TNBC. Critical barriers to progress in improving outcomes for AA TNBC patients are (i) a lack of reliable risk-predictive biomarkers that can identify TNBCs at high risk of progressing rapidly to metastatic disease, and (ii) targeted therapies for TNBCs. Since tumor biology between AA and EA women with TNBC can vary greatly, the optimal way to combat TNBC may differ between AA and EA patients. Thus, it is critical to identify key biomarkers that may have special therapeutic and prognostic value within certain ethnic subgroups. We recently found that AA TNBC patients were ~3 times as likely as EA TNBC patients to have high nuclear levels of HSET, a centrosome-clustering kinesin. We found that higher nuclear HSET levels were also associated with more aggressive tumor features and decreased metastasis-free survival. As a result, nuclear HSET may be a racial disparity biomarker in TNBC. Furthermore, HSET may be a valuable target to suppress metastasis because we found that TNBC cell migration was inhibited by HSET knockdown. Overexpression of Npap60L, a nucleoporin isoform, is known to suppress nuclear import. In a search of publically-available gene expression databases, we found that AA TNBCs have lower Npap60L levels than EA TNBCs. Therefore, we hypothesize that low Npap60L levels in AA TNBCs promotes nuclear accumulation of HSET. Our novel paradigm that ethnic differences in nuclear transport pathways promote different subcellular localization of HSET, a key mediator of metastasis, is a groundbreaking conceptual advancement. It holds translational promise not only in metastatic risk prediction but also in providing an anti- metastatic therapeutic target for TNBC patients with high nuclear HSET. AIM 1 will establish nuclear HSET as a racial disparity biomarker by evaluating its nuclear expression as a predictor of a) metastasis, b) poor progression-free survival, and c) poor overall survival in AA TNBC patients. AIM 2 will test whether racial differences in the levels of a nucleoporin protein (Npap60L) involved in nuclear import promotes nuclear retention of HSET in AA TNBCs. The overall impact of this project will be to validate HSET as a racial disparity biomarker and mechanistically define the Npap60L-HSET axis as a new pathway that can be targeted to thwart metastatic onset in AA TNBC patients and alleviate ethnic breast cancer-related health disparity.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Critical barriers to progress in treating triple negative breast cancer (TNBC), a particularly aggressive breast cancer subtype that is 2-3 times more common in African American (AA) than European American women, is a lack of reliable risk-predictive biomarkers and targeted therapies for TNBC. The goal of this project is (i) to validate nuclear HSET as a novel racial disparity biomarker that predicts poor clinical outcomes for TNBC, and (ii) to understand why AA TNBC cells accumulate more HSET in their nuclei. Successful outcomes of this STTR proposal may lead to the development of a clinically-facile immunohistochemistry kit that would enable identification of TNBC patients with high risk of progressing rapidly to metastatic disease.            ",A novel racial disparity marker for risk prediction in triple negative breast cancer patients,8997736,R41MD010303,"['Accounting ', ' inhibitor ', ' inhibitor/antagonist ', ' Attention ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Biological Assay ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Motility ', ' Cellular Motility ', ' Cellular Migration ', ' Cell Movement ', ' Cell Migration ', ' Cell Locomotion ', ' cell motility ', ' Nucleus ', ' Cell Nucleus ', ' Cell Viability ', ' Cell Survival ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Goals ', ' Hormone Receptor ', ' Modern Man ', ' Man (Taxonomy) ', ' Human ', ' Immunohistochemistry Staining Method ', ' Immunohistochemistry Cell/Tissue ', ' Immunohistochemistry ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Methods ', ' Mortality ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' tumor cell metastasis ', ' cancer metastasis ', ' Tumor Cell Migration ', ' Secondary Tumor ', ' Secondary Neoplasm ', ' Metastatic Tumor ', ' Metastatic Neoplasm ', ' Metastasize ', ' Metastasis ', ' Neoplasm Metastasis ', ' Patients ', ' pilot study ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' gene product ', ' Proteins ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Recurrent ', ' Recurrence ', ' Risk ', ' Ribonucleic Acid ', ' RNA Gene Products ', ' Non-Polyadenylated RNA ', ' RNA ', ' Running ', ' Metastatic to ', ' Solutions ', ' Stains ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Tissues ', ' Woman ', ' matrigel ', ' Relative ', ' Relative (related person) ', ' Kinesin ', ' Paraffin Embedding ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Evaluation ', ' prognostic ', ' European ', ' data repository ', ' clinical data repository ', ' Electronic Database ', ' Electronic Databank ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Databases ', ' Centrosome ', ' Progression-Free Survivals ', ' Confocal Microscopy ', ' Importins ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Malignant Cell ', ' cancer cell ', ' Stainings ', ' Staining method ', ' Nuclear ', ' Nuclear Localization Signal Peptide ', ' NLS Peptide ', ' Nuclear Localization Signal ', ' American ', ' Isoforms ', ' Protein Isoforms ', ' Receptor Protein ', ' receptor ', ' cohort ', ' Cytotoxic Therapy ', ' Cytotoxic Chemotherapy ', ' novel ', ' race differences ', ' racial difference ', ' ethnic difference ', ' Somatic Cell ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Sampling ', ' Nucleocytoplasmic Shuttling ', ' Nuclear Transport ', ' Cell Nucleus Active Transport ', ' nucleocytoplasmic transport ', ' treatment adverse effect ', ' therapy adverse effect ', ' side effect ', ' Treatment Side Effects ', ' Adverse effects ', ' Nuclear Import ', ' Formalin ', ' Nup Protein ', ' Nucleoporins ', ' Nuclear Pore Complex Proteins ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' Binding ', ' Binding (Molecular Function) ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Pharmacological Substance ', ' Pharmaceuticals ', ' Pharmaceutical Agent ', ' Pharmacologic Substance ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Breast Cancer Treatment ', ' Data ', ' Human Breast Cancer Cell ', ' Breast Cancer Cell ', ' Predictive Value ', ' Subgroup ', ' Risk Marker ', ' STTR ', ' Small Business Technology Transfer Research ', ' Tissue Chip ', ' Tissue Arrays ', ' Tissue Microarray ', ' Tumor Biology ', ' Validation ', ' Molecular ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' early onset ', ' transcriptome ', ' gene expression signature ', ' gene expression pattern ', ' Gene Expression Profile ', ' triple-negative breast cancer ', ' triple-negative invasive breast carcinoma ', ' Minority ', ' clinical efficacy ', ' Outcome ', ' cancer type ', ' therapeutic target ', ' tumor ', ' high risk ', ' combat ', ' overexpress ', ' overexpression ', ' public health relevance ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' ']",NIMHD,"NOVAZOI THERANOSTICS, INC.",R41,2015,193968,-0.011301344709065117
"Roles of Semaphorin Signaling in Breast Cancer Racial Disparities ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Breast cancer (BC) is the second most common cancer diagnosed in American women and is also the second leading cause of cancer death in women. Compared to Caucasian American (CA) women, African American (AA) women display earlier onset of BC, are more likely to be diagnosed with metastatic types of BC at the time of presentation, and have a significantly higher mortality rate. Our long term goal is to reveal the biological factors underlying racial disparities in BC outcomes and thereby facilitate development of novel clinical applications to eliminate such disparities. The biological factors that mediate BC racial disparities remain largely unknown. We performed a bioinformatic analysis using a dataset from TCGA (NCI) and unexpectedly identified that SEMA6D expression in BC tissues from AA women was significantly lower than in CA women. The low expression level of SEMA6D correlates significantly with poor survival of BC patients, and the association is more dramatic for patients with triple negative receptor status (ER, PR and HER2). In further support of our initial finding, examination of multiple datasets from NCBI GEO confirmed that expression of SEMA6D is significantly reduced in BC tissues compared to normal tissues. Our initial functional assay indicated that SEMA6D represses BC cell metastasis both in vitro and in vivo. SEMA6D is a member of the Semaphorin family of signaling molecules and its functions in BC pathogenesis have never been reported in the literature. Based on results from both our bioinformatic and functional analyses, we hypothesize that SEMA6D inhibits BC metastasis and differential expression of SEMA6D is a causative factor for outcome disparities observed in AA versus CA patients. We will initially test our hypothesis through the following two aims In Aim 1; we will determine the in vivo activity of SEMA6D in repressing BC metastasis. In Aim 2, we will characterize the potential mechanism for the differential expression of SEMA6D observed in AA versus CA patients. In this study, we will examine for the first time the role of SEMA6D in repressing BC metastasis. This study represents the first to connect Semaphorin signaling with BC racial disparities. Accomplishing this study will provide crucial clues for understanding the biological basis for racial disparities in BC and will facilitate development of novel diagnostic/therapeutic approaches to eliminate such disparities. Our preliminary studies provide a strong foundation for our central hypothesis and demonstrate that we have established the necessary tools for the proposed work. The tightly focused nature of the proposed studies will allow us to address these questions within the time-frame of this grant.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: In this study, we will evaluate the role of SEMA6D in breast cancer racial disparities.                ",Roles of Semaphorin Signaling in Breast Cancer Racial Disparities,8972564,R21CA199586,"['Abbreviations ', ' Accounting ', ' Affect ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Natural Products ', ' Biologic Factor ', ' Biological Factors ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' Cells ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Family ', ' Foundations ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Immunohistochemistry Staining Method ', ' Immunohistochemistry Cell/Tissue ', ' Immunohistochemistry ', ' In Vitro ', ' Literature ', ' milk agent ', ' Mammary Cancer Virus ', ' MMTV ', ' Bittner Virus ', ' Mouse Mammary Tumor Virus ', ' Transgenic Mice ', ' Mortality ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Murine ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Mice ', ' Mus ', ' tumor cell metastasis ', ' cancer metastasis ', ' Tumor Cell Migration ', ' Secondary Tumor ', ' Secondary Neoplasm ', ' Metastatic Tumor ', ' Metastatic Neoplasm ', ' Metastasize ', ' Metastasis ', ' Neoplasm Metastasis ', ' Tumor Staging ', ' Neoplasm Staging ', ' Cancer Staging ', ' Diagnostic Neoplasm Staging ', ' Patients ', ' Polymerase Chain Reaction ', ' Publishing ', ' Repression ', ' Reverse Transcription ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Tissues ', ' transplant ', ' Transplantation ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' Mediating ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization ', ' FISH analysis ', ' FISH Technique ', ' FISH Technic ', ' Fluorescent in Situ Hybridization ', ' base ', ' Malignant ', ' Malignant - descriptor ', ' Biological ', ' white American ', ' caucasian American ', ' neu Genes ', ' erbb2 [{C0242957}] ', ' erbB-2 Genes ', ' c-erbB-2 Proto-Oncogenes ', ' c-erbB-2 Genes ', ' c-erbB-2 ', ' TKR1 ', ' Human EGF Receptor 2 Gene ', ' HER2/neu ', ' HER2 Genes ', ' HER2 ', ' HER/2 ', ' HER-2 Genes ', ' HER-2 ', ' HER -2 ', ' ERBB2 ', ' ERBB2 gene ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Genetic ', ' Normal Tissue ', ' Normal tissue morphology ', ' Malignant Cell ', ' cancer cell ', ' tool ', ' Nature ', ' programs ', ' Distant ', ' Xenotransplantation ', ' Xenograft ', ' Heterologous Transplantation ', ' Heterograft ', ' Xenograft procedure ', ' American ', ' Receptor Protein ', ' receptor ', ' novel ', ' member ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' research study ', ' Pathogenesis ', ' Reporting ', ' Sampling ', ' cancer diagnosis ', ' laser capture microdissection ', ' Semaphorins ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' T-Stage ', ' Tumor stage ', ' Address ', ' Basic Cancer Research ', ' Human Breast Cancer Cell ', ' Breast Cancer Cell ', ' molecular signature ', ' molecular profile ', ' Molecular Fingerprinting ', ' Expression Signature ', ' Expression Profiling ', ' Molecular Profiling ', ' in vivo ', ' Cancer Cause ', ' Cancer Etiology ', ' Epigenetic Mechanism ', ' Epigenetic Change ', ' Epigenetic ', ' Epigenetic Process ', ' ER Status ', ' Estrogen Receptor Status ', ' exploratory developmental study ', ' R21 Program ', ' R21 Mechanism ', ' Exploratory/Developmental Grant ', ' nonmalignant ', ' Non-Malignant ', ' Signaling Molecule ', ' Societal Factors ', ' Molecular ', ' Knockout ', ' Knock-out ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' early onset ', ' triple-negative breast cancer ', ' triple-negative invasive breast carcinoma ', ' pyrosequencing ', ' Outcome ', ' migration ', ' cancer disparity ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' clinical applicability ', ' clinical application ', ' next generation diagnostics ', ' new diagnostics ', ' novel diagnostics ', ' mouse model ', ' tumor ', ' MDA-MB231 ', ' MDA MB 231 ', ' overexpress ', ' overexpression ', ' public health relevance ', ' TCGA ', ' The Cancer Genome Atlas ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,R21,2015,191835,-0.02132388980417692
"Sustaining palliative care to drug users with HIV/AIDS & health disparities DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): With increasing HIV survival and disability, informal (unpaid) caregivers play a growing role in the well-being of persons living with HIV/AIDS (PLHAs), especially as they enter end of life (EOL). Major goals of palliative care (PC) programs are to enhance the quality of life (QOL) of patients and their families, optimize function, and facilitate patient-family decision making on EOL treatment and discussion with medical providers. African American (AA) injection drug users (IDUs) experience disparities in prevalence and outcomes of HIV, in part due to their suboptimal healthcare and treatment adherence, and have low access to PC. The PI's research indicates most AA IDU PLHAs have caregivers and that they play a key role in their healthcare, treatment adherence and mental health. Our preliminary findings also suggest AA IDU PLHAs' caregivers have major risks for burnout and early cessation of care. Research is needed to understand ways to promote AA IDU PLHAs' HIV care and facilitate discussion and mutual understanding of their treatment goals and EOL care preferences with caregivers and providers to ensure their and their caregivers' QOL. The proposed mixed methods, longitudinal study is based on a social ecological, network resource framework and builds on the study team's novel HIV caregiving research program, pediatric HIV PC clinic program, and research on patient- provider communication on EOL issues. Caregiving can be highly stressful, and costly of financial and social resources, which can lead to caregiver burnout (e.g., role overload, captivity) and cessation of care. Major risks of care cessation include recipients' late stage illness, intensive (personal) care needs, substance abuse and other problem behaviors, and caregivers' lack of social support. Preliminary findings from our recent Beacon study suggest caregivers of were highly involved in AA IDU PLHA care recipients' medical adherence and had a dearth of social support. And 79% of recipients reported pain, which was associated with illicit drug use, posing a potential threat to their caregiving relationship and QOL. The proposed study expands our caregiving research program into new areas of PC, EOL, and caregiver resiliencies. The study will comprise four long- term follow-up assessment of the Beacon sample (up to six years) and new recruits (n=400 dyads, half from Beacon); and a qualitative component exploring PC, EOL, and caregiving resiliencies from caregiver and recipient perspectives. The study will address some of the methodological and theoretical limitations of prior caregiving and PC research. The findings will inform the team's later development of interventions to promote AA IDU PLHA caregivers' and recipients' sustained care and QOL by potentially intervening at the dyad, support network or medical provider level. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Relevance Caregivers provide a range of assistance critical to PLHAs' palliative care (PC) and quality of life (QOL). Research is needed to understand how to sustain caregiving and caregivers' QOL through end of life (EOL) of vulnerable African American, injection drug using (IDU) PLHAs. The study represents an obvious next step to the new team's PC, EOL, and caregiving research by identifying barriers and facilitators to sustained HIV care, its impact on QOL, and implications to adult HIV PC practice.",Sustaining palliative care to drug users with HIV/AIDS & health disparities,8814279,R01NR014050,"['Acquired Immunologic Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immuno-Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency ', ' AIDS ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Affect ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Elderly ', ' Communication ', ' Decision Making ', ' Morphinan-3,6-diol, 7,8-didehydro-4,5-epoxy-17-methyl- (5alpha,6alpha)-, diacetate (ester) ', ' Diamorphine ', ' Diacetylmorphine ', ' Heroin ', ' Information Disclosure ', ' Disclosure ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Expenditure ', ' Family ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' long-term study ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' Memory ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Methods ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Mortality ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Persons ', ' Painful ', ' Pain ', ' comfort care ', ' Palliative Treatment ', ' Palliative Therapy ', ' Palliative Care ', ' Patients ', ' well-being ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' Play ', ' QOL ', ' Quality of life ', ' recruit ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' Research ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Rewards ', ' Risk ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' personal care ', ' Self Care ', ' social support network ', ' Social support ', ' Testing ', ' Translations ', ' Measures ', ' Care Givers ', ' Caregivers ', ' Intensive Care ', ' Outcomes Assessment ', ' Outcome Assessment (Health Care) ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' depressive ', ' depression symptom ', ' Emotional Depression ', ' depressive symptoms ', ' Illicit Drugs ', ' Health Benefit ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' doubt ', ' Uncertainty ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' Area ', ' Medical ', ' Ensure ', ' disability ', ' drug use ', ' Drug usage ', ' behavioral problem ', ' Problem behavior ', ' Collaborations ', ' Staging ', ' Drug user ', ' cognitively impaired ', ' cognitive loss ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Clinic ', ' burn-out ', ' burnout ', ' Lifestyle-Related Problem ', ' Lifestyle-Related Disorder ', ' Behavior-Related Problem ', ' Behavior-Related Disorder ', ' Lifestyle-related condition ', ' Injection Drug User ', ' Injecting drug user ', ' experience ', ' novel ', ' member ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' HIV/AIDS problem ', ' HIV/AIDS ', ' AIDS/HIV ', ' AIDS/HIV problem ', ' substance abuse ', ' abuse of substances ', ' Substance abuse problem ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' stigma ', ' social stigma ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' highly active anti-retroviral therapy ', ' HAART ', ' Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy ', ' Provider ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' therapy adherence ', ' Address ', ' end-of-life ', ' end of life ', ' Adherence ', ' Adherence (attribute) ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' care giving ', ' caregiving ', ' care preference ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' treatment development ', ' intervention development ', ' develop therapy ', ' therapy development ', ' clinical care ', ' evidence base ', ' pediatric HIV ', ' pediatric human immunodeficiency virus ', ' treatment adherence ', ' clinical practice ', ' cocaine use ', ' injection drug use ', ' ']",NINR,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R01,2015,447287,0.03508098508929571
"Targeted Analyses of Jackson Heart Study Data DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Jackson Heart Study (JHS) was designed to collect clinical, laboratory, imaging, genetic, and environmental data that could provide insights into the determinants and development of cardiovascular and related diseases in African Americans (AA) residing in the Jackson, MS community.  Between 2000 and 2012, 5301 AA men and women participated at a baseline and two additional clinic examinations.  Obesity and diabetes are important contributors to cardiovascular outcomes and the overall health disparities observed between AAs and whites in the United States. Both conditions are highly prevalent among those enrolled in JHS. The overall goal of this proposal is to enhance the scientific output of the JHS with respect to obesity/diabetes and its cardiometabolic and vascular outcomes.  We propose to conduct in-depth cross- sectional and longitudinal analyses of obesity and glucometabolic parameters, and select outcomes (incident diabetes, subclinical and clinical cardiovascular disease) by engaging scientists in the newly established JHS Obesity Diabetes Working Group (ODWG).  The ODWG will function as a virtual team, utilizing a combination of teleconferences, in person meetings, and internet-based file sharing tools, and will include Wake Forest, JHS and other interested investigators and trainees. The investigative team includes expertise in epidemiology, biostatistics, imaging, diabetes, obesity, and cardiovascular disease.  We also have an extant relationship with JHS as Wake Forest served as the reading center for the CT and MRI studies performed at exams 2 and 3. A focus of ODWG activities includes mentoring junior investigators and trainees. We also expect that analysis and dissemination of these data will spur the application for separate funding for ancillary studies. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This research seeks to better understand obesity and diabetes in African American adults by establishing a  working group to analyze obesity and diabetes-related data collected by the Jackson Heart Study in 5301  African American men and women.

"Community-led Policies and Leadership to Eliminate Disparities for Asian Ame     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Tobacco control policy change has contributed tremendously to decreasing tobacco use and represents one of public health's top 10 achievements in the 20th century. Despite the great success of tobacco policy change, the decline in tobacco use prevalence has stalled with still high rates particularly among marginalized communities of color, Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders (AA and NHPIs) are one of the fastest growing populations in the U.S., yet we understand very little about the most effective processes and pathways for engaging AAs and NHPIs in policy change that result in successful compliance and eventual community norm change on tobacco. We propose to conduct a three-year community-based participatory research (CBPR) study titled Community-led Policies and Leadership to Eliminate Disparities for Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders on Tobacco (Com-PLEAT). The overall goal of this research is to identify and understand the pathways to successful tobacco control policy change among two AA and NHPI communities: Cambodians in Long Beach County and Pacific Islanders (including Native Hawaiians, Samoans and Chamorros) in San Diego County. The specific aims of this study are twofold: 1) to develop, and test a 4-prong policy change framework and its effect in helping to mobilize Asian American and Pacific Islander (AA and NHPI) (Cambodian and Chamorro) communities on tobacco control using key informant interviews, community readiness indices and Guttman scalogram analysis; and 2) to study the pathways to successful policy change on tobacco for AAs and NHPIs including the role of capacity building. This proposed Com-PLEAT Study will include key informant interviews, community readiness assessments and Guttman scalogram analysis methodologies and will make a significant contribution to the field of tobacco prevention and control by identifying alternative and more successfully sustained pathways to policy change for AAs and NHPIs. The proposed Com-PLEAT Study seeks to challenge the current framework that policy change will trickle down to all communities equally and the phasing out of culturally-tailored strategies to eliminate health disparities. Using a community-based participatory approach that involves communities in every aspect of the research design, data collection, analysis and dissemination, this study will engage communities to understand perception and motivation about policies and elements critical for full participation in a wide-range of policy interventions.         RELEVANCE (See instructions): The proposed Com-PLEAT Study will contribute not only to the better understanding of effective pathways for tobacco control policy change for Asian American, Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander (NHPI) communities, but also to the replication of this study in other AA and NHPI communities across the U.S. By using innovative research methods, the Com-PLEAT Study will hopefully translate into more effective and sustainable implementation of policy initiatives that include and serve AA and NHPI communities and help reduce health disparities.

"Mitochondria-nuclear crosstalk in triple negative breast cancer racial disparity DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): For Triple Negative BCa (TN BCa), there is a current lack of understanding of driver pathways and hence are often treated using more generic therapies. Currently there are no clinically accepted targets for the treatment for TN BCa and to predict its potential to metastasize. while BCa incidence is higher in Caucasian (CA) women, death due to BCa is higher in African American (AA) women. Importantly, AA patients are more likely to be diagnosed with triple negative (TN) BCa and at a more advanced stage than CA. Mitochondria is considered the energy house of the cell and has been strongly implicated in tumor development and progression and thus serving as a potential target for chemotherapy. With the advent of Transmitochondrial cybrid (cybrid) technology, it is now possible to examine the specific contribution of tumor-associated mitochondria to neoplastic growth and development under a defined nuclear background. Cybrids are constructed by fusing enucleated cells harboring mitochondria of interest with ?0 recipient cells (cells harboring ablated mitochondrial DNA). Using this technology in both an in vitro and in vivo setting, we have demonstrated a key role for mitochondrial retrograde regulation (MRR) progression of TN BCa. We have also identified critical regulation of post-translational modification of Src oncogenic pathway by cancer mitochondria. Our preliminary analysis using cybrids with mitochondria from AA and CA TN BCa cell lines suggest that mitochondrial retrograde regulation (MRR) of nuclear genes are different in AA and CA cells. Here we propose to combine Dr. Kaipparettu's (PI) expertise in BCa and cybrid technology with Dr. Lewis expertize in generating patient derived xenografts and Dr. Creighton's expertise in bioinformatics to evaluate a clinically challenging question, ""How can we better distinguish AA and CA TN BCa by its MRR?"" Strategically, we will use cybrid system generated from AA and CA TN BCa patients-derived xenografts to analyze the mitochondria specific alterations in metastatic BCa. ?0 cells from different TN breast-derived AA and CA nuclear background are already available in Kaipparettu lab. The cybrids thus generated will be confirmed for their mitochondrial function, nuclear origin by next-gen sequencing and evaluated for phenotypic changes using in vitro and in vivo tumor forming/invasion assays. Following this, cybrids with AA and CA mitochondria will be profiled for their Src pathway modification. To identify novel pathways, the MRR of cybrids will be analyzed by microarray and the gene expression will be examined using an established biostatistics and bioinformatics pipelines (Oncomine Concept Mapping) together with the biostatistician Dr. Creighton to generate oncogenic signatures and pathways associated with AA and CA TN BCa metastasis. The nominated pathways will be evaluated for their role in TN BCa progression using cell line and xenograft models. Overall, we expect to develop the first- of-its-kind mitochondria-driven oncogenic signature for AA and CA TN BCa progression. Clinically, we expect these to be translated to identify new drug targets for AA TN BCa. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Racial disparity exists in triple negative breast cancer, which is one of the aggressive subtypes of cancer, with higher number of incidence and mortality in young African American women.

"Circadian Genes and Adipose Function: Impact of Chronotype, Obesity and Race DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There has been an alarming increase in the prevalence of obesity in the United States, but women, in particular African Americans, have been especially hard it. It is thus crucial to identify novel pathways that mediate the increase prevalence of insulin resistance associated with obesity. Disturbances of the circadian clock system in peripheral tissues have emerged as a putative novel risk factor for weight gain and insulin resistance. While the cross-talk between the circadian system and metabolism has been well-documented in nocturnal animal models, in which, contrary to the human, the active period is aligned with high melatonin levels and elevated neuronal activity in the suprachiasmatic nucleus. The potential role of alterations in peripheral clock function in adipose tissue in promoting adiposity-related insulin resistance in women has not been elucidated. Additionally, bariatric surgery has emerged as a frontline treatment with over 200,000 procedures being performed in the US annually. In an ongoing collaboration with a bariatric surgeon, we have obtained preliminary evidence that bariatric surgery rapidly improves insulin action in primary human adipocytes. The central hypothesis of this application is that the reduction in insulin sensitivity in adipose tissue is mediated by alterations in the circadian expression of clock and metabolic genes, and that these disturbances are more pronounced in obese AA women versus non-Hispanic white (NHW) women. Subcutaneous fat biopsies from obese AA and NHW human volunteers will be collected 2 weeks prior to surgery, as well as from matched lean control women. Circadian gene expression will be measured in cultured adipose tissue over a 24 hr period and compared to the systemic insulin sensitivity and chronotype of each individual. During the week prior to surgery, bedtimes and mealtimes will be standardized for half of the obese subjects to determine the impact of central circadian alignment on peripheral circadian gene expression in subcutaneous and mesenteric fat collected at the start of the bariatric procedure. Finally, surgical patients will return 2 and 12 weeks post-surgery before long term weight loss has occurred and subcutaneous fat biopsies will be collected. At 2 weeks, we will determine if the rapid improvement in insulin sensitivity in adipose tissue is commensurate with improvement in the phase and amplitude of circadian gene expression in NHW and AA women. At 12 weeks, when normal meal schedules have resumed but patients remain obese, we will elucidate if bariatric surgery causes an earlier chronotype, which is associated with protection from the development of metabolic disease. At both time points, we will determine if the decreased long term efficacy of bariatric surgery in AA women is concomitant with a reduction in the restoration of peripheral circadian gene expression in adipose tissue. These studies should provide novel and important insights into the interplay of changes in peripheral circadian gene expression and insulin sensitivity that occurs in obesity in NHW and AA women, and may also lead to novel therapeutic interventions to reverse the current racial disparities in the prevalence of metabolic disease in women. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Women are at higher risk of becoming obese, particularly African American women who are 70% more likely to be obese than Non-Hispanic White women. We will test the central hypothesis that the reduction in insulin sensitivity in fat cells o obese women is mediated by perturbations in the daily cycle of gene expression. Furthermore, we will determine the beneficial impact of behavioral adjustment (scheduled sleep and meal times) or bariatric surgery on insulin responsiveness in human adipose tissue samples and explore any racial disparities in the responses obtained.","Circadian Genes and Adipose Function: Impact of Chronotype, Obesity and Race",8929242,R01DK103014,"['yellow adipose tissue ', ' white

"MULTILEVEL HEALTH PROMOTION IN AFRICAN AMERICAN CHURCHES DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposed study focuses on African Americans (AAs) - a population experiencing multiple health disparities. Promotion of healthy behaviors among AAs across the continuum of care from prevention to diagnosis and treatment services is critical to addressing AA health disparities. Black churches may be an ideal setting for health promotion interventions as they have extensive influence and reach in AA communities, high AA attendance rates, and a strong emphasis on health. Yet, limited studies exist on AA church-based health interventions that support a continuum of health services from prevention to linkage to care with church members and community members using church outreach services. This study focuses on planning, developing, and pilot testing an AA church-based multilevel health promotion intervention to address an AA health disparity. Using community-based participatory (CBPR) principles, our faith-health- community-academic partnership's (Heartland Health Network) CAB will assist in engaging faith and other community partners in all aspects of this study from setting the research agenda to pilot intervention development, implementation, evaluation, and dissemination of findings. In Year 1, the planning phase will consist of: a) conducting a needs assessment survey with 10 churches (n=450 adult church members total) and 10 health and community-based organizations (n=50 key stakeholders) to identify a health condition that disproportionately impacts AAs and feasible multilevel intervention strategies; b) holding a church/community forum to review needs assessment survey findings and explore facilitators/barriers and a plausible multilevel intervention strategies; and c) guided by the CAB and needs assessment findings, developing a culturally/religiously tailored, multilevel health promotion intervention that engages church health liaisons and health providers in promoting prevention, health screening, and linkage to care. In Years 2 and 3, a 2- or 3- arm pilot intervention will be tested with 6 AA churches (N=400 church and community members) assessed at baseline and 12-months. Post study focus groups will be conducted with church leaders and CAB members (n=40 total) to assess the CBPR process used in the study.         RELEVANCE: This study is the first to test a multilevel health promotion intervention in African American (AA) churches through delivery of prevention, health screening, and linkage to care services to AA church and community members. This model could have a significant public health impact by providing a faith community engagement model for implementing scalable, wide-reaching socio-ecological interventions and supporting AA faith leaders with a religiously and culturally-appropriate church-based intervention strategies and tools.

"Technology Intensified Diabetes Education Study in AA with T2DM (TIDES) DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposed K24 application is designed to support the career and research trajectory of the candidate by providing protected time to conduct patient-oriented research on interventions to reduce complications and deaths from diabetes in ethnic minority groups and mentor the next generation of women and minority clinical investigators in health disparities research. The specific aims of the proposed K24 application will be accomplished by completing the following three objectives: Mentoring Objective: To increase the pool of clinical researchers who can conduct patient-oriented research and successfully compete for peer-reviewed grants, as well as mentor the next generation of women and minority clinical investigators, who are engaged in the national effort to reduce and eliminate health care disparities. This will be accomplished by mentoring 2 women/minority investigators each year for 5 years. Career Development Objective: To obtain additional training in clinical trials methodology, comparative effectiveness research and community-based participatory research, that would greatly enhance the candidate's research capability and make him a more effective mentor to trainees in clinical research. This will be accomplished by taking 2 courses a year in advanced statistics, decision analysis, informatics, bioethics, responsible conduct of research, and health economics. Research Objective: The primary objective is to test the efficacy of a technology-intensified diabetes education/skills training (TIDES) intervention using the FORA 2-in-1 Telehealth System for diabetes in improving HbA1c levels in AAs with poorly controlled T2DM. The secondary objectives are to test the efficacy of a technology-intensified diabetes education/skills training (TIDES) intervention using the FORA 2-in-1 and Telehealth System for diabetes in improving BP control and quality of life in AAs with poorly controlled T2DM. Exploratory analyses will examine improvements in self-care behaviors (i.e. diet, physical activity, self glucose monitoring, and medication adherence) and the role of self-care as mediators of metabolic control. Mentorship is an important component of career advancement in academic medicine. Several studies have established that lack of mentoring is a reason for poor career advancement and attrition, particularly among women and minority faculty. The candidate who has a track record of mentoring women and minority faculty would benefit from the protected time for mentoring afforded by the proposed K24 award, while allowing continued research to eliminate disparities in diabetes.

"A Faith-Based Partnership to Address Obesity in African American families DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): ABSTRACT Obesity continues to be highly prevalent in the African American (AA) population, affecting nearly 40% of AA men and a staggering 59% of AA women. Unfortunately this trend is also present in AA children and adolescents; recent data indicate obesity prevalence in AA children and adolescents (age 2 - 19) to be 24.3% compared to 16.1% of non-Hispanic whites. Given some evidence that obesity spreads through social ties, including families, such that there is an increased risk of obesity among children when a parent is obese, developing effective family-based approaches to improving obesity and its related behaviors is paramount. Collaborative partnerships between academic institutions and faith-based organizations, specifically churches, may be one of the most optimal mediums for intervention development. The proposed conference grant seeks to lay the groundwork for the development of strategies to address family-based obesity in the AA community by leveraging the faith community. This will be accomplished by expanding an existing research partnership between The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center (MD Anderson) and Windsor Village United Methodist Church (WVUMC) - Creating a Higher Understanding of Cancer Research & Community Health (CHURCH). Specifically, we will: 1) enhance an existing faith-based-academic partnership to address family obesity and obesity- related behaviors in the African American community; 2) strengthen the capacity of partnership stakeholders and the local community to actively participate in the partnership through capacity building opportunities; 3) assess congregational and community interest in obesity and obesity-related behaviors in African Americans; and 4) develop a community-driven research agenda focused on addressing obesity in faith-based settings). To meet these aims we will invite community partners to join an academic-community-faith-based partnership, develop an organizational structure for the partnership and strengthen partnership through capacity building. We will conduct a community needs assessment focused on church- based factors that influence implementation of obesity programs and concerns and needs of AA youth, adults and church leadership with regards to obesity and its related behaviors. We will implement health education derived from community assessments, solicit feedback, and develop a project concept for future development into a grant application. Our goal is that the successful completion of this conference grant series will result in: 1) an expanded academic, faith-based partnership with the capacity to be leaders and a driving force to eliminate disparities in AA obesity in Houston and potentially nationally (Aims  & 2); 2) a comprehensive assessment of the strengths and needs of AA families and faith- based organizations to address obesity (Aim 3); and 3) a community-driven agenda in the form of project concepts, future grants, and sustained Partnership beyond the life of the conference series grant (Aim 4). PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed project builds on a successful community-academic partnership between MD Anderson Cancer Center and Windsor Village United Methodist Church (WVUMC) in Houston, TX. The proposed project plans to use a community- based participatory (CBPR) approach to capitalize on the existing partnership and enhance it to address family obesity and obesity-related behaviors in the African American community This partnership will greatly expand the knowledge base for conducting community-based participatory research with faith-based communities.",A Faith-Based Partnership to Address Obesity in African American families,8925121,R13HD080934,"['adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' Anxiety ', ' Behavior ', ' Breast ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Colon ', ' Communities ', ' coronary disorder ', ' Coronary Disease ', ' Coronary heart disease ', ' Data Collection ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' diabetes ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Environment ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' Family ', ' Feedback ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' Health Tutoring ', ' Health Instruction ', ' Health education ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' Health Promotion ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' high blood pressure ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Hypertension ', ' NAS/IOM ', ' Institute of Medicine ', ' Institute of Medicine (U.S.) ', ' Leadership ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Methods ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Obesity ', ' hypertrophic arthritis ', ' degenerative joint disease ', ' Osteoarthrosis ', ' Osteoarthritis ', ' Degenerative Arthritis ', ' Degenerative polyarthritis ', ' Parents ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Stigmatization ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' brain attack ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Apoplexy ', ' stroke ', ' Woman ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' conference ', ' symposium ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Youth ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Series ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Adolescent ', ' Collaborations ', ' Methodists ', ' Methodist Church ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' psychosocial ', ' interest ', ' meetings ', ' Needs Assessment ', ' Church ', ' knowledgebase ', ' knowledge base ', ' novel ', ' disease prevention ', ' disorder prevention ', ' prevention service ', ' Organization Charts ', ' organizational structure ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' cardiovascular risk ', ' cardiovascular risk factor ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Institution ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Grant Proposals ', ' Applications Grants ', ' Media Intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' Cancer Center ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center ', ' MDACC ', ' University of Texas M D Anderson Cancer Center ', ' trend ', ' Community Health ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' obesity prevention ', ' cancer research ', ' anticancer research ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' driving force ', ' obesity risk ', ' family influence ', ' Evidence based intervention ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' community based participatory research ', ' treatment development ', ' intervention development ', ' develop therapy ', ' therapy development ', ' ']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF TX MD ANDERSON CAN CTR,R13,2015,29026,0.12160771785345843
"Black College Students, Health Disparities & Disease Prevention Practices DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In 2010, about 25.8 million Americans had diabetes, and 27 percent of those cases were undiagnosed. type 2 diabetes (T2D) accounts for about 90-95 percent of diabetes cases; diabetes prevention is a national health objective. T2D disproportionately affects African-Americans (AAs) and Hispanics, compared with non-Hispanic whites. In Texas, 2009 data revealed that 14.4 percent of AAs had T2D, compared with 9.7 percent of Hispanics and 8 percent of Whites. Family history, overweight, and ethnicity are T2D risk factors. Lifestyle modification, including healthy eating, physical activity, and modest weigh loss, can prevent T2D. The transition from adolescence to young adulthood can be a time of increased stress, and is associated with increased health risk. Poor diet, obesity and inactivity increase during this time period, particularly among AAs. For those AA students with family history of T2D, this may contribute to the increasing prevalence of T2D diagnosed among younger populations. In 2010, 24 percent of new T2D cases were in adults 20-39 years of age and 55 percent were in adults ages 40-59 years. There are over 100 Historically Black Colleges or Universities (HBCUs) in the U.S. While HBCUs have significantly contributed to the educational progress of millions of AA students, there is a lack of empirically- driven descriptive and intervention research in health promotion focused on the HBCU populations. Efforts to identify and mitigate health risk behaviors in these students may help in addressing health disparities among AAs. Therefore, we are submitting this R21 application in response to PAR-10-137, addressing Research Area 3: chronic disease prevention. We will assess the social networks of AA students attending a HBCU, with and without T2D risk, and examine the flow of health related behaviors, attitudes, support, and information across the social networks of students. Our goal is to identify whether there are protective mechanisms within these social networks that might help to explain the differences between those students with T2D risk who report lifestyle behaviors that increase risk for early onset T2D, versus those students with T2D risk who practice lifestyle behaviors protective of T2D. We will also investigate whether a social network communication channel at an HBCU is an effective way to promote chronic disease prevention practices and reduce future risk. This proposed study has tremendous public health significance and is the first step in a program of research to develop and test effective social network-based interventions on HBCU campuses to reduce health disparities among this group. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Historically Black Colleges or Universities (HBCU) have significantly contributed to the educational progress of millions of African-American (AA) students. There is lack of health promotion research on HBCU populations who are at a higher risk of diabetes and other chronic diseases. Thus, we will assess the social networks of AA students attending a HBCU, and examine the flow of health-related behaviors, attitudes, support, and information across their social networks which may help in addressing health disparities among AAs, and investigate whether prevention programs can be disseminated via the college to student social networks.","Black College Students, Health Disparities & Disease Prevention Practices",8932762,R21NR014149,"['Accounting ', ' teenage ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' Adolescence ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' Attitude ', ' Awareness ', ' Behavior ', ' lifestyle modification ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' behavior intervention ', ' Life Style Modification ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' chronic disorder ', ' chronic disease/disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Communication ', ' diabetes ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' type II DM ', ' type 2 DM ', ' maturity onset diabetes ', ' ketosis resistant diabetes ', ' adult onset diabetes ', ' Type II diabetes ', ' Type II Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Type 2 diabetes ', ' Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus ', ' T2DM ', ' T2D ', ' T2 DM ', ' Stable Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Slow-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Noninsulin Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Non-Insulin Dependent Diabetes ', ' NIDDM ', ' Maturity-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' MODY ', ' Ketosis-Resistant Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Adult-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Diagnosis ', ' dietary ', ' Diet ', ' Food Intake ', ' Eating ', ' Faculty ', ' Family ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Health Personnel ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' Health Promotion ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' indexing ', ' interventions research ', ' interventional study ', ' interventional research ', ' intervention research ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' Interview ', ' Lifestyle ', ' Life Style ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Obesity ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Stress ', ' Students ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Testing ', ' Texas ', ' Time ', ' Universities ', ' wt-loss ', ' body weight loss ', ' Weight Reduction ', ' Weight Loss ', ' Body Weight decreased ', ' Friends ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Hispanics ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' Social Network ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Physical activity ', ' Individual ', ' young adulthood ', ' adult youth ', ' young adult ', ' Family Medical History Epidemiology ', ' Family Medical History ', ' Family history of ', ' Lifestyle Risk Reduction ', ' Risk Reduction Behavior ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Over weight ', ' Overweight ', ' collegiate ', ' college ', ' Services ', ' American ', ' behavioral/social science ', ' college student ', ' university student ', ' disease prevention ', ' disorder prevention ', ' Prevention program ', ' religious ', ' Religion and Spirituality ', ' Prevention ', ' Reporting ', ' risk perception ', ' Emotional ', ' response ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' diabetes risk ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' Age-Years ', ' Undergraduate Degree ', ' Baccalaureate Degree ', "" Bachelor's Degree "", ' Data ', "" Master's Degree "", ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' Diabetes prevention ', ' early onset ', ' protective behavior ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' Network-based ', ' Historically Black University ', ' Historically Black Institution ', ' Historically Black Colleges ', ' HBCUs ', ' Historically Black Colleges and Universities ', ' high risk ', ' social science research ', ' ']",NINR,BAYLOR COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,R21,2015,172425,0.1240094092202265
"The role of natural selection in SLE risk among African-Americans ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a severe autoimmune disorder that disproportionately affects African Americans (AA). Despite tremendous progress in elucidating its genetic etiology, research has been mainly limited to Caucasians, and little progress has been made in the identification of the specific disease-predisposing functional variations. Since the genome structure of a population is influenced by environmental pressures, and immune responses are particularly sensitive to the environment, it is possible that, throughout evolution, population-specific positive natural selection has led to a increased frequency of alleles that also predispose to autoimmune diseases like SLE. The goal of this project is to discover functional SLE risk variants in AAs while improving our understanding of the genetic basis of SLE that is due to natural selection. In order to accomplish this, Dr. Ramos will (1) identify regions of the genome that have been the target of recent positive natural selection in AA using two complementary population genetics statistics, (2) identify regions that are both predisposing to SLE and under selection, and (3) compute thorough functional annotation of the adaptive SLE risk variants to identify adaptive functional variation associated with SLE.  Dr. Ramos is a human geneticist in the Division of Rheumatology at the Medical University of South Carolina (MUSC). Her long-term career goal is to become an independent translational researcher in the genetics of autoimmunity. To facilitate her transition into an independent investigator, she seeks to further her skills and broaden the multidisciplinary nature of her research by training in population and evolutionary genetics, and bioinformatics and computational tools for the analysis of high-dimensional large-scale datasets. The environment for the success of Dr. Ramos is provided by (1) a mentorship team with the mentorship track record and varied expertise needed to support her project, (2) the availability of samples from unique African American and African populations and the established infrastructure to continue and expand studies on these populations, (3) support from the endowed Smart State Center in Inflammation and Fibrosis, the Multidisciplinary Clinical Research Center (MCRC) for Rheumatic Diseases in African Americans, and the growing Center Genomic Medicine, and (4) the Department of Medicine's robust mentorship program.  The identification of functional adaptive alleles that contribute to SLE risk in AA will contributeto an understanding of the role of positive natural selection in shaping SLE risk and vastly improve knowledge about the etiology of SLE in AA. These results will provide critical preliminary data supporting extramural applications to conduct focused analysis of sequence data, functional studies, expand to other populations and to other autoimmune diseases. The training will enable Dr. Ramos to achieve her long-term objective of becoming an independent investigator leading multidisciplinary teams conducting innovative genomic research in autoimmune disease.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Relevance This project is highly relevant to public health because African Americans (AA) has a higher prevalence and substantial risk of autoimmune diseases such as lupus, but has been largely understudied and the reasons for this health disparity remain elusive. This study will integrate evidence for positive natural selection with biological information to identify adaptive functional variation associated with lupus in AA. Identifying the genetic variations that cause lupus and understanding the role of natural selection in shaping its risk will greatly expand our knowledge about the etiology of lupus in AA and contribute to the development of interventions to reduce risk, improved diagnosis, targeted therapies, and improved outcomes.            ",The role of natural selection in SLE risk among African-Americans,8805337,K01AR067280,"['Affect ', ' Africa ', ' Allelomorphs ', ' Alleles ', ' aminoacid ', ' Amino Acids ', ' autoimmune disorder ', ' Autoimmune Diseases ', ' self recognition (immune) ', ' Autoimmune Status ', ' Autoimmunity ', ' Reactive Site ', ' Combining Site ', ' Binding Sites ', ' cultured cell line ', ' Strains Cell Lines ', ' CellLine ', ' Cell Line ', ' Chromatin ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Diagnosis ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' liability to disease ', ' disease/disorder proneness/risk ', ' Diathesis ', ' Disease susceptibility ', ' Environment ', ' Evolution ', ' Fibrosis ', ' Future ', ' Gene Frequency ', ' allelic frequency ', ' Allele Frequency ', ' Genes ', ' Population Genetics ', ' Genome ', ' Human Genome ', ' human whole genome ', ' Goals ', ' Haplotypes ', ' Modern Man ', ' Man (Taxonomy) ', ' Human ', ' Incidence ', ' indexing ', ' Inflammation ', ' Island ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' systemic lupus erythematosis ', ' disseminated lupus erythematosus ', ' Systemic SLE - Lupus Erythematosus ', ' Systemic Lupus Erythmatosus ', ' SLE ', ' Lupus Erythematosus Disseminatus ', ' Systemic Lupus Erythematosus ', ' Medicine ', ' Mentorship ', ' Marrow monocyte ', ' Blood monocyte ', ' monocyte ', ' pressure ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Rheumatic Diseases ', ' Musculoskeletal Pain Disorder ', ' Rheumatism ', ' Rheumatology ', ' Risk ', ' mRNA ', ' Messenger RNA ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Sea ', ' Sierra Leone ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' South Carolina ', ' statistics ', ' Testing ', ' transcription factor ', ' Universities ', ' Genetic Variation ', ' Genetic Diversity ', ' Variation (Genetics) ', ' white race ', ' Occidental ', ' Caucasoid Race ', ' Caucasoid ', ' Caucasian Race ', ' Caucasian ', ' Caucasians ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' Natural Selections ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Sequence Analyses ', ' SEQ-AN ', ' Sequence Analysis ', ' Natural History ', ' base ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Biological ', ' Medical ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Predisposition ', ' Training ', ' insight ', ' African ', ' European ', ' immunoresponse ', ' host response ', ' Immune response ', ' Genetic ', ' genetic vulnerability ', ' genetic mechanism of disease ', ' genetic etiology ', ' Inherited Susceptibility ', ' Inherited Predisposition ', ' Genetic Susceptibility ', ' Genetic Predisposition ', ' Genetic Predisposition to Disease ', ' Shapes ', ' Nature ', ' DNA Methylation ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Frequency ', ' Frequencies (time pattern) ', ' Severities ', ' Complex ', ' Scanning ', ' Source ', ' disease severity ', ' Severity of illness ', ' QTL ', ' Quantitative Trait Loci ', ' success ', ' trait ', ' Structure ', ' skills ', ' disease risk ', ' disorder risk ', ' Sampling ', ' Genomics ', ' miRNAs ', ' miRNA ', ' Micro RNA ', ' MicroRNAs ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' histone modification ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' disease causation ', ' causation ', ' Causality ', ' Etiology ', ' Length ', ' Admixture ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' High Prevalence ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Research Training ', ' Extramural ', ' EXTMR ', ' Extramural Activities ', ' Genomic Segment ', ' Fixation ', ' sample fixation ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' computational tools ', ' computerized tools ', ' Lupus ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' translational study ', ' treatment development ', ' intervention development ', ' develop therapy ', ' therapy development ', ' discover genes ', ' gene discovery ', ' public health relevance ', ' genomewide ', ' genome-wide ', ' dbGaP ', ' database of Genotypes and Phenotypes ', ' risk locus ', ' risk loci ', ' risk genotype ', ' risk gene ', ' risk allele ', ' Risk-associated variant ', ' risk variant ', ' ']",NIAMS,MEDICAL UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA,K01,2015,129087,0.07568948592801727
"DNA methylation biomarkers of scleroderma-associated interstitial lung disease DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Interstitial lung disease (ILD) is a major complication and the leading cause of mortality in scleroderma (SSc, systemic sclerosis). In addition, patients of African ancestry suffer from higher morbidity and mortality rates. The etiology of SSc, including the reasons underlying the wide variation in disease progression and severity remain unknown. For these reasons, it is important to understand the mechanisms through which SSc-ILD develops that may explain the racial differences in SSc-ILD outcomes. The low concordance rate between monozygotic twins suggests an important role for epigenetic or environmental factors in SSc susceptibility. Since it is influenced by the environment, epigenetic variation, inherited both directly and through shared environmental effects, may play an important role in SSc-ILD risk. Evidence suggests that epigenetic changes play an important role in the development of autoimmunity. These epigenetic markers have the potential to serve as biomarkers for the development and progression of SSc-ILD. The hypothesis of this study is that epigenetic factors are a significant contributor to severity of SSc-ILD in African-American (AA) patients. Its goal is to identify DNA methylation loci as biomarkers of SSc-ILD and its severity, which supports the long-term goal to delineate the role of DNA methylation in SSc risk and severity. This application proposes three specific aims: 1) comprehensive identification of differentially methylated cytosines (DMCs) and regions (DMRs) associated with SSc-ILD and its severity in AAs, 2) test if the most significant DMCs and DMRs are associated with genetic variation, and 3) test if the most significant DMCs and DMRs are associated with gene expression levels. Alveolar macrophages will be isolated from bronchoalveolar lavage on 34 AA SSc-ILD patients and 26 AA controls. Reduced representation bisulfite sequencing will be performed and DMCs and DMRs associated with SSc-ILD and disease severity will be identified. The 5 most significant DMCs/DMRs will be selected for genetic and expression studies. These results have the potential to identify DNA methylation loci as biomarkers of SSc-ILD and disease severity, thus contributing to an increased understanding of the molecular mechanisms of SSc-ILD and ultimately may lead to the development of effective diagnostics, prognostics and therapies. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Interstitial lung disease (ILD) is a major complication and the leading cause of mortality in scleroderma (or systemic sclerosis (SSc)). Given the higher morbidity and mortality rates in African American (AA) SSc patients, it is imperative to understand the reasons for this health disparity.

"Culture, Social Support & Quality of Life: Asian American Breast Cancer Survivors DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Little is known about the impact of health related quality of life on the well being of Asian American (AA) breast cancer survivors. This five-year mixed-methods study entitled: ""Culture, Support and Quality of Life: Asian American Breast Cancer Survivors"", proposes to identify and define how culture may modify the definitions of self-integrity and quality of life (QOL) for Asian American (AA) breast cancer (BC) survivors. Each culture defines self-esteem and the proper behavior required to achieve a positive sense of self for its members, and these definitions vary. Differing cultural definitions might explain why few ethnic minorities, like AAs, use mainstream survivorship services. AABC survivors have been reported to suffer significant emotional and social problems, but European American (EA) based mainstream designed services do not seem to adequately meet their needs. Two major barriers may hinder more effective interventions. First, dissonance between the beliefs and values upon which these mainstream services are based and AA constructions of self esteem and rules for relationships may reduce the acceptability of mainstream services. For example, most mainstream services emphasize the integrity of individuality and personhood, and accordingly, address the women alone. Yet, AA culture identifies the family as the unit of analysis, not the individual. This study proposes to utilize a more holistic operationalization of culture as a concept that could establish a new avenue of research to move the science of health disparities research forward. Identification of the salient unmet cultural needs of AA women would potentially expand Western based theories of positive survivorship and provide directions to develop more culturally relevant support services to improve their QOL. Second, no consensus exists on what actually comprises the construct of culture. This study proposes to develop a more holistic conceptual framework. Therefore, our four study aims are to: 1) Characterize how women in each of the four ethnic groups define self-integrity and well-being, 2) Identify if and how ethnic specific support services address the culturally formed expectations of integrity and well-being of AA BC survivors, and how this may differ by ethnic group, 3) Explore how the breast cancer experience impacts family members, and 4) Identify the impact of the cancer experience on the women's quality of life, and if it differs by ethnicity. In-depth ethnographic interviews will be conducted with 180 BC survivors and 96 family members for all 4 Aims. We will also survey 800 BC survivors (200 from each ethnic group), and triangulate the quantitative and qualitative findings to increase the validity of our results. We will use CBPR to collaborate with our community partners, Northern and Southern CA and Houston, TX to conduct the study. The 3 sites will enable us to also assess geographic and within group cultural variations. the quantitative and qualitative findings to increase the validity of our results. We will use CBPR to collaborate with our community partners Northern and Southern CA and Houston, TX to conduct the study. The 3 sites will enable us to also assess geographic and within group variations on cultural beliefs and patterns. The outcomes of this study are likely to inform both the science and practice of survivorship in the Asian American community in particular, and among diverse ethnic populations as well, by illuminating the culturally constructed modes and outcomes for managing the cancer experience. The findings are anticipated to provide direction to better meet the needs of cancer survivors and contribute the to the elimination of health disparities. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Little attention has been paid to the growing cancer control needs of Asian Americans (AAs), the ethnic group with the fastest growing rate of all ethnic groups in the U.S., and will double in size to 25 million by 2050. AA also are experiencing the fast increase in new cancer cases of all ethnic groups. The cancer incidence rate for AAs isis predicted to increase by 132 percent among this diverse population compared with 31 percent for non-Hispanic whites. Currenlty, unlike all other ethnicities, cancer is the number one cause of death for AA men and women. Notably, several AA subgroups currently show rates of cancer, including breast cancer (BC), that are higher than or equal to non-Hispanic white women. For some groups, a greater proportion of women with breast cancer are living through and beyond cancer. Studies show, however, that AABC survivors experience emotional and physical needs that are largely unmet, and despite the growing need and the unnecessary suffering borne by this community, too few studies have been conducted on the needs of AA cancer survivors. Of the 362,238 studies found in a Pub-Med search on cancer survivorship or social support, we found only 65 studies published between 1966 and 2010 that investigate the needs of AAs. Moreover, few support services exist to address the needs of AA cancer survivors in the entire nation. Evaluation of the impact of cancer on the social support needs of AA cancer survivors and their families, and in particular, the health related quality of life (HRQOL) of AA cancer survivorship, remains essentially unexamined. Thus, this is the first study to explore cultural explanations for the cross-cultural differences found in quality of life studies among Asian and Asian American populations compared with Western countries. Our study proposes to investigate both between and within group differences among three Asian-American (AA) subgroups (Chinese-American, Japanese-American, and Vietnamese-American) and a comparison group of European-American (EA) breast cancer (BC) survivors. The majority of studies in cancer survivorship have assumed a universality of the assumptions of positive coping strategies and goals. The differences in the performance of standardized scales noted among Asian Americans have not been explained. Relevance: The paucity of support groups and resources that are culturally salient for the growing number of AAs suffering with cancer makes a compelling public health argument for this innovative, mixed-paradigm and mixed-method study. Moreover, this study will forge a new path to evaluate the validity of the assumptions regarding the universality of Western European-American based values of individualism and autonomy that underlie the types of mainstream support services, and identify how, beyond Asian-language concordance, ethnic specific AA support groups assist their members along the survivorship journey through more familial based values and strategies. Investigation of these two areas would potentially expand the theoretical framework currently applied in HRQOL work with culturally-based modifications that are used in AABC support services so that other AA as well as mainstream health service professionals could better meet the needs of this rapidly growing population of AA cancer survivors and their families. This new path would also more accurately and effectively operationalize culture as a concept and construct to identify more relevant aspects of cultural differences that could move the science of health disparities research forward. We also utilize the strength of the community based participatory research approach to promote the validity of the findings to include the reality of the community.","Culture, Social Support & Quality of Life: Asian American Breast Cancer Survivors",8830931,R01CA158314,"['Asian Americans ', ' Attention ', ' Dorsum ', ' Back ', ' Behavior ', ' Belief ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cause of Death ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Chinese American ', ' Communities ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Family ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' health care service ', ' Health Services ', ' Incidence ', ' Individuality ', ' Interview ', ' Japanese American ', ' Language ', ' achievement Mainstream Education ', ' Mainstreaming ', ' Educational Mainstreaming ', ' Mainstreaming (Education) ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Methods ', ' Perception ', ' well-being ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Publishing ', ' QOL ', ' Quality of life ', ' Research ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Science ', ' self esteem ', ' self help organization ', ' Self-Help Groups ', ' Support Groups ', ' Social Interaction ', ' social disturbance ', ' Social Problems ', ' social support network ', ' Social support ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' survivorship ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' oriental ', ' Asians ', ' Friends ', ' Measures ', ' Family member ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' diverse populations ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' ethnographic ', ' Ethnography ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Survivors ', ' Individual ', ' European ', ' Personhood ', ' satisfaction ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Immigrant ', ' tool ', ' sadness ', ' depressed ', ' Depressed mood ', ' Consensus ', ' Life ', ' Investigation ', ' Home ', ' Home environment ', ' Pattern ', ' Country ', ' Outcome Study ', ' meetings ', ' Services ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' expectation ', ' member ', ' Adult Sons ', ' Adult Offspring ', ' Adult Daughters ', ' Adult Children ', ' cultural values ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' Emotional ', ' Modeling ', ' stigma ', ' social stigma ', ' theories ', ' cancer diagnosis ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Subgroup ', ' Cancer Control Science ', ' Cancer Control ', ' Cancer Survivor ', ' Cancer Survivorship ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' SF-36 ', ' Modification ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' comparison group ', ' forging ', ' health related quality of life ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' coping ', ' Population ', ' Impact evaluation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' ethnic minority ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' community based participatory research ', ' emotional experience ', ' effective intervention ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R01,2015,185689,0.02019502360684519
"Prostate Cancer Gene Identification within Candidate Region in African Americans ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  There are well documented racial disparities in prostate cancer (PCa) incidence and mortality in the United States between African American (AA) and European American (EA) men. These disparities cannot be fully explained by differences in screening or treatment differences by race, and other environmental and biological risk factors have not been well characterized. We hypothesize that racial differences in the distribution of genetic risk factors may contribute to the observed disparities. We recently identified a region on chromosome 7q31-32 that is statistically significantly associated with prostate cancer in AA men, and there is suggestive evidence for association with PCa aggressiveness as well. The identified region is gene-rich, and thus far we have identified two candidate genes (CPED1 and FLNC) in this region. These are genes that have not been well characterized in the literature, however hints of their role in prostate cancer can be found within previous expression studies. Here, we propose to examine the region on chromosome 7q31-32 in greater depth, using existing samples and data from multiple databases. In Aim 1, we first will examine SNP associations in this region in a much larger independent sample set to confirm our original findings (Aim 1.A). We will then examine available online databases, including dbGAP, GEO, and Oncomine for further evidence of association of genes in this region with PCa risk and aggressiveness (Aim 1.B). Based on the findings of Aims 1.A and B, we will select genes and regions to target with a dense tagSNP panel to better refine our genes of interest in 230 AA PCa cases and 230 AA controls. Aim 2 will explore the functional significance of the top five candidate genes identified in our prior work and in Aim 1, including CPED1 and FLNC, using banked tissue samples (Aim 2.A) and cell lines (Aim 2.B). For Aim 2.A, Expression of mRNA will be assessed in 112 fresh frozen PCa samples selected to represent EA men, AA men, high Gleason grade (GG, >4+3) and low GG (<3+4) equally. Protein expression will be assessed using IHC in paraffin embedded PCa samples, using the same race/grade sampling method. For Aim 2.B, multiple cell lines representing a range of PCa aggressiveness and both EA and AA origin will be used to evaluate protein expression and biological function of these proteins. Protein expression will be determined using immunoblot analysis. If clinical data suggest the candidate gene is overexpressed in PCa, we will knock it down, and if expression is lost in PCa we will overexpress it. We will perform cell growth, transformation, migration and invasion assays to determine if altering gene expression will regulate cellular function. We will also perform cell counting assays to measure cell growth over an eight day period. Soft agar and clonogenic assays will be used to assay transformation. Boyden chamber assays will be used to assess changes in migration and invasion.

"Molecular determinant of racial disparity in prostate cancer DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Significant disparity in the incidence and clinical outcome of prostate cancer (PCa) exist between African- American (AA) men and their European American (EA) counterparts. Despite this recognition, we have not made a major leap in our understanding of the molecular causes associated with such disparity. This proposal is built upon our strong preliminary data on a proto-oncogene, Myb, which has remained largely unexplored in PCa. Our novel findings demonstrate that 1) Myb expression is significantly elevated in AA PCa with greater overall incidence as compared to EA PCa, 2) low intensity expression of Myb is also detected in some of the benign prostate tissues (BPH) from AA patients, while no expression is detected in EA BPH, 3) AA PCa cell lines (MDaPCa-2b and RC-77/T) exhibit high Myb expression and significant resistance to hormone-depletion and docetaxel (DTX) toxicity, 4) AA PCa cells also display high growth, migratory and invasive potential, which is associated with Myb overexpression, and 5) Myb interacts with AR and modulates the expression of androgen-responsive gene, KLK3/PSA, suggesting their cooperative role in gene regulation. Based on these promising findings, we hypothesize that relative greater incidence and overall expression of Myb in AA PCa cells underlies their inherently greater propensity to metastasize and evade therapeutic intervention. To test this hypothesis, we are proposing three specific aims. In aim 1, we will investigate the role of Myb in PCa aggressiveness and therapy-resistance. Using luciferase-tagged, Myb-overexpressing or -silenced, paired AA and EA PCa cell lines, we will examine the functional association of Myb with PCa growth and metastasis, and their response to castration- and docetaxel- therapies in an orthotopic mouse model. In Aim 2, we will examine the functional consequences of Myb-AR interaction and identify their downstream consequences. We will specifically examine whether Myb has a role in AR localization and transcriptional activation. Furthermore, we will assess the effect of Myb on transcriptional reprogramming of AR by using state of the art RNA-Seq and ChIP-Seq approaches. We will determine the shared and independent targets of Myb and AR in PCa cells and examine if Myb alters AR target gene specificity. In Aim 3, we will determine the clinical relevance of Myb in racial disparity associated with PCa. We will perform immunohistochemical (IHC) analysis to assess Myb and AR expression and localization (cytoplasmic vs. nuclear) in PCa, adjacent BPH, and uninvolved normal tissues from both AA and EA cases. We will then examine their correlation (alone and in combination) with race, tumor grade, metastasis incidence, PSA levels, and patient's survival. Together, these studies will provide experimental, mechanistic and clinical evidence for the role of Myb in aggressive behavior and therapeutic- resistance of PCa, and support the association of Myb with observed racial disparity. In the long-term, the resulting information will be useful in reducing the racial disparities in clinical outcomes of PCa by establishing the clinical utility of Myb as a risk predictor and/or therapeutic target for effective disease management. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Main barrier in achieving progress toward racial disparities reduction in prostate cancer is our limited understanding of the underlying molecular basis. The proposed research will examine the functional and clinical significance of Myb overexpression in prostate cancer aggressiveness and therapeutic resistance, the two major reasons for the poor clinical outcome of African American (AA) patients. The outcomes of our study will allow distinction between clinically indolent and aggressive prostate tumors, and pave the way for novel target-based therapies, which will ultimately reduce the enhanced burden of prostate cancer on African American population and improve overall survival of prostate cancer patients.",Molecular determinant of racial disparity in prostate cancer,8847693,U01CA185490,"['Affect ', ' Aggression ', ' Aggressive behavior ', ' Therapeutic Androgen ', ' Androgenic Compounds ', ' Androgenic Agents ', ' Androgens ', ' Surgical Castration ', ' Castration ', ' Cells ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Exhibits ', ' Gene Expression Regulation ', ' Gene Regulation Process ', ' Gene Regulation ', ' Gene Action Regulation ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Growth ', ' Health ', ' Therapeutic Hormone ', ' Endocrine Gland Secretion ', ' Chemotherapy-Hormones/Steroids ', ' Hormones ', ' Incidence ', ' Ligands ', ' Luciferase Immunologic ', ' Luciferases ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Mortality ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' tumor cell metastasis ', ' cancer metastasis ', ' Tumor Cell Migration ', ' Secondary Tumor ', ' Secondary Neoplasm ', ' Metastatic Tumor ', ' Metastatic Neoplasm ', ' Metastasize ', ' Metastasis ', ' Neoplasm Metastasis ', ' Patients ', ' Play ', ' Prostatic Gland ', ' Prostate Gland ', ' Prostate ', ' Prostatic Neoplasia ', ' Prostate Tumor ', ' Prostate Neoplasms ', ' Prostatic Neoplasms ', ' protooncogene ', ' c-ONC ', ' Cellular Oncogene ', ' Proto-Oncogenes ', ' Publishing ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Androgen Receptor ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Socioeconomic Factors ', ' Specificity ', ' thymus derived lymphocyte ', ' Thymus-Dependent Lymphocytes ', ' T-Cells ', ' T-Lymphocyte ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Tissues ', ' Relative ', ' Relative (related person) ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' hK3 Kallikrein ', ' gamma-Seminoprotein ', ' Seminin ', ' Semenogelase ', ' Prostate Specific Antigen Preproprotein ', ' Plasma Prekallikrein ', ' Plasma Kallikrein Precursor ', ' P-30 Antigen ', ' Kallikrein 3 ', ' EC 3.4.21.34 ', ' Prostate-Specific Antigen ', ' Transcription Activation ', ' Transcriptional Activation ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Benign ', ' Clinical ', ' Malignant ', ' Malignant - descriptor ', ' insight ', ' Indolent ', ' European ', ' Gene Targeting ', ' docetaxol ', ' Taxotere ', ' N-Debenzoyl-N-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)-10-deacetyltaxol ', ' docetaxel ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Normal Tissue ', ' Normal tissue morphology ', ' Prostatic Cancer ', ' Prostate Cancer ', ' Prostate CA ', ' Malignant prostatic tumor ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Prostate ', ' Malignant neoplasm of prostate ', ' Disorder Management ', ' Disease Management ', ' programs ', ' Frequency ', ' Frequencies (time pattern) ', ' Nuclear ', ' American ', ' receptor expression ', ' Toxicities ', ' Toxic effect ', ' novel ', ' nosology ', ' disorder classification ', ' disease classification ', ' Modality ', ' Pathogenesis ', ' Reporting ', ' intervention therapy ', ' Therapeutic Intervention ', ' response ', ' Sequence-Specific Posttranscriptional Gene Silencing ', ' RNAi ', ' RNA Silencing ', ' Quelling ', ' Posttranscriptional Gene Silencing ', ' Post-Transcriptional Gene Silencing ', ' RNA Interference ', ' Tissue Sample ', ' KLKB1 ', ' KLK3 ', ' KLK3 gene ', ' Data ', ' Receptor Signaling ', ' Cancer Patient ', ' Characteristics ', ' Molecular ', ' Process ', ' resistant to therapy ', ' resistance to therapy ', ' therapy resistant ', ' vector ', ' LNCaP ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' cancer disparity ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' resistant ', ' Resistance ', ' clinical relevance ', ' clinically relevant ', ' clinical significance ', ' clinically significant ', ' mouse model ', ' therapeutic target ', ' tumor ', ' overexpress ', ' overexpression ', ' ChIP Sequencing ', ' ChIP-seq ', ' RNAseq ', ' RNA-seq ', ' transcriptome sequencing ', ' prostate cancer cell ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH ALABAMA,U01,2015,313931,-0.042979467301040394
"Georgia CaRes DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Georgia Regents University (GRU) has been home to Georgia's only NCI MB-CCOP since 2004. With its affiliate site, University Cancer & Blood Center (UCBC), GRU has enrolled nearly 800 patients to NCI clinical trials: 39% of them African American (AA) and other minorities, with accrual split between treatment trials (48%) and prevention and control trials (52%). Building on this successful track record, GRU Cancer Center (GRUCC) and UCBC are joining forces with Morehouse School of Medicine (MSM) and the Jiann-Ping Hsu College of Public Health (JPHCOPH) at Georgia Southern University to become the NCORP Minority/Underserved Community Site for Georgia. The need to sustain and grow an NCORP that focuses on minority and underserved populations in Georgia is great. Georgia has some of the nation's worst cancer disparities, particularity between African Americans (AA) and Caucasians (CA) and between rural and urban populations. The disparities are glaring for some of the most common cancers. Not only do AA men in Georgia have the highest rate of prostate cancer among AA men in the country, they are almost twice as likely to be diagnosed with the disease as CA men in Georgia and three times as likely to die from it. In Georgia, AA women die of breast cancer 25% more often than CA women, and AA die of colorectal cancer 45% more than CA. The Specific Aims of the proposed NCORP M/U site for Georgia are to: 1) Implement a NCORP M/U Site for Georgia that meets or exceeds all NCI requirements; 2) Contribute to the design, conduct and translation of the national NCORP research agenda, particularity studies that pertain to minority and underserved populations; and 3) expand patient and provider access to-and enrollment/participation in-cancer prevention, control, imaging, treatment and screening/post-surveillance clinical trials and cancer care delivery research throughout Georgia, particularly for minority and underserved populations in urban and rural settings. Key sub-aims include the implementation of a leadership development program to cultivate the next generation of NCORP investigators and leaders and engagement to key stakeholders and community partners in all aspects of the NCORP research agenda. Georgia represents a unique opportunity to pursue research directed towards cancer disparities and to affect  minority and underserved communities' accrual to clinical trials and cancer care delivery research studies.  30% of its 9.9M residents are AA (vs. 12% in the U.S.) and 75% of its counties are rural, most of them  medically underserved.

"Role of chemokine receptor in disparities associated with prostate cancer progres DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): African-American (AA) men have higher incidence of prostate cancer (PCa) than European American (EA). Furthermore, PCa in AA men is characterized by poor prognosis and dismal therapeutic outcomes. However, the mechanism/s associated with this health disparity remain unclear. Thus, identification of molecular mechanisms underlying such disparity is greatly desired in order to develop effective therapeutic and management approaches. It is becoming well appreciated that the chemokine-ligand axis is crucially involved in tumor cell trafficking and the development of organ-specific metastases, which is the major cause of PCa associated deaths. Our laboratory is the first to show that CC chemokine receptor 9 (CCR9) is selectively overexpressed in prostate cancers with negligible expression in normal prostate epithelia. Our exciting preliminary data show significantly higher expression of CCR9 in AA PCa cell lines and clinical samples compared to cell lines and clinical samples derived from EA. Furthermore, serum CCL25, which is natural ligand for CCR9 was higher in AA and PCa cell lines from AA (MDA-PCa-2b) and showed higher invasive and migratory potential as well as less response to chemotherapeutics in vitro compared to EA cell lines (C4-2b). Based upon these encouraging data, we hypothesize that CCR9-CCL25 axis underlies the poor prognosis and therapeutic outcome in AA men with PCa. To test our hypothesis, we propose to investigate the CCR9- CCL25 mediated mechanism associated with (i) aggressive cell phenotype in AA samples, (ii) homing and tumor growth in bone and the potential role of this chemokine-receptor axis in improving chemotherapeutic efficacy of clinical regimens in AA patients. We further aim to establish CCR9 as a biomarker for PCa progression and aggressive disease. To accomplish our aims, we have generated CCR9 anti-body against CCR9 and CCL25, which will be used to block this axis during in vitro assays to determine its role in migration, invasion, survival and chemoresistance; determining its potential role in metastasis as well as determining therapeutic efficacy of Docetaxel in vivo using AA and EA cell lines. In addition, siRNA duplexes or specific pharmacological inhibitors against CCR9 driven signaling molecules will be used to dissect the CCR9 mediated mechanism involved in migration, invasion, survival and chemoresistance. We are optimistic that the successful completion of these studies will define the role of this newly identified chemokine in PCa health disparity. Furthermore, it will enable the design and development of rational therapies directed against the CCR9-CCL25 to reduce/eliminate disparity in therapeutic outcomes. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Our goal is to determine the potential involvement of CC chemokine receptor-9 in disparity associated with poor disease and therapeutic outcome in African American patients. The outcomes of our study will (i) allow to determine the CCR9-mediated molecular pathways involved in PCa graveness and chemo resistant phenotypes, (ii) determine the CCR9-mediated mechanisms metastasis and (iii) establish the clinico- pathological significance of CCR9 in PCa health disparity.

"Complement Activation and Perinatal Outcomes in African American Women ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Preterm Birth (PTB) affects approximately 1 out of every 9 infants born in the United States and is the leading cause of infant mortality. Despite advances in risk factor identification and obstetrical care, racial disparities persist in the occurrence of PTB, with particularly high rates among African American (AA) women. An exaggerated inflammatory response is one of four discrete mechanisms for the pathogenesis of PTB. There is a significant racial disparity in inflammation-associated PTB, with African-Americans disproportionately affected. Exaggerated inflammation can be triggered by infectious processes and behavioral risk factors that promote pathogenic vaginal microbial colonization or inflammation. Identification of novel biobehavioral risk factors may provide additional insight int mechanisms and potential targets for intervention to eliminate this stubbornly persistent racial disparity in PTB. A key mediator of the inflammatory response, and also associated with PTB, is the complement pathway (""complement""). Complement is an innate defense mechanism composed of more than 30 blood proteins that are critically involved in the elimination of pathogenic microbes. Complement also is activated to assist in embryo implantation and the vascular remodeling and removal of cellular debris resulting from implantation that is essential to a healthy pregnancy. Dysregulation of the complement fragment C3a during early pregnancy has recently been identified as a biological risk factor for PTB and preterm premature rupture of membranes (PPROM). Exploring factors associated with C3a activation during early pregnancy among AA women may prove beneficial in the identification of biobehavioral mechanisms contributing to the later development of PTB. The purpose of this revised F31 proposal is to investigate the relationship between the vaginal microbiome, complement activation, PTB associated clinical measures, and modifiable biobehavioral risk factors linked to PTB and AA race. The proposed study is nested within a larger parent study (1R01NR014800) that is prospectively exploring the biobehavioral determinants of the microbiome and the risk of PTB in AA women. This F31 proposed study will enroll 100 of the AA women in the parent study from whom biological samples and questionnaire data will be collected at prenatal care visits occurring at time point 1 (8-14 wks) and clinical measures and outcomes collected from the medical record at time point 2 (delivery). In this prospective study we will:(1) Determine the relationship between vaginal microflora (vaginal microbiome and presence/absence of genital tract infection) and C3a levels in AA women during early pregnancy; and (2) Investigate the relationship between C3a levels in AA women during early pregnancy and PTB associated clinical measures (20 wk cervical length, gestational age at delivery). We will also explore the influence of biobehavioral risk factors (e.g., vaginal hygiene practices, sexual practices, substance use) on identified study variables.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Preterm Birth (PTB) affects approximately 1 out of every 9 infants born in the United States and despite advances in risk factor identification and obstetrica care, racial disparities persist in the occurrence of PTB, with particularly high rates among African American (AA) women.

"Racial Disparity of microRNA in Hepatitis C Virus Mediated Hepatocellularcarcinoma ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Hepatitis C virus (HCV) mediated end stage liver disease, including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), is a growing problem among African Americans (AAs). The central goal of this project is to investigate the racial disparity of HCV mediated liver cancer. HCV infection mediated death rate among AA patients is about 2- fold higher than CA. Very little information is available about the underlying mechanisms of liver disease progression among chronically HCV infected ethnic groups. Our research proposal will examine this previously unexplored area of HCV mediated end stage liver disease among AA. microRNAs (miRNAs) play critical roles in multi-step cell growth regulatory processes, and the relationship between chronic HCV infection and miRNA expression is of considerable interest in understanding virus mediated disease progression. Our preliminary data indicated a group of microRNAs modulated in chronically HCV infected AA sera as compared to that of CA. We hypothesize that these circulatory miRNAs can be potential predictive biomarker towards HCC development in HCV infected AA patients, and are involved deregulating hepatocyte growth. Thus, identification of predictive biomarkers for HCC and the underlying molecular mechanisms for race disparity will have a great translational benefit.

"Biobehavioral Determinants of the Microbiome and Preterm Birth in Black Women DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goals of this study are to elucidate the bio behavioral determinants that govern the structure and dynamics of the microbiome of African American (AA) women during pregnancy and to investigate whether microbiome composition is associated with PTB. The proposed study will contribute to a bio psychosocial understanding of within-race risk for PTB, providing insight into important risk and protective factors relevant to AA women who disproportionately experience PTB compared to any other US population. Our research is consistent with frameworks for eliminating racial disparities, which recognize the importance of studying potential risk factors within-race as a vital first step, and is congruent with the National Institute of Nursing Research goal of promoting and improving the health of individuals, families, and communities across the lifespan in a variety of clinical settings and within diverse populations. The study will prospectively enroll a socioeconomically diverse cohort of H 960 pregnant AA women and follow them through delivery, collecting data at three time points: twice via direct participant contact during prenatal care appointments (at 10-14 and 26-30 weeks' gestation), and once via review of the medical records from the delivery hospitalization. Using a nested case-control approach, we will designate as cases all women who experience PTB (an estimated 125 cases); an equal number of controls will be selected from among those who deliver a term infant. Using this study design we will: (1) Characterize the vaginal, oral, and gut microbiome during early and later pregnancy; (2) Examine whether bio behavioral factors linked with PTB - including biological indicators and experiences of stress, nutritional status, and health behaviors - influence the composition of the microbiome; (3) Determine whether the composition of the vaginal, oral, and gut microbiome in early and/or later pregnancy is associated with PTB; and (4) Investigate whether symptom patterns are associated with microbiomic milieu that increase the risk of PTB among AA women. The success of this research is supported by several factors. First, we have assembled a multidisciplinary collaboration of clinicians and basic and translational scientists representing expertise in infectious disease, obstetrics-gynecology, nutrition, genetics and epigenetics, stress physiology, epidemiology and informatics under the leadership of a nurse-scientist. Second, we have the support of the Atlanta Clinical and Translational Science Institute (CTSA award # NIH UL1TR000454); Emory's Interdisciplinary Training for Nurse Scientists Award (T32 NR012715), Emory's Reproductive and Perinatal Epidemiology Fellowship Award, and the Emory Integrated Genomics Core Laboratory. Third, Atlanta is home to AA women of broad SES, many of whom are served by Emory's affiliated delivery hospitals, enabling us to sample a diverse group of AA women, allowing for sufficient variation in the bio behavioral determinants under study to distinguish their independent and interactive effects on the microbiome and, ultimately, on the risk of PTB. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Preterm birth (PTB) occurs at unacceptably high rates within the United States, with African American women disproportionately affected. The composition of the microbiome during pregnancy may be a key mechanism for PTB. Our study will characterize the structure and dynamics of the vaginal, oral, and gut microbiome within the population most affected by PTB - African American women - in order to evaluate whether particular microbiome patterns are linked with PTB and to identify bio behavioral factors that impact microbiome structure and dynamics during pregnancy.",Biobehavioral Determinants of the Microbiome

"The role of exRNA in  Health Disparity of Prostate Cancer ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The mortality rate of PCa in African American (AA) is 2-3 times higher than Caucasian American (CA) men. A number of studies demonstrated that high incidence and mortality rates of PCa among AA men might originate from genetic, lifestyle or socioeconomic-related factors. Molecular mechanisms underlying these discrepancies are still under investigation. The process of tumor growth and metastasis mainly depends on the ability of cancer cells to communicate with each other and with neighboring cells. Microvesicles (MVs) are small cell-derived extracellular bodies secreted by normal and tumor cells and they promote cell-cell communication. The cargo of these vesicles carries microRNAs mRNAs and proteins to recipient cells. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding regulatory RNAs that negatively regulate gene expression at the post-transcriptional level. However, their real physiological function of extracellular RNA (exRNA) including miRNAs, in PCa racial disparities is still obscure. Our previous study demonstrates that MV-derived onco-miRNAs contribute to PCa progression through transformation of patient-derived adipose stem cells. Importantly, we identified selective expression of a subset of putative onco-miRNAs in prostate tumors. Thus, altered onco-miRNAs expression could be a determinant factor for high PCa progression and mortality rates among AA men. Thus, we hypothesize that ""onco-miRNAs derived by prostate tumor microvesicles are critical to PC progression in AA men of PCa"". This hypothesis will be tested by the following specific aims; 1) To investigate the expression levels of putative (miR-3613-3p and miR-3680-3p) and known (miR-125b, miR-130b and miR-155) onco-miRNAs in normal and PCa cells derived from AA and CA men as well as in human PCa specimens and 2) To examine the functional significance of these onco- miRNAs in mediating disease progression. This study is innovative, because it capitalizes on discovery of new functional roles for this putative onco-miRNAs and their relevant cellular target genes in PCa health disparity. Our expectation from this proposal is to understand the pleiotropic functions of these putative onco-miRNAs and clarify their implications in health disparity. Our preliminary results show that not only the expression of putative miRNAs (miR-3613-3p and miR-3680-3p) was higher in PCa cell lines versus normal cells but also in AA vs. CA patients. However, the expression of miRNA target genes (i.e. tumor suppressor genes; PDCD4 & LATS2) was low on in vitro and on human tissue level suggesting these miRNAs have an oncogenic activity. Our long-term goal is to explore the functional significance and potential clinical utilities of these putative miRNAs, as biomarkers or therapeutic targets, to improve the outcomes and quality of lives of patients suffering from this disease. The outcomes from this study will certainly benefit the PI by giving him the opportunity to acquire research support, exercise him to become independent investigator and inspire him to apply for independent research-supports (i.e. R01). In addition, scientific findings that will be obtained from this proposal may lead to discovery of new prognostic markers or therapeutic targets in PCa and definitely will address the reasons why African American men have more aggressive disease than other minorities.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The mortality rate of prostate cancer (PCa) in African American (AA) is 2-3 times higher than Caucasian American (CA) men. Molecular mechanisms underlying these discrepancies are still unknown. Microvesicles ""tiny bodies"" secreted in our body were proved to carry extracellular/exosomal RNA (exRNA) to their target cells. miRNAs, one of exRNAs, expression could be a determinant factor for high PCa progression among AA men. We aim to investigate the expression and functional significance of putative miRNAs in normal and PCa derived from AA and CA men, and further establishing their clinical utilities.            ",The role of exRNA in  Health Disparity of Prostate Cancer,8877161,R21CA194750,"['yellow adipose tissue ', ' white adipose tissue ', ' adipose ', ' Fatty Tissue ', ' Adipose tissue ', ' Therapeutic Androgen ', ' Androgenic Compounds ', ' Androgenic Agents ', ' Androgens ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Surgical Castration ', ' Castration ', ' Cell-to-Cell Interaction ', ' Cell Interaction ', ' Cell Communication ', ' Subcellular Process ', ' Cellular Process ', ' Cellular Physiology ', ' Cellular Function ', ' Cell Process ', ' Cell Function ', ' Cell physiology ', ' Cells ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Enzymes ', ' Physical Exercise ', ' Exercise ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Genes ', ' Goals ', ' Modern Man ', ' Man (Taxonomy) ', ' Human ', ' In Vitro ', ' Incidence ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Lifestyle ', ' Life Style ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Mortality ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' tumor cell metastasis ', ' cancer metastasis ', ' Tumor Cell Migration ', ' Secondary Tumor ', ' Secondary Neoplasm ', ' Metastatic Tumor ', ' Metastatic Neoplasm ', ' Metastasize ', ' Metastasis ', ' Neoplasm Metastasis ', ' Patients ', ' Prostatic Neoplasia ', ' Prostate Tumor ', ' Prostate Neoplasms ', ' Prostatic Neoplasms ', ' gene product ', ' Proteins ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Recurrent ', ' Recurrence ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Support ', ' Ribonucleic Acid ', ' RNA Gene Products ', ' Non-Polyadenylated RNA ', ' RNA ', ' mRNA ', ' Messenger RNA ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Progenitor Cells ', ' Stem cells ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' oncosuppressor gene ', ' Tumor Suppressing Genes ', ' Recessive Oncogenes ', ' Oncogenes-Tumor Suppressors ', ' Onco-Suppressor Genes ', ' Emerogenes ', ' Cancer Suppressor Genes ', ' Antioncogenes ', ' Anti-Oncogenes ', ' Tumor Suppressor Genes ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' Mediating ', ' neoplastic progression ', ' neoplasm progression ', ' cancer progression ', ' tumor progression ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' white American ', ' caucasian American ', ' Gene Targeting ', ' Disease Progression ', ' Genetic ', ' Vesicle ', ' Malignant Cell ', ' cancer cell ', ' Research Specimen ', ' Specimen ', ' Prostatic Cancer ', ' Prostate Cancer ', ' Prostate CA ', ' Malignant prostatic tumor ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Prostate ', ' Malignant neoplasm of prostate ', ' programs ', ' Investigation ', ' human tissue ', ' extracellular ', ' Outcome Study ', ' Tumor Cell ', ' neoplastic cell ', ' Receptor Protein ', ' receptor ', ' tumor growth ', ' cellular targeting ', ' expectation ', ' deprivation ', ' Nontranslated RNA ', ' Noncoding RNA ', ' Untranslated RNA ', ' Prostate Carcinoma Metastatic ', ' Metastatic Prostate Cancer ', ' miRNAs ', ' miRNA ', ' Micro RNA ', ' MicroRNAs ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Normal Cell ', ' LATS2 ', ' LATS2 gene ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' prognostic indicator ', ' prognostic biomarker ', ' Prognosis Marker ', ' Molecular Marker of Prognosis ', ' Prognostic Marker ', ' Other Genetics ', ' Principal Investigator ', ' Molecular ', ' Process ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomic ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio economic ', ' socioeconomics ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' cancer disparity ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' resistant ', ' Resistance ', ' Oncogenic ', ' therapeutic target ', ' selectively expressed ', ' selective expression ', ' public health relevance ', ' clinical care ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' prostate cancer cell ', ' ']",NCI,TULANE UNIVERSITY OF LOUISIANA,R21,2015,187231,0.01794717012403699
"MIC-1 and its functional partners in prostate cancer racial disparity ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Prostate cancer (PCa) is the most common non-cutaneous malignancy in the United States males and is the second leading cause of cancer deaths in men. In this regard, epidemiologic data have also provided evidence of racial disparity, including younger age, higher incidence and aggressiveness of PCa at diagnosis and inferior survival rates of African Americans (AA) relative to Caucasian patients in the Unites States. The explanation for these differences is still unknown. On the other hand, our recent results combined with prior studies have revealed that MIC-1 and its functional partners EGFR and CXCR4 were more frequent in AA compared to Caucasian PCa patients. Importantly, recent reports have revealed that EGFR and CXCR4 mediate Docetaxel resistance in PCa cells. Therefore, the central hypothesis of this proposal is that the up- regulation of MIC-1 signaling cascade may cooperate with EGFR and CXCR4 oncogenic pathways for the acquisition of a more aggressive behavior, survival and therapeutic resistance of PCa cells and contribute to the racial disparity between AA versus Caucasian patients. The overall objective is to establish the signaling elements modulated by MIC-1/transforming growth factor-ß receptors (TGF-ßRs) and their functional cross- talks with EGFR and CXCR4 cascades in tumor and tumor-associated stromal cells during prostate carcinogenesis and bone metastases that contribute to the ethnic disparity in AA vs. Caucasian patients. The therapeutic benefit to targeting MIC-1 cascade and its functional partners for reversing the chemoresistance of PC cells will also be investigated using PCa cell models and human PCa tissues from AA and Caucasian men. To test this hypothesis, three specific aims were proposed. Aim I will establish the involvement of MIC-1, EGFR and CXCR4 in racial disparity by performing immunohistochemical analyses of their expression on a large panel of benign and malignant tissues and DNA microarrays with PC cell lines relevant to AA and Caucasian men. Aim II will delineate molecular mechanisms of MIC-1 and its signaling cross-talks with EGFR and CXCR4 cascades involved in the growth, invasion and alterations of metabolic pathways using in vitro PCa cell models relevant to AA and Caucasian PCa patients. Aim III will determine the therapeutic benefit to target MIC-1 cascade for improving the anti-carcinogenic effects of docetaxel using in vitro and in vivo PCa cell models. Finally, we also demonstrate the molecular mechanism associated with Docetaxel resistance and its relationship with MIC-1 in PCa cells relevant to AA and Caucasian patients. Taken together, these studies will delineate the functional interplay between MIC-1 and its interacting partners EGFR and CXCR4 and their potential role in disease aggressiveness and therapy resistance to better understand their involvement in the racial disparity between AA and Caucasian patients. The overall outcome of this application will reveal the clinical interest to use combination of MIC-1, EGFR and CXCR4 as molecular biomarkers for an earlier and accurate diagnosis, response to therapy and impact on therapeutic intervention of AA and Caucasian patients.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The research project aims to establish the role of MIC-1 and its interacting partners EGFR and CXCR4 in prostate cancer (PCa) pathogenesis, aggressiveness and their involvement in the racial disparity between African American (AA) and Caucasian men. The studies will delineate the signaling elements modulated by MIC-1 and its functional partners EGFR and CXCR4 that contribute to PCa progression, bone metastases, chemoresistance and interethnic disparity using a large panel of prostatic tissue specimens and PCa cell lines relevant to PCa and bone metastases derived from AA and Caucasian patients. Further, the autocrine/paracrine role of MIC-1 in PCa will be established using recombinant human MIC-1 protein using stromal and tumor cells. The benefit of down-regulating MIC-1 for reversing Docetaxel resistance will be determined using in vitro and in vivo PCa cell models. Finally, we also demonstrate the mechanism associated with Docetaxel resistance and its relationship with MIC-1 in PCa cells.            ",MIC-1 and its functional partners in prostate cancer racial disparity,8877142,U01CA185148,"['Age ', ' Aggression ', ' Aggressive behavior ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Surgical Castration ', ' Castration ', ' cultured cell line ', ' Strains Cell Lines ', ' CellLine ', ' Cell Line ', ' Cells ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Diagnosis ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Elements ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Growth ', ' Modern Man ', ' Man (Taxonomy) ', ' Human ', ' In Vitro ', ' Incidence ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Light ', ' male ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Mortality ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Prognosis ', ' outcome forecast ', ' gene product ', ' Proteins ', ' proto-oncogene protein c-erbB-1 ', ' erbBl ', ' erbB-1 Proto-Oncogene Protein ', ' erbB-1 ', ' c-erbB-1 Protein ', ' c-erbB-1 ', ' Urogastrone Receptor ', ' Transforming Growth Factor alpha Receptor ', ' TGF-alpha Receptor ', ' HER1 ', ' Epidermal Growth Factor-Urogastrone Receptors ', ' Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinase ', ' Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor Kinase ', ' ERBB Protein ', ' EGFR ', ' EGF Receptor ', ' Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Metastatic to ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Survival Rate ', ' Testing ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Tissues ', ' TGFβ ', ' TGFbeta ', ' TGF-β ', ' TGF-beta ', ' TGF B ', ' Platelet Transforming Growth Factor ', ' Milk Growth Factor ', ' Bone-Derived Transforming Growth Factor ', ' Transforming Growth Factor beta ', ' transforming growth factors Animal growth regulators ', ' Tumor Growth Factors ', ' Transforming Growth Factors ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' Upregulation ', ' Up-Regulation ', ' Up-Regulation (Physiology) ', ' white race ', ' Occidental ', ' Caucasoid Race ', ' Caucasoid ', ' Caucasian Race ', ' Caucasian ', ' Caucasians ', ' oriental ', ' Asians ', ' Relative ', ' Relative (related person) ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' Mediating ', ' bone neoplasm secondary ', ' Skeletal metastasis ', ' Secondary malignant neoplasm of bone ', ' Secondary malignancy of bone ', ' Secondary cancer of bone ', ' Osseous metastasis ', ' Metastatic malignant neoplasm to bone ', ' Metastatic Tumor to the Bone ', ' Metastatic Cancer to the Bone ', ' Metastasis to bone ', ' Bony metastasis ', ' Bone cancer metastatic ', ' Bone Metastasis ', ' Metastatic Neoplasm to the Bone ', ' Stromal Cells ', ' base ', ' neoplastic progression ', ' neoplasm progression ', ' cancer progression ', ' tumor progression ', ' improved ', ' Benign ', ' Clinical ', ' Malignant ', ' Malignant -

"Mitochondria-nuclear crosstalk in triple negative breast cancer racial disparity DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): For Triple Negative BCa (TN BCa), there is a current lack of understanding of driver pathways and hence are often treated using more generic therapies. Currently there are no clinically accepted targets for the treatment for TN BCa and to predict its potential to metastasize. while BCa incidence is higher in Caucasian (CA) women, death due to BCa is higher in African American (AA) women. Importantly, AA patients are more likely to be diagnosed with triple negative (TN) BCa and at a more advanced stage than CA. Mitochondria is considered the energy house of the cell and has been strongly implicated in tumor development and progression and thus serving as a potential target for chemotherapy. With the advent of Transmitochondrial cybrid (cybrid) technology, it is now possible to examine the specific contribution of tumor-associated mitochondria to neoplastic growth and development under a defined nuclear background. Cybrids are constructed by fusing enucleated cells harboring mitochondria of interest with ?0 recipient cells (cells harboring ablated mitochondrial DNA). Using this technology in both an in vitro and in vivo setting, we have demonstrated a key role for mitochondrial retrograde regulation (MRR) progression of TN BCa. We have also identified critical regulation of post-translational modification of Src oncogenic pathway by cancer mitochondria. Our preliminary analysis using cybrids with mitochondria from AA and CA TN BCa cell lines suggest that mitochondrial retrograde regulation (MRR) of nuclear genes are different in AA and CA cells. Here we propose to combine Dr. Kaipparettu's (PI) expertise in BCa and cybrid technology with Dr. Lewis expertize in generating patient derived xenografts and Dr. Creighton's expertise in bioinformatics to evaluate a clinically challenging question, ""How can we better distinguish AA and CA TN BCa by its MRR?"" Strategically, we will use cybrid system generated from AA and CA TN BCa patients-derived xenografts to analyze the mitochondria specific alterations in metastatic BCa. ?0 cells from different TN breast-derived AA and CA nuclear background are already available in Kaipparettu lab. The cybrids thus generated will be confirmed for their mitochondrial function, nuclear origin by next-gen sequencing and evaluated for phenotypic changes using in vitro and in vivo tumor forming/invasion assays. Following this, cybrids with AA and CA mitochondria will be profiled for their Src pathway modification. To identify novel pathways, the MRR of cybrids will be analyzed by microarray and the gene expression will be examined using an established biostatistics and bioinformatics pipelines (Oncomine Concept Mapping) together with the biostatistician Dr. Creighton to generate oncogenic signatures and pathways associated with AA and CA TN BCa metastasis. The nominated pathways will be evaluated for their role in TN BCa progression using cell line and xenograft models. Overall, we expect to develop the first- of-its-kind mitochondria-driven oncogenic signature for AA and CA TN BCa progression. Clinically, we expect these to be translated to identify new drug targets for AA TN BCa. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Racial disparity exists in triple negative breast cancer, which is one of the aggressive subtypes of cancer, with higher number of incidence and mortality in young African American women. Though mitochondria play an important role in promoting cancer progression by retrograde regulation of nuclear genes and post-translation modification of oncoproteins, the role mitochondrial regulation in racial disparity of triple negative breast cancer has never been examined. Using a combination of cybrid technology together with oncogenic pathway analysis, this proposal aims to identify mitochondria-regulated cancer signatures for racial disparity in triple negative breast cancer.",Mitochondria-nuclear crosstalk in triple negative breast cancer racial disparity,9072188,R21CA179720,"['Accounting ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' Animals ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Biometrics ', ' Biometry ', ' Breast ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' cultured cell line ', ' Strains Cell Lines ', ' CellLine ', ' Cell Line ', ' Nucleus ', ' Cell Nucleus ', ' Cells ', ' Communication ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Diagnosis ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' DNA ', ' mtDNA ', ' Mitochondrial DNA ', ' electron transfer ', ' Electron Transport ', ' Foundations ', ' Genes ', ' Growth and Development ', ' Growth and Development function ', ' Health ', ' Histones ', ' Housing ', ' In Vitro ', ' Incidence ', ' Maps ', ' mitochondrial ', ' Mitochondria ', ' Mortality ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' genome mutation ', ' Genetic defect ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Mutation ', ' tumor cell metastasis ', ' cancer metastasis ', ' Tumor Cell Migration ', ' Secondary Tumor ', ' Secondary Neoplasm ', ' Metastatic Tumor ', ' Metastatic Neoplasm ', ' Metastasize ', ' Metastasis ', ' Neoplasm Metastasis ', ' neoplastic growth ', ' neoplasia ', ' Neoplasms ', ' Oncoproteins ', ' Oncogene Products ', ' Oncogene Proteins ', ' Organelles ', ' Paper ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Play ', ' Protein Modification ', ' Posttranslational Protein Processing ', ' Posttranslational Modifications ', ' Post-Translational Protein Modification ', ' Post-Translational Modifications ', ' Post-Translational Modification Protein/Amino Acid Biochemistry ', ' Post-Translational Protein Processing ', ' gene product ', ' Proteins ', ' Research ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Technology ', ' Translating ', ' Translations ', ' transplant ', ' Transplantation ', ' white race ', ' Occidental ', ' Caucasoid Race ', ' Caucasoid ', ' Caucasian Race ', ' Caucasian ', ' Caucasians ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' v-SRC Avian Sarcoma (Schmidt-Ruppin A-2) Viral Oncogene Homolog ', ' c-src Proto-Oncogenes ', ' c-src Genes ', ' c src ', ' ASVSRC1 ', ' SRC gene ', ' Generic Drugs ', ' generic ', ' Nonproprietary Drugs ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' Pro-Oxidants ', ' Oxygen Radicals ', ' Active Oxygen ', ' Reactive Oxygen Species ', ' Sequence Analyses ', ' SEQ-AN ', ' Sequence Analysis ', ' base ', ' neoplastic progression ', ' neoplasm progression ', ' cancer progression ', ' tumor progression ', ' Benign ', ' Clinical ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Biological ', ' src-Family Tyrosine Kinases ', ' src Tyrosine Kinases ', ' src Protein-Tyrosine Kinases ', ' src Kinases ', ' src-Family Kinases ', ' Metabolic ', ' Exposure to ', ' Staging ', ' Malignant Cell ', ' cancer cell ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' Xenotransplantation ', ' Xenograft ', ' Heterologous Transplantation ', ' Heterograft ', ' Xenograft procedure ', ' Nuclear ', ' interest ', ' novel ', ' Categories ', ' Regulation ', ' Network Analysis ', ' Pathway Analysis ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' LOINC Axis 2 Property ', ' Property ', ' response ', ' drug development ', ' gene expression microarray ', ' GeneChip ', ' Gene Expression Chip ', ' Gene Chips ', ' mtDNA mutation ', ' mitochondrial DNA mutation ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' metabolism measurement ', ' metabolomics ', ' microarray technology ', ' Microarray-Based Analysis ', ' Microarray Analysis ', ' Data ', ' prognostic indicator ', ' prognostic biomarker ', ' Prognosis Marker ', ' Molecular Marker of Prognosis ', ' Prognostic Marker ', ' in vivo ', ' Apoptotic ', ' Xenograft Model ', ' Modification ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' triple-negative breast cancer ', ' triple-negative invasive breast carcinoma ', ' cancer type ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' Cancerous ', ' Oncogenic ', ' clinical significance ', ' clinically significant ', ' chemotherapy ', ' tumor ', ' nextgen sequencing ', ' next gen sequencing ', ' NGS system ', ' NGS Method ', ' next generation sequencing ', ' Drug Targeting ', ' ']",NCI,BAYLOR COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,R21,2015,53212,0.03690189014731161
"IBD Gene Mapping by Clinical and Population Subset DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) are complex genetic disorders of the gastrointestinal tract, and a major health burden to patients and society. Tremendous progress has been made in dissecting IBD genetic etiology with identification of over 100 IBD loci by genome wide association studies (GWAS) but mainly limited to persons of European ancestry. The IBD Genetics Consortium (IBDGC) was established to facilitate multicenter collaborative studies of 6 Genetics Research Centers (GRCs) organized with a Data Coordinating Center (DCC). Our GRC at Johns Hopkins (JHGRC) has contributed to all IBDGC studies, led the largest genome wide linkage study in IBD and has led the IBDGC in a focus on African American (AA) IBD genetics (recruiting 88% of study subjects). We published the first large clinical characterization of AA IBD, serological associations of AA CD, clinical disparity studies, and most recently evaluation of admixture in AA CD, NOD2 the other four most well characterized CD genetic loci. More research in AA IBD is needed to understand the etiology of IBD in this ancestrally distinct, major American population, and also because diverse allelic and haplotype structure, and potential for unique functional variants will yield benefits for all populations. Additionally, a major challenge, especially for non- coding associations, is to know which SNPs are causative vs. those in linkage disequilibrium. Comparing association patterns across populations and evaluating function of associated SNPs that map to potential transcription factor (TF) sites active in IBD related cells will be beneficial. Our Aims in the next funding period are to (1) facilitate more comprehensive IBD gene discovery and evaluation in the AA population, and (2) to characterize the epigenome relevant to IBD and evaluate the most provocative non-coding SNPs across populations that map to potential TF binding sites for alterning genomic function. For the first Aim, we have enlarged our recruitment to12 satellite recruitment centers and will recruit 1000 AA IBD cases (with potential of 2600 cases) over the next five years. Immunochip IBD genotyping in AA's and a first stage AA CD GWAS IBD are underway, with facilitation of a 2nd stage ancillary R01 AA CD GWAS with Emory University planned for Year 3. We will perform an IBDGC AA UC GWAS of 1000 cases in year 4. We will compare IBD associations across ethnic groups to define most consistent non-coding SNPs. For Aim 2, we've assembled a team to help us characterize IBD relevant epigenomic annotation. We will purify immune cells from resected colon of patients, perform ChIP-Seq, and evaluate SNPs that map to TF binding sites using in-vitro enhancer assays in transfected cell lines. We will play a major role in all IBDGC activities, with our team of genetic statistical, genomic, immunology, and microbiome co-investigators, by our ability to obtain biological materials (including blood, biopsy, resection, and stool) and to recall patients for re-sampling, and by working cooperatively to maximize productivity of the IBDGC and its GRCs and DCC. According to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention, an estimated 1.4 million Americans suffer from Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD), a chronic debilitating disorder with no cure that includes Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. IBD ranks in the top 5 in prevalence for gastrointestinal disorders and represents a significant financial burden to society requiring a lifetime of medical care. This proposed research aims to determine the genetic variations that cause IBD which will aid in developing preventive measures, improving the quality of care with better treatments and educating patients through genetic counseling.",IBD Gene Mapping by Clinical and Population Subset,8926950,U01DK062431,"['Achievement Attainment ', ' Achievement ', ' Allelomorphs ', ' Alleles ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Architecture ', ' self recognition (immune) ', ' Autoimmune Status ', ' Autoimmunity ', ' Reactive Site ', ' Combining Site ', ' Binding Sites ', ' biological material ', ' Biomaterials ', ' Biocompatible Materials ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Biopsy ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Blood ', ' cultured cell line ', ' Strains Cell Lines ', ' CellLine ', ' Cell Line ', ' Cells ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' CDC ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' Chromatin ', ' genetic mapping ', ' Total Human and Non-Human Gene Mapping ', ' Linkage Mapping ', ' Gene Mapping Genetics ', ' Gene Mapping ', ' Gene Localization ', ' Chromosome Mapping ', ' Ulcerated Colitis ', ' Ulcerative Colitis ', ' Colon ', ' Satellite Centers ', ' Community Health Centers ', ' regional enteritis ', ' eleocolitis ', ' Granulomatous Enteritis ', "" Crohn's disorder "", ' Crohn disease ', "" Crohn's disease "", ' type I diabetes ', ' ketosis prone diabetes ', ' juvenile diabetes mellitus ', ' juvenile diabetes ', ' insulin dependent diabetes ', ' Type I Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Type 1 diabetes ', ' Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus ', ' T1DM ', ' T1D ', ' T1 diabetes ', ' T1 DM ', ' Sudden-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Ketosis-Prone Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Juvenile-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' IDDM ', ' Brittle Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' DNA ', ' Epithelial Cells ', ' Ethnic group ', ' stool ', ' Feces ', ' gastrointestinal disorder ', ' Gastrointestinal Diseases and Manifestations ', ' Gastrointestinal Diseases ', ' Gastrointestinal tract structure ', ' digestive canal ', ' alimentary tract ', ' Gastrointestinal Tract ', ' GI Tract ', ' Digestive Tract ', ' Alimentary Canal ', ' Gene Expression Regulation ', ' Gene Regulation Process ', ' Gene Regulation ', ' Gene Action Regulation ', ' Genes ', ' Regulator Genes ', ' trans acting element ', ' regulatory gene ', ' Transcriptional Regulatory Elements ', ' Genetic Counseling ', ' Genotype ', ' Goals ', ' Haplotypes ', ' Health ', ' hereditary disorder ', ' genetic disorder ', ' Molecular Disease ', ' Genetic Diseases ', ' Genetic Condition ', ' Hereditary Disease ', ' Modern Man ', ' Man (Taxonomy) ', ' Human ', ' Immunological Diseases ', ' Immunologic Diseases ', ' Immune System Disorder ', ' Immune Dysfunction ', ' Immune Disorders ', ' Immune Diseases ', ' Immune System Diseases ', ' In Vitro ', ' Inflammatory Intestinal Disorder ', ' Inflammatory Intestinal Disease ', ' Inflammatory Bowel Disorder ', ' Inflammatory Bowel Diseases ', ' bowel ', ' Intestinal ', ' Intestines ', ' Linkage Disequilibrium ', ' systemic lupus erythematosis ', ' disseminated lupus erythematosus ', ' Systemic SLE -

"An Integrated HIV Prevention Model for African American Mothers and Daughters    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Disproportionate rates of mental illness and HIV/AIDS/STIs among African Americans (AA), especially females, reflect significant health disparities. AA women accounted for 66% of new AIDS cases among women in 2006, and AA girls account for 64% of new HIV infections among youth. Mental health is linked to HIV-risk in important ways, yet few families- based, gender-specific, Afrocentric programs address mental health and HIV. Simultaneously targeting multiple levels in an integrated approach - the mother-daughter dyad, women, and girls - addresses HIV in the broader social context and capitalizes on the reciprocal impact of mothers and daughters, facilitating mutual reinforcement of HIV prevention attitudes and behavior, and thereby reducing intervention decay and sustaining positive outcomes over protracted time periods. IMARA (Informed, Motivated, Aware, and Responsible about AIDS) is a culturally-tailored, gender-specific, individual PLUS family-based HIV prevention program designed for two high risk groups -- AA women and AA girls. Based on the Theory of Gender and Power and the Social-Personal Framework, IMARA blends SISTA for women, SiHLE for girls, and a highly promising (Project STYLE) family-based program for teens in psychiatric care to simultaneously reduce women's and girls' risky sexual behavior and delay girls' sexual debut. IMARA incorporates components of Project STYLE that are specific to families and teens in psychiatric care (affect management, conflict resolution, parental monitoring, parent-teen communication) with aspects of SISTA and SiHLE that address gender, power, and ethnic pride. Pilot testing (N=22 mother-daughter dyads) supported IMARA's feasibility, tolerability, and acceptability, and despite the small sample size, outcome data indicate promising trends and changes in targeted mediators (increased parental monitoring, more open mother-daughter communication, greater intentions to use condoms, more relationship power) and sexual risk (increased condom use, fewer partners) separately for mothers and daughters from baseline to 2-month follow up. This study proposes a 2-arm RCT to test and compare the efficacy of IMARA to a health promotion control group in reducing risky sexual behavior among 300 women and their 14 - 18 year old AA daughters in psychiatric care. Mothers and daughters will complete baseline, 6-, and 12-month follow-up assessments. We will use an intent-to-treat analysis and a combination of SEM procedures, regression techniques, and other inferential statistical tests for contrasting means and proportions. We will analyze treatment outcomes using logistic and linear multiple regression models examining effects at 6- and 12- months separately, as well as a combined model with random effects for repeated measurements across time. This proposal answers a compelling need for innovative prevention programs that address the intersecting health disparities of mental illness and HIV/AIDS/STIs among African American girls and women. Effective family-based programs can alter negative developmental trajectories of this very high-risk population and begin to redress existing health disparities.        African Americans (AA) account for more HIV/AIDS cases, people living with HIV/AIDS, and HIV-related deaths than any other racial group in the United States.1, 2 In 2004, AA women accounted for the largest proportion (66%) of new AIDS cases among women in 2006,3-5 and in 2005, AA youth ages 13 - 19 accounted for 69% of new AIDS cases.3 AAs also experience significant mental health disparities,6, 7 and mental illness exacerbates risk for HIV among adults8, 9 and youth.10 Teens in psychiatric care engage in the same HIV-risk behaviors as their school age peers but at higher rates.11-13 The diversity of risk factors associated with these trends is complex, multi-level, and go beyond an individual woman or girl, yet few family-based, gender-specific, Afrocentric programs exist to address their needs. Simultaneously targeting multiple levels in an integrated program -- the mother-daughter dyad, women, and girls -- capitalizes on the reciprocal impact of mothers and daughters, and facilitates mutual reinforcement of HIV prevention attitudes and behavior, thereby reducing intervention decay and sustaining positive outcomes over time. The long-term goal of the study is to reduce health disparities in HIV/AIDS/STIs and mental health among African American women and girls by improving healthy sexual decision-making, empowering mothers to become effective role models, strengthening mother-daughter communication and emotion regulation skills, and building stronger mother-daughter relationships that sustain behavior change.

"Enhancing Kidney Donation Through Live Organ Video Educated Donors (LOVED) DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Chronic Kidney Disease is diagnosed in four times as many African Americans (AAs) as Whites and nearly twice as many AAs perish from the condition. Kidney transplantation offers the best outcomes for patients with End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) but rates of procurement far outnumber cadaver organ availability, especially among AAs. A superior option is living donor kidney transplantation (LDKT). Since AAs comprise only 18.5% of LDKT recipients, innovative and culturally preferred strategies are needed to increase LDKT within the AA community. We hypothesize that a patient-centered, two tiered culturally sensitive education/motivation intervention targeting AA ESRD patients and potential donors (PDs) using mobile health (mHealth) technology will result in: 1) increased ESRD patients' willingness to ask for donation; 2) increased number of PDs who complete medical evaluation; and, 3) increased number of LDKTs. We will leverage mHealth technology as the delivery mechanism to maximize large scale dissemination potential. Guided by behavioral change and technology acceptability theories, the Live Organ Video Educated Donor [LOVED] program will be developed to address two domains. LOVED I will be tailored for AA ESRD patients and navigated by an AA LDKT recipient. LOVED II will be tailored for potential LDKT donors and navigated by an AA LDKT donor. iPad program delivery will include testimonial audio/video clips, home-work assignments, videoconferencing, chat room sessions, and text/emails. The proposed mixed methods research utilizes qualitative and quantitative studies in a 3 phase process of development that will involve: 1) Development of LOVED I and II technical content and delivery formats guided by behavioral and technological theories using 9 focus groups (8 per group) of AA LDKT recipients/donors, ESRD LDKT eligible patients, PDs who failed to complete screening and transplant healthcare provider team. 2) Conduct 3 month LOVED I and II proof of concept studies (LOVED I = 24 LDKT eligible patients; LOVED II = 24 PDs who did not complete screening) to assess program acceptability, feasibility, changes in self efficacy and attitudes. Also assessed will be % ESRD patients who identify PDs, % PDs who complete screening, % LDKTs and participants' perceptions of cultural competence of intervention including levels of trust, discrimination, shared decision making and literacy. 3) Conduct two 6 month 2-arm randomized control trials (LOVED I vs. standard of care, N=60; LOVED II vs. standard of care, N=80) to generate estimates needed for design of a large scale RCT. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Culturally sensitive programs are needed to increase African Americans' (AAs) LDKT rate. We will accomplish this with a user centered iterative development approach resulting in a two-tiered LDKT program led by AA LDKT recipients/donors. iPad program delivery will include videoconferencing, chat room sessions and viewing of testimonials from AA LDKT patients/donors relating how barriers and associated issues were resolved and AA celebrities' experiences of the benefits of LDKT. These experiences will foster increased efficacy and motivation to complete the LDKT process as a patient or donor.",Enhancing Kidney Donation Through Live Organ Video Educated Donors (LOVED),8917204,R01DK098777,"['Attitude ', ' Behavior ', ' Cadaver ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' Diagnosis ', ' dialysis therapy ', ' Dialysis ', ' Dialysis procedure ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Discrimination (Psychology) ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Email ', ' E-Mail ', ' Electronic Mail ', ' Feedback ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Health ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Health Personnel ', ' Hospitals ', ' indexing ', ' renal ', ' Kidney Urinary System ', ' Kidney ', ' chronic kidney disease ', ' Chronic Renal Failure ', ' Chronic Renal Disease ', ' Chronic Kidney Failure ', ' Renal Transplants ', ' Renal Transplantation ', ' Kidney Transplants ', ' Kidney Grafting ', ' Kidney Transplantation ', ' Linguistic ', ' Linguistics ', ' literacy ', ' lifespan ', ' life span ', ' Length of Life ', ' Longevity ', ' Motivation ', ' Patients ', ' Perception ', ' Program Acceptability ', ' QOL ', ' Quality of life ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Solutions ', ' South Carolina ', ' Technology ', ' Time ', ' transplant ', ' Transplantation ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' Research Methods ', ' Research Methodology ', ' Clip ', ' base ', ' dosage ', ' Organ ', ' Phase ', ' Medical ', ' Evaluation ', ' Trust ', ' Fostering ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' Staging ', ' tool ', ' Living Donors ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Home ', ' Home environment ', ' meetings ', ' preference ', ' experience ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' Participant ', ' cultural competence ', ' Health Care Technology ', ' Health Technology ', ' theories ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Drops ', ' Provider ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' End-Stage Renal Disease ', ' End-Stage Kidney Disease ', ' ESRD ', ' End stage renal failure ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Address ', ' Videoconferencing ', ' Videoconferences ', ' Adherence ', ' Adherence (attribute) ', ' Data ', ' High Prevalence ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Randomized ', ' Process ', ' Text ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' early onset ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' willingness ', ' Outcome ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' patient centered ', ' patient oriented ', ' primary outcome ', ' secondary outcome ', ' standard of care ', ' coping mechanism ', ' shared decision making ', ' arm ', ' screening ', ' mobile health ', ' m-Health ', ' mHealth ', ' ']",NIDDK,MEDICAL UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA,R01,2015,258125,0.03647328632438093
"DIDACTIC: Dissemination and Implementation of a Diet and Activity Community Trial DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): South Carolina has some of the largest health disparities in the nation, and these are invariably more extreme in African Americans (AA) compared to European Americans. The chronic diseases that present the greatest public health challenges are now known to be inflammation related, and AAs tend to have greater inherent sensitivity to inflammation modulators. The proposed dissemination and implementation research is based on our efficacious intervention trial, ""Diet & Activity Community Trial: High-Risk Inflammation"" [R24 MD002769- 01], which focused on diet, physical activity, and stress reduction in collaboration with the AA faith community to reduce inflammation (referred to as the HEALS intervention). Extraordinary success in engaging the AA faith and greater AA community allows us to propose to disseminate and implement this intervention. We will ensure that the proposed dissemination and implementation research contributes to achieving our overall goal of reducing health disparities among AAs through the following specific aims: (1) Disseminate and implement the successful HEALS intervention in the AA faith community; (2) Evaluate and monitor the dissemination process for adoption, recruitment, retention, and fidelity to the HEALS intervention trial including testing the effect of the disseminated intervention using a variety of non-invasive measures that are relevant to overall health status, proven to be related to chronic inflammation in the intervention-phase trial, and that can (and will) be employed in a community setting; (3) Conduct a cost-effectiveness analysis of intervention dissemination and implementation to reduce health disparities in parameters associated with inflammation, from both budgetary and societal perspectives; and (4) Enhance the capacity of the target community to sustain the delivery of the evidence-based intervention and for community partners to engage in future research and programming to address health disparities through cultivation of a network of active church and community educators and leadership development activities. We will utilize a community-based participatory research approach to recruit 30 churches and 450 participants using a lay health, train-the-trainer model that decentralizes the research process and is suitable for dissemination and implementation research. We also will engage 30 ""mentor"" lay health educators (members of church education teams) who participated in the intervention trial phase to mentor and train newly recruited lay health educators for church education teams for the proposed dissemination and implementation research. We propose to use non-invasive approaches to measure key variables during dissemination and implementation. Cost-effectiveness analysis is an important component and will yield information on required inputs and outputs. The proposed research offers an opportunity to build upon a history of successful collaboration by disseminating and implementing evidence- based intervention with a focus on sustainability of efforts through capacity-building and leadership development to address health disparities in the AA community to address health disparities. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: African Americans (AA) in South Carolina have some of the most extreme health disparities in the nation and most of these can be traced to the effects of poor diet, low levels of physical activity, and stress in increasing chronic inflammation. We have developed an efficacious intervention for dissemination and implementation in partnership with and by our community stakeholders in the AA community to stem the high rates of inflammation rising tide of chronic disease rates in this community. The proposed research also will include assessing the costs associated with dissemination and implementation and focus on enhancing sustainability through capacity building and leadership development activities.",DIDACTIC: Dissemination and Implementation of a Diet and Activity Community Trial,8840651,R01HL122285,"['Adoption ', ' Awareness ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' chronic disorder ', ' chronic disease/disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Communities ', ' Community Participation ', ' dietary ', ' Diet ', ' Food Intake ', ' Eating ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Family ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Level of Health ', ' Health Status ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' Inflammation ', ' Leadership ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Obesity ', ' Ownership ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' recruit ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' Research ', ' South Carolina ', ' Stress ', ' Testing ', ' Translations ', ' Universities ', ' Measures ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Chronic ', ' Phase ', ' Ensure ', ' Training ', ' Physical activity ', ' Trust ', ' European ', ' R24 ', ' R-24 Monoclonal Antibody ', ' MoAb R24 ', ' Monoclonal Antibody R24 ', ' cancer prevention ', ' Collaborations ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' Church ', ' American ', ' cancer risk ', ' success ', ' Participant ', ' member ', ' Intervention Trial ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' theories ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Health Educators ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Address ', ' cost-effectiveness analysis ', ' cost-effective analysis ', ' cost efficient analysis ', ' cost effective analysis ', ' Cost Effective Analyses ', ' Cost Effectiveness Analysis ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Cancer Control Science ', ' Cancer Control ', ' Community Trial ', ' Monitor ', ' Process ', ' Community Health ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Output ', ' cost ', ' implementation research ', ' dissemination research ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Evidence based intervention ', ' stem ', ' community based participatory research ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' therapy design ', ' health training ', ' high risk ', ' community setting ', ' evidence base ', ' high standard ', ' inflammation marker ', ' inflammatory marker ', ' ']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA AT COLUMBIA,R01,2015,496018,0.12791418231308868
"Enhancing Glaucoma Medication Adherence Among African Americans ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Glaucoma is the leading cause of irreversible blindness among African Americans (AA) who are more than three times more likely to develop glaucoma when compared to Caucasians. Changes associated with the progression of glaucoma can have a serious negative impact on an individual's quality of life, independence, and everyday functioning. Accumulating research indicates that pressure-reducing eye drops can significantly delay or prevent the onset of disease; however, such preventative efforts have been found to be limited due to problems with poor medication adherence. Lacking are available health promotion interventions that minimize this important health disparity. Thus, in our research program, we demonstrated this health disparity for glaucoma medication adherence (Dreer et al., 2012). Next, we conducted several follow-up studies in order to develop a culturally relevant and informed, health promotion-based intervention to improve glaucoma medication adherence among AA's. As part of the intervention development process, we conducted several focus groups with AA glaucoma patients to elicit the salient barriers and facilitators related to glaucoma medication adherence, and then formed a community-based participatory research team comprised of AA's with glaucoma (Dreer et al., 2013). The resulting intervention was based on a multi-component empowerment framework that includes glaucoma education, motivational interviewing, and problem-solving training to improve glaucoma medication adherence. We recently pilot tested the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of the intervention among AA's. Findings revealed significant improvements in objective medication adherence (Dreer et al., under review). Therefore, we now propose to further evaluate the efficacy of this intervention for improving glaucoma medication adherence among AA patients in a large-scale randomized clinical trial (RCT).  The patient population for the RCT will consist of 240 adult AA's with glaucoma and who are aged = 21 years who seek services at the University of Alabama at Birmingham's Glaucoma Clinic within the Department of Ophthalmology. The RCT will have two treatment arms; patients will be randomized following eligibility determination and written informed consent. The usual care only arm will consist of the standard medical care for glaucoma (medicine, laser trabeculoplasty, conventional surgery, or a combination of any of these). The second arm will consist of usual care as just described plus the culturally relevant, health promotion-based intervention. The primary outcome (objective glaucoma medication adherence) and secondary outcomes will be assessed at baseline before intervention initiation and at 3, 7, and 12-month in-clinic follow-up visits by a research interviewer masked to subjects' randomization. The practical question to be addressed is does a culturally relevant, health promotion-based intervention improve glaucoma medication adherence among a high-risk segment of the population? Information from this project will be particularly useful for AA's with glaucoma, their families, and eye care providers.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Poor adherence to glaucoma therapy is a significant healthcare issue that may result in unwarranted changes in medications, increased healthcare expenditure, risk to the patient if surgical intervention is required and further deterioration of vision, all of which can be prevented. This can subsequently have a negative impact on an individual's quality life, independence, and everyday living. The multifaceted and culturally relevant, health promotion-based intervention, lacking in this area, is designed to take critical steps toward addressing this problem by motivating change for healthy lifestyle behaviors and improving problem-solving strategies to better manage barriers related to glaucoma medication adherence, particularly among African American patients who are at greater risk for glaucoma and poor adherence compared to Caucasians.            ",Enhancing Glaucoma Medication Adherence Among African Americans,8862695,R01EY025331,"['adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Alabama ', ' Awareness ', ' Behavior ', ' Belief ', ' Control Groups ', ' Diagnosis ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Electronics ', ' Elements ', ' Protocol Screening ', ' Eligibility ', ' Eligibility Determination ', ' Expenditure ', ' Eyeball ', ' Eye ', ' ophthalmopathy ', ' eye disorder ', ' Eye diseases ', ' Eye Drops ', ' Eyedrops ', ' Family ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Future ', ' Glaucoma ', ' glaucomatous ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' Health Promotion ', ' Informed Consent ', ' Interviewer ', ' Language ', ' Laser Radiation ', ' Laser Electromagnetic ', ' Lasers ', ' Literature ', ' Masks ', ' Medicine ', ' Ophthalmology ', ' Optometries ', ' Optometry ', ' Paper ', ' Patient Training ', ' Patient Instruction ', ' Patient Education ', ' Patients ', ' Perception ', ' pressure ', ' Problem Solving ', ' Publishing ', ' QOL ', ' Quality of life ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Research ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Research Design ', ' Risk ', ' Socioeconomic Factors ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Trabeculoplasty ', ' Trabeculectomy ', ' Universities ', ' visual function ', ' Sight ', ' Vision ', ' white race ', ' Occidental ', ' Caucasoid Race ', ' Caucasoid ', ' Caucasian Race ', ' Caucasian ', ' Caucasians ', ' Writing ', ' Generations ', ' Measures ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Schedule ', ' Treatment Cost ', ' Caring ', ' Magazine ', ' Journals ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Medical ', ' Randomized Clinical Trials ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Sample Size ', ' Disease Progression ', ' disorder onset ', ' disease onset ', ' Onset of illness ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Disorder Management ', ' Disease Management ', ' programs ', ' Clinic ', ' visual loss ', ' vision loss ', ' Blindness ', ' Test Result ', ' surgery ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' interest ', ' Visit ', ' Services ', ' experience ', ' skills ', ' empowerment ', ' race differences ', ' racial difference ', ' motivational interview ', ' motivational enhancement therapy ', ' feeling upset ', ' feeling distress ', ' emotional distress ', ' Deterioration ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Provider ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Preparedness ', ' Readiness ', ' Address ', ' Dose ', ' Adherence ', ' Adherence (attribute) ', ' Data ', ' Effectiveness of Interventions ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Randomized ', ' trial design ', ' Clinical Trials Design ', ' Conventional Surgery ', ' Preparation ', ' Process ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomic ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio economic ', ' socioeconomics ', ' medication adherence ', ' medication compliance ', ' underserved people ', ' under served population ', ' Underserved Population ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' therapy efficacy ', ' therapeutically effective ', ' therapeutic efficacy ', ' intervention efficacy ', ' Treatment Efficacy ', ' coping ', ' blind ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' twenty-one year old ', ' age 21 years ', ' age 21 ', ' 21 year old ', ' community based participatory research ', ' treatment development ', ' intervention development ', ' develop therapy ', ' therapy development ', ' visual science ', ' vision science ', ' high risk ', ' public health relevance ', ' patient population ', ' primary outcome ', ' secondary outcome ', ' usual care ', ' treatment as usual ', ' arm ', ' ']",NEI,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,R01,2015,367500,0.06606190269712187
"Analysis of Racial Disparities in HCC by Systems Metabolomics ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a significant health problem in the United States. Compared to European Americans (EA), the incidence of HCC is higher in African Americans (AA) and is associated with more advanced tumor stage at diagnosis and lower survival rates. It has been reported that the sensitivity of α- fetoprotein (AFP) for the diagnosis of HCC in African Americans with hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is lower than that of patients of all other racial groups combined. We previously performed preliminary investigation into racial disparities through metabolomics profiling of sera from HCC cases and patients with liver cirrhosis by using both liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Through stratified analysis of the LC/GC-MS data, we identified different candidates that distinguish HCC cases from the cirrhotic controls among AA and EA. This application builds on these promising preliminary results to find and validate race-specific metabolites as biomarkers for HCC. This will be accomplished by targeted analysis of metabolites in liver tissues and sera from HCC cases and patients with liver cirrhosis representing AA and EA. Metabolites that differentiate HCC cases from cirrhotic controls in a race-specific manner will be selected by statistical and network-based methods. Then, a systems-oriented approach that combines these metabolites with other candidate biomarkers (genes, glycans, and proteins) will be utilized for the selection of key signaling pathways perturbed in HCC. Following validation of the candidates via independent samples from HCC cases, patients with liver cirrhosis, and healthy subjects, we will elucidate their functional roles through both in vitro and in vivo experiments. Successful completion of this research will enable us to identify HCC biomarkers and perturbed pathways that are race-specific as well as those that are shared by AA and EA. These findings will contribute not only to a greater understanding of racial disparities in HCC but also to improving diagnosis of HCC through race-specific biomarkers.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Currently used biomarkers for detecting hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in high-risk cirrhotic patients lack the desired sensitivity and specificity, particularly in African American patients. The goal of this project is to find and validate race-specific biomarkers for HCC and identify perturbed intercellular signaling pathways in HCC. If successful, the study will (1) contribute to a greater understanding of racial disparities in HCC, (2) enable accurate detection of HCC by using race as a factor, and (3) give insights into the mechanisms underlying the behavior of potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets.                ",Analysis of Racial Disparities in HCC by Systems Metabolomics,8972508,U01CA185188,"['Behavior ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Blood ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' cultured cell line ', ' Strains Cell Lines ', ' CellLine ', ' Cell Line ', ' neoplastic transformation ', ' Neoplastic Cell Transformation ', ' Cells ', ' Clinical Markers ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Fetoprotein ', ' Genes ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' non-A, non-B hepatitis ', ' non-A non-B hepatitis ', ' non A, non B hepatitis ', ' non A non B hepatitis ', ' hepatitis nonA nonB ', ' hepatitis non A non B ', ' PT-NANBH ', ' Non-B Hepatitis Parenterally-Transmitted Non-A ', ' NANBH ', ' Hepatitis, Viral, Non-A, Non-B, Parenterally-Transmitted ', ' Hepatitis C virus infection ', ' HCV infection ', ' Hepatitis C ', ' liver carcinoma ', ' Liver Cells Carcinoma ', ' Hepatoma ', ' Hepatocellular cancer ', ' Hepatocellular Carcinoma ', ' Primary carcinoma of the liver cells ', ' University Hospitals ', ' In Vitro ', ' Incidence ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' hepatic organ system ', ' hepatic body system ', ' Liver ', ' Hepatic Cirrhosis ', ' Liver Cirrhosis ', ' mass fragmentometry ', ' ion trap mass spectrometry ', ' Mass-Gas Chromatography Spectrum Analysis ', ' Mass-Gas Chromatography Spectrometry ', ' Mass Fragmentographies ', ' Gas-Liquid-Mass Spectrometry Chromatography ', ' GCMS ', ' GC MS ', ' Mass Fragmentography ', ' Methods ', ' Tumor Staging ', ' Neoplasm Staging ', ' Cancer Staging ', ' Diagnostic Neoplasm Staging ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Glycans ', ' Polysaccharides ', ' gene product ', ' Proteins ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' recruit ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' Research ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Sensitivity and Specificity ', ' Signal Pathway ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Survival Rate ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Tissues ', ' United States ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' base ', ' racial/ethnic difference ', ' improved ', ' Biological ', ' Biochemical ', ' Chemicals ', ' Liver Cells ', ' Hepatic Parenchymal Cell ', ' Hepatic Cells ', ' Hepatocyte ', ' Blood Serum ', ' Serum ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' European ', ' Staging ', ' Investigation ', ' Pattern ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' Xenotransplantation ', ' Xenograft ', ' Heterologous Transplantation ', ' Heterograft ', ' Xenograft procedure ', ' American ', ' Cellular Proliferation ', ' Cell Multiplication ', ' Cell Growth in Number ', ' Cell Proliferation ', ' Performance ', ' Participant ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' research study ', ' Reporting ', ' Protein Gene Products ', ' Gene Proteins ', ' Network Analysis ', ' Pathway Analysis ', ' Sampling ', ' Proteomics ', ' LC/MS ', ' liquid chromatography mass spectrometry ', ' Metabolic Pathway ', ' T-Stage ', ' Tumor stage ', ' metabolism measurement ', ' metabolomics ', ' Enzyme Gene ', ' HPAFP ', ' FETA ', ' AFP ', ' AFP gene ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Stage at Diagnosis ', ' in vivo ', ' Validation ', ' Preparation ', ' cirrhotic ', ' Cirrhosis ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' risk prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' computer based prediction ', ' predictive modeling ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' transcriptomics ', ' Network-based ', ' healthy volunteer ', ' therapeutic target ', ' network models ', ' high risk ', ' public health relevance ', ' population based ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' cancer initiation ', ' candidate validation ', ' ']",NCI,GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY,U01,2015,269790,0.0776127873449452
"Metabotropic Glutamate Receptor 1 in African American Prostate Cancer DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Prostate cancer (PCa) presents with the greatest racial disparity of any cancer in the U.S., with an alarmingly high incidence and mortality rate among African Americans (AAs). AA men with PCa present with higher tumor volume, more advanced stage, higher Gleason grade, higher prostate-specific antigen (PSA), and worse prognosis than Caucasian Americans (CAs). The underlying reasons for such disproportionate ethnic differences may reflect genuine racial differences in cancer biology, socio-cultural differences, or access to health care systems.  Recently, we discovered that serum glutamate levels positively correlate with PCa aggressiveness and Gleason score (e8 versus d6) in AAs and CAs. However, glutamate levels were higher in AAs, with primary or metastatic castrate-resistant (CR) PCa than in CAs. Glutamate deprivation or blockade with a glutamate receptor (i.e., GRM1) antagonist significantly decreased growth, migration and invasion and induced apoptosis in PCa cells. We also demonstrated a higher GRM1 expression in MDA-PCa2b (metastatic AA-PCa cell line) than in the E006AA (primary AA-PCa cell line). GRM1 overexpression increased E006AA cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. Our preliminary data show that GRM1 expression is higher in PCa tissues than in normal or benign glands in AAs.  Based on these data, we hypothesized that GRM1 expression levels contribute to biological and clinical aggressiveness of PCa in AAs. Our hypothesis will be tested in the following Specific Aims: (1) to determine the association between tissue expression of GRM1 and clinicohistopathological predictors or prognosticators of PCa progression or aggressiveness in AAs; and (2) to determine the association between GRM1 expression levels and invasive and metastatic phenotypes in AA-PCa cells.  Data generated from this exploratory study will define biological and/or clinicohistopathological significance or relevance of GRM1 expression in AA-PCa and may prove useful in discriminating clinically or biologically aggressive tumors from indolent (non-aggressive) tumors and minimizing PCa disparity in AAs.

We recently discovered that serum glutamate levels positively correlate with PCa aggressiveness and Gleason score (e8 versus d6) and were higher in AAs, with primary or metastatic castrate-resistant PCa than in CAs. Our data show that glutamate receptor-GRM1 expression is higher in PCa tissues than in normal or benign glands in AAs. In this exploratory study, the biological relevance of alterations in GRM1 expression levels will be examined on tumor growth and metastasis in AA-PCa cell lines. To define the clinical significance, we will determine the association between tissue-expression levels of GRM1 and clinicopathological predictors or prognosticators of PCa aggressiveness in AA-men. Data obtained from the proposed studies may prove diagnostic utilities in discriminating between clinically or biologically aggressive tumors and non-aggressive (indolent) tumors and provide novel opportunities using GRM1-antagonist or blocking agent(s) for PCa therapy in AA men.",Metabotropic Glutamate Receptor 1 in African American Prostate Cancer,8829801,R21CA183892,"['Age ', ' Bioenergetics ', ' Natural Products ', ' Biologic Factor ', ' Biological Factors ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Brain ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' cultured cell line ', ' Strains Cell Lines ', ' CellLine ', ' Cell Line ', ' Motility ', ' Cellular Motility ', ' Cellular Migration ', ' Cell Movement ', ' Cell Migration ', ' Cell Locomotion ', ' cell motility ', ' Tricarboxylic Acid Cycle ', ' TCA cycle ', ' Krebs Cycle ', ' Citric Acid Cycle ', ' Environment ', ' Epithelial Cells ', ' Family ', ' glutamatergic ', ' L-Glutamate ', ' Glutamates ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Growth ', ' Health ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' healthcare service availability ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare access availability ', ' health services availability ', ' health care service availability ', ' health care service access ', ' health care availability ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Availability of Health Services ', ' Accessibility of health care ', ' Access to Healthcare ', ' Access to Health Care ', ' Access to Care ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' In Vitro ', ' Incidence ', ' melanocyte ', ' Malignant Melanoma ', ' melanoma ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Transgenic Mice ', ' Mortality ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Multivariate Analyses ', ' Multivariate Analysis ', ' tumor cell metastasis ', ' cancer metastasis ', ' Tumor Cell Migration ', ' Secondary Tumor ', ' Secondary Neoplasm ', ' Metastatic Tumor ', ' Metastatic Neoplasm ', ' Metastasize ', ' Metastasis ', ' Neoplasm Metastasis ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Play ', ' Prognosis ', ' outcome forecast ', ' Prostatic Gland ', ' Prostate Gland ', ' Prostate ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Recurrent ', ' Recurrence ', ' Risk Factors ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Signal Pathway ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Stains ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Tissues ', ' white race ', ' Occidental ', ' Caucasoid Race ', ' Caucasoid ', ' Caucasian Race ', ' Caucasian ', ' Caucasians ', ' Glutamate Receptor ', ' Measures ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' hK3 Kallikrein ', ' gamma-Seminoprotein ', ' Seminin ', ' Semenogelase ', ' Prostate Specific Antigen Preproprotein ', ' Plasma Prekallikrein ', ' Plasma Kallikrein Precursor ', ' P-30 Antigen ', ' Kallikrein 3 ', ' EC 3.4.21.34 ', ' Prostate-Specific Antigen ', ' Programmed Cell Death ', ' Apoptosis Pathway ', ' Apoptosis ', ' base ', ' neoplastic progression ', ' neoplasm progression ', ' cancer progression ', ' tumor progression ', ' Prostatovesiculectomy ', ' Radical Prostatectomy ', ' Benign ', ' Clinical ', ' Malignant ', ' Malignant -

"A Follow-up Study for Causes of Cancer in Black Women DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Black Women's Health Study (BWHS), the largest follow-up study for cancer in African American (AA) women, began in 1995 when 59,000 women (median age, 38) from across the U.S. enrolled. The BWHS has successfully followed participants with biennial questionnaires for data on incident disease and medical, reproductive, behavioral, psychosocial, and socioeconomic factors, linked addresses to U.S. census data, and are currently linking to air pollution data. Cancer diagnoses are validated by pathology data from hospitals and cancer registries. A DNA bio repository was established through collection of cheek cell samples from 26,800 participants. Despite initial slow accrual of cancers due to the young age of participants at entry, the BWHS has published extensively on risk factors for breast cancer; sufficient cases of lung cancer, colorectal cancer, and colon adenomas are now available. We propose to (1) continue follow-up/data collection; (2) establish a repository of 17,800 blood samples; (3) share data/samples in consortia projects. Continuation of the BWHS is highly desirable: 90% of participants are still cancer-free; follow-up has been successful and unbiased; the cohort has reached ages at which cancer incidence increases markedly; effects of exposures (e.g., severe obesity, racism) that are less common in other populations can be studied; the DNA has made valuable contributions to genetic cancer studies and is a major replication source for studies of breast cancer and related phenotypes in AA and other groups; the BWHS is a key contributor to consortia projects of rarer cancers in /\As; and the BWHS has been highly productive. Because levels of many blood markers are unfavorable among AAs and few studies of blood biomarkers in relation to cancer incidence have been carried out specifically in /\As, we propose to establish a repository of blood samples in the BWHS. A successful pilot study demonstrated the feasibility of our methods and participation was unbiased and similar to that in other large follow-up studies. The repository will increase by 60% the limited number of AA women with available blood samples being followed in U.S. cancer cohort studies. AA women continue to be disproportionately affected by many cancers. Continuation of the BWHS will permit continuation of its valuable contributions to understanding cancer etiology in this understudied group. A blood repository will greatly increase the value of the BWHS resource by permitting studies that help to fill the knowledge gap about the relation of biomarkers to cancer incidence and survival in AAs. The assessment of serious nonmalignant illnesses in the BWHS enhances the value of this resource at no cost to the study of cancer. Incidence and mortality rates of many cancers and other illnesses confinue to be disproportionately high  among AA women. The Black Women's Health Study, a follow-up study of 59,000 AA women, has  contributed important information on risk factors for cancer. Continued follow-up, the collection of blood  samples, and participation of the BWHS in collaborafive studies, including studies of rare cancers, will  produce valuable informafion on risk factors for cancers and other illnesses that burden AA women.",A Follow-up Study for Causes of Cancer in Black Women,8919286,UM1CA164974,"['abstracting ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' Air Pollution ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Blood ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Cells ', ' Censuses ', ' Cheek ', ' Bucca ', ' Cheek structure ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Collection ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' DNA ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Genotype ', ' Health ', ' Hospitals ', ' Incidence ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Income ', ' Laboratories ', ' Medical Records ', ' Methods ', ' Mortality ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Newsletter ', ' extreme obesity ', ' Severe obesity ', ' Morbid Obesity ', ' web based ', ' online computer ', ' On-Line Systems ', ' Online Systems ', ' Pathology ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' pilot study ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' Publishing ', ' Quality Control ', ' Questionnaires ', ' Research ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Ships ', ' Socioeconomic Factors ', ' Woman ', ' Female Health ', "" Women's Health "", ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' Nonrespondent ', ' Blood Sample ', ' Blood specimen ', ' Specified ', ' Specific qualifier value ', ' Medical ', ' racism ', ' Link ', ' lung cancer ', ' Pulmonary malignant Neoplasm ', ' Pulmonary Cancer ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Lung ', ' Malignant neoplasm of lung ', ' Funding ', ' Collaborations ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Knowledge ', ' Scanning ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Source ', ' psychosocial ', ' Services ', ' success ', ' cohort ', ' Manuscripts ', ' Participant ', ' payment ', ' cancer genetics ', ' reproductive ', ' cancer registry ', ' neoplasm registry ', ' inherited factor ', ' genetic risk factor ', ' colon adenomatous polyp ', ' colon adenoma ', ' Colonic Adenomatous Polyp ', ' Colonic Adenoma ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' repository ', ' cancer diagnosis ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Large Intestine Adenoma ', ' Large Bowel Adenomatous Polyp ', ' Large Bowel Adenoma ', ' Colorectal Adenomatous Polyp ', ' Colorectal Adenoma ', ' Address ', ' Aliquot ', ' Breast Cancer Risk Factor ', ' Consent ', ' Data ', ' Cancer Cause ', ' Cancer Etiology ', ' Collection ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' nonmalignant ', ' Non-Malignant ', "" Nurses' Health Study "", ' Preparation ', ' Process ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' Shipping ', ' Colorectal Cancer ', ' Behavioral ', ' cost ', ' years of life lost to disease ', ' years of life lost to disability ', ' disease burden ', ' burden of disease ', ' burden of illness ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' twenty-one year old ', ' age 21 years ', ' age 21 ', ' 21 year old ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' nongenetic ', ' non-genetic ', ' biorepository ', ' biobank ', ' sharing data ', ' DNA Repository ', ' ']",NCI,BOSTON UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CAMPUS,UM1,2015,3661817,0.10153798357887506
"Anti-CXCL13 mAb to mitigate prostate cancer health disparities ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The most common metastatic site for hormone refractory prostate cancer (HRPC; PCa) is bone. While docetaxel can prolong the overall survival in patients with metastatic HRPC, current treatments do not provide a cure. Further complicating the matter, HRPC is a disease that affects a variety of patients differently, which can be problematic for physicians to provide standardized treatments with similar outcomes. African Americans (AAs) with HRPC can experience significantly lower rates of overall survival, faster rates of tumor progression and poor responses to chemotherapy than compared to European Americans (EAs) with this disease. Unfortunately, the mechanisms behind these PCa health disparities have not been well studied. To address these issues, investigators at Morehouse School of Medicine and JYANT Technologies, Inc. have identified a critical pathway that controls PCa cell growth, metastasis (to bone), and docetaxel response rates - the CXCL13:CXCR5 axis. We previously reported the functional expression of CXCR5 by PCa cell lines and that CXCL13 (the only ligand for CXCR5) can mediate PCa cell growth, migration, invasion, and docetaxel resistance. In addition, we reported significantly higher CXCR5 expression by prostate tumors from patients with advance PCa, than compared to normal matched or benign disease tissues. Our exciting preliminary data show CXCR5 expression by prostate tumors resected from AA patients are significantly (as much as two-fold) higher than EAs with the same disease stage. Previously, we demonstrated serum CXCL13 levels are significantly higher in PCa patients and this ligand is secreted by bone marrow endothelium under conditions found during this disease. Finally, we show that our murine anti-human CXCL13 antibody both prevented and shrunk HRPC xenografts established in femurs of SCID mice. In consideration of these findings, JYANT Technologies seeks to develop a novel humanized anti-human CXCL13 monoclonal antibody (CXCL13 HuMAB) for the treatment of HRPC and to address the disparities in clinical and therapeutic outcomes with this disease. To complete these objectives, we will use clinically relevant mouse models of osteolytic and osteoblastic HRPC as well as docetaxel-resistant xenografts to carry out the following aims: Aim One will ascertain the immunogenicity, using naïve B6 mice, and the PK/PD profile of CXCL13 HuMAB, in SCID mice bearing luciferase-expressing osteolytic (PC3-luc) and osteoblastic (C4-2b-luc) xenografts in femurs. Aim Two will determine the systemic and immune toxicity as well as the efficacy of CXCL13 HuMAB to inhibit prostate tumor growth and docetaxel-resistance in bone, using SCID mice challenged in femurs with hormone refractory (PC3-luc and C4-2b-luc) and/or docetaxel-resistant (PC3R-luc and C4-2bR-luc) PCa cell lines.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: To date, there is no cure for metastatic HRPC; chemoresistance, toxicities, and variable response rates hinder the use of many drugs (e.g., docetaxel) to treat PCa. Using clinically relevant HRPC models, this study tests the utility of targeting the CXCL13:CXCR5 axis, which is highly elevated in AAs than compared to EAs with HRPC.            ",Anti-CXCL13 mAb

"Race - adiposity interactions regulate mechanisms determining insulin sensitivity DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Project summary. Insulin resistance plays a major role in the etiology of chronic metabolic diseases, many of which differ with race/ethnicity. Previous studies using mainly indirect methods suggest that insulin sensitivity is lower in African-Americans (AA) vs. European-Americans (EA). However, results are discrepant, differing with the method used and the obesity status of the participants. Our preliminary data using the reference standard glucose clamp indicate that in lean individuals, insulin sensitivity i lower among AA, while in obese individuals, insulin sensitivity is higher among AA. We hypothesize that this race/body mass index (BMI) interaction may be explained in part by significantly lower visceral/hepatic adiposity in AA that results in less impairment of insulin sensitivity among obese AA individuals. Conversely, we hypothesize that inherently greater oxidative stress impairs insulin sensitivity in AA, explaining lower insulin sensitivity in lean AA vs. EA. This is based on our preliminary data indicating that a circulating marker of cumulative oxidative stress was significantly associated with insulin-stimulated glucose disposal in AA but not EA, and that production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in vitro was greater in AA vs. EA. We propose to test these hypotheses by prospectively comparing skeletal muscle and hepatic insulin sensitivity in healthy lean, overweight, and obese AA and EA using the hyperinsulinemic isoglycemic glucose clamp with tracer-labeled glucose. Analysis of ancestral genetic admixture will permit simultaneous assessment of the contribution of ancestry to main outcomes. With our first aim, we will test the hypothesis that a significant race-by-BMI interaction will be detected n skeletal muscle and hepatic insulin sensitivity, such that at low BMI AA are less insulin sensitive but at high BMI AA are more insulin sensitive, when compared with EA. The second aim will test the hypothesis that at high BMI, AA will have greater hepatic and skeletal muscle insulin sensitivity due to lower hepatic and visceral fat. The third aim will test the hypothesis that greater bioenergetic efficiency and ROS production within skeletal muscle mitochondria will be associated with lower skeletal muscle insulin sensitivity in lean AA. A secondary aim will test the hypothesis that skeletal muscle and hepatic insulin sensitivity are better associated with adipokines, cytokines, lipids, blood pressure, and vascular function in EA than in AA. Relevance. Results from this study elucidating why the underlying pathophysiology of insulin resistance differs with genetic background may guide development of personalized treatment strategies with implications for several chronic metabolic diseases (e.g., type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and cancer). PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We will test the hypothesis that the underlying pathophysiology of insulin resistance differs with genetic background. We predict that insulin resistance will occur secondary to visceral and hepatic obesity in European Americans, but is driven by inherently greater oxidative stress in African Americans. Results from this study may guide the development of individualized treatment strategies for prevention and reversal of insulin resistance, and may have implications for a race-specific role of insulin resistance in the etiology of chronic metabolic disease.",Race - adiposity interactions regulate mechanisms determining insulin sensitivity,8892171,R01DK096388,"['adulthood ', ' adult human

"Epigenetic and Biobehavioral Determinants of Preterm Birth in Black Women DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Preterm birth (PTB, birth prior to 37 weeks' gestation) is a leading cause of infant mortality. Of the known risk factors for PTB, among the strongest is African American (AA) race. Compared to Caucasians, AA women have more than 1.5 times the risk of PTB (16.8% vs. 10.5%). The proposed research will investigate whether specific bio behavioral factors linked to PTB influence the epigenetic regulation of genes to promote PTB in AA women. This research will contribute to a bio psychosocial understanding of within-race risk for PTB, providing insight into important risk and protective factors relevant to AA women. The proposed research is consistent with frameworks for eliminating racial disparities, which recognize the need to study risks within-race as a vital first step, and is congruent with the National Institute of Minority Health and Health Disparities goal of promoting understanding of the biological mechanisms involved in conditions that disproportionately affect health disparity populations.  To evaluate the hypothesis that epigenetic mechanisms mediate the relationship between specific bio behavioral factors and PTB for AA women, the proposed study will leverage bio behavioral and biologic data from an on-going longitudinal study of preterm birth in AA women (R01 NR014800) that is enrolling a socioeconomically diverse cohort of H 960 pregnant AA women and collecting data during prenatal care appointments (at 10-14 and 26-30 weeks' gestation) and at delivery. Using a nested case-control approach, cases are designated as those who experience PTB (an estimated 125 cases) and controls as those who experience a term birth. Building from this study design, we will: (1) characterize PBMC DNA methylation and RNA expression patterns over the course of pregnancy among AA women who deliver preterm and at term; (2) identify bio behavioral factors - including nutritional status, stress, an reproductive tract infections - that influence patterns of peripheral DNA methylation and RNA expression; (3) evaluate associations between PTB and both DNA methylation and RNA expression among AA women that are independent of the bio behavioral factors and (4) determine whether these epigenetic differences can be detected in the second and/or third trimester. The success of this research is supported by a multidisciplinary collaboration of clinicians, basic and translational scientists representing expertise in obstetrical outcomes and maternal-child health, genetics and epigenetics, nutrition, stress, epidemiology and informatics; the overlap of key personnel for the proposed study and the on-going R01 'Bio behavioral Determinants of the Micro biome and Preterm Birth for Black Women'; and support from Emory University's Clinical and Translational Science Institute (CTSA award # NIH UL1TR000454). Finally, Atlanta is home to AA women of broad socioeconomic status who are served by Emory's affiliated delivery hospitals, allowing for sufficient variation in the bio behavioral factrs under study to distinguish independent and interactive effects on DNA methylation and, ultimately, on the risk of PTB. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Preterm birth (PTB) occurs at unacceptably high rates in the United States, with African American (AA) women disproportionately affected. The proposed research will investigate whether bio behavioral factors linked to PTB influence the regulation and expression of genes to promote PTB in AA women. We will focus our investigation on bio behavioral factors that affect the inflammatory pathway - including poor nutritional status, stress and reproductive tract infections -- as, according to the Institute of Medicine, inflammation predominantly contributes to the excessive rates of PTB experienced by AA women. This research will contribute to a bio psychosocial understanding of within-race risk for PTB, providing insight into important risk and protective factors relevant to AA women who disproportionately experience PTB.",Epigenetic and Biobehavioral Determinants of Preterm Birth in Black Women,8890214,R01MD009064,"['Accounting ', ' Affect ', ' Appointment ', ' Award ', ' Biology ', ' Parturition ', '

"The African American Non-Resident Fatherhood Program DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application requests support for a study to examine the effects of an intervention aimed at increasing paternal involvement in African American non-resident fathers. Although the number of children living without fathers has grown nationally, the greatest percentage of children living apart from their fathers is found among African American (AA) families. Two thirds of all AA children in the United States live in households without their biological father. Father presence is important to the emotional, social and developmental wellbeing of children throughout the child's life. Positive father involvement is also important to the health and wellbeing of fathers themselves. Therefore, the purpose of this project is to test the Building Bridges to Fatherhood (BBTF) program, an innovative video-based fatherhood program developed with the guidance of a Fathers Advisory Council. The purpose of the BBTF program is to increase and sustain paternal involvement among AA fathers and their young children (2-5 years). The BBTF program will be tested in a randomized clinical trial among 180 families of young children across 2 large predominantly African American areas (west-side and south-side) of a large Midwestern city. Fathers will be recruited via key informants from multiple community sites (i.e. churches, barbershops, community centers, schools, day care centers, local business establishments, dry cleaners, and sports venues) and randomly assigned to either the BBTF intervention or a Financial Literacy (FL) attention control group. Participants will be assessed at pre-intervention, 12 weeks and 24 weeks using self-report measures completed by fathers and the child's biological mother and participate in a booster session at 18 weeks. Dependent variables include: paternal involvement (material and in-kind [non-monetary] support and direct father/child interaction), father parenting competence (self-efficacy, satisfaction, parenting skills and knowledge), father psychological wellbeing (self-esteem, general and racial stress), father communication and problem solving, and father and maternal reports of child behavior and development (cognitive, emotional, and social). Further, father-mother relationship quality will be examined for its mediating effect on fathers' outcomes and paternal involvement. This application builds on our prior research: (1) refining an effective and culturally relevant parent training model so that it has enhanced social and contextual validity for African American non- resident fathers, and (2) providing a real-world intervention for fathers that has as its primary aim to facilitate and sustain father involvement i early childhood, before father estrangement becomes entrenched and intractable. This study is consistent with the NINR goals for the 21st century to address cultural and ethnic disparities in health promotion and intervention activities by developing innovative, culturally responsive, evidence-based interventions that are tailored to the individual. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  This application to test an innovative culturally relevant fatherhood program for increasing and sustaining paternal involvement among African American (AA) non-resident fathers is relevant to public health because over two-thirds of AA children live in homes without their fathers. Children with fathers who are continuously and actively involved have better behavioral, social, and emotional development and fathers who are continuously and actively involved with their children also fare better than fathers who are not. Thus, an effective fatherhood program holds great promise for improving the health outcomes and social well-being of children and fathers.",The African American Non-Resident Fatherhood Program,8913274,R01NR011182,"['Age ', ' Attention ', ' Behavior ', ' Parturition ', ' Birth ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Child Behavior ', ' Infant and Child Development ', ' Child Development ', ' childrearing ', ' Child Rearing ', ' Cities ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' Control Groups ', ' Experimental Designs ', ' Family ', ' Father-Child Relationship ', ' Father-Child Relations ', ' Fathers ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' Health Promotion ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' Hospitals ', ' Household ', ' newborn human (0-6 weeks) ', ' Newborns ', ' 0-6 weeks old ', ' Newborn Infant ', ' literacy ', ' Mothers ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' Parents ', ' well-being ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' Problem Solving ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' recruit ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' Research ', ' Research Support ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Schools ', ' self esteem ', ' Social Development ', ' social support network ', ' Social support ', ' Sports ', ' Stress ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Unmarried Father ', ' Child Support ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', ' Relative ', ' Relative (related person) ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' Businesses ', ' Competence ', ' Criminal Justice ', ' Mediating ', ' Outcome Measure ', ' base ', ' divorce/separation ', ' role model ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Biological ', ' psychological ', ' psychologic ', ' Randomized Clinical Trials ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' satisfaction ', ' Collaborations ', ' fatherhood ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Side ', ' Home ', ' Home environment ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' interest ', ' Visit ', ' meetings ', ' Church ', ' early childhood ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' skills ', ' Participant ', ' paternity ', ' father role ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' Emotional ', ' Modeling ', ' father offspring interaction ', ' father child interaction ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Future Generations ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Address ', ' Day center care ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Randomized ', ' NIH RFA ', ' Request for Applications ', ' Cognitive ', ' Characteristics ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' informant ', ' Behavioral ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' psychological outcomes ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' five year old ', ' age 5 years ', ' 5 year old ', ' Evidence based intervention ', ' demographics ', ' community setting ', ' intervention effect ', ' efficacy testing ', ' health equity ', ' ']",NINR,RUSH UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2015,521168,0.08037055017426363
"Integrated genomic analysis of racial disparities in endometrial cancer DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Although the incidence of endometrial cancer in African-American (AA) women is lower than in Caucasian (C) women, a striking racial disparity exists in endometrial cancer survival rates in the United States, with blacks having up to 30% worse survival rates than whites. Socio-demographic factors alone cannot account for this difference because differences in survival still occur when analyses are adjusted for black and white women by stage and by biologically aggressive (i.e., Type II) endometrial tumors. Uterine serous papillary carcinoma (USC), represents the most aggressive histologic subtype of endometrial cancer. This variant of endometrial carcinoma is up to three fold more frequent in AA women when compared to C women. On the basis of our recently published data on the genetic landscape of USC suggesting that genetic and biologic factors may underlie the racial disparity in survival rates and with the ultimate goal to develop novel, more specific and more effective treatment modalities for the diagnosis and therapy of USC so common in AA women, we propose the following: Aim 1: Identify through whole exome sequencing driver mutation candidates, loss of heterozygosity (LOH) patterns and copy number variations (CNV) in 200 USC samples and use bioinformatics strategies to perform a systematic assessment of genetic differences between AA vs C tumors, Aim 2: Evaluate miRNAs and mRNA expression differences in USC from AA and C and perform downstream analysis of pathways influencing disease in different groups of USC (i.e., c-erbB2+ vs negative and PIK3CA and CCNE1 mutants vs wild type) and Aim 3: Evaluate the biochemical properties of a subset of novel PIK3CA mutations and validate the c-erbB2/PIK3CA and CCNE1 pathways as novel targets for USC treatment using primary USC cell lines and targeted agents including trastuzumab and T-DM1 (i.e., mAbs targeting c-erbB2), AZD8055, GDC-0980 and CYC065 (i.e., a mTOR/PI3K/CDK inhibitors) in in vitro and in vivo assays. This proposal encompasses the first integrated analysis of genomic differences in USC developed by AA when compared to C women as well as the validation of the currently identified differentially expressed genes harboring key driver mutations as novel targets for USC therapy in minority. Relevance Definition and functional validation of key driver mutations and downstream signaling pathways differentially active in AA women harboring USC may be used to guide novel, highly effective targeted therapies against these highly aggressive tumors and, therefore, may have immediate clinical relevance on minority health. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Type II endometrial tumors such as uterine serous carcinoma (USC) are more commonly diagnosed in AA women when compared to C women, suggesting a genetic predisposition in black women to develop these biologically aggressive neoplasms. This proposal is designed to perform the first comprehensive analysis of genomic differences in USC developed by AA women when compared to C women. We will search for driver gene mutations, loss of heterozygosity (LOH) and copy number variations (CNV) and identify miRNAs and genes highly differentially expressed in USC developed by AA women when compared to C women. These studies will provide essential information for a better understanding of the genetic cause of the disparity in frequency of this diagnosis in AA women as well as the molecular basis responsible for the unfavorable prognosis more frequent in AA women relative to C women.

"Smart Walk: A Smartphone Physical Activity Program for African American Women ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Project Summary/Abstract National data show that 82% of African American (AA) women are overweight or obese, and 57% are obese. The health risks associated with the high prevalence of overweight and obesity among AA women is concerning, as these risks contribute to subsequent chronicities including cardiovascular disease (CVD) and type 2 diabetes (T2D). Physical activity (PA) is an established mechanism to manage weight and to improve myriad cardiometabolic disease risk factors. However, despite these benefits, only 36% of AA women meet the national PA guidelines. The low PA levels among AA women coupled with the high prevalence of overweight/obesity and other chronic disease conditions indicate the need for effective strategies to promote sustained high PA in this high-risk population. Technology-based platforms (i.e. Smartphone applications, Internet, social media) represent potential channels to deliver PA interventions to AA women. However, few researchers have explored these platforms to deliver culturally relevant PA interventions to AA women. This represents a missed opportunity given the established success of technology-delivered behavior change interventions and data suggesting that AA women use Internet, social media, and Smartphones at equal or greater rates than other race/ethnic groups. Over the past 5 years, the applicant of this proposed work has focused on filling this gap in the published research through the development and evaluation of technology-based approaches to increase PA among AA women. Trained as a behavioral scientist, his graduate and postdoctoral training has been focused in the social and psychological sciences, with a particular emphasis on the development and evaluation of theory- driven, culturally relevant technology-based PA interventions for AA women. The research and training proposed in the current application will extend and refine the candidate's PA and health disparities research trajectory through : 1) focused training in the physiological and biochemical mechanisms underpinning cardiometabolic disease risk factors responsive to PA intervention, and 2) evaluation of the effects of a culturall relevant Smartphone-delivered PA program (Smart Walk) to improve (baseline to 6 months) and maintain (7 months to 12 months) higher PA levels among AA women and improve cardiometabolic disease risk factors. The candidate has identified a supportive and stimulating research environment at Arizona State University to pursue the proposed research. Under the mentorship and Drs. Barbara Ainsworth, Colleen Keller, Glenn Gaesser, and Sonia Vega-Lopez, he will gain the necessary skills to establish himself as an independent behavioral and health disparities research scientist. In the K99 portion of the grant award, the applicant will gan explicit training in the physiological and biochemical mechanisms underpinning cardiometabolic disease risk factors responsive to PA intervention through didactic coursework and hands-on clinical laboratory experience. Training in this research area will complement his already strong social science background by allowing him to gain a deeper understanding of the physiological mechanisms associated with the health-enhancing benefits of PA. In the R00 phase of the grant award, the applicant will deploy the training acquired during the K99 phase and build logically upon his previous health disparities research trajectory by implementing a 12-month technology-based PA randomized controlled trial to evaluate the effects of a culturally relevant Smartphone-delivered PA intervention to improve (baseline to 6 months) and maintain (7 months to 12 months) high PA levels and reduce cardiometabolic disease risk among obese AA women. Seventy-six obese AA women will receive either a culturally relevant, Social Cognitive Theory-based PA promotion program delivered using a Smartphone application or a wellness contact control condition. PA, fitness, and cardiometabolic disease risk factors will be evaluated. Potential physiological mechanisms through which PA may impact cardiometabolic disease risk factors will also be explored. The proposed research and training activities support the immediate and long-term career goals of the applicant. The applicant's immediate career goal is to enhance his theory based PA research to include salient mechanisms that underpin PA effects on health (i.e. inflammation), towards the prevention and treatment of cardiometabolic disease risk factors among AA women. His long-term career goals are to: a) establish an independent, externally-funded program of research focused on the identification of effective strategies to promote sustained PA among racial/ethnic minorities, and 2) reduce the disproportionate burden of the cardiometabolic diseases among high-risk minority populations. The training and research activities proposed in the current K99/R00 application will assist the candidate in achieving these career goals, and advance PA and health disparities science.                 Project Narrative The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effects of a culturally relevant Smartphone-delivered physical activity intervention to improve and maintain high physical activity levels and reduce cardiometabolic disease risk among obese African American women. In a 12-month randomized controlled trial, 76 sedentary and obese African American women will receive either a culturally relevant, Social Cognitive Theory-based physical activity intervention delivered using a Smartphone application or a wellness contact control condition. Primary study outcomes include changes in physical activity and feasibility and acceptability of the Smartphone- delivered program; secondary outcomes include cardiorespiratory fitness, cardiometabolic disease risk factors, and potential physiological mechanisms through which physical activity may impact cardiometabolic disease risk factors.",Smart Walk: A Smartphone Physical

"Biobehavioral Determinants of the Microbiome and Preterm Birth in Black Women DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goals of this study are to elucidate the bio behavioral determinants that govern the structure and dynamics of the microbiome of African American (AA) women during pregnancy and to investigate whether microbiome composition is associated with PTB. The proposed study will contribute to a bio psychosocial understanding of within-race risk for PTB, providing insight into important risk and protective factors relevant to AA women who disproportionately experience PTB compared to any other US population. Our research is consistent with frameworks for eliminating racial disparities, which recognize the importance of studying potential risk factors within-race as a vital first step, and is congruent with the National Institute of Nursing Research goal of promoting and improving the health of individuals, families, and communities across the lifespan in a variety of clinical settings and within diverse populations. The study will prospectively enroll a socioeconomically diverse cohort of H 960 pregnant AA women and follow them through delivery, collecting data at three time points: twice via direct participant contact during prenatal care appointments (at 10-14 and 26-30 weeks' gestation), and once via review of the medical records from the delivery hospitalization. Using a nested case-control approach, we will designate as cases all women who experience PTB (an estimated 125 cases); an equal number of controls will be selected from among those who deliver a term infant. Using this study design we will: (1) Characterize the vaginal, oral, and gut microbiome during early and later pregnancy; (2) Examine whether bio behavioral factors linked with PTB - including biological indicators and experiences of stress, nutritional status, and health behaviors - influence the composition of the microbiome; (3) Determine whether the composition of the vaginal, oral, and gut microbiome in early and/or later pregnancy is associated with PTB; and (4) Investigate whether symptom patterns are associated with microbiomic milieu that increase the risk of PTB among AA women. The success of this research is supported by several factors. First, we have assembled a multidisciplinary collaboration of clinicians and basic and translational scientists representing expertise in infectious disease, obstetrics-gynecology, nutrition, genetics and epigenetics, stress physiology, epidemiology and informatics under the leadership of a nurse-scientist. Second, we have the support of the Atlanta Clinical and Translational Science Institute (CTSA award # NIH UL1TR000454); Emory's Interdisciplinary Training for Nurse Scientists Award (T32 NR012715), Emory's Reproductive and Perinatal Epidemiology Fellowship Award, and the Emory Integrated Genomics Core Laboratory. Third, Atlanta is home to AA women of broad SES, many of whom are served by Emory's affiliated delivery hospitals, enabling us to sample a diverse group of AA women, allowing for sufficient variation in the bio behavioral determinants under study to distinguish their independent and interactive effects on the microbiome and, ultimately, on the risk of PTB. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Preterm birth (PTB) occurs at unacceptably high rates within the United States, with African American women disproportionately affected. The composition of the microbiome during pregnancy may be a key mechanism for PTB. Our study will characterize the structure and dynamics of the vaginal, oral, and gut microbiome within the population most affected by PTB - African American women - in order to evaluate whether particular microbiome patterns are linked with PTB and to identify bio behavioral factors that impact microbiome structure and dynamics during pregnancy.",Biobehavioral Determinants of the Microbiome

"Germline Mutations in African American Families with Aggressive Prostate Cancer ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The mortality rate of prostate cancer (PCa) in African American (AA) men is two-folds higher that in Caucasian American (CA) men because they persistently present with a more aggressive form of the disease. However, the genetic risk factors contributing to aggressive PCa in AA men are poorly understood because this area of research has not been sufficiently explored. To address this deficiency, we have enrolled 20 AA families with hereditary PCa in southern Louisiana, including 15 families with aggressive PCa, and we have collected samples from 421 AA individuals with aggressive PCa. We performed exome sequencing on one affected and one unaffected man from a large AA family with aggressive PCa and identified 14 novel non-synonymous variants (ns-variants) that co-segregate with the PCa phenotype in this family. Therefore, we hypothesize that genetic analyses of AA families with aggressive PCa may facilitate the identification of the genetic factors conferring risk to aggressive PCa, and one or more of the 14 identified ns-variants may contribute to aggressive PCa risk in AA men with hereditary or even sporadic PCa. The objective of this study is to identify common germline mutations conferring PCa risk, specifically in AA families and individuals with aggressive PCa, thereby reducing the PCa-related health disparity. In this proposed study, we will: 1) Determine which of the 14 novel ns-variant(s) confers risk to aggressive PCa in AA families. We will genotype the 14 variants in affected and unaffected men to determine which variant(s) co-segregate with PCa in most AA families with aggressive PCa and which variant(s) have the highest frequency in affected individuals. These variants will be validated in an additional 25 AA PCa families provided by Johns Hopkins University. 2) Identify additional variants in the 14 candidate genes conferring risk to aggressive PCa in AA families. We will re-sequence the 14 candidate genes in all of the affected men in the 20 AA families to identify additional variants that may confer risk to aggressive PCa in AA families and AA individuals. 3) Determine the functions of the risk- variant(s) in prostate tumorigenesis. We will perform functional analyses of the risk-variant(s) including RNA and protein expression, cell growth rate, and anchorage-independent colony formation of the cells expressing risk-allele(s) to determine which variant(s) most strongly contributes to aggressive PCa risk in AA. The knowledge gained from this study will advance our understanding of the etiology of aggressive PCa, particularly in the AA population. Results from this proposal may lead to the development of diagnostic tools for early detection and early management of those at an increased risk of developing aggressive PCa to eventually reduce the PCa-related health disparities.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The mortality rates in African American (AA) men with prostate cancer (PCa) are the highest among all other ethnic groups because they persistently present with a more aggressive form of the disease; yet, the genetic factors contributing to a two-fold higher risk of aggressive PCa in AA men remain largely unknown. In this proposal, we aim to uncover significant evidence of the genetic factors contributing to aggressive PCa by analyzing 45 AA families with hereditary PCa using state-of-the-art sequencing methodologies with the long- term goal of reducing this health disparity in AA men.            ",Germline Mutations in African American Families with Aggressive Prostate Cancer,8877077,R21CA185213,"['Affect ', ' Cellular Growth ', ' Cellular Expansion ', ' cell growth ', ' Cells ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Family ', ' Genes ', ' Genotype ', ' Goals ', ' Incidence ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Louisiana ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Method LOINC Axis 6 ', ' Methodology ', ' Mortality ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' Second Primary Neoplasms ', ' Second Neoplasm ', ' Second Malignancy ', ' Metachronous Second Primary Neoplasms ', ' Metachronous Neoplasms ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' Area ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Hereditary Mutation ', ' Germline Mutation ', ' Germ-Line Mutation ', ' white American ', ' caucasian American ', ' Individual ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Genetic ', ' tool ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Prostatic Cancer ', ' Prostate Cancer ', ' Prostate CA ', ' Malignant prostatic tumor ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Prostate ', ' Malignant neoplasm of prostate ', ' Knowledge ', ' Frequency ', ' Frequencies (time pattern) ', ' Hereditary ', ' Inherited ', ' cancer risk ', ' early detection ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' novel ', ' Preventive strategy ', ' Prevention strategy ', ' Prevention ', ' Genetic analyses ', ' genetic analysis ', ' inherited factor ', ' genetic risk factor ', ' Sampling ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' protein expression ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' disease causation ', ' causation ', ' Causality ', ' Etiology ', ' Candidate Gene ', ' Candidate Disease Gene ', ' Address ', ' Cancer Cause ', ' Cancer Etiology ', ' Cancer Family ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Population ', "" man's "", ' man ', ' next generation diagnostics ', ' new diagnostics ', ' novel diagnostics ', ' therapeutic target ', ' high risk ', ' public health relevance ', ' prostate tumorigenesis ', ' prostate carcinogenesis ', ' exome sequencing ', ' risk locus ', ' risk loci ', ' risk genotype ', ' risk gene ', ' risk allele ', ' Risk-associated variant ', ' risk variant ', ' ']",NCI,LSU HEALTH SCIENCES CENTER,R21,2015,190530,0.06589078698821674
"MicroRNAs in African American Prostate Cancer ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Prostate cancer (PCa) is the most common cancer in men in the United States, which disproportionately affects African Americans (AA) with higher incidence, advanced disease and worse prognosis. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are non-coding RNAs that represent universal gene regulatory mechanism exerting its effect primarily by binding to 3'UTR of target and affect cell survival, proliferation, cancer initiation, development and metastasis. We recently reported differential expression of miRNAs in PCa tissues and body fluids. In this proposal, we present preliminary data on selected two miRNAs that are downregulated in age/disease matched African American (AA) when compared with Caucasian (CA) PCa tissues. We present preliminary data on modulation cancer cell growth, migration, anoikis, angiogenesis and modulation of EMT signaling. We have preliminarily identified several miRNA targets that may explain miRNA mechanisms in PCa progression. We report miRNA modulation of JNK1-Sp1 signaling which is known to modulate angiogenesis and metastasis. We hypothesize that differential loss of selected microRNAs in AA PCa deregulates an intricate signaling network, leading to aggressive phenotype. Further these miRNAs could be used as biomarkers to distinguish between indolent vs. aggressive disease (predominant in AAs) and serve as novel therapeutic targets. The specific aims of this proposal are: (1) to study the clinical significance of microRNAs and their targets in age/race matched PCa tissues and their adjacent benign regions and disease staged PCa TMAs; (2) to validate miRNA targets and delineate signaling mechanisms by generating miRNA gene deletions in AA and CA prostate cells by genome editing using [Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR associated (CAS) nuclease Cas9); (3) Investigate the role of microRNAs in experimental prostate carcinogenesis in vitro and in vivo by studying their gain and loss of function in AA and CA prostate cancer cells and in vivo by examining the effects on tumor growth and metastasis in an orthotopic mouse model. Recognizing miRNAs as basis of PCa pathogenesis, disparity and understanding their biological implications will significantly impact diagnosis and treatment development for aggressive PCa common in African American men.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposal will characterize selected microRNAs that are downregulated in African American (AA) prostate cancer (PCa) tissues when compared with Caucasian (CA) PCa. Their characterization will provide basic mechanistic insights into their role in prostate carcinogenesis, as biomarker and therapeutic targets. In the long term, these studies could have significant public health consequences, as involvement of these miRNAs in AA PCa will support their development as molecular targets and biomarkers for early detection, prevention and treatment of aggressive PCa common in AA men.            ",MicroRNAs in African American Prostate Cancer,8877003,U01CA194730,"['Affect ', ' Age ', ' Aggression ', '

"Using the Exome to Discover Genetic Determinants of Fibroids in African Americans DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Uterine fibroids affect 77% of women by menopause in the U.S. and account for $2.1 billion in healthcare costs each year. Until recently, tumor tissu and cell culture studies investigating fibroid growth have been the primary sources for understanding fibroid pathophysiology. Genetic analysis provides a powerful and cost effective tool to identify etiological and causal factors, especially since a genetic predisposition to fibrods has already been shown from twin studies. As much as 69% of risk is explained by genetic factors. Racial disparities also support a role for genetics in fibroid risk. African American (AA) women have earlier age-of-onset, more numerous and larger fibroids with a greater lifetime incidence compared to European Americans (EAs). Among existing genetic analysis approaches, whole exome genotyping (WEG) is the most cost-effective and efficient compared to genome-wide association studies (GWAS) that focuses on common variants that may themselves not be causal. In this study, we will take advantage of a unique Vanderbilt resource, the BioVU DNA databank. BioVU has over 141,221 adult DNA samples linked to electronic medical records (EMR). From BioVU we have identified 3,535 AA subjects (612 cases and 2,923 controls) who meet our stringent inclusion criteria. Studies have shown that many women with fibroids are asymptomatic and without imaging as many as 51% of women may be misclassified. As a result, we have required pelvic imaging for both cases and controls. 50,000 BioVU subjects are currently being genotyped using Illumina's Exome Chip as part of an institutional initiative, including all AAs (completion summer of 2013). Our first aim is to conduc a WEG study of fibroids using AA BioVU subjects (n = 3,535) using logistic regression (common variants) and gene-based allele collapsing approaches (rare variants) to evaluate associations of SNPs with fibroids risk. Our second aim is to resequence exomes at 50X using AA BioVU extreme fibroid cases (n = 75) and controls (n = 75) to discover novel coding variants associated with fibroid risk. Extreme cases are those with youngest fibroid onset and largest number and size of fibroid. Extreme controls are the oldest subjects with no recorded history of fibroids. Aim 2 will allow us to validate variants discovered in Aim 1, as well as to identify nove variants not included on the genotyping chip. The NIH, NICHD, AHRQ, and the OWHR have made understanding the mechanisms underlying fibroid risk research priorities. This study is the largest and first whole exome experiment of fibroid among AAs. Immediate availability of samples and resources allow us to accomplish these R01 scope Aims within the budgetary and time constraints of an R03. These aims will allow us to identify novel variants associated with fibroids using two distinct approaches (WEG and exome resequencing using extreme phenotypes) and will lay the ground work for a future R01 examining rare variants associated with fibroids across racial groups. Our proposed study will fundamentally change knowledge about fibroids and lead to breakthroughs in understanding mechanisms in fibroid formation. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Even though fibroids are heritable and known to disproportionately impact African Americans (AAs), the literature about the genetics of fibroids remains meager. Little progress has been made relative to other complex diseases, despite federal research agencies including the NIH, NICHD, and AHRQ recognizing fibroids among their priority women's health topics. Our extremely cost-effective and efficient whole exome association study that includes the first exome genotyping experiment among AAs and exome resequencing using an extreme phenotype approach for targeted fine mapping will be a crucial contribution to knowledge about the role of rare variation and genetics in fibroid risk.",Using the Exome to Discover Genetic Determinants of Fibroids in

"Georgia CaRes DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Georgia Regents University (GRU) has been home to Georgia's only NCI MB-CCOP since 2004. With its affiliate site, University Cancer & Blood Center (UCBC), GRU has enrolled nearly 800 patients to NCI clinical trials: 39% of them African American (AA) and other minorities, with accrual split between treatment trials (48%) and prevention and control trials (52%). Building on this successful track record, GRU Cancer Center (GRUCC) and UCBC are joining forces with Morehouse School of Medicine (MSM) and the Jiann-Ping Hsu College of Public Health (JPHCOPH) at Georgia Southern University to become the NCORP Minority/Underserved Community Site for Georgia. The need to sustain and grow an NCORP that focuses on minority and underserved populations in Georgia is great. Georgia has some of the nation's worst cancer disparities, particularity between African Americans (AA) and Caucasians (CA) and between rural and urban populations. The disparities are glaring for some of the most common cancers. Not only do AA men in Georgia have the highest rate of prostate cancer among AA men in the country, they are almost twice as likely to be diagnosed with the disease as CA men in Georgia and three times as likely to die from it. In Georgia, AA women die of breast cancer 25% more often than CA women, and AA die of colorectal cancer 45% more than CA. The Specific Aims of the proposed NCORP M/U site for Georgia are to: 1) Implement a NCORP M/U Site for Georgia that meets or exceeds all NCI requirements; 2) Contribute to the design, conduct and translation of the national NCORP research agenda, particularity studies that pertain to minority and underserved populations; and 3) expand patient and provider access to-and enrollment/participation in-cancer prevention, control, imaging, treatment and screening/post-surveillance clinical trials and cancer care delivery research throughout Georgia, particularly for minority and underserved populations in urban and rural settings. Key sub-aims include the implementation of a leadership development program to cultivate the next generation of NCORP investigators and leaders and engagement to key stakeholders and community partners in all aspects of the NCORP research agenda. Georgia represents a unique opportunity to pursue research directed towards cancer disparities and to affect  minority and underserved communities' accrual to clinical trials and cancer care delivery research studies.  30% of its 9.9M residents are AA (vs. 12% in the U.S.) and 75% of its counties are rural, most of them  medically underserved. Georgia's NCORP M/U Site will ensure greater access to state-of-the-art cancer care across the state and broader translation of research findings into public health and clinical practice.",Georgia CaRes,9114546,UG1CA189851,"['Affect ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Feedback ', ' Health ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Health Personnel ', ' Health Services ', ' Institutes ', ' Leadership ', ' male ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Mentors ', ' Patients ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Primary Care ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Public Health ', ' Public Health Practice ', ' Research ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Research Design ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' rural health clinic ', ' Rural Health Centers ', ' Rural Population ', ' school of medicine ', ' medical college ', ' medical schools ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' Translations ', ' Universities ', ' Urban Population ', ' Caucasians ', ' white race ', ' Occidental ', ' Caucasoid Race ', ' Caucasoid ', ' Caucasian Race ', ' Caucasian ', ' Woman ', ' County ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Specialist ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Ensure ', ' Rural ', ' Oncologist ', ' Glare ', ' cancer prevention ', ' Prostatic Cancer ', ' Prostate Cancer ', ' Prostate CA ', ' Malignant prostatic tumor ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Prostate ', ' Malignant neoplasm of prostate ', ' blood cancer ', ' Malignant Hematopoietic Neoplasm ', ' Hematopoietic and Lymphoid Neoplasms ', ' Hematopoietic and Lymphoid Cell Neoplasm ', ' Hematopoietic Tumor ', ' Hematopoietic Neoplasms including Lymphomas ', ' Hematopoietic Malignancies ', ' Hematopoietic Cell Tumor ', ' Hematopoietic Neoplasms ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' Home ', ' Home environment ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Country ', ' interest ', ' meetings ', ' collegiate ', ' college ', ' care delivery ', ' Structure ', ' Prevention Research ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' research study ', ' Prevention ', ' anticancer therapy ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Treatment ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Therapy ', ' Cancer Treatment ', ' cancer therapy ', ' cancer care ', ' Provider ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Institution ', ' Clinical Oncology ', ' Preventive ', ' Health Sciences ', ' Cancer Center ', ' Cancer Control Science ', ' Cancer Control ', ' Community Oncology ', ' CCOP ', ' Community Clinical Oncology Program ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' translation research enterprise ', ' translation research ', ' Translational Science ', ' Translational Research Enterprise ', ' Translational Research ', ' Colo-rectal Cancer ', ' Colorectal Cancer ', ' Behavioral ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' work group ', ' working group ', ' treatment trial ', ' cancer research ', ' anticancer research ', ' underserved people ', ' under served population ', ' Underserved Population ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' next generation ', ' Minority ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' disparity in cancer ', ' cancer disparity ', ' medically underserved ', ' control trial ', ' clinical practice ', ' oncology program ', ' Morehouse School of Medicine ', ' Morehouse School of Med ', ' Morehouse Sch of Medicine ', ' screening ', ' Prevention trial ', ' institutional capacity ', ' leadership development ', ' underserved minority ', ' ']",NCI,AUGUSTA UNIVERSITY,UG1,2016,751518,0.04973593519822035
"Sustaining palliative care to drug users with HIV/AIDS & health disparities DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): With increasing HIV survival and disability, informal (unpaid) caregivers play a growing role in the well-being of persons living with HIV/AIDS (PLHAs), especially as they enter end of life (EOL). Major goals of palliative care (PC) programs are to enhance the quality of life (QOL) of patients and their families, optimize function, and facilitate patient-family decision making on EOL treatment and discussion with medical providers. African American (AA) injection drug users (IDUs) experience disparities in prevalence and outcomes of HIV, in part due to their suboptimal healthcare and treatment adherence, and have low access to PC. The PI's research indicates most AA IDU PLHAs have caregivers and that they play a key role in their healthcare, treatment adherence and mental health. Our preliminary findings also suggest AA IDU PLHAs' caregivers have major risks for burnout and early cessation of care. Research is needed to understand ways to promote AA IDU PLHAs' HIV care and facilitate discussion and mutual understanding of their treatment goals and EOL care preferences with caregivers and providers to ensure their and their caregivers' QOL. The proposed mixed methods, longitudinal study is based on a social ecological, network resource framework and builds on the study team's novel HIV caregiving research program, pediatric HIV PC clinic program, and research on patient- provider communication on EOL issues. Caregiving can be highly stressful, and costly of financial and social resources, which can lead to caregiver burnout (e.g., role overload, captivity) and cessation of care. Major risks of care cessation include recipients' late stage illness, intensive (personal) care needs, substance abuse and other problem behaviors, and caregivers' lack of social support. Preliminary findings from our recent Beacon study suggest caregivers of were highly involved in AA IDU PLHA care recipients' medical adherence and had a dearth of social support. And 79% of recipients reported pain, which was associated with illicit drug use, posing a potential threat to their caregiving relationship and QOL. The proposed study expands our caregiving research program into new areas of PC, EOL, and caregiver resiliencies. The study will comprise four long- term follow-up assessment of the Beacon sample (up to six years) and new recruits (n=400 dyads, half from Beacon); and a qualitative component exploring PC, EOL, and caregiving resiliencies from caregiver and recipient perspectives. The study will address some of the methodological and theoretical limitations of prior caregiving and PC research. The findings will inform the team's later development of interventions to promote AA IDU PLHA caregivers' and recipients' sustained care and QOL by potentially intervening at the dyad, support network or medical provider level. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Relevance Caregivers provide a range of assistance critical to PLHAs' palliative care (PC) and quality of life (QOL). Research is needed to understand how to sustain caregiving and caregivers' QOL through end of life (EOL) of vulnerable African American, injection drug using (IDU) PLHAs. The study represents an obvious next step to the new team's PC, EOL, and caregiving research by identifying barriers and facilitators to sustained HIV care, its impact on QOL, and implications to adult HIV PC practice.",Sustaining palliative care to drug users with HIV/AIDS & health disparities,9013413,R01NR014050,"['Acquired Immunologic Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immuno-Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency ', ' AIDS ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Affect ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Elderly ', ' Communication ', ' Decision Making ', ' Diamorphine ', ' Diacetylmorphine ', ' Heroin ', ' Information Disclosure ', ' Disclosure ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Expenditure ', ' Family ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' long-term study ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' Memory ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Methods ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' mortality ', ' Persons ', ' Painful ', ' Pain ', ' comfort care ', ' Palliative Treatment ', ' Palliative Therapy ', ' Palliative Care ', ' Patients ', ' well-being ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' Play ', ' QOL ', ' Quality of life ', ' recruit ', ' active recruitment ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' Research ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Rewards ', ' Risk ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' personal care ', ' Self Care ', ' social support network ', ' Social support ', ' Testing ', ' Translations ', ' Measures ', ' Caregivers ', ' Care Givers ', ' Intensive Care ', ' Outcome Assessment ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' depressive symptoms ', ' depressive ', ' depression symptom ', ' Emotional Depression ', ' Health Benefit ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Uncertainty ', ' doubt ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' Area ', ' Medical ', ' Ensure ', ' disability ', ' drug use ', ' Drug usage ', ' behavioral problem ', ' Problem behavior ', ' Collaborations ', ' Staging ', ' Drug user ', ' cognitively impaired ', ' cognitive loss ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Clinic ', ' burn-out ', ' burnout ', ' Lifestyle-Related Problem ', ' Lifestyle-Related Disorder ', ' Behavior-Related Problem ', ' Behavior-Related Disorder ', ' Lifestyle-related condition ', ' persons who inject drugs ', ' people who inject illicit drugs ', ' people who inject drugs ', ' PWID ', ' Injection Drug User ', ' Injecting drug user ', ' experience ', ' novel ', ' member ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' HIV/AIDS problem ', ' HIV/AIDS ', ' AIDS/HIV ', ' AIDS/HIV problem ', ' substance abuse ', ' abuse of substances ', ' Substance abuse problem ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' stigma ', ' social stigma ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' highly active anti-retroviral therapy ', ' HAART ', ' Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy ', ' Provider ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' therapy adherence ', ' Address ', ' end-of-life ', ' end of life ', ' Adherence ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' care giving ', ' caregiving ', ' care preference ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' therapy development ', ' treatment development ', ' intervention development ', ' develop therapy ', ' clinical care ', ' evidence base ', ' pediatric human immunodeficiency virus ', ' pediatric HIV ', ' treatment adherence ', ' clinical practice ', ' cocaine use ', ' injection drug use ', ' support network ', ' care recipients ', ' care receiver ', ' informal care ', ' caregiving research ', ' research on caregiving ', ' care giving research ', ' illicit drug use ', ' ']",NINR,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R01,2016,454007,0.03508098508929571
"The role of exRNA in  Health Disparity of Prostate Cancer ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The mortality rate of PCa in African American (AA) is 2-3 times higher than Caucasian American (CA) men. A number of studies demonstrated that high incidence and mortality rates of PCa among AA men might originate from genetic, lifestyle or socioeconomic-related factors. Molecular mechanisms underlying these discrepancies are still under investigation. The process of tumor growth and metastasis mainly depends on the ability of cancer cells to communicate with each other and with neighboring cells. Microvesicles (MVs) are small cell-derived extracellular bodies secreted by normal and tumor cells and they promote cell-cell communication. The cargo of these vesicles carries microRNAs mRNAs and proteins to recipient cells. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding regulatory RNAs that negatively regulate gene expression at the post-transcriptional level. However, their real physiological function of extracellular RNA (exRNA) including miRNAs, in PCa racial disparities is still obscure. Our previous study demonstrates that MV-derived onco-miRNAs contribute to PCa progression through transformation of patient-derived adipose stem cells. Importantly, we identified selective expression of a subset of putative onco-miRNAs in prostate tumors. Thus, altered onco-miRNAs expression could be a determinant factor for high PCa progression and mortality rates among AA men. Thus, we hypothesize that ""onco-miRNAs derived by prostate tumor microvesicles are critical to PC progression in AA men of PCa"". This hypothesis will be tested by the following specific aims; 1) To investigate the expression levels of putative (miR-3613-3p and miR-3680-3p) and known (miR-125b, miR-130b and miR-155) onco-miRNAs in normal and PCa cells derived from AA and CA men as well as in human PCa specimens and 2) To examine the functional significance of these onco- miRNAs in mediating disease progression. This study is innovative, because it capitalizes on discovery of new functional roles for this putative onco-miRNAs and their relevant cellular target genes in PCa health disparity. Our expectation from this proposal is to understand the pleiotropic functions of these putative onco-miRNAs and clarify their implications in health disparity. Our preliminary results show that not only the expression of putative miRNAs (miR-3613-3p and miR-3680-3p) was higher in PCa cell lines versus normal cells but also in AA vs. CA patients. However, the expression of miRNA target genes (i.e. tumor suppressor genes; PDCD4 & LATS2) was low on in vitro and on human tissue level suggesting these miRNAs have an oncogenic activity. Our long-term goal is to explore the functional significance and potential clinical utilities of these putative miRNAs, as biomarkers or therapeutic targets, to improve the outcomes and quality of lives of patients suffering from this disease. The outcomes from this study will certainly benefit the PI by giving him the opportunity to acquire research support, exercise him to become independent investigator and inspire him to apply for independent research-supports (i.e. R01). In addition, scientific findings that will be obtained from this proposal may lead to discovery of new prognostic markers or therapeutic targets in PCa and definitely will address the reasons why African American men have more aggressive disease than other minorities. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The mortality rate of prostate cancer (PCa) in African American (AA) is 2-3 times higher than Caucasian American (CA) men.

"IBD Gene Mapping by Clinical and Population Subset DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) are complex genetic disorders of the gastrointestinal tract, and a major health burden to patients and society. Tremendous progress has been made in dissecting IBD genetic etiology with identification of over 100 IBD loci by genome wide association studies (GWAS) but mainly limited to persons of European ancestry. The IBD Genetics Consortium (IBDGC) was established to facilitate multicenter collaborative studies of 6 Genetics Research Centers (GRCs) organized with a Data Coordinating Center (DCC). Our GRC at Johns Hopkins (JHGRC) has contributed to all IBDGC studies, led the largest genome wide linkage study in IBD and has led the IBDGC in a focus on African American (AA) IBD genetics (recruiting 88% of study subjects). We published the first large clinical characterization of AA IBD, serological associations of AA CD, clinical disparity studies, and most recently evaluation of admixture in AA CD, NOD2 the other four most well characterized CD genetic loci. More research in AA IBD is needed to understand the etiology of IBD in this ancestrally distinct, major American population, and also because diverse allelic and haplotype structure, and potential for unique functional variants will yield benefits for all populations. Additionally, a major challenge, especially for non- coding associations, is to know which SNPs are causative vs. those in linkage disequilibrium. Comparing association patterns across populations and evaluating function of associated SNPs that map to potential transcription factor (TF) sites active in IBD related cells will be beneficial. Our Aims in the next funding period are to (1) facilitate more comprehensive IBD gene discovery and evaluation in the AA population, and (2) to characterize the epigenome relevant to IBD and evaluate the most provocative non-coding SNPs across populations that map to potential TF binding sites for alterning genomic function. For the first Aim, we have enlarged our recruitment to12 satellite recruitment centers and will recruit 1000 AA IBD cases (with potential of 2600 cases) over the next five years. Immunochip IBD genotyping in AA's and a first stage AA CD GWAS IBD are underway, with facilitation of a 2nd stage ancillary R01 AA CD GWAS with Emory University planned for Year 3. We will perform an IBDGC AA UC GWAS of 1000 cases in year 4. We will compare IBD associations across ethnic groups to define most consistent non-coding SNPs. For Aim 2, we've assembled a team to help us characterize IBD relevant epigenomic annotation. We will purify immune cells from resected colon of patients, perform ChIP-Seq, and evaluate SNPs that map to TF binding sites using in-vitro enhancer assays in transfected cell lines. We will play a major role in all IBDGC activities, with our team of genetic statistical, genomic, immunology, and microbiome co-investigators, by our ability to obtain biological materials (including blood, biopsy, resection, and stool) and to recall patients for re-sampling, and by working cooperatively to maximize productivity of the IBDGC and its GRCs and DCC. According to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention, an estimated 1.4 million Americans suffer from Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD), a chronic debilitating disorder with no cure that includes Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. IBD ranks in the top 5 in prevalence for gastrointestinal disorders and represents a significant financial burden to society requiring a lifetime of medical care. This proposed research aims to determine the genetic variations that cause IBD which will aid in developing preventive measures, improving the quality of care with better treatments and educating patients through genetic counseling.",IBD Gene Mapping by Clinical and Population Subset,9146335,U01DK062431,"['Achievement Attainment ', ' Achievement ', ' Allelomorphs ', ' Alleles ', ' Engineering

"A Follow-up Study for Causes of Cancer in Black Women DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Black Women's Health Study (BWHS), the largest follow-up study for cancer in African American (AA) women, began in 1995 when 59,000 women (median age, 38) from across the U.S. enrolled. The BWHS has successfully followed participants with biennial questionnaires for data on incident disease and medical, reproductive, behavioral, psychosocial, and socioeconomic factors, linked addresses to U.S. census data, and are currently linking to air pollution data. Cancer diagnoses are validated by pathology data from hospitals and cancer registries. A DNA bio repository was established through collection of cheek cell samples from 26,800 participants. Despite initial slow accrual of cancers due to the young age of participants at entry, the BWHS has published extensively on risk factors for breast cancer; sufficient cases of lung cancer, colorectal cancer, and colon adenomas are now available. We propose to (1) continue follow-up/data collection; (2) establish a repository of 17,800 blood samples; (3) share data/samples in consortia projects. Continuation of the BWHS is highly desirable: 90% of participants are still cancer-free; follow-up has been successful and unbiased; the cohort has reached ages at which cancer incidence increases markedly; effects of exposures (e.g., severe obesity, racism) that are less common in other populations can be studied; the DNA has made valuable contributions to genetic cancer studies and is a major replication source for studies of breast cancer and related phenotypes in AA and other groups; the BWHS is a key contributor to consortia projects of rarer cancers in /\As; and the BWHS has been highly productive. Because levels of many blood markers are unfavorable among AAs and few studies of blood biomarkers in relation to cancer incidence have been carried out specifically in /\As, we propose to establish a repository of blood samples in the BWHS. A successful pilot study demonstrated the feasibility of our methods and participation was unbiased and similar to that in other large follow-up studies. The repository will increase by 60% the limited number of AA women with available blood samples being followed in U.S. cancer cohort studies. AA women continue to be disproportionately affected by many cancers. Continuation of the BWHS will permit continuation of its valuable contributions to understanding cancer etiology in this understudied group. A blood repository will greatly increase the value of the BWHS resource by permitting studies that help to fill the knowledge gap about the relation of biomarkers to cancer incidence and survival in AAs. The assessment of serious nonmalignant illnesses in the BWHS enhances the value of this resource at no cost to the study of cancer. Incidence and mortality rates of many cancers and other illnesses confinue to be disproportionately high  among AA women. The Black Women's Health Study, a follow-up study of 59,000 AA women, has  contributed important information on risk factors for cancer. Continued follow-up, the collection of blood  samples, and participation of the BWHS in collaborafive studies, including studies of rare cancers, will  produce valuable informafion on risk factors for cancers and other illnesses that burden AA women.",A Follow-up Study for Causes of Cancer in Black Women,9137637,UM1CA164974,"['abstracting ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' Air Pollution ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Blood ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cells ', ' Censuses ', ' Cheek ', ' Bucca ', ' Cheek structure ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Collection ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' DNA ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Genotype ', ' Health ', ' Hospitals ', ' Incidence ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Income ', ' Laboratories ', ' Medical Records ', ' Methods ', ' mortality ', ' Newsletter ', ' extreme obesity ', ' Severe obesity ', ' Morbid Obesity ', ' web based ', ' online computer ', ' On-Line Systems ', ' Online Systems ', ' Pathology ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' pilot study ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' Publishing ', ' Quality Control ', ' Questionnaires ', ' Research ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Ships ', ' Socioeconomic Factors ', ' Woman ', "" Women's Health "", ' Female Health ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Nonrespondent ', ' Blood Sample ', ' Blood specimen ', ' Specified ', ' Specific qualifier value ', ' Medical ', ' racism ', ' Link ', ' lung cancer ', ' Pulmonary malignant Neoplasm ', ' Pulmonary Cancer ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Lung ', ' Malignant neoplasm of lung ', ' Funding ', ' Collaborations ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Knowledge ', ' Scanning ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Source ', ' psychosocial ', ' Services ', ' success ', ' cohort ', ' Manuscripts ', ' Participant ', ' payment ', ' cancer genetics ', ' reproductive ', ' cancer registry ', ' neoplasm registry ', ' inherited factor ', ' genetic risk factor ', ' colon adenomatous polyp ', ' colon adenoma ', ' Colonic Adenomatous Polyp ', ' Colonic Adenoma ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' repository ', ' cancer diagnosis ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Large Intestine Adenoma ', ' Large Bowel Adenomatous Polyp ', ' Large Bowel Adenoma ', ' Colorectal Adenomatous Polyp ', ' Colo-rectal Adenoma ', ' Colorectal Adenoma ', ' Address ', ' Aliquot ', ' Breast Cancer Risk Factor ', ' Consent ', ' Data ', ' Cancer Cause ', ' Cancer Etiology ', ' Collection ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' nonmalignant ', ' Non-Malignant ', "" Nurses' Health Study "", ' Preparation ', ' Process ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' Shipping ', ' Colo-rectal Cancer ', ' Colorectal Cancer ', ' Behavioral ', ' cost ', ' years of life lost to disease ', ' years of life lost to disability ', ' disease burden ', ' burden of disease ', ' burden of illness ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' 21 year old ', ' twenty-one year old ', ' age 21 years ', ' age 21 ', ' Biological Markers ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' non-genetic ', ' nongenetic ', ' biobank ', ' biorepository ', ' sharing data ', ' DNA Repository ', ' ']",NCI,BOSTON UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CAMPUS,UM1,2016,3688399,0.10153798357887506
"Role of chemokine receptor in disparities associated with prostate cancer progres DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): African-American (AA) men have higher incidence of prostate cancer (PCa) than European American (EA). Furthermore, PCa in AA men is characterized by poor prognosis and dismal therapeutic outcomes. However, the mechanism/s associated with this health disparity remain unclear. Thus, identification of molecular mechanisms underlying such disparity is greatly desired in order to develop effective therapeutic and management approaches. It is becoming well appreciated that the chemokine-ligand axis is crucially involved in tumor cell trafficking and the development of organ-specific metastases, which is the major cause of PCa associated deaths. Our laboratory is the first to show that CC chemokine receptor 9 (CCR9) is selectively overexpressed in prostate cancers with negligible expression in normal prostate epithelia. Our exciting preliminary data show significantly higher expression of CCR9 in AA PCa cell lines and clinical samples compared to cell lines and clinical samples derived from EA. Furthermore, serum CCL25, which is natural ligand for CCR9 was higher in AA and PCa cell lines from AA (MDA-PCa-2b) and showed higher invasive and migratory potential as well as less response to chemotherapeutics in vitro compared to EA cell lines (C4-2b). Based upon these encouraging data, we hypothesize that CCR9-CCL25 axis underlies the poor prognosis and therapeutic outcome in AA men with PCa. To test our hypothesis, we propose to investigate the CCR9- CCL25 mediated mechanism associated with (i) aggressive cell phenotype in AA samples, (ii) homing and tumor growth in bone and the potential role of this chemokine-receptor axis in improving chemotherapeutic efficacy of clinical regimens in AA patients. We further aim to establish CCR9 as a biomarker for PCa progression and aggressive disease. To accomplish our aims, we have generated CCR9 anti-body against CCR9 and CCL25, which will be used to block this axis during in vitro assays to determine its role in migration, invasion, survival and chemoresistance; determining its potential role in metastasis as well as determining therapeutic efficacy of Docetaxel in vivo using AA and EA cell lines. In addition, siRNA duplexes or specific pharmacological inhibitors against CCR9 driven signaling molecules will be used to dissect the CCR9 mediated mechanism involved in migration, invasion, survival and chemoresistance. We are optimistic that the successful completion of these studies will define the role of this newly identified chemokine in PCa health disparity. Furthermore, it will enable the design and development of rational therapies directed against the CCR9-CCL25 to reduce/eliminate disparity in therapeutic outcomes. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Our goal is to determine the potential involvement of CC chemokine receptor-9 in disparity associated with poor disease and therapeutic outcome in African American patients. The outcomes of our study will (i) allow to determine the CCR9-mediated molecular pathways involved in PCa graveness and chemo resistant phenotypes, (ii) determine the CCR9-mediated mechanisms metastasis and (iii) establish the clinico- pathological significance of CCR9 in PCa health disparity. Our project will impact 1) development CCR9 expression as a new biomarker for aggressive disease and 2) therapeutic outcome of AA patients.",Role of chemokine receptor in disparities associated with

"Integrated genomic analysis of racial disparities in endometrial cancer DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Although the incidence of endometrial cancer in African-American (AA) women is lower than in Caucasian (C) women, a striking racial disparity exists in endometrial cancer survival rates in the United States, with blacks having up to 30% worse survival rates than whites. Socio-demographic factors alone cannot account for this difference because differences in survival still occur when analyses are adjusted for black and white women by stage and by biologically aggressive (i.e., Type II) endometrial tumors. Uterine serous papillary carcinoma (USC), represents the most aggressive histologic subtype of endometrial cancer. This variant of endometrial carcinoma is up to three fold more frequent in AA women when compared to C women. On the basis of our recently published data on the genetic landscape of USC suggesting that genetic and biologic factors may underlie the racial disparity in survival rates and with the ultimate goal to develop novel, more specific and more effective treatment modalities for the diagnosis and therapy of USC so common in AA women, we propose the following: Aim 1: Identify through whole exome sequencing driver mutation candidates, loss of heterozygosity (LOH) patterns and copy number variations (CNV) in 200 USC samples and use bioinformatics strategies to perform a systematic assessment of genetic differences between AA vs C tumors, Aim 2: Evaluate miRNAs and mRNA expression differences in USC from AA and C and perform downstream analysis of pathways influencing disease in different groups of USC (i.e., c-erbB2+ vs negative and PIK3CA and CCNE1 mutants vs wild type) and Aim 3: Evaluate the biochemical properties of a subset of novel PIK3CA mutations and validate the c-erbB2/PIK3CA and CCNE1 pathways as novel targets for USC treatment using primary USC cell lines and targeted agents including trastuzumab and T-DM1 (i.e., mAbs targeting c-erbB2), AZD8055, GDC-0980 and CYC065 (i.e., a mTOR/PI3K/CDK inhibitors) in in vitro and in vivo assays. This proposal encompasses the first integrated analysis of genomic differences in USC developed by AA when compared to C women as well as the validation of the currently identified differentially expressed genes harboring key driver mutations as novel targets for USC therapy in minority. Relevance Definition and functional validation of key driver mutations and downstream signaling pathways differentially active in AA women harboring USC may be used to guide novel, highly effective targeted therapies against these highly aggressive tumors and, therefore, may have immediate clinical relevance on minority health. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Type II endometrial tumors such as uterine serous carcinoma (USC) are more commonly diagnosed in AA women when compared to C women, suggesting a genetic predisposition in black women to develop these biologically aggressive neoplasms. This proposal is designed to perform the first comprehensive analysis of genomic differences in USC developed by AA women when compared to C women. We will search for driver gene mutations, loss of heterozygosity (LOH) and copy number variations (CNV) and identify miRNAs and genes highly differentially expressed in USC developed by AA women when compared to C women. These studies will provide essential information for a better understanding of the genetic cause of the disparity in frequency of this diagnosis in AA women as well as the molecular basis responsible for the unfavorable prognosis more frequent in AA women relative to C women. Finally, our results will provide essential information for the development of USC-specific therapies for preventing progression of advanced/recurrent disease after conventional surgery and

"African American Families Fighting Parental Cancer Together ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  In 2015, an estimated 340,000 parents of school age children will be newly diagnosed with cancer in the U.S. Parental cancer causes significant emotional distress in both diagnosed parents and children. African American (AA) adults experience a disproportionate burden of solid tumor cancers (e.g., breast, prostate, lung, and colon) which puts AA adolescents, a vulnerable population to begin with, at high risk for parental cancer related distress. Treatments have been somewhat successful for younger school age children (ages 7-12) of cancer patients but most treatment studies have included white middle class samples. Differences in attitudes, daily functioning and levels of distress among different ethnic and racial groups are well-documented, yet few culturally sensitive family intervention programs have been developed for AA families coping with cancer. Building on the PI's previous studies with AA families coping with parental cancer, we propose to conduct a randomized control trial to address this gap. We will of a culturally sensitive family-based intervention that targets the parent child relationship in AA families coping with the impact of solid tumor parental cancer. We will randomize 172 AA families coping with parental cancer to either Families Fighting Cancer Together (FFCT) or to parent psycho-education (TAU). Both manualized treatments include 5 bi-monthly sessions over 10 weeks. Subjects will be African American parents diagnosed for the first time in the past 12 months with Stage I, II, or III solid tumor cancers with at least one child between the ages of 12 and 18 living at home. Patients will be recruited from 3 large inner city cancer centers where there is an estimated 500 eligible low to middle income AA cancer patients a year. Family assessments will be done at baseline, post-treatment (10 weeks), 6-month, and 12-month follow-up. The proposed R01 research has the following aims: Aim 1: Compare the efficacy of FFCT to TAU in reducing depressive symptoms (CDI) and anxiety (RCMAS) in AA adolescents at post-treatment and long term outcome (6 and 12-month follow-up). Aim 2: Compare the efficacy of FFCT to TAU in reducing parental stress (PCQ: impact of illness on child/concerns about parenting) in AA parents at post-treatment and long term outcome (6 and 12-month follow-up). Exploratory Aims: 1. Explore whether moderators identified in Caucasian samples have a similar impact on treatment in AA samples. Specifically, we will examine: a) perceived level of group support, b) gender and age of adolescent, c) parent's marital status, d) SES, and e) stage of parent's cancer on the impact of treatment. 2. Explore whether changes in parent-child attachment and communication mediate the association between treatment and depressive symptoms (CDI) and anxiety (RCMAS) at 6 and12-month follow-up. Treatments to help adolescents cope with the impact of parental cancer are urgently needed, particularly those designed to reach low-income AA populations. Developing effective and transportable family-based interventions for this population could improve developmental adjustment to this significant life stressor at a critical point in the livesof adolescents.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  This project directly addresses cancer health disparities, which is relevant to NCI's mission. Treatments to help adolescents cope with the impact of parental cancer are urgently needed, particularly those designed to reach low-income African American populations.

"DIDACTIC: Dissemination and Implementation of a Diet and Activity Community Trial DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): South Carolina has some of the largest health disparities in the nation, and these are invariably more extreme in African Americans (AA) compared to European Americans. The chronic diseases that present the greatest public health challenges are now known to be inflammation related, and AAs tend to have greater inherent sensitivity to inflammation modulators. The proposed dissemination and implementation research is based on our efficacious intervention trial, ""Diet & Activity Community Trial: High-Risk Inflammation"" [R24 MD002769- 01], which focused on diet, physical activity, and stress reduction in collaboration with the AA faith community to reduce inflammation (referred to as the HEALS intervention). Extraordinary success in engaging the AA faith and greater AA community allows us to propose to disseminate and implement this intervention. We will ensure that the proposed dissemination and implementation research contributes to achieving our overall goal of reducing health disparities among AAs through the following specific aims: (1) Disseminate and implement the successful HEALS intervention in the AA faith community; (2) Evaluate and monitor the dissemination process for adoption, recruitment, retention, and fidelity to the HEALS intervention trial including testing the effect of the disseminated intervention using a variety of non-invasive measures that are relevant to overall health status, proven to be related to chronic inflammation in the intervention-phase trial, and that can (and will) be employed in a community setting; (3) Conduct a cost-effectiveness analysis of intervention dissemination and implementation to reduce health disparities in parameters associated with inflammation, from both budgetary and societal perspectives; and (4) Enhance the capacity of the target community to sustain the delivery of the evidence-based intervention and for community partners to engage in future research and programming to address health disparities through cultivation of a network of active church and community educators and leadership development activities. We will utilize a community-based participatory research approach to recruit 30 churches and 450 participants using a lay health, train-the-trainer model that decentralizes the research process and is suitable for dissemination and implementation research. We also will engage 30 ""mentor"" lay health educators (members of church education teams) who participated in the intervention trial phase to mentor and train newly recruited lay health educators for church education teams for the proposed dissemination and implementation research. We propose to use non-invasive approaches to measure key variables during dissemination and implementation. Cost-effectiveness analysis is an important component and will yield information on required inputs and outputs. The proposed research offers an opportunity to build upon a history of successful collaboration by disseminating and implementing evidence- based intervention with a focus on sustainability of efforts through capacity-building and leadership development to address health disparities in the AA community to address health disparities. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: African Americans (AA) in South Carolina have some of the most extreme health disparities in the nation and most of these can be traced to the effects of poor diet, low levels of physical activity, and stress in increasing chronic inflammation. We have developed an efficacious intervention for dissemination and implementation in partnership with and by our community stakeholders in the AA community to stem the high rates of inflammation rising tide of chronic disease rates in this community. The proposed research also will include assessing the costs associated with dissemination and implementation and focus on enhancing sustainability through capacity building and leadership development activities.",DIDACTIC: Dissemination and Implementation of a Diet and Activity Community Trial,9270101,R01HL122285,"['Adoption ', ' Awareness ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Communities ', ' Community Participation ', ' dietary ', ' Diet ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Family ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Level of Health ', ' Health Status ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' Inflammation ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Obesity ', ' Ownership ', ' Public Health ', ' recruit ', ' active recruitment ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' Research ', ' South Carolina ', ' Stress ', ' Testing ', ' Translations ', ' Universities ', ' Measures ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Chronic ', ' Phase ', ' Ensure ', ' Training ', ' Physical activity ', ' Trust ', ' European ', ' R24 ', ' R-24 Monoclonal Antibody ', ' MoAb R24 ', ' Monoclonal Antibody R24 ', ' cancer prevention ', ' Collaborations ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' Church ', ' American ', ' cancer risk ', ' success ', ' Participant ', ' member ', ' Interventional trial ', ' Intervention Trial ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' theories ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Health Educators ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Address ', ' cost-effectiveness analysis ', ' cost-effective analysis ', ' cost efficient analysis ', ' cost effectiveness analyses ', ' cost effective analysis ', ' Cost Effective Analyses ', ' Cost Effectiveness Analysis ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Cancer Control Science ', ' Cancer Control ', ' Community Trial ', ' Monitor ', ' Process ', ' Community Health ', ' Output ', ' cost ', ' implementation research ', ' dissemination research ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Evidence based intervention ', ' stem ', ' community based participatory research ', ' participatory action research ', ' community based research ', ' community based design ', ' therapy design ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' health training ', ' high risk ', ' community setting ', ' evidence base ', ' high standard ', ' inflammatory marker ', ' inflammation marker ', ' leadership development ', ' racial health disparity ', ' racial disparities in health ', ' Healthy Eating ', ' ']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA AT COLUMBIA,R01,2016,43890,0.12791418231308868
"The Impact of the Intrauterine and Early Childhood Environments on Neurocognitive and Metabolic Development in African American Youth: Focus on the Gut-Brain Axis PROJECT ABSTRACT  Environmental exposures during the critical prenatal and early childhood periods can result in lifelong health consequences. Mechanisms underlying these exposure-health relationships are complex, with exogenous exposures (such as chemical toxicants, infectious agents, diet) and endogenous processes (such as gene expression, inflammation and oxidative stress) activating metabolic pathways that lead to adverse health outcomes. Both adverse exposures and their health consequences disproportionately impact African American (AA) women and children, highlighting that health disparities begin in utero and are amplified postnatally. Among outcomes disproportionately experienced by AA children are preterm birth, neurodevelopmental deficits, and obesity – all linked to environmental exposures, yet poorly understood due to their etiologic complexity. Our team is currently investigating preterm birth and neurodevelopment through 18-months in relation to pre- and postnatal exposures to environmental toxicants and biopsychosocial risk factors in cohorts of pregnant AA women (R01NR014800, R01MD009064) and their infants (R01MD009746) and via our P50 Children's Center (P50ES026071) in collaboration with the Emory HERCULES Exposome Research Center (P30 ES019776).  Through ECHO, we propose to elucidate exposures and risk pathways that contribute to neurodevelopmental deficits and obesity in preschool aged AA children by: (1) Assembling an Atlanta ECHO cohort of ~440 AA socioeconomically diverse mother-child pairs by combining extant cohorts for whom the prenatal, perinatal, and early childhood environments are, or will be, characterized; (2) Completing the analysis and synthesis of data from the Atlanta ECHO cohort to characterize mother-child pairs in terms of prenatal and early childhood exposures (toxicants, stressors and neuroendocrine-immune activation, nutritional and metabolic status, microbiome and infections, bonding and interaction); epigenetic and metabolomic profiles; and perinatal outcomes (gestational age, size-for-gestation); (3) Testing cohort-specific hypotheses related to prenatal and early childhood exposures and neurodevelopmental outcomes and obesity in AA children at 2, 3, 4, and 5 years of age; (4) Participating in ECHO-wide consortium studies to identify risk and protective factors that moderate associations between environmental exposures, typical growth and development, and adverse child health outcomes. Our cohort's participation in the ECHO consortium will contribute to a biopsychosocial understanding of within- and between-race risk for adverse child health outcomes, providing insight into risk and protective factors relevant to AA families. The proposed research is consistent with frameworks for eliminating racial disparities, which recognize the need to study risks within-race as a vital first step, and is congruent with the National Institute of Minority Health and Health Disparities goal of promoting understanding of the biological mechanisms involved in conditions that disproportionately affect health disparity populations. PROJECT NARRATIVE Both adverse environmental exposures and their health consequences disproportionately impact African American (AA) women and children, highlighting that health disparities begin in utero and are amplified postnatally. AA children are more likely to experience preterm birth, neurodevelopmental deficits, and obesity – all linked to environmental exposures, yet poorly understood due to their etiologic complexity. Our goal is to use a sociodemographically diverse Atlanta ECHO cohort of AA mother-child pairs to study the mechanistic pathways through which early life exogenous and endogenous exposures contribute to neurodevelopmental deficits and obesity in preschool aged AA children in order to guide future prevention and intervention efforts.",The Impact of the Intrauterine and Early Childhood Environments

"Effect of sickle cell trait status on diabetes prediction in African Americans ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): African Americans (AAs) are disproportionately burdened by type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), with 19% of AA adults in the US affected as compared to 10% of whites. Because T2DM can be prevented or delayed with lifestyle and pharmaceutical interventions, it is crucial that we develop methods to identify high-risk persons before they develop T2DM. Risk prediction models are an effective tool for early identification of individuals who are at increased risk of developing T2DM. Available T2DM risk stratification tools however, were not developed using the current diagnostic criteria for T2DM which includes hemoglobin A1C (A1C) in the diagnosis of T2DM and current models have not been updated to include A1C as a predictor of T2DM risk. Further, of the existing diabetes prediction models, none have been developed in a population of AAs despite the fact that one of the strongest predictors of T2DM and one of the methods of diagnosing T2DM, A1C, varies substantially in AAs as compared to whites. Specifically, a number of studies have found higher levels of hemoglobin A1C (A1C) among AAs than whites that are not explained by differences in fasting glucose levels and AAs experience diabetic complications at lower values of A1C than whites. Current diagnostic guidelines, however, do not take into account known racial differences in the A1c-glycemia relationship. A potential explanation for these racial differences is the increased prevalence of sickle cell trait (SCT) in AAs as compared to whites. Sickle cell trait, a heritable disorder of the red blood cells that is more prevalent in African Americans, is hypothesized to further modify the A1c-glycemia relationship. Given that SCT may help to explain the biological differences in the A1c-glycemia relationship in AAs as compared to whites, we propose to, first, investigate the A1c-glycemia relationship in AAs with and without SCT (Aim #1) and, then, to develop (Aim #2) and validate (Aim #3) a series of risk prediction models which incorporate racial differences in A1c and examine the utility of incorporating SCT as a predictor of T2DM in order to better identify AAs at increased risk for developing T2DM. The proposed research will be carried out using existing data collected on AAs from two large cohort studies, the Jackson Heart Study and the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults study. This project will contribute to our understanding of the racial differences in the A1c-glucose relationship and will result in a series of externally validated T2DM prediction models that are sensitive to the differential prediction of A1C in AAs and that examine the potential role of SCT in T2DM prediction in AAs.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: African Americans are disproportionately affected by type 2 diabetes mellitus. Recent diagnostic guidelines recommend the use of hemoglobin A1C (A1C) in the screening and diagnosis of diabetes despite significant differences in the A1c-glycemia relationship in African Americans (AAs) as compared to whites.

"Brain-Gut Axis and Its Influence on Gestational Weight Gain ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Nearly two-thirds of US women of childbearing age are overweight or obese and nearly half, once pregnant, have excessive gestational weight gain (GWG). Excessive GWG is a significant predictor of poor obstetric outcomes and lifelong health risks for a woman and her infant. Obesity, which oftentimes worsens with each pregnancy and advancing age, increases obstetric and fetal complications. Inadequate GWG also poses risks to the mother and infant. African American (AA) women's rates of preexisting obesity and both excessive and inadequate GWG is higher than rates for women of other races, across nearly all BMI categories. Currently, the biobehavioral factors associated with excessive and inadequate GWG are poorly understood, yet in order to improve outcomes, are essential to identify, particularly for AA women. In the proposed pilot study, we will test the hypothesis that an underlying mechanism that contributes to within-race variability in GWG patterns is the structure and dynamics of the gut microbiome during pregnancy and, further, that the brain-gut axis is influenced by biobehavioral factors identified as important contributors to GWG. Increasing evidence supports that the gut microbiome greatly influences the bidirectional signaling between the gastrointestinal tract and the brain. Little is known about the intra-racial variations in the ut microbiome and the brain-gut axis. Even less is known about the gut microbiome across BMI categories, microbiome changes in pregnancy, and maternal behavior profiles linked with GWG. In the parent study, pregnant AA women are recruited among 18 to 35 year-old women during the 1st and 2nd trimesters. For the proposed sub-study an additional 3rd trimester prenatal encounter will be added for a subset of 80 women. This visit will occur between 35-41 weeks' gestation and will involve a 3rd rectal swab and completion of questionnaires on stress, mood, and diet. Nearly all data used in the sub-study will be from the 1st and 3rd trimester data collections. Upon analysis, a two-sample t-test or ANOVA will be used to compare the logarithm transformations of microbes. To compare the percentage of microbes within the same women from 1st to 3rd trimester time points, a paired t-test will be performed on the logarithm transformed percentages. For a more detailed trend analysis over the time points, a mixed effects ANOVA will be performed. Partial correlation analyses will be used to test for pairwise linear associations between the outcomes and interval and/or total GWG after adjusting for the biological and/or psychosocial factors. With the parent study underway, a strong research team is actively investigating the role of the microbiome in AA women's obstetric outcomes, particularly preterm birth. Ms. Edwards, the PI of this proposed study, is gaining vital experience and is poised to begin collecting data and analyzing results. As obesity and improper GWG are known contributors to racial disparities in birth outcomes and chronic conditions, the proposed study will serve as a step toward ameliorating health disparities in AA families.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: African American (AA) women have higher rates of both excessive and inadequate gestational weight gain (GWG) compared to women of other races -- both of which are significantly predictive of poor obstetric outcomes and lifelong health risks for the woman and her infant. The underlying biobehavioral factors associated with both excessive and inadequate GWG are poorly understood, yet are essential to identify, particularly for AA women, in order that effective interventions may be developed. In the proposed pilot study, we will investigate dysregulation of the ""brain-gut"" axis as an underlying mechanism contributing to within-race variability in GWG patterns.            ",Brain-Gut

"Molecular determinant of racial disparity in prostate cancer DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Significant disparity in the incidence and clinical outcome of prostate cancer (PCa) exist between African- American (AA) men and their European American (EA) counterparts. Despite this recognition, we have not made a major leap in our understanding of the molecular causes associated with such disparity. This proposal is built upon our strong preliminary data on a proto-oncogene, Myb, which has remained largely unexplored in PCa. Our novel findings demonstrate that 1) Myb expression is significantly elevated in AA PCa with greater overall incidence as compared to EA PCa, 2) low intensity expression of Myb is also detected in some of the benign prostate tissues (BPH) from AA patients, while no expression is detected in EA BPH, 3) AA PCa cell lines (MDaPCa-2b and RC-77/T) exhibit high Myb expression and significant resistance to hormone-depletion and docetaxel (DTX) toxicity, 4) AA PCa cells also display high growth, migratory and invasive potential, which is associated with Myb overexpression, and 5) Myb interacts with AR and modulates the expression of androgen-responsive gene, KLK3/PSA, suggesting their cooperative role in gene regulation. Based on these promising findings, we hypothesize that relative greater incidence and overall expression of Myb in AA PCa cells underlies their inherently greater propensity to metastasize and evade therapeutic intervention. To test this hypothesis, we are proposing three specific aims. In aim 1, we will investigate the role of Myb in PCa aggressiveness and therapy-resistance. Using luciferase-tagged, Myb-overexpressing or -silenced, paired AA and EA PCa cell lines, we will examine the functional association of Myb with PCa growth and metastasis, and their response to castration- and docetaxel- therapies in an orthotopic mouse model. In Aim 2, we will examine the functional consequences of Myb-AR interaction and identify their downstream consequences. We will specifically examine whether Myb has a role in AR localization and transcriptional activation. Furthermore, we will assess the effect of Myb on transcriptional reprogramming of AR by using state of the art RNA-Seq and ChIP-Seq approaches. We will determine the shared and independent targets of Myb and AR in PCa cells and examine if Myb alters AR target gene specificity. In Aim 3, we will determine the clinical relevance of Myb in racial disparity associated with PCa. We will perform immunohistochemical (IHC) analysis to assess Myb and AR expression and localization (cytoplasmic vs. nuclear) in PCa, adjacent BPH, and uninvolved normal tissues from both AA and EA cases. We will then examine their correlation (alone and in combination) with race, tumor grade, metastasis incidence, PSA levels, and patient's survival. Together, these studies will provide experimental, mechanistic and clinical evidence for the role of Myb in aggressive behavior and therapeutic- resistance of PCa, and support the association of Myb with observed racial disparity. In the long-term, the resulting information will be useful in reducing the racial disparities in clinical outcomes of PCa by establishing the clinical utility of Myb as a risk predictor and/or therapeutic target for effective disease management. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Main barrier in achieving progress toward racial disparities reduction in prostate cancer is our limited understanding of the underlying molecular basis. The proposed research will examine the functional and clinical significance of Myb overexpression in prostate cancer aggressiveness and therapeutic resistance, the two major reasons for the poor clinical outcome of African American (AA) patients. The outcomes of our study will allow distinction between clinically indolent and aggressive prostate tumors, and pave the way for novel target-based therapies, which will ultimately reduce the enhanced burden of prostate cancer on African American population and improve overall survival of prostate cancer patients.",Molecular determinant of racial disparity in prostate cancer,9045588,U01CA185490,"['Affect ', ' Aggression ', ' Aggressive behavior ', ' Therapeutic Androgen ', ' Androgenic Compounds ', ' Androgenic Agents ', ' Androgens ', ' Surgical Castration ', ' Castration ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cells ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Exhibits ', ' Gene Regulation Process ', ' Gene Regulation ', ' Gene Action Regulation ', ' Gene Expression Regulation ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Growth ', ' Health ', ' Therapeutic Hormone ', ' Endocrine Gland Secretion ', ' Hormones ', ' Incidence ', ' Ligands ', ' Luciferase Immunologic ', ' Luciferases ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' mortality ', ' tumor cell metastasis ', ' cancer metastasis ', ' Secondary Tumor ', ' Secondary Neoplasm ', ' Metastatic Tumor ', ' Metastatic Neoplasm ', ' Metastatic Mass ', ' Metastatic Lesion ', ' Metastasize ', ' Metastasis ', ' Neoplasm Metastasis ', ' Patients ', ' Play ', ' Prostatic Gland ', ' Prostate Gland ', ' Prostate ', ' Prostatic Neoplasia ', ' Prostate Tumor ', ' Prostate Neoplasms ', ' Prostatic Neoplasms ', ' protooncogene ', ' c-onc Proteins ', ' c-ONC ', ' Proto-Oncogene Proteins ', ' Cellular Proto-Oncogene Proteins ', ' Cellular Proto-Oncogene Products ', ' Cellular Oncogene ', ' Proto-Oncogenes ', ' Publishing ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Androgen Receptor ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Socioeconomic Factors ', ' Specificity ', ' thymus derived lymphocyte ', ' Thymus-Dependent Lymphocytes ', ' T-Cells ', ' T-Lymphocyte ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Tissues ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Prostate-Specific Antigen ', ' hK3 Kallikrein ', ' gamma-Seminoprotein ', ' Seminin ', ' Semenogelase ', ' Prostate Specific Antigen Preproprotein ', ' Plasma Prekallikrein ', ' Plasma Kallikrein Precursor ', ' P-30 Antigen ', ' Kallikrein 3 ', ' EC 3.4.21.34 ', ' Transcriptional Activation ', ' Transcription Activation ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Benign ', ' Clinical ', ' Malignant ', ' Malignant - descriptor ', ' insight ', ' Indolent ', ' European ', ' Gene Targeting ', ' docetaxol ', ' Taxotere ', ' docetaxel ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Normal Tissue ', ' Normal tissue morphology ', ' Prostatic Cancer ', ' Prostate Cancer ', ' Prostate CA ', ' Malignant prostatic tumor ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Prostate ', ' Malignant neoplasm of prostate ', ' Disorder Management ', ' Disease Management ', ' programs ', ' Frequencies ', ' Nuclear ', ' American ', ' receptor expression ', ' Toxicities ', ' Toxic effect ', ' novel ', ' nosology ', ' disorder classification ', ' disease classification ', ' Modality ', ' Pathogenesis ', ' Reporting ', ' intervention therapy ', ' Therapeutic Intervention ', ' response ', ' Sequence-Specific Posttranscriptional Gene Silencing ', ' RNAi ', ' RNA Silencing ', ' Quelling ', ' Posttranscriptional Gene Silencing ', ' Post-Transcriptional Gene Silencing ', ' RNA Interference ', ' Tissue Sample ', ' KLKB1 ', ' KLK3 ', ' KLK3 gene ', ' Data ', ' Receptor Signaling ', ' Cancer Patient ', ' Characteristics ', ' Molecular ', ' Process ', ' treatment resistance ', ' therapeutic resistance ', ' resistant to therapy ', ' resistance to therapy ', ' therapy resistant ', ' vector ', ' knockdown ', ' knock-down ', ' LNCaP ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' disparity in cancer ', ' cancer disparity ', ' Resistance ', ' resistant ', ' clinically relevant ', ' clinical relevance ', ' clinically significant ', ' clinical significance ', ' mouse model ', ' murine model ', ' therapeutic target ', ' tumor ', ' overexpression ', ' overexpress ', ' over-expression ', ' ChIP-seq ', ' chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequencing ', ' ChIP Sequencing ', ' transcriptome sequencing ', ' RNAseq ', ' RNA sequencing ', ' RNA Seq ', ' prostate cancer cell ', ' prostate tumor cell ', ' racial disparity ', ' race disparity ', ' disparities in race ', ' prostate cancer cell line ', ' disparity reduction ', ' reduce disparity ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH ALABAMA,U01,2016,314363,-0.042979467301040394
"The role of natural selection in SLE risk among African-Americans ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a severe autoimmune disorder that disproportionately affects African Americans (AA). Despite tremendous progress in elucidating its genetic etiology, research has been mainly limited to Caucasians, and little progress has been made in the identification of the specific disease-predisposing functional variations. Since the genome structure of a population is influenced by environmental pressures, and immune responses are particularly sensitive to the environment, it is possible that, throughout evolution, population-specific positive natural selection has led to a increased frequency of alleles that also predispose to autoimmune diseases like SLE. The goal of this project is to discover functional SLE risk variants in AAs while improving our understanding of the genetic basis of SLE that is due to natural selection. In order to accomplish this, Dr. Ramos will (1) identify regions of the genome that have been the target of recent positive natural selection in AA using two complementary population genetics statistics, (2) identify regions that are both predisposing to SLE and under selection, and (3) compute thorough functional annotation of the adaptive SLE risk variants to identify adaptive functional variation associated with SLE.  Dr. Ramos is a human geneticist in the Division of Rheumatology at the Medical University of South Carolina (MUSC). Her long-term career goal is to become an independent translational researcher in the genetics of autoimmunity. To facilitate her transition into an independent investigator, she seeks to further her skills and broaden the multidisciplinary nature of her research by training in population and evolutionary genetics, and bioinformatics and computational tools for the analysis of high-dimensional large-scale datasets. The environment for the success of Dr. Ramos is provided by (1) a mentorship team with the mentorship track record and varied expertise needed to support her project, (2) the availability of samples from unique African American and African populations and the established infrastructure to continue and expand studies on these populations, (3) support from the endowed Smart State Center in Inflammation and Fibrosis, the Multidisciplinary Clinical Research Center (MCRC) for Rheumatic Diseases in African Americans, and the growing Center Genomic Medicine, and (4) the Department of Medicine's robust mentorship program.  The identification of functional adaptive alleles that contribute to SLE risk in AA will contributeto an understanding of the role of positive natural selection in shaping SLE risk and vastly improve knowledge about the etiology of SLE in AA. These results will provide critical preliminary data supporting extramural applications to conduct focused analysis of sequence data, functional studies, expand to other populations and to other autoimmune diseases. The training will enable Dr. Ramos to achieve her long-term objective of becoming an independent investigator leading multidisciplinary teams conducting innovative genomic research in autoimmune disease. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Relevance This project is highly relevant to public health because African Americans (AA) has a higher prevalence and substantial risk of autoimmune diseases such as lupus, but has been largely understudied and the reasons for this health disparity remain elusive. This study will integrate evidence for positive natural selection with biological information to identify adaptive functional variation associated with lupus in AA. Identifying the genetic variations that cause lupus and understanding the role of natural selection in shaping its risk will greatly expand our knowledge about the etiology of lupus in AA and contribute to the development of interventions to reduce risk, improved diagnosis, targeted therapies, and improved outcomes.",The role of natural selection in SLE risk among African-Americans,9033817,K01AR067280,"['Affect ', ' Africa ', ' Allelomorphs ', ' Alleles ', ' aminoacid ', ' Amino Acids ', ' autoimmune disorder ', ' Autoimmune Diseases ', ' Autoimmune Status ', ' Autoimmunity ', ' Reactive Site ', ' Combining Site ', ' Binding Sites ', ' cultured cell line ', ' Strains Cell Lines ', ' CellLine ', ' Cell Line ', ' Chromatin ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' liability to disease ', ' Diathesis ', ' Disease susceptibility ', ' Environment ', ' Evolution ', ' Fibrosis ', ' Future ', ' allelic frequency ', ' Allele Frequency ', ' Gene Frequency ', ' Genes ', ' Population Genetics ', ' Genome ', ' human whole genome ', ' Human Genome ', ' Goals ', ' Haplotypes ', ' Health ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Incidence ', ' indexing ', ' Inflammation ', ' Island ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' systemic lupus erythematosis ', ' disseminated lupus erythematosus ', ' Systemic SLE -

"EPHA6 as a novel candidate driver gene in colon cancer ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our long-term objective is to elucidate the etiologic factors contributing to disparate colon cancer (CRC) outcomes in African Americans (AA), who continue to exhibit the highest CRC incidence and mortality rates in the U.S, even after accounting for socioeconomic and access to care factors. We recently reported the first comprehensive molecular characterization of AA CRCs, identifying a 15 gene-set as preferentially mutated in AA as compared to Caucasian CRCs. On a broader scale, it is likely that these ethnicity-associated differences in CRC mutational landscapes may have potential to impact on broader disparities in cancer behaviors. In particular, our study identified the, accounting for ~6% of AA vs. 0% of Caucasians CRC cases. EPHA6 belongs to a broader family of ephrin receptor tyrosine kinases that function as oncogenes or tumor suppressors depending on the cancer type. Intriguingly, our study was the first to implicate EPHA6 in CRCs, with the finding of recurrent mutations in this gene selectively in AA CRCs, suggesting a provocative ethnicity-associated difference in routes of colon carcinogenesis. Accordingly, the specific goals of the current proposal are: (AIM 1) To characterize EPHA6 signaling and determine the functional consequences of EPHA6 mutations identified in AA CRCs. We will use in-depth phospho-proteomics and gene expression profiling approaches in AA CRC cell lines engineered to express wild-type (WT) or mutant versions of EPHA6 to characterize EPHA6 signaling and to determine the molecular consequences of EPHA6 mutations. Furthermore, we will compare the phenotypic effects of WT vs. mutant EPHA6 on tumor growth characteristics, using in vitro and xenograft models; (AIM 2) To determine if loss of EPHA6 enhances susceptibility to colon cancer. We will use EPHA6 null mice to determine if loss of EPHA6 induces colon tumorigenesis in chemical carcinogen and Apc Min models of colon cancer. As a complementary approach to Aim 1, we will further dissect and refine EPHA6 signaling pathway, in vivo, using proteomics and gene profiling in EPHA6 WT vs. null mouse colons; (AIM 3) To determine the generality of EPHA6 mutations, and their association with clinically-relevant histopathological features. The AA CRC cases used in our initial study were derived exclusively from Northeast Ohio. Given the history of differing patterns of mass internal migration of AAs within U.S, we will re-sequence EPHA6 in AA CRC cases from Southwestern Texas, to test if EPHA6 is common CRC mutational target in geographically distinct AA populations. Furthermore, given that all of the EPHA6-mutant CRCs identified in our initial study arose in proximal colon, we will re-sequence EPHA6 in a fresh set of AA CRCs from Northeast Ohio to determine if EPHA6-mutant CRC cases define a distinct, morphologically recognizable, subset of CRCs. Success in these studies will uncover new mechanisms underlying colon tumorigenesis and may identify new therapeutic targets for CRC, in addition to having broad epidemiological implications in elucidating the etiologic factors potentially contributing to aggressive colon cancer phenotypes in African Americans.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: African Americans are more likely to be diagnosed with and to die as a result of colon cancer than any other ethnic group in the United States. Identifying the mechanisms involved in colon tumor progression in African Americans is therefore critical for elucidating the etiologic factors contributing to outcome disparities in African Americans. Our proposed studies are designed to delineate the molecular mechanisms associated with colon cancer progression in African Americans with an overarching goal of guiding clinical management for this deadly disease in this population.            ",EPHA6 as a novel candidate driver gene in colon cancer,9090377,R01CA204549,"['Accounting ', ' Allelomorphs ', ' Alleles ', ' Diazene, dimethyl-,

"Analysis of Racial Disparities in HCC by Systems Metabolomics ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a significant health problem in the United States. Compared to European Americans (EA), the incidence of HCC is higher in African Americans (AA) and is associated with more advanced tumor stage at diagnosis and lower survival rates. It has been reported that the sensitivity of α- fetoprotein (AFP) for the diagnosis of HCC in African Americans with hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is lower than that of patients of all other racial groups combined. We previously performed preliminary investigation into racial disparities through metabolomics profiling of sera from HCC cases and patients with liver cirrhosis by using both liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Through stratified analysis of the LC/GC-MS data, we identified different candidates that distinguish HCC cases from the cirrhotic controls among AA and EA. This application builds on these promising preliminary results to find and validate race-specific metabolites as biomarkers for HCC. This will be accomplished by targeted analysis of metabolites in liver tissues and sera from HCC cases and patients with liver cirrhosis representing AA and EA. Metabolites that differentiate HCC cases from cirrhotic controls in a race-specific manner will be selected by statistical and network-based methods. Then, a systems-oriented approach that combines these metabolites with other candidate biomarkers (genes, glycans, and proteins) will be utilized for the selection of key signaling pathways perturbed in HCC. Following validation of the candidates via independent samples from HCC cases, patients with liver cirrhosis, and healthy subjects, we will elucidate their functional roles through both in vitro and in vivo experiments. Successful completion of this research will enable us to identify HCC biomarkers and perturbed pathways that are race-specific as well as those that are shared by AA and EA. These findings will contribute not only to a greater understanding of racial disparities in HCC but also to improving diagnosis of HCC through race-specific biomarkers. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Currently used biomarkers for detecting hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in high-risk cirrhotic patients lack the desired sensitivity and specificity, particularly in African American patients. The goal of this project is to find and validate race-specific biomarkers for HCC and identify perturbed intercellular signaling pathways in HCC. If successful, the study will (1) contribute to a greater understanding of racial disparities in HCC, (2) enable accurate detection of HCC by using race as a factor, and (3) give insights into the mechanisms underlying the behavior of potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets.",Analysis of Racial Disparities in HCC by Systems Metabolomics,9115112,U01CA185188,"['α-Fetoproteins ', ' Fetuins ', ' Alpha-Fetoglobulin ', ' Alpha-1-Fetoprotein ', ' alpha-Fetoproteins ', ' Behavior ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Blood ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' cultured cell line ', ' Strains Cell Lines ', ' CellLine ', ' Cell Line ', ' neoplastic transformation ', ' Neoplastic Cell Transformation ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cells ', ' Clinical Markers ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Enzyme Gene ', ' Enzymes ', ' Genes ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' non-A, non-B hepatitis ', ' non A, non B hepatitis ', ' hepatitis non A non B ', ' hep C ', ' Hepatitis, Viral, Non-A, Non-B, Parenterally-Transmitted ', ' Hepatitis C virus infection ', ' HCV infection ', ' Hepatitis C ', ' liver carcinoma ', ' Liver Cells Carcinoma ', ' Hepatoma ', ' Hepatocellular cancer ', ' Hepatocellular Carcinoma ', ' Hepatocarcinoma ', ' Primary carcinoma of the liver cells ', ' University Hospitals ', ' In Vitro ', ' Incidence ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' hepatic organ system ', ' hepatic body system ', ' Liver ', ' Hepatic Cirrhosis ', ' Liver Cirrhosis ', ' mass fragmentometry ', ' ion trap mass spectrometry ', ' Mass-Gas Chromatography Spectrum Analysis ', ' Mass-Gas Chromatography Spectrometry ', ' Mass Fragmentographies ', ' Gas-Liquid-Mass Spectrometry Chromatography ', ' GCMS ', ' GC MS ', ' Mass Fragmentography ', ' Methods ', ' Tumor Staging ', ' Neoplasm Staging ', ' Cancer Staging ', ' Diagnostic Neoplasm Staging ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Glycans ', ' Polysaccharides ', ' Proteins ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' recruit ', ' active recruitment ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' Research ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Sensitivity and Specificity ', ' Signal Pathway ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Survival Rate ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Tissues ', ' United States ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Biological ', ' Biochemical ', ' Chemicals ', ' Liver Cells ', ' Hepatic Parenchymal Cell ', ' Hepatic Cells ', ' Hepatocyte ', ' Blood Serum ', ' Serum ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' European ', ' Staging ', ' Investigation ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' xeno-transplantation ', ' xeno-transplant ', ' Xenotransplantation ', ' Xenograft ', ' Heterologous Transplantation ', ' Heterograft ', ' Xenograft procedure ', ' American ', ' Cellular Proliferation ', ' Cell Multiplication ', ' Cell Growth in Number ', ' Cell Proliferation ', ' Performance ', ' Participant ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' research study ', ' ethnicity difference ', ' ethnic difference ', ' Reporting ', ' Protein Gene Products ', ' Gene Proteins ', ' Network Analysis ', ' Pathway Analysis ', ' Sampling ', ' Proteomics ', ' LC/MS ', ' liquid chromatography mass spectrometry ', ' Metabolic Pathway ', ' T-Stage ', ' Tumor stage ', ' metabonomics ', ' metabolism measurement ', ' metabolomics ', ' HPAFP ', ' FETA ', ' AFP ', ' AFP gene ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Stage at Diagnosis ', ' in vivo ', ' Validation ', ' Preparation ', ' cirrhotic ', ' Cirrhosis ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' risk prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' computer based prediction ', ' predictive modeling ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' transcriptomics ', ' Network-based ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' healthy volunteer ', ' therapeutic target ', ' network models ', ' high risk ', ' population based ', ' candidate marker ', ' candidate biomarker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' cancer initiation ', ' candidate validation ', ' racial disparity ', ' race disparity ', ' disparities in race ', ' potential biomarker ', ' potential biological marker ', ' multiple omics ', ' specific biomarkers ', ' ethnic diversity ', ' ethnically diverse ', ' ']",NCI,GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY,U01,2016,255915,0.0776127873449452
"Biobehavioral Determinants of the Microbiome and Preterm Birth in Black Women DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goals of this study are to elucidate the bio behavioral determinants that govern the structure and dynamics of the microbiome of African American (AA) women during pregnancy and to investigate whether microbiome composition is associated with PTB. The proposed study will contribute to a bio psychosocial understanding of within-race risk for PTB, providing insight into important risk and protective factors relevant to AA women who disproportionately experience PTB compared to any other US population. Our research is consistent with frameworks for eliminating racial disparities, which recognize the importance of studying potential risk factors within-race as a vital first step, and is congruent with the National Institute of Nursing Research goal of promoting and improving the health of individuals, families, and communities across the lifespan in a variety of clinical settings and within diverse populations. The study will prospectively enroll a socioeconomically diverse cohort of H 960 pregnant AA women and follow them through delivery, collecting data at three time points: twice via direct participant contact during prenatal care appointments (at 10-14 and 26-30 weeks' gestation), and once via review of the medical records from the delivery hospitalization. Using a nested case-control approach, we will designate as cases all women who experience PTB (an estimated 125 cases); an equal number of controls will be selected from among those who deliver a term infant. Using this study design we will: (1) Characterize the vaginal, oral, and gut microbiome during early and later pregnancy; (2) Examine whether bio behavioral factors linked with PTB - including biological indicators and experiences of stress, nutritional status, and health behaviors - influence the composition of the microbiome; (3) Determine whether the composition of the vaginal, oral, and gut microbiome in early and/or later pregnancy is associated with PTB; and (4) Investigate whether symptom patterns are associated with microbiomic milieu that increase the risk of PTB among AA women. The success of this research is supported by several factors. First, we have assembled a multidisciplinary collaboration of clinicians and basic and translational scientists representing expertise in infectious disease, obstetrics-gynecology, nutrition, genetics and epigenetics, stress physiology, epidemiology and informatics under the leadership of a nurse-scientist. Second, we have the support of the Atlanta Clinical and Translational Science Institute (CTSA award # NIH UL1TR000454); Emory's Interdisciplinary Training for Nurse Scientists Award (T32 NR012715), Emory's Reproductive and Perinatal Epidemiology Fellowship Award, and the Emory Integrated Genomics Core Laboratory. Third, Atlanta is home to AA women of broad SES, many of whom are served by Emory's affiliated delivery hospitals, enabling us to sample a diverse group of AA women, allowing for sufficient variation in the bio behavioral determinants under study to distinguish their independent and interactive effects on the microbiome and, ultimately, on the risk of PTB. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Preterm birth (PTB) occurs at unacceptably high rates within the United States, with African American women disproportionately affected. The composition of the microbiome during pregnancy may be a key mechanism for PTB. Our study will characterize the structure and dynamics of the vaginal, oral, and gut microbiome within the population most affected by PTB - African American women - in order to evaluate whether particular microbiome patterns are linked with PTB and to identify bio behavioral factors that impact microbiome structure and dynamics during pregnancy.",Biobehavioral Determinants of the Microbiome

"Comparative Effectiveness of Genomics Assay for Active Surveillance Failure Prediction in African American Men:  the impact of genetic ancestry and socioeconomic status. ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Prostate Cancer (PCa) is the most common malignancy in men but overtreatment is a major public health concern. To address this, Genomic Health Inc. in collaboration with academic and military hospitals validated a 17-gene relative expression assay to predict the probability of adverse pathologic features at the time of radical prostatectomy to improve the safety of active surveillance. Their Oncotype DX (ODX) assay improves the prognostic accuracy beyond standard clinical parameters at the time of biopsy. The ODX GPS is scaled from 0-100 and increases the number of men deemed eligible for active surveillance by decreasing the pre-test probability of adverse pathology and allows patients and providers to confidently elect active surveillance to avoid upfront treatment morbidity.  ODX has been validated in largely European American (EA) populations but has yet to be adequately assessed in high-risk African American (AA) men. Our overarching hypothesis is that the prognostic accuracy of Oncotype DX varies by race and by socioeconomic status and genetic ancestry among AAs. This is significant since AAs have the highest risk of PCa and PCa mortality and are more likely to harbor adverse pathology in their prostate despite being eligible for active surveillance by clinical parameters. Risk of aggressive PCa varies across studies in AA men based on socioeconomic factors including insurance, education and income. Moreover, gene expression varies significantly between AA and EA prostate tumors. Given this, ODX can be dangerous for AAs if prediction performance is poorer or differs significantly between AAs and EAs or between subpopulations of AAs with clinically localized prostate cancer (CLPCa).  To assess the prediction performance of ODX in AAs with CLPCa, we propose the following Specific Aims: (1) to compare the effectiveness of the ODX GPS as a predictor of adverse pathology in archived specimen from 100 AA and 50 EA men with CLPCa; (2) to compare the prediction performance of the GPS for adverse pathology in archived specimen from 150 AAs with CLPCa from divergent socio-demographic (income, education, insurance status) backgrounds; (3) to assess for variation in GPS prediction performance in 100 previously recruited AAs with CLPCa by degree of genetic European or African ancestry.  Should this comparative effectiveness study reveal variations in prediction performance by race, socioeconomic status or genetic ancestry, a calibrated GPS score could be provided. Alternatively, if the ODX assay inadequately measures risk of adverse pathology we prevent its use in men of African ancestry. In either scenario we improve the safety of active surveillance for a high-risk PCa population.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The morbidity associated with the upfront treatment of prostate cancer has led to the promotion of active surveillance to delay or avoid treatment-related complications. However, active surveillance is grossly underutilized due the inability of standard clinical parameters to detect adverse pathologic features in the prostates of eligible men. Our protocol will improve the safety of active surveillance by evaluating the effectiveness of a genomics assay for the prediction of adverse pathology in high-risk African American prostate cancer patients.                ",Comparative Effectiveness of Genomics Assay for Active Surveillance Failure Prediction in African American Men:  the impact of genetic ancestry and socioeconomic status.,9025363,R21CA202552,"['University Medical Centers ', ' Academic Medical Centers ', ' Adoption ', ' Affect ', ' Archives ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Biopsy ', ' Calibration ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Future ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Genes ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Hospitals ', ' Military Hospitals ', ' Veterans Hospitals ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Income ', ' Insurance ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' mortality ', ' Pathology ', ' Patients ', ' Probability ', ' Prostatic Gland ', ' Prostate Gland ', ' Prostate ', ' Prostatic Neoplasia ', ' Prostate Tumor ', ' Prostate Neoplasms ', ' Prostatic Neoplasms ', ' Public Health ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Receiver Operator Characteristics ', ' Receiver Operating Characteristics ', ' recruit ', ' active recruitment ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Safety ', ' Socioeconomic Factors ', ' statistics ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Measures ', ' Treatment outcome ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Uninsured ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Prostatovesiculectomy ', ' Radical Prostatectomy ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' prognostic ', ' Failure ', ' African ', ' European ', ' Collaborations ', ' Genetic ', ' Research Specimen ', ' Specimen ', ' Prostatic Cancer ', ' Prostate Cancer ', ' Prostate CA ', ' Malignant prostatic tumor ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Prostate ', ' Malignant neoplasm of prostate ', ' Knowledge ', ' Insurance Status ', ' Insurance Coverage ', ' Investigation ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Pattern ', ' American ', ' Performance ', ' novel ', ' Modality ', ' gene expression assay ', ' gene expression analysis ', ' Transcript Expression Analysis ', ' Transcript Expression Analyses ', ' Gene Expression Pattern Analysis ', ' Gene Expression Monitoring ', ' Gene Expression Profiling ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' performance tests ', ' Abate ', ' Genomics ', ' anticancer therapy ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Treatment ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Therapy ', ' Cancer Treatment ', ' cancer therapy ', ' Provider ', ' Effectiveness ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' low socioeconomic position ', ' low socio-economic status ', ' low socio-economic position ', ' low socioeconomic status ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Cancer Patient ', ' Pathologic ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socio-economically ', ' socio-economic ', ' socioeconomics ', ' cancer gene expression ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' disparity in cancer ', ' cancer disparity ', ' comparative effectiveness ', ' compare effectiveness ', ' high risk ', ' public health relevance ', ' Biological Markers ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' social health determinants ', ' prostate biopsy ', ' ']",NCI,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,R21,2016,220289,-0.03988954248682602
"Establishment of PDX mouse models and cell lines from hepatitis C virus associated liver cancer patients from CA and AA ethnic groups ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Hepatitis C virus (HCV) mediated end stage liver disease, including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), is a growing problem among African Americans (AAs). The central goal of this project is to investigate the racial disparity of HCV mediated liver cancer. HCV infection mediated death rate among AA patients is about 2- fold higher than CA. Very little information is available about the underlying mechanisms of liver disease progression among chronically HCV infected ethnic groups. Our research proposal will examine this previously unexplored area of HCV mediated end stage liver disease among AA. microRNAs (miRNAs) play critical roles in multi-step cell growth regulatory processes, and the relationship between chronic HCV infection and miRNA expression is of considerable interest in understanding virus mediated disease progression. Our preliminary data indicated a group of microRNAs modulated in chronically HCV infected AA sera as compared to that of CA. We hypothesize that these circulatory miRNAs can be potential predictive biomarker towards HCC development in HCV infected AA patients, and are involved deregulating hepatocyte growth. Thus, identification of predictive biomarkers for HCC and the underlying molecular mechanisms for race disparity will have a great translational benefit. Our long term objectives are to translae these findings from the laboratory to the bedside identifying predictive biomarker, and developing therapeutic modalities for HCV mediated liver disease progression. Impact: The results from this R21 exploratory proposal will have a high impact by investigating the role of miRNAs as genetic factors for understating racial disparity. Our research will explain why African Americans have higher incidence of HCV mediated liver cancer as compared to Caucasians.

"Roles of Semaphorin Signaling in Breast Cancer Racial Disparities ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Breast cancer (BC) is the second most common cancer diagnosed in American women and is also the second leading cause of cancer death in women. Compared to Caucasian American (CA) women, African American (AA) women display earlier onset of BC, are more likely to be diagnosed with metastatic types of BC at the time of presentation, and have a significantly higher mortality rate. Our long term goal is to reveal the biological factors underlying racial disparities in BC outcomes and thereby facilitate development of novel clinical applications to eliminate such disparities. The biological factors that mediate BC racial disparities remain largely unknown. We performed a bioinformatic analysis using a dataset from TCGA (NCI) and unexpectedly identified that SEMA6D expression in BC tissues from AA women was significantly lower than in CA women. The low expression level of SEMA6D correlates significantly with poor survival of BC patients, and the association is more dramatic for patients with triple negative receptor status (ER, PR and HER2). In further support of our initial finding, examination of multiple datasets from NCBI GEO confirmed that expression of SEMA6D is significantly reduced in BC tissues compared to normal tissues. Our initial functional assay indicated that SEMA6D represses BC cell metastasis both in vitro and in vivo. SEMA6D is a member of the Semaphorin family of signaling molecules and its functions in BC pathogenesis have never been reported in the literature. Based on results from both our bioinformatic and functional analyses, we hypothesize that SEMA6D inhibits BC metastasis and differential expression of SEMA6D is a causative factor for outcome disparities observed in AA versus CA patients. We will initially test our hypothesis through the following two aims In Aim 1; we will determine the in vivo activity of SEMA6D in repressing BC metastasis. In Aim 2, we will characterize the potential mechanism for the differential expression of SEMA6D observed in AA versus CA patients. In this study, we will examine for the first time the role of SEMA6D in repressing BC metastasis. This study represents the first to connect Semaphorin signaling with BC racial disparities. Accomplishing this study will provide crucial clues for understanding the biological basis for racial disparities in BC and will facilitate development of novel diagnostic/therapeutic approaches to eliminate such disparities.

"Prostate Cancer Gene Identification within Candidate Region in African Americans ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  There are well documented racial disparities in prostate cancer (PCa) incidence and mortality in the United States between African American (AA) and European American (EA) men. These disparities cannot be fully explained by differences in screening or treatment differences by race, and other environmental and biological risk factors have not been well characterized. We hypothesize that racial differences in the distribution of genetic risk factors may contribute to the observed disparities. We recently identified a region on chromosome 7q31-32 that is statistically significantly associated with prostate cancer in AA men, and there is suggestive evidence for association with PCa aggressiveness as well. The identified region is gene-rich, and thus far we have identified two candidate genes (CPED1 and FLNC) in this region. These are genes that have not been well characterized in the literature, however hints of their role in prostate cancer can be found within previous expression studies. Here, we propose to examine the region on chromosome 7q31-32 in greater depth, using existing samples and data from multiple databases. In Aim 1, we first will examine SNP associations in this region in a much larger independent sample set to confirm our original findings (Aim 1.A). We will then examine available online databases, including dbGAP, GEO, and Oncomine for further evidence of association of genes in this region with PCa risk and aggressiveness (Aim 1.B). Based on the findings of Aims 1.A and B, we will select genes and regions to target with a dense tagSNP panel to better refine our genes of interest in 230 AA PCa cases and 230 AA controls. Aim 2 will explore the functional significance of the top five candidate genes identified in our prior work and in Aim 1, including CPED1 and FLNC, using banked tissue samples (Aim 2.A) and cell lines (Aim 2.B). For Aim 2.A, Expression of mRNA will be assessed in 112 fresh frozen PCa samples selected to represent EA men, AA men, high Gleason grade (GG, >4+3) and low GG (<3+4) equally. Protein expression will be assessed using IHC in paraffin embedded PCa samples, using the same race/grade sampling method. For Aim 2.B, multiple cell lines representing a range of PCa aggressiveness and both EA and AA origin will be used to evaluate protein expression and biological function of these proteins. Protein expression will be determined using immunoblot analysis. If clinical data suggest the candidate gene is overexpressed in PCa, we will knock it down, and if expression is lost in PCa we will overexpress it. We will perform cell growth, transformation, migration and invasion assays to determine if altering gene expression will regulate cellular function. We will also perform cell counting assays to measure cell growth over an eight day period. Soft agar and clonogenic assays will be used to assay transformation. Boyden chamber assays will be used to assess changes in migration and invasion. Study results will provide insight into genetic risk factors for PCa that might help explain racial disparities in incidence and mortality and thereby provide biological targets for reducing these disparities. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  This study will provide insight into genetic risk factors for prostate cancer through a thorough interrogation of a susceptibility region of the genome on 7q31-32 previously identified in a sample of African American men. These genes may help explain racial disparities in incidence and mortality. Understanding genes involved in PCa carcinogenesis and progression in African American men will provide biological targets for reducing these disparities.",Prostate Cancer Gene Identification within Candidate Region in African Americans,9037625,R21CA185087,"['Agar ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Cell Number ', ' Cell Count ', ' Cellular Growth ', ' Cellular Expansion ', ' cell growth ', ' cultured cell line ', ' Strains Cell Lines ', ' CellLine ', ' Cell Line ', ' Subcellular Process ', ' Cellular Process ', ' Cellular Physiology ', ' Cellular Function ', ' Cell Process ', ' Cell Function ', ' Cell physiology ', ' genetic mapping ', ' Total Human and Non-Human Gene Mapping ', ' Linkage Mapping ', ' Gene Mapping Genetics ', ' Gene Mapping ', ' Gene Localization ', ' Chromosome Mapping ', ' Chromosomes ', ' Chromosome 7 ', ' Chromosomes, Human, Pair 7 ', ' virtual simulation ', ' in silico ', ' computerized simulation ', ' computerized modeling ', ' computer based models ', ' computational simulation ', ' computational models ', ' computational modeling ', ' Mathematical Models and Simulations ', ' Mathematical Model Simulation ', ' Computerized Models ', ' Computer based Simulation ', ' Computer Models ', ' Computer Simulation ', ' Freezing ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Genes ', ' Genome ', ' Genotype ', ' Health ', ' Immigrations ', ' In-Migration ', ' Incidence ', ' Literature ', ' Maps ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Methods ', ' mortality ', ' Transforming Genes ', ' Oncoproteins ', ' Oncogene Proteins ', ' Oncogene Products ', ' Cancer-Promoting Gene ', ' Cancer Genes ', ' Oncogenes ', ' Prostatic Gland ', ' Prostate Gland ', ' Prostate ', ' Proteins ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Risk Factors ', ' mRNA ', ' Messenger RNA ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Tissues ', ' United States ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Paraffin Embedding ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' base ', ' density ', ' Biological ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Predisposition ', ' insight ', ' European ', ' data repository ', ' clinical data repository ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Databases ', ' Biological Function ', ' Biological Process ', ' Gleason-SC ', ' Gleason Sum ', ' Gleason Score for Prostate Cancer ', ' Gleason Score ', ' Gleason Grade ', ' Gleason Grade for Prostate Cancer ', ' Prostatic Cancer ', ' Prostate Cancer ', ' Prostate CA ', ' Malignant prostatic tumor ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Prostate ', ' Malignant neoplasm of prostate ', ' interest ', ' American ', ' cancer risk ', ' Cancer Induction ', ' carcinogenesis ', ' reverse transcriptase PCR ', ' RTPCR ', ' RT-PCR ', ' Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction ', ' race differences ', ' racial difference ', ' inherited factor ', ' genetic risk factor ', ' Sampling ', ' Cancer Susceptibility Gene ', ' Cancer-Predisposing Gene ', ' cell bank ', ' Filamin C, gamma ', ' FLNC ', ' FLN2 ', ' Actin Binding Protein 280 ', ' ABPL ', ' FLNC gene ', ' protein expression ', ' Tissue Sample ', ' Candidate Gene ', ' Candidate Disease Gene ', ' Data ', ' Immunoblot Analysis ', ' mRNA Expression ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Validation ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' PC3 ', ' PC-3 cell line ', ' PC-3 ', ' PC3 cell line ', ' whole genome association study ', ' whole genome association studies ', ' whole genome association analysis ', ' genomewide association study ', ' genomewide association studies ', ' genomewide association scan ', ' genome wide association studies ', ' genome wide association scan ', ' genome wide association ', ' GWAS ', ' GWA study ', ' genome wide association study ', ' DU-145 ', ' DU145 ', ' LNCaP ', ' Population ', ' migration ', ' tumor ', ' overexpression ', ' overexpress ', ' over-expression ', ' screening ', ' racial disparity ', ' race disparity ', ' disparities in race ', ' prostate cancer cell line ', ' admixture mapping ', ' disparity reduction ', ' reduce disparity ', ' ']",NCI,WAYNE STATE UNIVERSITY,R21,2016,204723,-0.05819022777431722
"DIDACTIC: Dissemination and Implementation of a Diet and Activity Community Trial DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): South Carolina has some of the largest health disparities in the nation, and these are invariably more extreme in African Americans (AA) compared to European Americans. The chronic diseases that present the greatest public health challenges are now known to be inflammation related, and AAs tend to have greater inherent sensitivity to inflammation modulators. The proposed dissemination and implementation research is based on our efficacious intervention trial, ""Diet & Activity Community Trial: High-Risk Inflammation"" [R24 MD002769- 01], which focused on diet, physical activity, and stress reduction in collaboration with the AA faith community to reduce inflammation (referred to as the HEALS intervention). Extraordinary success in engaging the AA faith and greater AA community allows us to propose to disseminate and implement this intervention. We will ensure that the proposed dissemination and implementation research contributes to achieving our overall goal of reducing health disparities among AAs through the following specific aims: (1) Disseminate and implement the successful HEALS intervention in the AA faith community; (2) Evaluate and monitor the dissemination process for adoption, recruitment, retention, and fidelity to the HEALS intervention trial including testing the effect of the disseminated intervention using a variety of non-invasive measures that are relevant to overall health status, proven to be related to chronic inflammation in the intervention-phase trial, and that can (and will) be employed in a community setting; (3) Conduct a cost-effectiveness analysis of intervention dissemination and implementation to reduce health disparities in parameters associated with inflammation, from both budgetary and societal perspectives; and (4) Enhance the capacity of the target community to sustain the delivery of the evidence-based intervention and for community partners to engage in future research and programming to address health disparities through cultivation of a network of active church and community educators and leadership development activities. We will utilize a community-based participatory research approach to recruit 30 churches and 450 participants using a lay health, train-the-trainer model that decentralizes the research process and is suitable for dissemination and implementation research. We also will engage 30 ""mentor"" lay health educators (members of church education teams) who participated in the intervention trial phase to mentor and train newly recruited lay health educators for church education teams for the proposed dissemination and implementation research. We propose to use non-invasive approaches to measure key variables during dissemination and implementation. Cost-effectiveness analysis is an important component and will yield information on required inputs and outputs. The proposed research offers an opportunity to build upon a history of successful collaboration by disseminating and implementing evidence- based intervention with a focus on sustainability of efforts through capacity-building and leadership development to address health disparities in the AA community to address health disparities. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: African Americans (AA) in South Carolina have some of the most extreme health disparities in the nation and most of these can be traced to the effects of poor diet, low levels of physical activity, and stress in increasing chronic inflammation. We have developed an efficacious intervention for dissemination and implementation in partnership with and by our community stakeholders in the AA community to stem the high rates of inflammation rising tide of chronic disease rates in this community.

"Germline Mutations in African American Families with Aggressive Prostate Cancer ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The mortality rate of prostate cancer (PCa) in African American (AA) men is two-folds higher that in Caucasian American (CA) men because they persistently present with a more aggressive form of the disease. However, the genetic risk factors contributing to aggressive PCa in AA men are poorly understood because this area of research has not been sufficiently explored. To address this deficiency, we have enrolled 20 AA families with hereditary PCa in southern Louisiana, including 15 families with aggressive PCa, and we have collected samples from 421 AA individuals with aggressive PCa. We performed exome sequencing on one affected and one unaffected man from a large AA family with aggressive PCa and identified 14 novel non-synonymous variants (ns-variants) that co-segregate with the PCa phenotype in this family. Therefore, we hypothesize that genetic analyses of AA families with aggressive PCa may facilitate the identification of the genetic factors conferring risk to aggressive PCa, and one or more of the 14 identified ns-variants may contribute to aggressive PCa risk in AA men with hereditary or even sporadic PCa. The objective of this study is to identify common germline mutations conferring PCa risk, specifically in AA families and individuals with aggressive PCa, thereby reducing the PCa-related health disparity. In this proposed study, we will: 1) Determine which of the 14 novel ns-variant(s) confers risk to aggressive PCa in AA families. We will genotype the 14 variants in affected and unaffected men to determine which variant(s) co-segregate with PCa in most AA families with aggressive PCa and which variant(s) have the highest frequency in affected individuals. These variants will be validated in an additional 25 AA PCa families provided by Johns Hopkins University. 2) Identify additional variants in the 14 candidate genes conferring risk to aggressive PCa in AA families. We will re-sequence the 14 candidate genes in all of the affected men in the 20 AA families to identify additional variants that may confer risk to aggressive PCa in AA families and AA individuals. 3) Determine the functions of the risk- variant(s) in prostate tumorigenesis. We will perform functional analyses of the risk-variant(s) including RNA and protein expression, cell growth rate, and anchorage-independent colony formation of the cells expressing risk-allele(s) to determine which variant(s) most strongly contributes to aggressive PCa risk in AA. The knowledge gained from this study will advance our understanding of the etiology of aggressive PCa, particularly in the AA population. Results from this proposal may lead to the development of diagnostic tools for early detection and early management of those at an increased risk of developing aggressive PCa to eventually reduce the PCa-related health disparities. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The mortality rates in African American (AA) men with prostate cancer (PCa) are the highest among all other ethnic groups because they persistently present with a more aggressive form of the disease; yet, the genetic factors contributing to a two-fold higher risk of aggressive PCa in AA men remain largely unknown. In this proposal, we aim to uncover significant evidence of the genetic factors contributing to aggressive PCa by analyzing 45 AA families with hereditary PCa using state-of-the-art sequencing methodologies with the long- term goal of reducing this health disparity in AA men.",Germline Mutations in African American Families with Aggressive Prostate Cancer,9042312,R21CA185213,"['Affect ', ' Cellular Growth ', ' Cellular Expansion ', ' cell growth ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cells ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Family ', ' Genes ', ' Genotype ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Incidence ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Louisiana ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Methodology ', ' mortality ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' Second Primary Neoplasms ', ' Second Neoplasm ', ' Second Malignancy ', ' Metachronous Second Primary Neoplasms ', ' Metachronous Neoplasms ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Area ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Hereditary Mutation ', ' Germline Mutation ', ' Germ-Line Mutation ', ' white American ', ' caucasian American ', ' Individual ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Genetic ', ' tool ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Prostatic Cancer ', ' Prostate Cancer ', ' Prostate CA ', ' Malignant prostatic tumor ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Prostate ', ' Malignant neoplasm of prostate ', ' Knowledge ', ' Frequencies ', ' Hereditary ', ' Inherited ', ' cancer risk ', ' early detection ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' novel ', ' Preventive strategy ', ' Preventative strategy ', ' Prevention strategy ', ' Prevention ', ' Genetic analyses ', ' genetic analysis ', ' inherited factor ', ' genetic risk factor ', ' Sampling ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' protein expression ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' disease causation ', ' causation ', ' Causality ', ' Etiology ', ' Candidate Gene ', ' Candidate Disease Gene ', ' Address ', ' Cancer Cause ', ' Cancer Etiology ', ' Cancer Family ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Population ', ' man ', "" man's "", ' novel diagnostics ', ' next generation diagnostics ', ' new diagnostics ', ' therapeutic target ', ' high risk ', ' prostate carcinogenesis ', ' prostate tumorigenesis ', ' exome sequencing ', ' risk variant ', ' risk locus ', ' risk loci ', ' risk genotype ', ' risk gene ', ' risk allele ', ' Risk-associated variant ', ' ']",NCI,LSU HEALTH SCIENCES CENTER,R21,2016,158775,0.06589078698821674
"MIC-1 and its functional partners in prostate cancer racial disparity ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Prostate cancer (PCa) is the most common non-cutaneous malignancy in the United States males and is the second leading cause of cancer deaths in men. In this regard, epidemiologic data have also provided evidence of racial disparity, including younger age, higher incidence and aggressiveness of PCa at diagnosis and inferior survival rates of African Americans (AA) relative to Caucasian patients in the Unites States. The explanation for these differences is still unknown. On the other hand, our recent results combined with prior studies have revealed that MIC-1 and its functional partners EGFR and CXCR4 were more frequent in AA compared to Caucasian PCa patients. Importantly, recent reports have revealed that EGFR and CXCR4 mediate Docetaxel resistance in PCa cells. Therefore, the central hypothesis of this proposal is that the up- regulation of MIC-1 signaling cascade may cooperate with EGFR and CXCR4 oncogenic pathways for the acquisition of a more aggressive behavior, survival and therapeutic resistance of PCa cells and contribute to the racial disparity between AA versus Caucasian patients. The overall objective is to establish the signaling elements modulated by MIC-1/transforming growth factor-ß receptors (TGF-ßRs) and their functional cross- talks with EGFR and CXCR4 cascades in tumor and tumor-associated stromal cells during prostate carcinogenesis and bone metastases that contribute to the ethnic disparity in AA vs. Caucasian patients. The therapeutic benefit to targeting MIC-1 cascade and its functional partners for reversing the chemoresistance of PC cells will also be investigated using PCa cell models and human PCa tissues from AA and Caucasian men. To test this hypothesis, three specific aims were proposed. Aim I will establish the involvement of MIC-1, EGFR and CXCR4 in racial disparity by performing immunohistochemical analyses of their expression on a large panel of benign and malignant tissues and DNA microarrays with PC cell lines relevant to AA and Caucasian men. Aim II will delineate molecular mechanisms of MIC-1 and its signaling cross-talks with EGFR and CXCR4 cascades involved in the growth, invasion and alterations of metabolic pathways using in vitro PCa cell models relevant to AA and Caucasian PCa patients. Aim III will determine the therapeutic benefit to target MIC-1 cascade for improving the anti-carcinogenic effects of docetaxel using in vitro and in vivo PCa cell models. Finally, we also demonstrate the molecular mechanism associated with Docetaxel resistance and its relationship with MIC-1 in PCa cells relevant to AA and Caucasian patients. Taken together, these studies will delineate the functional interplay between MIC-1 and its interacting partners EGFR and CXCR4 and their potential role in disease aggressiveness and therapy resistance to better understand their involvement in the racial disparity between AA and Caucasian patients. The overall outcome of this application will reveal the clinical interest to use combination of MIC-1, EGFR and CXCR4 as molecular biomarkers for an earlier and accurate diagnosis, response to therapy and impact on therapeutic intervention of AA and Caucasian patients. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The research project aims to establish the role of MIC-1 and its interacting partners EGFR and CXCR4 in prostate cancer (PCa) pathogenesis, aggressiveness and their involvement in the racial disparity between African American (AA) and Caucasian men. The studies will delineate the signaling elements modulated by MIC-1 and its functional partners EGFR and CXCR4 that contribute to PCa progression, bone metastases, chemoresistance and interethnic disparity using a large panel of prostatic tissue specimens and PCa cell lines relevant to PCa and bone metastases derived from AA and Caucasian patients. Further, the autocrine/paracrine role of MIC-1 in PCa will be established using recombinant human MIC-1 protein using stromal and tumor cells. The benefit of down-regulating MIC-1 for reversing Docetaxel resistance will be determined using in vitro and in vivo PCa cell models.

"The African American Non-Resident Fatherhood Program DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application requests support for a study to examine the effects of an intervention aimed at increasing paternal involvement in African American non-resident fathers. Although the number of children living without fathers has grown nationally, the greatest percentage of children living apart from their fathers is found among African American (AA) families. Two thirds of all AA children in the United States live in households without their biological father. Father presence is important to the emotional, social and developmental wellbeing of children throughout the child's life. Positive father involvement is also important to the health and wellbeing of fathers themselves. Therefore, the purpose of this project is to test the Building Bridges to Fatherhood (BBTF) program, an innovative video-based fatherhood program developed with the guidance of a Fathers Advisory Council. The purpose of the BBTF program is to increase and sustain paternal involvement among AA fathers and their young children (2-5 years). The BBTF program will be tested in a randomized clinical trial among 180 families of young children across 2 large predominantly African American areas (west-side and south-side) of a large Midwestern city. Fathers will be recruited via key informants from multiple community sites (i.e. churches, barbershops, community centers, schools, day care centers, local business establishments, dry cleaners, and sports venues) and randomly assigned to either the BBTF intervention or a Financial Literacy (FL) attention control group. Participants will be assessed at pre-intervention, 12 weeks and 24 weeks using self-report measures completed by fathers and the child's biological mother and participate in a booster session at 18 weeks. Dependent variables include: paternal involvement (material and in-kind [non-monetary] support and direct father/child interaction), father parenting competence (self-efficacy, satisfaction, parenting skills and knowledge), father psychological wellbeing (self-esteem, general and racial stress), father communication and problem solving, and father and maternal reports of child behavior and development (cognitive, emotional, and social). Further, father-mother relationship quality will be examined for its mediating effect on fathers' outcomes and paternal involvement. This application builds on our prior research: (1) refining an effective and culturally relevant parent training model so that it has enhanced social and contextual validity for African American non- resident fathers, and (2) providing a real-world intervention for fathers that has as its primary aim to facilitate and sustain father involvement i early childhood, before father estrangement becomes entrenched and intractable. This study is consistent with the NINR goals for the 21st century to address cultural and ethnic disparities in health promotion and intervention activities by developing innovative, culturally responsive, evidence-based interventions that are tailored to the individual. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  This application to test an innovative culturally relevant fatherhood program for increasing and sustaining paternal involvement among African American (AA) non-resident fathers is relevant to public health because over two-thirds of AA children live in homes without their fathers. Children with fathers who are continuously and actively involved have better behavioral, social, and emotional development and fathers who are continuously and actively involved with their children also fare better than fathers who are not. Thus, an effective fatherhood program holds great promise for improving the health outcomes and social well-being of children and fathers.",The African American Non-Resident Fatherhood Program,9061440,R01NR011182,"['Age ', ' Attention ', ' Behavior ', ' Parturition ', ' Birth ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Child Behavior ', ' Infant and Child Development ', ' Child Development ', ' childrearing ', ' Parenting behavior ', ' Parenting ', ' Child Rearing ', ' Cities ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' Control Groups ', ' Experimental Designs ', ' Family ', ' Father-Child Relationship ', ' Father-Child Relations ', ' Fathers ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' Health Promotion ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' Hospitals ', ' Household ', ' newborn children ', ' newborn child ', ' Newborns ', ' 0-4 weeks old ', ' Newborn Infant ', ' Mothers ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' Parents ', ' well-being ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' Problem Solving ', ' Public Health ', ' recruit ', ' active recruitment ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' Research ', ' Research Support ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Schools ', ' self esteem ', ' Social Development ', ' social support network ', ' Social support ', ' Sports ', ' Stress ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Unmarried Father ', ' Child Support ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Businesses ', ' Competence ', ' Criminal Justice ', ' Mediating ', ' Outcome Measure ', ' base ', ' divorce/separation ', ' role model ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Biological ', ' psychological ', ' psychologic ', ' Randomized Clinical Trials ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' satisfaction ', ' Collaborations ', ' fatherhood ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Side ', ' Home ', ' Home environment ', ' System ', ' interest ', ' Visit ', ' meetings ', ' Church ', ' early childhood ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' skills ', ' Participant ', ' paternity ', ' father role ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' Emotional ', ' Modeling ', ' father offspring interaction ', ' father child interaction ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Future Generations ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Address ', ' Day center care ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Randomized ', ' NIH RFA ', ' Request for Applications ', ' Cognitive ', ' Characteristics ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' informant ', ' Behavioral ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' psychological outcomes ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' 5 year old ', ' five year old ', ' age 5 years ', ' Evidence based intervention ', ' demographics ', ' community setting ', ' intervention effect ', ' efficacy testing ', ' health equity ', ' behavioral outcome ', ' behavior outcome ', ' community center ', ' financial literacy ', ' ethnic disparity ', ' ethnicity disparity ', ' ']",NINR,RUSH UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2016,521863,0.08037055017426363
"Complement Activation and Perinatal Outcomes in African American Women ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Preterm Birth (PTB) affects approximately 1 out of every 9 infants born in the United States and is the leading cause of infant mortality. Despite advances in risk factor identification and obstetrical care, racial disparities persist in the occurrence of PTB, with particularly high rates among African American (AA) women. An exaggerated inflammatory response is one of four discrete mechanisms for the pathogenesis of PTB. There is a significant racial disparity in inflammation-associated PTB, with African-Americans disproportionately affected. Exaggerated inflammation can be triggered by infectious processes and behavioral risk factors that promote pathogenic vaginal microbial colonization or inflammation. Identification of novel biobehavioral risk factors may provide additional insight int mechanisms and potential targets for intervention to eliminate this stubbornly persistent racial disparity in PTB. A key mediator of the inflammatory response, and also associated with PTB, is the complement pathway (""complement""). Complement is an innate defense mechanism composed of more than 30 blood proteins that are critically involved in the elimination of pathogenic microbes. Complement also is activated to assist in embryo implantation and the vascular remodeling and removal of cellular debris resulting from implantation that is essential to a healthy pregnancy. Dysregulation of the complement fragment C3a during early pregnancy has recently been identified as a biological risk factor for PTB and preterm premature rupture of membranes (PPROM). Exploring factors associated with C3a activation during early pregnancy among AA women may prove beneficial in the identification of biobehavioral mechanisms contributing to the later development of PTB. The purpose of this revised F31 proposal is to investigate the relationship between the vaginal microbiome, complement activation, PTB associated clinical measures, and modifiable biobehavioral risk factors linked to PTB and AA race. The proposed study is nested within a larger parent study (1R01NR014800) that is prospectively exploring the biobehavioral determinants of the microbiome and the risk of PTB in AA women. This F31 proposed study will enroll 100 of the AA women in the parent study from whom biological samples and questionnaire data will be collected at prenatal care visits occurring at time point 1 (8-14 wks) and clinical measures and outcomes collected from the medical record at time point 2 (delivery). In this prospective study we will:(1) Determine the relationship between vaginal microflora (vaginal microbiome and presence/absence of genital tract infection) and C3a levels in AA women during early pregnancy; and (2) Investigate the relationship between C3a levels in AA women during early pregnancy and PTB associated clinical measures (20 wk cervical length, gestational age at delivery). We will also explore the influence of biobehavioral risk factors (e.g., vaginal hygiene practices, sexual practices, substance use) on identified study variables.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Preterm Birth (PTB) affects approximately 1 out of every 9 infants born in the United States and despite advances in risk factor identification and obstetrica care, racial disparities persist in the occurrence of PTB, with particularly high rates among African American (AA) women. There is a significant racial disparity in inflammation-associated PTB among AA women suggesting a need to explore biobehavioral mechanisms of inflammation within this high risk group.

"Culture, Family Process, and Developmental Outcomes in Asian American Youth DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Counter to the ""model minority"" stereotype, Asian American (AA) youth show a uniquely mixed pattern of behaviors. They report better academic performance, fewer externalizing problems (e.g., substance use, violence), but more internalizing problems (e.g., depression, suicide) than youth of other racial-ethnic groups. During emerging adulthood, the positive outcomes in AA youth do not seem to hold up, and poor mental health is exacerbated. In fact, the suicide rate among young AA women is alarming, posing a serious public concern. In addition, AA youth subgroups dramatically differ in youth outcomes: some subgroups fare well while others struggle. However, our current knowledge is seriously limited in understanding how parenting and parent-child relations help or hinder youth development among AA youth. The existing family-process model, which is derived mainly from Western conceptualization, does not seem to be adequate to predict health and behavioral outcomes in AA youth. For example, the associations between parenting and youth behaviors among AA youth do not often show a conventional pattern but in fact reveal a paradoxical pattern. Cultures vary in parenting beliefs and behaviors and how they establish parent-child relations. In addition, like all other minority youth, AA youth face acculturation, having to negotiate between parental and mainstream cultures. However, culturally unique aspects of family process and the issue of acculturation are often neglected in the existing parenting research. This study responds to the urgent need for reliable longitudinal data of AA youth, the fastest growing but one of the most understudied and misunderstood populations in the United States. This proposed study aims to formulate a culturally adequate family-process model that incorporates acculturation in family process to accurately explain the complex outcome patterns of AA youth. The study will collect annual longitudinal survey data from Filipino American and Korean American families in the state of Illinois (N=1,960; 350 youth, 350 mothers, and 280 fathers from 350 families with n=980 per group) with the following specific aims: (1) to examine the concurrent and longitudinal associations of family process (parental beliefs, parental behaviors, and parent-child relations) with academic achievement, externalizing problems, and internalizing problems among AA youth, (2) to delineate developmental trajectories and their determinants in family process for the three outcome domains during adolescence and through the transition to young adulthood among AA youth, and (3) to investigate the influences of acculturation on the ways family process is connected to youth outcomes and developmental trajectories among AA youth. The results of this study will guide AA parents to preserve the aspects of their parenting that produce and maintain positive youth behaviors but to modify their parenting or adopt new strategies to prevent serious internalizing problems or worsening of those problems. The results also can guide parents of other race/ethnic groups to adopt AA parenting methods to help maximize their child's potential growth without increasing mental-health problems. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Asian Americans are the fastest growing population in the United States, but they remain underserved and misunderstood, often labeled as the ""model minority."" This application responds to the urgent needs of Asian American youth by attempting to explain their significantly high rates of internalizing problems such as depression and suicide, their inability to sustain positive behaviors, and the significant disparities in health and behavioral outcomes among Asian American subgroups.","Culture, Family Process, and Developmental Outcomes in Asian American Youth",9049520,R01HD073200,"['Cultural Assimilation ', ' Acculturation ', ' teenage ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' Adolescence ', ' Asian Americans ', ' Assertiveness ', ' authoritarian ', ' Authoritarianism ', ' Behavior ', ' Belief ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Infant and Child Development ', ' Child Development ', ' childrearing ', ' Parenting behavior ', ' Parenting ', ' Child Rearing ', ' Conflict ', ' Conflict (Psychology) ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Environment ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Ethnic group ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' Family ', ' Fathers ', ' Goals ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Growth ', ' Health ', ' Illinois ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Income ', ' achievement Mainstream Education ', ' Educational Mainstreaming ', ' Mainstreaming ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Methods ', ' Mothers ', ' Paint ', ' parent offspring interaction ', ' parent child interaction ', ' Parent-Child Relationship ', ' Parent-Child Relations ', ' Parents ', ' Poverty ', ' preservation ', ' Biologic Preservation ', ' Biological Preservation ', ' Public Health ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Research ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Stereotyping ', ' United States ', ' Violence ', ' violent behavior ', ' violent ', ' Woman ', ' Asians ', ' oriental ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', ' Longitudinal Surveys ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Youth ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Chinese People ', ' Chinese ', ' Label ', ' improved ', ' psychological ', ' psychologic ', ' Training ', ' mental ', ' Psyche structure ', ' using substances ', ' substance using ', ' substance use ', ' AOD use ', ' Alcohol or Other Drugs use ', ' young adulthood ', ' adult youth ', ' young adult ', ' Immigrant ', ' Empirical Research ', ' Knowledge ', ' Adopted ', ' Investigation ', ' Complex ', ' Pattern ', ' Occupational ', ' American ', ' Performance ', ' Filipino American ', ' Korean American ', ' high school ', ' trait ', ' Negotiation ', ' Negotiating ', ' Mediation ', ' Academic achievement ', ' Reporting ', ' Modeling ', ' boys ', ' girls ', ' theories ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Data ', ' Indigenous ', ' Subgroup ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' Process ', ' depression and suicidality ', ' Depression and Suicide ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' suicide rate ', ' neglect ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' aged ', ' Family Process ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' emerging adulthood ', ' behavioral outcome ', ' behavior outcome ', ' ']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,R01,2016,638717,0.06685910949037294
"Enhancing Kidney Donation Through Live Organ Video Educated Donors (LOVED) DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Chronic Kidney Disease is diagnosed in four times as many African Americans (AAs) as Whites and nearly twice as many AAs perish from the condition. Kidney transplantation offers the best outcomes for patients with End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) but rates of procurement far outnumber cadaver organ availability, especially among AAs. A superior option is living donor kidney transplantation (LDKT). Since AAs comprise only 18.5% of LDKT recipients, innovative and culturally preferred strategies are needed to increase LDKT within the AA community. We hypothesize that a patient-centered, two tiered culturally sensitive education/motivation intervention targeting AA ESRD patients and potential donors (PDs) using mobile health (mHealth) technology will result in: 1) increased ESRD patients' willingness to ask for donation; 2) increased number of PDs who complete medical evaluation; and, 3) increased number of LDKTs. We will leverage mHealth technology as the delivery mechanism to maximize large scale dissemination potential. Guided by behavioral change and technology acceptability theories, the Live Organ Video Educated Donor [LOVED] program will be developed to address two domains. LOVED I will be tailored for AA ESRD patients and navigated by an AA LDKT recipient. LOVED II will be tailored for potential LDKT donors and navigated by an AA LDKT donor. iPad program delivery will include testimonial audio/video clips, home-work assignments, videoconferencing, chat room sessions, and text/emails. The proposed mixed methods research utilizes qualitative and quantitative studies in a 3 phase process of development that will involve: 1) Development of LOVED I and II technical content and delivery formats guided by behavioral and technological theories using 9 focus groups (8 per group) of AA LDKT recipients/donors, ESRD LDKT eligible patients, PDs who failed to complete screening and transplant healthcare provider team. 2) Conduct 3 month LOVED I and II proof of concept studies (LOVED I = 24 LDKT eligible patients; LOVED II = 24 PDs who did not complete screening) to assess program acceptability, feasibility, changes in self efficacy and attitudes. Also assessed will be % ESRD patients who identify PDs, % PDs who complete screening, % LDKTs and participants' perceptions of cultural competence of intervention including levels of trust, discrimination, shared decision making and literacy. 3) Conduct two 6 month 2-arm randomized control trials (LOVED I vs. standard of care, N=60; LOVED II vs. standard of care, N=80) to generate estimates needed for design of a large scale RCT. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Culturally sensitive programs are needed to increase African Americans' (AAs) LDKT rate. We will accomplish this with a user centered iterative development approach resulting in a two-tiered LDKT program led by AA LDKT recipients/donors. iPad program delivery will include videoconferencing, chat room sessions and viewing of testimonials from AA LDKT patients/donors relating how barriers and associated issues were resolved and AA celebrities' experiences of the benefits of LDKT.

"MicroRNAs in African American Prostate Cancer ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Prostate cancer (PCa) is the most common cancer in men in the United States, which disproportionately affects African Americans (AA) with higher incidence, advanced disease and worse prognosis. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are non-coding RNAs that represent universal gene regulatory mechanism exerting its effect primarily by binding to 3'UTR of target and affect cell survival, proliferation, cancer initiation, development and metastasis. We recently reported differential expression of miRNAs in PCa tissues and body fluids. In this proposal, we present preliminary data on selected two miRNAs that are downregulated in age/disease matched African American (AA) when compared with Caucasian (CA) PCa tissues. We present preliminary data on modulation cancer cell growth, migration, anoikis, angiogenesis and modulation of EMT signaling. We have preliminarily identified several miRNA targets that may explain miRNA mechanisms in PCa progression. We report miRNA modulation of JNK1-Sp1 signaling which is known to modulate angiogenesis and metastasis. We hypothesize that differential loss of selected microRNAs in AA PCa deregulates an intricate signaling network, leading to aggressive phenotype. Further these miRNAs could be used as biomarkers to distinguish between indolent vs. aggressive disease (predominant in AAs) and serve as novel therapeutic targets. The specific aims of this proposal are: (1) to study the clinical significance of microRNAs and their targets in age/race matched PCa tissues and their adjacent benign regions and disease staged PCa TMAs; (2) to validate miRNA targets and delineate signaling mechanisms by generating miRNA gene deletions in AA and CA prostate cells by genome editing using [Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR associated (CAS) nuclease Cas9); (3) Investigate the role of microRNAs in experimental prostate carcinogenesis in vitro and in vivo by studying their gain and loss of function in AA and CA prostate cancer cells and in vivo by examining the effects on tumor growth and metastasis in an orthotopic mouse model. Recognizing miRNAs as basis of PCa pathogenesis, disparity and understanding their biological implications will significantly impact diagnosis and treatment development for aggressive PCa common in African American men. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposal will characterize selected microRNAs that are downregulated in African American (AA) prostate cancer (PCa) tissues when compared with Caucasian (CA) PCa. Their characterization will provide basic mechanistic insights into their role in prostate carcinogenesis, as biomarker and therapeutic targets. In the long term, these studies could have significant public health consequences, as involvement of these miRNAs in AA PCa will support their development as molecular targets and biomarkers for early

"Enhancing Glaucoma Medication Adherence Among African Americans ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Glaucoma is the leading cause of irreversible blindness among African Americans (AA) who are more than three times more likely to develop glaucoma when compared to Caucasians. Changes associated with the progression of glaucoma can have a serious negative impact on an individual's quality of life, independence, and everyday functioning. Accumulating research indicates that pressure-reducing eye drops can significantly delay or prevent the onset of disease; however, such preventative efforts have been found to be limited due to problems with poor medication adherence. Lacking are available health promotion interventions that minimize this important health disparity. Thus, in our research program, we demonstrated this health disparity for glaucoma medication adherence (Dreer et al., 2012). Next, we conducted several follow-up studies in order to develop a culturally relevant and informed, health promotion-based intervention to improve glaucoma medication adherence among AA's. As part of the intervention development process, we conducted several focus groups with AA glaucoma patients to elicit the salient barriers and facilitators related to glaucoma medication adherence, and then formed a community-based participatory research team comprised of AA's with glaucoma (Dreer et al., 2013). The resulting intervention was based on a multi-component empowerment framework that includes glaucoma education, motivational interviewing, and problem-solving training to improve glaucoma medication adherence. We recently pilot tested the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of the intervention among AA's. Findings revealed significant improvements in objective medication adherence (Dreer et al., under review). Therefore, we now propose to further evaluate the efficacy of this intervention for improving glaucoma medication adherence among AA patients in a large-scale randomized clinical trial (RCT).  The patient population for the RCT will consist of 240 adult AA's with glaucoma and who are aged = 21 years who seek services at the University of Alabama at Birmingham's Glaucoma Clinic within the Department of Ophthalmology. The RCT will have two treatment arms; patients will be randomized following eligibility determination and written informed consent. The usual care only arm will consist of the standard medical care for glaucoma (medicine, laser trabeculoplasty, conventional surgery, or a combination of any of these). The second arm will consist of usual care as just described plus the culturally relevant, health promotion-based intervention. The primary outcome (objective glaucoma medication adherence) and secondary outcomes will be assessed at baseline before intervention initiation and at 3, 7, and 12-month in-clinic follow-up visits by a research interviewer masked to subjects' randomization. The practical question to be addressed is does a culturally relevant, health promotion-based intervention improve glaucoma medication adherence among a high-risk segment of the population? Information from this project will be particularly useful for AA's with glaucoma, their families, and eye care providers. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Poor adherence to glaucoma therapy is a significant healthcare issue that may result in unwarranted changes in medications, increased healthcare expenditure, risk to the patient if surgical intervention is required and further deterioration of vision, all of which can be prevented. This can subsequently have a negative impact on an individual's quality life, independence, and everyday living. The multifaceted and culturally relevant, health promotion-based intervention, lacking in this area, is designed to take critical steps toward addressing this problem by motivating change for healthy lifestyle behaviors and improving problem-solving strategies to better manage barriers related to glaucoma medication adherence, particularly among African American patients who are at greater risk for glaucoma and poor adherence compared to Caucasians.",Enhancing Glaucoma Medication Adherence Among African Americans,9070592,R01EY025331,"['adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Alabama ', ' Awareness ', ' Behavior ', ' Belief ', ' Control Groups ', ' Diagnosis ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' electronic device ', ' Electronics ', ' Elements ', ' Protocol Screening ', ' Eligibility ', ' Eligibility Determination ', ' Expenditure ', ' Eyeball ', ' Eye ', ' ophthalmopathy ', ' eye disorder ', ' Eye diseases ', ' Eye Drops ', ' Eyedrops ', ' Family ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Future ', ' glaucomatous ', ' Glaucoma ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' Health Promotion ', ' Informed Consent ', ' Interviewer ', ' Language ', ' Laser Radiation ', ' Laser Electromagnetic ', ' Lasers ', ' Literature ', ' Masks ', ' Medicine ', ' Ophthalmology ', ' Optometries ', ' Optometry ', ' Paper ', ' Patient Training ', ' Patient Instruction ', ' Patient Education ', ' Patients ', ' Perception ', ' pressure ', ' Problem Solving ', ' Publishing ', ' QOL ', ' Quality of life ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Research ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Research Design ', ' Risk ', ' Socioeconomic Factors ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Trabeculoplasty ', ' Trabeculectomy ', ' Universities ', ' Vision ', ' visual function ', ' Sight ', ' Caucasians ', ' white race ', ' Occidental ', ' Caucasoid Race ', ' Caucasoid ', ' Caucasian Race ', ' Caucasian ', ' Writing ', ' Generations ', ' Measures ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Schedule ', ' Treatment Cost ', ' Caring ', ' Journals ', ' Magazine ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Medical ', ' Randomized Clinical Trials ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Sample Size ', ' Disease Progression ', ' disorder onset ', ' disease onset ', ' Onset of illness ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Disorder Management ', ' Disease Management ', ' programs ', ' Clinic ', ' visual loss ', ' vision loss ', ' Blindness ', ' Test Result ', ' surgery ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' interest ', ' Visit ', ' Services ', ' experience ', ' skills ', ' empowerment ', ' race differences ', ' racial difference ', ' motivational interview ', ' motivational enhancement therapy ', ' feeling upset ', ' feeling distress ', ' emotional distress ', ' Deterioration ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Provider ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Preparedness ', ' Readiness ', ' Address ', ' Dose ', ' Adherence ', ' Data ', ' Effectiveness of Interventions ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Randomized ', ' Clinical Trials Design ', ' Conventional Surgery ', ' Preparation ', ' Process ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socio-economically ', ' socio-economic ', ' socioeconomics ', ' medication adherence ', ' drug compliance ', ' drug adherence ', ' medication compliance ', ' underserved people ', ' under served population ', ' Underserved Population ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Treatment Efficacy ', ' therapy efficacy ', ' therapeutically effective ', ' therapeutic efficacy ', ' intervention efficacy ', ' coping ', ' blind ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' 21 year old ', ' twenty-one year old ', ' age 21 years ', ' age 21 ', ' community based participatory research ', ' participatory action research ', ' community based research ', ' community based design ', ' therapy development ', ' treatment development ', ' intervention development ', ' develop therapy ', ' vision science ', ' visual science ', ' high risk ', ' patient population ', ' primary outcome ', ' secondary outcome ', ' treatment as usual ', ' usual care ', ' arm ', ' healthy lifestyle ', ' treatment group ', ' ']",NEI,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,R01,2016,367500,0.06606190269712187
"Race - adiposity interactions regulate mechanisms determining insulin sensitivity DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Project summary. Insulin resistance plays a major role in the etiology of chronic metabolic diseases, many of which differ with race/ethnicity. Previous studies using mainly indirect methods suggest that insulin sensitivity is lower in African-Americans (AA) vs. European-Americans (EA). However, results are discrepant, differing with the method used and the obesity status of the participants. Our preliminary data using the reference standard glucose clamp indicate that in lean individuals, insulin sensitivity i lower among AA, while in obese individuals, insulin sensitivity is higher among AA. We hypothesize that this race/body mass index (BMI) interaction may be explained in part by significantly lower visceral/hepatic adiposity in AA that results in less impairment of insulin sensitivity among obese AA individuals. Conversely, we hypothesize that inherently greater oxidative stress impairs insulin sensitivity in AA, explaining lower insulin sensitivity in lean AA vs. EA. This is based on our preliminary data indicating that a circulating marker of cumulative oxidative stress was significantly associated with insulin-stimulated glucose disposal in AA but not EA, and that production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in vitro was greater in AA vs. EA. We propose to test these hypotheses by prospectively comparing skeletal muscle and hepatic insulin sensitivity in healthy lean, overweight, and obese AA and EA using the hyperinsulinemic isoglycemic glucose clamp with tracer-labeled glucose. Analysis of ancestral genetic admixture will permit simultaneous assessment of the contribution of ancestry to main outcomes. With our first aim, we will test the hypothesis that a significant race-by-BMI interaction will be detected n skeletal muscle and hepatic insulin sensitivity, such that at low BMI AA are less insulin sensitive but at high BMI AA are more insulin sensitive, when compared with EA. The second aim will test the hypothesis that at high BMI, AA will have greater hepatic and skeletal muscle insulin sensitivity due to lower hepatic and visceral fat. The third aim will test the hypothesis that greater bioenergetic efficiency and ROS production within skeletal muscle mitochondria will be associated with lower skeletal muscle insulin sensitivity in lean AA. A secondary aim will test the hypothesis that skeletal muscle and hepatic insulin sensitivity are better associated with adipokines, cytokines, lipids, blood pressure, and vascular function in EA than in AA. Relevance. Results from this study elucidating why the underlying pathophysiology of insulin resistance differs with genetic background may guide development of personalized treatment strategies with implications for several chronic metabolic diseases (e.g., type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and cancer). PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We will test the hypothesis that the underlying pathophysiology of insulin resistance differs with genetic background. We predict that insulin resistance will occur secondary to visceral and hepatic obesity in European Americans, but is driven by inherently greater oxidative stress in African Americans. Results from this study may guide the development of individualized treatment strategies for prevention and reversal of insulin resistance, and may have implications for a race-specific role of insulin resistance in the etiology of chronic metabolic disease.",Race - adiposity interactions regulate mechanisms determining insulin sensitivity,9115157,R01DK096388,"['adulthood ', ' Adult Human ',

"African American Families Fighting Parental Cancer Together ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    In 2014, an estimated 1.2 million parents of school age children will be newly diagnosed with cancer in the U.S.  2 Parental cancer causes significant emotional distress in both diagnosed parents and their children. African 3 American (AA) adults experience a disproportionate burden of solid tumor cancers (e.g., breast, prostate, colo- 4 rectal, and lung) which puts AA adolescents; a vulnerable population to begin with, at high risks for parental cancer 5 related distresses. Treatments have been somewhat successful for younger school age children (ages 7-12) of 6 cancer patients but most treatment studies have included white middle class samples. Differences in attitudes, 7 daily functioning and levels of distress among different ethnic and racial groups are well-documented, yet few 8 culturally sensitive family intervention programs have been developed for AA families coping with cancer.  9 Building on the PI's previous studies with AA families coping with parental cancer, we propose to conduct a 10 randomized control trial to address this gap. We will evaluate the efficacy of a culturally sensitive family-based 11 intervention that targets the parent-child relationship in AA families coping with the impact of solid tumor parent- 12 tal cancer. We will randomize 172 AA families coping with parental cancer to either Families Fighting Cancer 13 Together (FFCT) or to parent psycho-education (TAU). Both manualized treatments include 5 bi-monthly ses- 14 sions over 10 weeks. Subjects will be African American parents diagnosed in the past 12 months with Stage I, 15 II, or III solid tumor cancers with at least one child between the ages of 12 and 18 living at home. Patients will 16 be recruited from 3 large urban cancer centers where there is an estimated 500 eligible low to middle income 17 AA cancer patients a year. Family assessments will be done at baseline, post-treatment (10 weeks), 6-month, 18 and 12-month follow-up. The proposed R01 research has the following aims: Aim 1: Compare the efficacy of 19 FFCT to TAU in reducing depressive symptoms (CDI) in AA adolescents at post-treatment and long term out- 20 come (6 and 12-month follow-up). Aim 2: Compare the efficacy of FFCT to TAU in reducing parental stress 21 (PCQ: parental stress related to coping with cancer) in AA parents at post-treatment and long term outcome (6 22 and 12-month follow-up). Exploratory Aims: 1. Explore whether moderators identified in white samples have a 23 similar impact on treatment in AA samples. Specifically, we will examine: a) perceived level of group support, 24 b) gender and age of adolescent, c) parent's marital status, d) SES, and e) stage of parent's cancer on the im- 25 pact of treatment. 2. Explore whether changes in parent-child attachment and communication mediate the as- 26 association between treatment and adolescent depressive symptoms (CDI) and anxiety (RCMAS) at 6 and12- 27 month follow-up. Treatments to help adolescents cope with the impact of parental cancer are needed, particu- 28 larly those designed to reach low-income AA populations. If the proposed research is successful, it will change 29 the nature of treatment support options available to a group that is overrepresented and underserved by exist- 30 ing interventions and reduce potentially harmful distress among AA adolescents. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:   This project directly addresses cancer health disparities, which is relevant to NCI's mission. Treatments to help adolescents cope with the impact of parental cancer are urgently needed, particularly those designed to reach low-income African American populations. Developing an effective and transportable family-based intervention for this population could improve developmental adjustment to this significant life stressor at a critical point in the lives of African American adolescents.",African American Families Fighting Parental Cancer Together,9327199,R01CA194178,"['adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' post treatment ', ' After-Treatment ', ' After Care ', ' Aftercare ', ' Age ', ' Anxiety ', ' Attitude ', ' Breast ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Cognition ', ' Communication ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Family ', ' Health ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Income ', ' pulmonary ', ' Lung Respiratory System ', ' Lung ', ' Marital Status ', ' Mission ', ' Tumor Staging ', ' Neoplasm Staging ', ' Cancer Staging ', ' Diagnostic Neoplasm Staging ', ' parent offspring interaction ', ' parent child interaction ', ' Parent-Child Relationship ', ' Parent-Child Relations ', ' Parents ', ' Patients ', ' Prostatic Gland ', ' Prostate Gland ', ' Prostate ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' recruit ', ' active recruitment ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' Research ', ' Stress ', ' Time ', ' Gender ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' depressive symptoms ', ' depressive ', ' depression symptom ', ' Emotional Depression ', ' Mediating ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Youth ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Intention ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' rectal ', ' Clinical ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Adolescent ', ' Distress ', ' African ', ' school age ', ' School-Age Population ', ' Solid Tumor ', ' Solid Neoplasm ', ' instructional intervention ', ' Training Intervention ', ' Instruction Intervention ', ' Education for Intervention ', ' Educational Intervention ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' Staging ', ' sadness ', ' depressed ', ' Depressed mood ', ' Nature ', ' Life ', ' fighting ', ' Home ', ' Home environment ', ' colorectum ', ' colo-rectal ', ' Colon or Rectum ', ' Colorectal ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' stressor ', ' intervention program ', ' Prevention program ', ' feeling upset ', ' feeling distress ', ' emotional distress ', ' Sampling ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' Low income ', ' Address ', ' Population Intervention ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Randomized ', ' Cancer Center ', ' Cancer Cause ', ' Cancer Etiology ', ' Cancer Patient ', ' Newly Diagnosed ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' youth depression ', ' pediatric depression ', ' depression in adolescence ', ' depressed adolescents ', ' childhood onset depression ', ' childhood depression ', ' adolescents with depression ', ' adolescent depression ', ' child depression ', ' daily functioning ', ' Outcome ', ' coping ', ' Population ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' disparity in cancer ', ' cancer disparity ', ' treatment effect ', ' high risk ', ' treatment as usual ', ' usual care ', ' group support ', ' comparative efficacy ', ' compare efficacy ', ' Cultural Sensitivity ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF DELAWARE,R01,2016,594309,0.07267878577306629
"Smartphone-Delivered, Diabetes-Modified Behavioral Activation Treatment (Smartphone DM-BAT) in AAs With T2DM The proposed K24 renewal application is designed to support the career and research trajectory of the candidate by providing protected time to conduct patient-oriented research on interventions to reduce complications and deaths from diabetes in ethnic minority groups and mentor the next generation of women and minority clinical investigators in health disparities research. In the first 5 years of the current K24 grant, the candidate has trained 40 mentees including: 7 faculty, 2 post-docs, 2 doctoral students, 1 fellow, and 17 medical students. He has 147 abstracts/presentations and 156 peer-reviewed publications with mentees. In addition, in the past 5 years, he submitted 27 grants with mentees of which 10 were funded. The specific aims of the proposed K24 renewal application will be accomplished by completing the following three objectives: Mentoring Objective: To increase the pool of clinical researchers who can conduct patient-oriented research and successfully compete for peer-reviewed grants, as well as mentor the next generation of women and minority clinical investigators, who are engaged in the national effort to reduce and eliminate health care disparities. This will be accomplished by mentoring 2 women/minority investigators each year for 5 years. Career Development Objective: To obtain additional training in leadership, health economics, and health informatics that would greatly enhance the candidate's research capability and make him a more effective mentor to trainees in clinical research. This will be accomplished by completing 4 courses a year in leadership, health economics, and health informatics Research Objective: The primary objective is to test the efficacy of the Smartphone DM-BAT intervention comprised of smartphone-delivered, diabetes-modified behavioral activation treatment (education, skills training and behavior activation), home monitoring with feedback (FORA home telemonitoring system) and care delivered by nurse educators in improving HbA1c levels in AAs with poorly controlled T2DM. The secondary objectives are to test the efficacy of the Smartphone DM-BAT intervention in improving BP control and quality of life in AAs with poorly controlled T2DM. Exploratory analyses will examine the role of process (information, motivation, self-efficacy, depression) and behavioral measures (diet, exercise and medication adherence) as mediators of metabolic control. Mentorship is an important component of career advancement in academic medicine. Several studies have established that lack of mentoring is a reason for poor career advancement and attrition, particularly among women and minority faculty. The candidate who has a track record of mentoring women and minority faculty would benefit from the protected time for mentoring afforded by the proposed K24 renewal award, while allowing continued research to eliminate disparities in diabetes.

"A Faith-Based Partnership to Address Obesity in African American families DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): ABSTRACT Obesity continues to be highly prevalent in the African American (AA) population, affecting nearly 40% of AA men and a staggering 59% of AA women. Unfortunately this trend is also present in AA children and adolescents; recent data indicate obesity prevalence in AA children and adolescents (age 2 - 19) to be 24.3% compared to 16.1% of non-Hispanic whites. Given some evidence that obesity spreads through social ties, including families, such that there is an increased risk of obesity among children when a parent is obese, developing effective family-based approaches to improving obesity and its related behaviors is paramount. Collaborative partnerships between academic institutions and faith-based organizations, specifically churches, may be one of the most optimal mediums for intervention development. The proposed conference grant seeks to lay the groundwork for the development of strategies to address family-based obesity in the AA community by leveraging the faith community. This will be accomplished by expanding an existing research partnership between The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center (MD Anderson) and Windsor Village United Methodist Church (WVUMC) - Creating a Higher Understanding of Cancer Research & Community Health (CHURCH). Specifically, we will: 1) enhance an existing faith-based-academic partnership to address family obesity and obesity- related behaviors in the African American community; 2) strengthen the capacity of partnership stakeholders and the local community to actively participate in the partnership through capacity building opportunities; 3) assess congregational and community interest in obesity and obesity-related behaviors in African Americans; and 4) develop a community-driven research agenda focused on addressing obesity in faith-based settings). To meet these aims we will invite community partners to join an academic-community-faith-based partnership, develop an organizational structure for the partnership and strengthen partnership through capacity building. We will conduct a community needs assessment focused on church- based factors that influence implementation of obesity programs and concerns and needs of AA youth, adults and church leadership with regards to obesity and its related behaviors. We will implement health education derived from community assessments, solicit feedback, and develop a project concept for future development into a grant application. Our goal is that the successful completion of this conference grant series will result in: 1) an expanded academic, faith-based partnership with the capacity to be leaders and a driving force to eliminate disparities in AA obesity in Houston and potentially nationally (Aims  & 2); 2) a comprehensive assessment of the strengths and needs of AA families and faith- based organizations to address obesity (Aim 3); and 3) a community-driven agenda in the form of project concepts, future grants, and sustained Partnership beyond the life of the conference series grant (Aim 4). PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed project builds on a successful community-academic partnership between MD Anderson Cancer Center and Windsor Village United Methodist Church (WVUMC) in Houston, TX.

"Circadian Genes and Adipose Function: Impact of Chronotype, Obesity and Race DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There has been an alarming increase in the prevalence of obesity in the United States, but women, in particular African Americans, have been especially hard it. It is thus crucial to identify novel pathways that mediate the increase prevalence of insulin resistance associated with obesity. Disturbances of the circadian clock system in peripheral tissues have emerged as a putative novel risk factor for weight gain and insulin resistance. While the cross-talk between the circadian system and metabolism has been well-documented in nocturnal animal models, in which, contrary to the human, the active period is aligned with high melatonin levels and elevated neuronal activity in the suprachiasmatic nucleus. The potential role of alterations in peripheral clock function in adipose tissue in promoting adiposity-related insulin resistance in women has not been elucidated. Additionally, bariatric surgery has emerged as a frontline treatment with over 200,000 procedures being performed in the US annually. In an ongoing collaboration with a bariatric surgeon, we have obtained preliminary evidence that bariatric surgery rapidly improves insulin action in primary human adipocytes. The central hypothesis of this application is that the reduction in insulin sensitivity in adipose tissue is mediated by alterations in the circadian expression of clock and metabolic genes, and that these disturbances are more pronounced in obese AA women versus non-Hispanic white (NHW) women. Subcutaneous fat biopsies from obese AA and NHW human volunteers will be collected 2 weeks prior to surgery, as well as from matched lean control women. Circadian gene expression will be measured in cultured adipose tissue over a 24 hr period and compared to the systemic insulin sensitivity and chronotype of each individual. During the week prior to surgery, bedtimes and mealtimes will be standardized for half of the obese subjects to determine the impact of central circadian alignment on peripheral circadian gene expression in subcutaneous and mesenteric fat collected at the start of the bariatric procedure. Finally, surgical patients will return 2 and 12 weeks post-surgery before long term weight loss has occurred and subcutaneous fat biopsies will be collected. At 2 weeks, we will determine if the rapid improvement in insulin sensitivity in adipose tissue is commensurate with improvement in the phase and amplitude of circadian gene expression in NHW and AA women. At 12 weeks, when normal meal schedules have resumed but patients remain obese, we will elucidate if bariatric surgery causes an earlier chronotype, which is associated with protection from the development of metabolic disease. At both time points, we will determine if the decreased long term efficacy of bariatric surgery in AA women is concomitant with a reduction in the restoration of peripheral circadian gene expression in adipose tissue. These studies should provide novel and important insights into the interplay of changes in peripheral circadian gene expression and insulin sensitivity that occurs in obesity in NHW and AA women, and may also lead to novel therapeutic interventions to reverse the current racial disparities in the prevalence of metabolic disease in women. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Women are at higher risk of becoming obese, particularly African American women who are 70% more likely to be obese than Non-Hispanic White women. We will test the central hypothesis that the reduction in insulin sensitivity in fat cells o obese women is mediated by perturbations in the daily cycle of gene expression. Furthermore, we will determine the beneficial impact of behavioral adjustment (scheduled sleep and meal times) or bariatric surgery on insulin responsiveness in human adipose tissue samples and explore any racial disparities in the responses obtained.","Circadian Genes and Adipose Function: Impact of Chronotype, Obesity and Race",9115611,R01DK103014,"['yellow adipose tissue ', ' white

"A new approach to controlling chlamydia transmission in young people Abstract Chlamydia trachomatis (Ct) is the most commonly reported sexually transmitted infection in the U.S., is a major cause of infertility, pelvic inflammatory disease and ectopic pregnancy among women and has been associated with increased HIV acquisition. Because women experience the most severe sequelae, the focus of Ct prevention in the U.S. has been on screening sexually active women < 25 years old. Though men are reservoirs of the infection, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have not recommended targeting men due to lack of evidence for this approach. This research will fill this gap. African American (AA) women are 7.5 times more likely to be infected with Ct than whites, thus AA are the focus of this research. We hypothesize that screening AA men is essential to curbing the high rates of Ct among young AA women and that a bundled approach will by synergistic. Our community-based pilot program, called “Check it,” is a pilot- tested male screening program which targeted AA men aged 15-25. At the core of this intervention is male Ct screening, but it is also bundled with other evidence-based and best practices for Ct control including: venue- based sampling (VBS), social network peer referral, modest monetary incentives (MMI), screening of target men, rescreening of target men found to be Ct positive with text reminders (Text-RS) , expedited treatment for index men (EIT) and for the partners (EPT), and Wed-based education (Web-Ed). The goal of this study is to examine the effectiveness of a pilot-tested, bundled Ct prevention program focusing on screening young AA men for the prevention of Ct among young AA women: Aim 1. To determine the impact of Check it on women's Ct rates – This aim has a formative phase and an intervention phase. In the formative phase, the pilot Check it is developed and manualized. In the intervention, Check it is implemented and evaluated. We hypothesize that, post-intervention, Ct rates among AA women in the intervention community will be significantly lower compared to rates in the control communities, and that Check it will result in high rates of index/partner treatment and rescreening. Aim 2. To model the potential impact and optimal coverage needed - Using inputs from this study and the literature, a deterministic population-based epidemiological model will be used to model the number of cases averted by Check it and to determine the potential impact at different intensities of the intervention. Aim 3. To determine the cost effectiveness of Check it - Time motion studies will be conducted and used as inputs for the cost-benefit/effectiveness analysis of the Check it Program in order to distinguish study from program costs. If Check it is found to be effective as hypothesized, we will conduct future translational research to disseminate the program. This research has the potential for practical application by improving reproductive health and high impact by removing disparities in the control of Ct among AA men. . Public Health Significance Rates of Chlamydia trachomatis (Ct), a major cause of reproductive morbidity and potential facilitator of HIV transmission, are 7 times higher among African American (AA) women compared to white women constituting an alarming health disparity. The present approach of screening women only is not working and screening men, the reservoirs of infection, should be considered. The goal of this research is to test the effectiveness (measured, potential and cost) and to translate “Check it”, which is a pilot-tested, bundled seek, test and treat intervention targeting young African American men to reduce infections in young AA women.  ",A new approach to controlling chlamydia transmission in young people,9185729,R01HD086794,"['abstracting ', ' Affect ', ' post treatment ', ' After-Treatment ', ' After Care ', ' Aftercare ', ' Awareness ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' CDC ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' Charge ', ' bedsonia ', ' Miyagawanella ', ' Chlamydia ', ' Rickettsia trachomae ', ' Chlamydia trachomatis ', ' Communities ', ' Community Pharmacy ', ' cost benefit effectiveness ', ' cost benefit economics ', ' Cost Benefit Analyses ', ' Cost-Benefit Analysis ', ' cost effectiveness ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Hair ', ' Health ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' Incentives ', ' indexing ', ' Infection ', ' unable to bear children ', ' infertile ', ' fertility loss ', ' fertility cessation ', ' Difficulty conceiving ', ' Cannot achieve a pregnancy ', ' Infertility ', ' Literature ', ' male ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Persons ', ' extrauterine pregnancy ', ' Ectopic Pregnancy ', ' Public Health ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' sex partner ', ' Sexual Partners ', ' Venereal Infections ', ' Venereal Disorders ', ' Venereal Diseases ', ' Sexually Transmitted Infection ', ' Sexually Transmitted Disorder ', ' Sexually Transmitted Diseases ', ' Target Populations ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Time and Motion Studies ', ' Translating ', ' Transportation ', ' Urine ', ' Urine Urinary System ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Social Network ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Phase ', ' Trust ', ' sexually active ', ' Pelvic Inflammatory Disease ', ' Fostering ', ' Logistics ', ' Reproductive Health ', ' Community Networks ', ' programs ', ' Clinic ', ' experience ', ' Participant ', ' disease prevention ', ' disorder prevention ', ' Prevention program ', ' peer ', ' Prevention ', ' Reporting ', ' medical examination ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' stigma ', ' social stigma ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Legal ', ' Educational Materials ', ' High Prevalence ', ' translation research enterprise ', ' translation research ', ' Translational Science ', ' Translational Research Enterprise ', ' Translational Research ', ' Transmission ', ' transmission process ', ' Text ', ' Behavioral ', ' post intervention ', ' cost ', ' community intervention ', ' epidemiological model ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel approaches ', ' new approaches ', ' novel strategies ', ' cost effective ', ' cost-effective ', ' aged ', ' man ', "" man's "", ' practical application ', ' application in practice ', ' community organizations ', ' effectiveness measure ', ' evidence base ', ' population based ', ' young man ', ' adolescent men ', ' adolescent man ', ' screening ', ' reproductive morbidity ', ' ']",NICHD,TULANE UNIVERSITY OF LOUISIANA,R01,2016,611305,0.11128796825787918
"Racial Disparity of microRNA in Hepatitis C Virus Mediated Hepatocellularcarcinoma ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Hepatitis C virus (HCV) mediated end stage liver disease, including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), is a growing problem among African Americans (AAs). The central goal of this project is to investigate the racial disparity of HCV mediated liver cancer. HCV infection mediated death rate among AA patients is about 2- fold higher than CA. Very little information is available about the underlying mechanisms of liver disease progression among chronically HCV infected ethnic groups. Our research proposal will examine this previously unexplored area of HCV mediated end stage liver disease among AA. microRNAs (miRNAs) play critical roles in multi-step cell growth regulatory processes, and the relationship between chronic HCV infection and miRNA expression is of considerable interest in understanding virus mediated disease progression. Our preliminary data indicated a group of microRNAs modulated in chronically HCV infected AA sera as compared to that of CA. We hypothesize that these circulatory miRNAs can be potential predictive biomarker towards HCC development in HCV infected AA patients, and are involved deregulating hepatocyte growth. Thus, identification of predictive biomarkers for HCC and the underlying molecular mechanisms for race disparity will have a great translational benefit. Our long term objectives are to translae these findings from the laboratory to the bedside identifying predictive biomarker, and developing therapeutic modalities for HCV mediated liver disease progression. Impact: The results from this R21 exploratory proposal will have a high impact by investigating the role of miRNAs as genetic factors for understating racial disparity. Our research will explain why African Americans have higher incidence of HCV mediated liver cancer as compared to Caucasians.

"DNA methylation biomarkers of scleroderma-associated interstitial lung disease DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Interstitial lung disease (ILD) is a major complication and the leading cause of mortality in scleroderma (SSc, systemic sclerosis). In addition, patients of African ancestry suffer from higher morbidity and mortality rates. The etiology of SSc, including the reasons underlying the wide variation in disease progression and severity remain unknown. For these reasons, it is important to understand the mechanisms through which SSc-ILD develops that may explain the racial differences in SSc-ILD outcomes. The low concordance rate between monozygotic twins suggests an important role for epigenetic or environmental factors in SSc susceptibility. Since it is influenced by the environment, epigenetic variation, inherited both directly and through shared environmental effects, may play an important role in SSc-ILD risk. Evidence suggests that epigenetic changes play an important role in the development of autoimmunity. These epigenetic markers have the potential to serve as biomarkers for the development and progression of SSc-ILD. The hypothesis of this study is that epigenetic factors are a significant contributor to severity of SSc-ILD in African-American (AA) patients. Its goal is to identify DNA methylation loci as biomarkers of SSc-ILD and its severity, which supports the long-term goal to delineate the role of DNA methylation in SSc risk and severity. This application proposes three specific aims: 1) comprehensive identification of differentially methylated cytosines (DMCs) and regions (DMRs) associated with SSc-ILD and its severity in AAs, 2) test if the most significant DMCs and DMRs are associated with genetic variation, and 3) test if the most significant DMCs and DMRs are associated with gene expression levels. Alveolar macrophages will be isolated from bronchoalveolar lavage on 34 AA SSc-ILD patients and 26 AA controls. Reduced representation bisulfite sequencing will be performed and DMCs and DMRs associated with SSc-ILD and disease severity will be identified. The 5 most significant DMCs/DMRs will be selected for genetic and expression studies. These results have the potential to identify DNA methylation loci as biomarkers of SSc-ILD and disease severity, thus contributing to an increased understanding of the molecular mechanisms of SSc-ILD and ultimately may lead to the development of effective diagnostics, prognostics and therapies. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Interstitial lung disease (ILD) is a major complication and the leading cause of mortality in scleroderma (or systemic sclerosis (SSc)). Given the higher morbidity and mortality rates in African American (AA) SSc patients, it is imperative to understand the reasons for this health disparity.

"Targeted Analyses of Jackson Heart Study Data DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Jackson Heart Study (JHS) was designed to collect clinical, laboratory, imaging, genetic, and environmental data that could provide insights into the determinants and development of cardiovascular and related diseases in African Americans (AA) residing in the Jackson, MS community.  Between 2000 and 2012, 5301 AA men and women participated at a baseline and two additional clinic examinations.  Obesity and diabetes are important contributors to cardiovascular outcomes and the overall health disparities observed between AAs and whites in the United States. Both conditions are highly prevalent among those enrolled in JHS. The overall goal of this proposal is to enhance the scientific output of the JHS with respect to obesity/diabetes and its cardiometabolic and vascular outcomes.  We propose to conduct in-depth cross- sectional and longitudinal analyses of obesity and glucometabolic parameters, and select outcomes (incident diabetes, subclinical and clinical cardiovascular disease) by engaging scientists in the newly established JHS Obesity Diabetes Working Group (ODWG).  The ODWG will function as a virtual team, utilizing a combination of teleconferences, in person meetings, and internet-based file sharing tools, and will include Wake Forest, JHS and other interested investigators and trainees. The investigative team includes expertise in epidemiology, biostatistics, imaging, diabetes, obesity, and cardiovascular disease.  We also have an extant relationship with JHS as Wake Forest served as the reading center for the CT and MRI studies performed at exams 2 and 3. A focus of ODWG activities includes mentoring junior investigators and trainees. We also expect that analysis and dissemination of these data will spur the application for separate funding for ancillary studies. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This research seeks to better understand obesity and diabetes in African American adults by establishing a  working group to analyze obesity and diabetes-related data collected by the Jackson Heart Study in 5301  African American men and women.

"MicroRNAs in African American Prostate Cancer ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Prostate cancer (PCa) is the most common cancer in men in the United States, which disproportionately affects African Americans (AA) with higher incidence, advanced disease and worse prognosis. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are non-coding RNAs that represent universal gene regulatory mechanism exerting its effect primarily by binding to 3'UTR of target and affect cell survival, proliferation, cancer initiation, development and metastasis. We recently reported differential expression of miRNAs in PCa tissues and body fluids. In this proposal, we present preliminary data on selected two miRNAs that are downregulated in age/disease matched African American (AA) when compared with Caucasian (CA) PCa tissues. We present preliminary data on modulation cancer cell growth, migration, anoikis, angiogenesis and modulation of EMT signaling. We have preliminarily identified several miRNA targets that may explain miRNA mechanisms in PCa progression. We report miRNA modulation of JNK1-Sp1 signaling which is known to modulate angiogenesis and metastasis. We hypothesize that differential loss of selected microRNAs in AA PCa deregulates an intricate signaling network, leading to aggressive phenotype. Further these miRNAs could be used as biomarkers to distinguish between indolent vs. aggressive disease (predominant in AAs) and serve as novel therapeutic targets. The specific aims of this proposal are: (1) to study the clinical significance of microRNAs and their targets in age/race matched PCa tissues and their adjacent benign regions and disease staged PCa TMAs; (2) to validate miRNA targets and delineate signaling mechanisms by generating miRNA gene deletions in AA and CA prostate cells by genome editing using [Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR associated (CAS) nuclease Cas9); (3) Investigate the role of microRNAs in experimental prostate carcinogenesis in vitro and in vivo by studying their gain and loss of function in AA and CA prostate cancer cells and in vivo by examining the effects on tumor growth and metastasis in an orthotopic mouse model. Recognizing miRNAs as basis of PCa pathogenesis, disparity and understanding their biological implications will significantly impact diagnosis and treatment development for aggressive PCa common in African American men. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposal will characterize selected microRNAs that are downregulated in African American (AA) prostate cancer (PCa) tissues when compared with Caucasian (CA) PCa. Their characterization will provide basic mechanistic insights into their role in prostate carcinogenesis, as biomarker and therapeutic targets. In the long term, these studies could have significant public health consequences, as involvement of these miRNAs in AA PCa will support their development as molecular targets and biomarkers for early detection, prevention and treatment of aggressive PCa common in AA men.",MicroRNAs in African American Prostate Cancer,9301388,U01CA194730,"['Affect ', ' Age ', ' Aggression ', ' Aggressive behavior

"Improving Resection Rates among African Americans with NSCLC PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT. Surgical resection is the standard-of-care for patients with early stage lung cancer, and multiple published studies have shown that improvements in resection rates translate into improvements in overall survival. African Americans (AAs) with early stage, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) are significantly less likely than European Americans (EAs) to undergo resection, even when controlling for age, comorbidity, tumor stage, socioeconomic status, insurance status, and surgical consultation. This racial disparity is particularly pronounced in South Carolina (SC). Investigators at the National Cancer Institute-designated Medical University of South Carolina Hollings Cancer Center (MUSC HCC) hypothesize that a dynamic, [statewide], patient navigation intervention will reduce potential barriers to surgical cancer care and improve resection rates among AAs with early stage NSCLC. The patient navigation intervention will be tested in a two-arm, cluster- randomized trial comparing the intervention versus [usual care] in a sample of 200 AAs in SC with Stage I or II NSCLC. Study participants will be recruited from six geographically diverse study sites within a [statewide] cancer Clinical Trials Network (CTN) coordinated by MUSC, and participants will be cluster-randomized by CTN site. The investigators will further evaluate the modifying effects of income and urban-rural residence on the relationships between the intervention and the main study outcome (receipt of surgery), as well as [receipt of surgical consultation], time to resection, [time to death (survival)], health-related quality of life, state anxiety, perceived self-efficacy in patient-physician interaction, trust in physicians, and satisfaction with the treatment decision made. The proposed research is highly significant for many reasons. First, lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death in the United States (US) and SC. Second, less than half of AAs in SC with early stage NSCLC undergo surgical resection, and the median survival of AAs with early stage NSCLC is consistently lower than that of EAs. Third, SC has a large AA population (approximately 30%), has urban as well as large rural geographic areas, and has wide income distributions. A [statewide] patient navigation intervention to enhance access to surgical therapy for AAs with NSCLC could lead to significant improvements in care and reductions in racial disparities in lung cancer outcomes [across wide geographic and socioeconomic strata] in SC, as well as in other communities across the US. PROJECT NARRATIVE. Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer deaths in the US; however, while surgical resection is the optimal treatment for localized, early stage lung cancer, less than half of the African Americans (AAs) diagnosed with this disease undergo surgical resection. This study will test whether a [statewide] patient navigation intervention improves receipt of surgical resection, [receipt of surgical consultation], reduces time to surgery and [improves survival] in AAs with early stage disease, and it may uncover modifiable root causes underlying underuse of lung cancer surgery among AAs. The patient navigation intervention may prove to be a practical but powerful strategy for use by other health care providers, institutions, and communities seeking to reduce persistent racial disparities in lung cancer surgery and outcomes.",Improving Resection Rates among African Americans with NSCLC,8991328,R01MD005892,"['abstracting ', ' Age ', ' Anxiety ', ' nonsmall cell lung cancer ', ' Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer ', ' NSCLC - Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer ', ' NSCLC ', ' Non-Small-Cell Lung Carcinoma ', ' Communities ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Comorbidity ', ' Consultations ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Decision Making ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' geographic site ', ' Geographical Location ', ' Geographic Region ', ' Geographic Area ', ' Geographic Locations ', ' Goals ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Health Personnel ', ' Health Services Needs ', ' Level of Health ', ' Health Status ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Income ', ' Income Distributions ', ' interventions research ', ' interventional study ', ' interventional research ', ' intervention research ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Tumor Staging ', ' Neoplasm Staging ', ' Cancer Staging ', ' Diagnostic Neoplasm Staging ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Publishing ', ' recruit ', ' active recruitment ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' social support network ', ' Social support ', ' South Carolina ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' Woman ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Caring ', ' rural area ', ' urban area ', ' improved ', ' early cancer detection ', ' Cancer Screening for Patients ', ' Screening for cancer ', ' Site ', ' Medical ', ' Randomized Clinical Trials ', ' Ensure ', ' residential site ', ' residence ', ' Trust ', ' European ', ' Rural ', ' lung cancer ', ' Pulmonary malignant Neoplasm ', ' Pulmonary Cancer ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Lung ', ' Malignant neoplasm of lung ', ' satisfaction ', ' root ', ' Plant Roots ', ' Staging ', ' Insurance Status ', ' Insurance Coverage ', ' surgery ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' Outcome Study ', ' American ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' resection ', ' Surgical Removal ', ' Removal ', ' Extirpation ', ' Abscission ', ' Excision ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' theories ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' cancer surgery ', ' cancer care ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Institution ', ' Effectiveness ', ' T-Stage ', ' Tumor stage ', ' Low income ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' mammary screening ', ' mammary cancer detection ', ' Breast screening ', ' Breast cancer screening ', ' Breast Cancer Detection ', ' NCI Organization ', ' National Cancer Institute ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Randomized ', ' Cancer Center ', ' Cancer Cause ', ' Cancer Etiology ', ' Cancer Patient ', ' Newly Diagnosed ', ' Principal Investigator ', ' Process ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socio-economically ', ' socio-economic ', ' socioeconomics ', ' health related quality of life ', ' Clinical Trials Network ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' cancer type ', ' trial comparing ', ' tumor ', ' community setting ', ' evidence base ', ' group intervention ', ' standard of care ', ' treatment as usual ', ' usual care ', ' arm ', ' anxiety states ', ' Cluster randomized trial ', ' Cluster randomization trial ', ' racial disparity ', ' race disparity ', ' disparities in race ', ' trial design ', ' cancer clinical trial ', ' ']",NIMHD,MEDICAL UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA,R01,2016,368750,0.09667747765201604
"Genetic underpinnings of cardiorenal risk in Africans and African Americans ABSTRACT Hypertension (HTN) has earlier onset and takes on a more severe form in African Americans (AAs) as compared to other U.S. populations, which translates to higher rates of cardiovascular disease (CVD) endpoints including stroke and end stage renal disease. The rates of related comorbidities including type 2 diabetes (T2D) and chronic kidney disease (CKD) are also higher in AAs. These remarkable disparities equate to important consequences for the health of AA communities. Emerging data suggest genetic markers originating in Africa incur disease risk in this population. Prior genetic association studies of HTN, T2D, and CKD have been undertaken in AAs. However, the ancestral genetic variation coverage and sample sizes that have been achieved in genetic studies of European Ancestry populations have not yet been achieved for African ancestry populations. Additionally, a direct comparison of risk alleles between AA and African populations has yet to be made. To address these important research gaps, we propose a study that substantially expands the number of AAs with relevant phenotype and genotype data and dramatically improves the coverage of African specific genetic variation in a large number of AAs belonging to existing cardiovascular epidemiology cohorts. We propose genotyping 8000 AAs from the REasons for Geographic and Racial Differences in Stroke (REGARDS) study and 2000 West Africans from the Human Health and Heredity in Africa (H3A) Kidney Network, newly bringing these 10,000 participants into genetic studies. We will combine these data with existing genotype data from 2000 H3A participants and recently generated high-coverage whole genome sequence (WGS) data on ~6500 AAs, with relevant phenotype data, from the NHLBI’s Trans- Omics for Precision Medicine (TOPMed) program. The TOPMed WGS data will be further used to impute sequence variants into REGARDS, H3A and the ~15,000 previously genotyped AA participants from other NHLBI cohorts. We will use these unprecedented resources to conduct the most comprehensive study of cardiorenal traits (blood pressure, renal function, fasting glucose) in AAs to date. We will follow up our top variant-association findings in an independent replication sample of 11,000 AAs with relevant data. Finally, we will test whether variants associated with these risk factors are also associated with CVD outcomes. Our proposed study, including a total of ~40,500 AAs and 4000 West Africans, will provide us an unprecedented opportunity to evaluate the role of genetic variation, and in particular African-derived genetic variation, in the increased susceptibility to CVD and renal disease in AAs. ! PROJECT NARRATIVE African Americans are overburdened by hypertension and related comorbidities, representing a major area of racial health disparity, with African Americans having higher risk and worse outcomes. The proposed work will identify novel genetic risk factors for various cardiorenal measures in African Americans and Africans. The results may help better understand the potential ancestral genetic etiology and lead to improved disease diagnosis as well as cardiovascular disease prevention.",Genetic underpinnings of

"Using epigenomic subtyping to understand the racial differences in lymphoma PROJECT SUMMARY Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), the most common aggressive type of lymphomas, is characterized by marked clinical and pathological heterogeneity that is reflected at the molecular level. It is well known that although the incidence rates for DLBCL were lower for African Americans (AA) than for European Americans (EA), AA patients were diagnosed at a significantly younger age and have worse 5-year survival compared with EA patients. The reason for this apparent racial/ethnic difference is unclear and cannot be fully explained by social stressors or access to care. We speculate that epigenetic variations could underlie the racial/ethnic differences because the pathogenesis of DLBCL is strongly linked to perturbation of epigenetic mechanisms, and population-specific cytosine modifications are a fundamental feature between human populations. In addition, greater epigenetic heterogeneity is linked with more aggressive DLBCL and poorer survival outcomes. Most prior studies of DLBCL epigenetics have assessed 5-methylcytosines (5mC) in predominantly EA patients. No studies have evaluated 5-hydroxymethylcytosines (5hmC), an emerging stable and abundant modification with distinct gene regulatory and cellular functions, due mainly to technical limitations. Most importantly, no studies have assessed concurrently 5mC and 5hmC in both EA and AA DLBCL patients. Without an effective technique to obtain the complete landscape of modified cytosines, development of targeted epigenetic approaches to improve DLBCL disparities is unlikely. The objective of this Exploratory/Developmental study is to distinguish 5hmC from 5mC at the time of DLBCL diagnosis between AA and EA patients and evaluate their clinical significance. Our hypothesis is that the 5mC/5hmC signatures in tumor tissues differ between AA and EA patients and that these differences contribute to the well-known racial/ethnic differences in DLBCL risk and outcomes. The Specific Aims are to 1) distinguish 5hmC from 5mC in EA and AA patients and evaluate population-specific 5mC/5hmC loci; and 2) determine therapeutic response-associated 5hmC/5mC loci. Specifically, we will obtain tissues for 120 patients with DLBCL (60 AA and 60 EA) from the University of Chicago Lymphoma Biobank. We will combine an innovative technique, the Tet-assisted Bisulfite Sequencing (TAB-Seq) and the new Illumina EPIC array to accurately distinguish 5hmC from 5mC. We will perform an epigenome-wide scan to assess differences in 5hmC/5mC modification levels between AA and EA patients at presentation and also integrate both modifications to predict therapeutic response, defined as relapse within 24 months after treatment. This proposal addresses a critical research question in a highly innovative, cost-efficient, and timely manner, providing important data for the first time on the complete landscape of modified cytosines for racial/ethnic differences in DLBCL. The results are expected to have positive impact because it is possible that the identified epigenetic loci/biomarkers will provide new targets for individualized preventive and therapeutic interventions to decrease mortality and burden of DLBCL. PROJECT NARRATIVE PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: African Americans were diagnosed of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), the most aggressive lymphoma in adults, at a significantly younger age (54 years vs. 65 years) and have worse 5-year survival (45% vs. 54%) compared with European American patients. This work seeks to understand the biological bases of the racial/ethnic differences by identifying complete DNA methylation and hydroxymethylation signatures at the time of diagnosis between African American and European American patients with DLBCL. Successful completion of this study will lead to a much better understanding of epigenetic factors that underlie the apparent racial/ethnic differences in DLBCL, which should accelerate the development of race-based individualized preventive and therapeutic interventions to substantially reduce the disparities observed in DLBCL among patients from different ethnic groups.",Using epigenomic subtyping to understand the racial differences in lymphoma,9455051,R21MD011439,"['adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Affect ', ' post treatment ', ' After-Treatment ', ' After Care ', ' Aftercare ', ' ages ', ' Age ', ' Bursa-Equivalent Lymphocyte ', ' Bursa-Dependent Lymphocytes ', ' B-cell ', ' B-Cells ', ' B cells ', ' B cell ', ' B blood cells ', ' B-Lymphocytes ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Breast ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Subcellular Process ', ' Cellular Process ', ' Cellular Physiology ', ' Cellular Function ', ' Cell Process ', ' Cell Function ', ' Cell physiology ', ' Chicago ', ' Colon ', ' Cytosine ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Endometrium ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Genes ', ' trans acting element ', ' regulatory gene ', ' Transcriptional Regulatory Elements ', ' Regulator Genes ', ' treatment access ', ' health services availability ', ' health service access ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' accessibility to health services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Access to Care ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Incidence ', ' indexing ', ' Liver ', ' hepatic organ system ', ' hepatic body system ', ' Lymphoma ', ' Reticulolymphosarcoma ', ' Malignant Lymphoma ', ' Germinoblastoma ', ' Germinoblastic Sarcoma ', ' mortality ', ' Patients ', ' Prostate ', ' Prostatic Gland ', ' Prostate Gland ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Relapse ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Specificity ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Treatment outcome ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' Enhancers ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Biological ', ' Link ', ' Individual ', ' African ', ' European ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Biological Function ', ' Biological Process ', ' Solid Tumor ', ' Solid Neoplasm ', "" large cell Diffuse non-Hodgkin's lymphoma "", ' Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma ', ' DLBCL ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' DNA Methylation ', ' Scanning ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' Techniques ', ' Tumor Tissue ', ' American ', ' stressor ', ' tumor initiation ', ' novel ', ' member ', ' racial difference ', ' race differences ', ' ethnic difference ', ' ethnicity difference ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' Pathogenesis ', ' social ', ' Therapeutic Intervention ', ' intervention therapy ', ' Sampling ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Preventative intervention ', ' Regulatory Element ', ' Tetanus Helper Peptide ', ' Tet ', ' Epigenetic Mechanism ', ' Epigenetic Change ', ' Epigenetic ', ' Epigenetic Process ', ' exploratory developmental study ', ' R21 Program ', ' R21 Mechanism ', ' Exploratory/Developmental Grant ', ' Pathologic ', ' Molecular ', ' Modification ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' epigenomics ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel approaches ', ' new approaches ', ' novel strategies ', ' Outcome ', ' cost efficient ', ' Prevention approach ', ' Approaches to prevention ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' clinically significant ', ' clinical significance ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' epigenetic variation ', ' tumor ', ' public health relevance ', ' treatment response ', ' therapeutic response ', ' response to treatment ', ' Biological Markers ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' biobank ', ' biorepository ', ' epigenetic marker ', ' epigenetic biomarker ', ' epigenome ', ' bisulfite sequencing ', ' bisulfite-seq ', ' BS-seq ', ' survival outcome ', ' disparity reduction ', ' reduce disparity ', ' ']",NIMHD,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,R21,2017,254325,0.13967388191090063
"The role of natural selection in SLE risk among African-Americans ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a severe autoimmune disorder that disproportionately affects African Americans (AA). Despite tremendous progress in elucidating its genetic etiology, research has been mainly limited to Caucasians, and little progress has been made in the identification of the specific disease-predisposing functional variations. Since the genome structure of a population is influenced by environmental pressures, and immune responses are particularly sensitive to the environment, it is possible that, throughout evolution, population-specific positive natural selection has led to a increased frequency of alleles that also predispose to autoimmune diseases like SLE. The goal of this project is to discover functional SLE risk variants in AAs while improving our understanding of the genetic basis of SLE that is due to natural selection. In order to accomplish this, Dr. Ramos will (1) identify regions of the genome that have been the target of recent positive natural selection in AA using two complementary population genetics statistics, (2) identify regions that are both predisposing to SLE and under selection, and (3) compute thorough functional annotation of the adaptive SLE risk variants to identify adaptive functional variation associated with SLE.  Dr. Ramos is a human geneticist in the Division of Rheumatology at the Medical University of South Carolina (MUSC). Her long-term career goal is to become an independent translational researcher in the genetics of autoimmunity. To facilitate her transition into an independent investigator, she seeks to further her skills and broaden the multidisciplinary nature of her research by training in population and evolutionary genetics, and bioinformatics and computational tools for the analysis of high-dimensional large-scale datasets. The environment for the success of Dr. Ramos is provided by (1) a mentorship team with the mentorship track record and varied expertise needed to support her project, (2) the availability of samples from unique African American and African populations and the established infrastructure to continue and expand studies on these populations, (3) support from the endowed Smart State Center in Inflammation and Fibrosis, the Multidisciplinary Clinical Research Center (MCRC) for Rheumatic Diseases in African Americans, and the growing Center Genomic Medicine, and (4) the Department of Medicine's robust mentorship program.  The identification of functional adaptive alleles that contribute to SLE risk in AA will contributeto an understanding of the role of positive natural selection in shaping SLE risk and vastly improve knowledge about the etiology of SLE in AA. These results will provide critical preliminary data supporting extramural applications to conduct focused analysis of sequence data, functional studies, expand to other populations and to other autoimmune diseases. The training will enable Dr. Ramos to achieve her long-term objective of becoming an independent investigator leading multidisciplinary teams conducting innovative genomic research in autoimmune disease. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Relevance This project is highly relevant to public health because African Americans (AA) has a higher prevalence and substantial risk of autoimmune diseases such as lupus, but has been largely understudied and the reasons for this health disparity remain elusive. This study will integrate evidence for positive natural selection with biological information to identify adaptive functional variation associated with lupus in AA. Identifying the genetic variations that cause lupus and understanding the role of natural selection in shaping its risk will greatly expand our knowledge about the etiology of lupus in AA and contribute to the development of interventions to reduce risk, improved diagnosis, targeted therapies, and improved outcomes.",The role of natural selection in SLE risk among African-Americans,9249477,K01AR067280,"['Affect ', ' Africa ', ' Allelomorphs ', ' Alleles ', ' aminoacid ', ' Amino Acids ', ' autoimmune disorder ', ' auto-immune disorder ', ' auto-immune disease ', ' Autoimmune Diseases ', ' Autoimmune Status ', ' Autoimmunity ', ' Reactive Site ', ' Combining Site ', ' Binding Sites ', ' cultured cell line ', ' Strains Cell Lines ', ' CellLine ', ' Cell Line ', ' Chromatin ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Research ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' liability to disease ', ' Diathesis ', ' Disease susceptibility ', ' Environment ', ' Evolution ', ' Fibrosis ', ' Future ', ' allelic frequency ', ' Allele Frequency ', ' Gene Frequency ', ' Genes ', ' Population Genetics ', ' Genome ', ' human whole genome ', ' Human Genome ', ' Goals ', ' Haplotypes ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Incidence ', ' indexing ', ' Inflammation ', ' Island ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Systemic Lupus Erythematosus ', ' systemic lupus erythematosis ', ' disseminated lupus erythematosus ', ' Systemic SLE -

"Georgia CaRes DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Georgia Regents University (GRU) has been home to Georgia's only NCI MB-CCOP since 2004. With its affiliate site, University Cancer & Blood Center (UCBC), GRU has enrolled nearly 800 patients to NCI clinical trials: 39% of them African American (AA) and other minorities, with accrual split between treatment trials (48%) and prevention and control trials (52%). Building on this successful track record, GRU Cancer Center (GRUCC) and UCBC are joining forces with Morehouse School of Medicine (MSM) and the Jiann-Ping Hsu College of Public Health (JPHCOPH) at Georgia Southern University to become the NCORP Minority/Underserved Community Site for Georgia. The need to sustain and grow an NCORP that focuses on minority and underserved populations in Georgia is great. Georgia has some of the nation's worst cancer disparities, particularity between African Americans (AA) and Caucasians (CA) and between rural and urban populations. The disparities are glaring for some of the most common cancers. Not only do AA men in Georgia have the highest rate of prostate cancer among AA men in the country, they are almost twice as likely to be diagnosed with the disease as CA men in Georgia and three times as likely to die from it. In Georgia, AA women die of breast cancer 25% more often than CA women, and AA die of colorectal cancer 45% more than CA. The Specific Aims of the proposed NCORP M/U site for Georgia are to: 1) Implement a NCORP M/U Site for Georgia that meets or exceeds all NCI requirements; 2) Contribute to the design, conduct and translation of the national NCORP research agenda, particularity studies that pertain to minority and underserved populations; and 3) expand patient and provider access to-and enrollment/participation in-cancer prevention, control, imaging, treatment and screening/post-surveillance clinical trials and cancer care delivery research throughout Georgia, particularly for minority and underserved populations in urban and rural settings. Key sub-aims include the implementation of a leadership development program to cultivate the next generation of NCORP investigators and leaders and engagement to key stakeholders and community partners in all aspects of the NCORP research agenda. Georgia represents a unique opportunity to pursue research directed towards cancer disparities and to affect  minority and underserved communities' accrual to clinical trials and cancer care delivery research studies.  30% of its 9.9M residents are AA (vs. 12% in the U.S.) and 75% of its counties are rural, most of them  medically underserved.

"Analysis of Racial Disparities in HCC by Systems Metabolomics ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a significant health problem in the United States. Compared to European Americans (EA), the incidence of HCC is higher in African Americans (AA) and is associated with more advanced tumor stage at diagnosis and lower survival rates. It has been reported that the sensitivity of α- fetoprotein (AFP) for the diagnosis of HCC in African Americans with hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is lower than that of patients of all other racial groups combined. We previously performed preliminary investigation into racial disparities through metabolomics profiling of sera from HCC cases and patients with liver cirrhosis by using both liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Through stratified analysis of the LC/GC-MS data, we identified different candidates that distinguish HCC cases from the cirrhotic controls among AA and EA. This application builds on these promising preliminary results to find and validate race-specific metabolites as biomarkers for HCC. This will be accomplished by targeted analysis of metabolites in liver tissues and sera from HCC cases and patients with liver cirrhosis representing AA and EA. Metabolites that differentiate HCC cases from cirrhotic controls in a race-specific manner will be selected by statistical and network-based methods. Then, a systems-oriented approach that combines these metabolites with other candidate biomarkers (genes, glycans, and proteins) will be utilized for the selection of key signaling pathways perturbed in HCC. Following validation of the candidates via independent samples from HCC cases, patients with liver cirrhosis, and healthy subjects, we will elucidate their functional roles through both in vitro and in vivo experiments. Successful completion of this research will enable us to identify HCC biomarkers and perturbed pathways that are race-specific as well as those that are shared by AA and EA. These findings will contribute not only to a greater understanding of racial disparities in HCC but also to improving diagnosis of HCC through race-specific biomarkers. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Currently used biomarkers for detecting hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in high-risk cirrhotic patients lack the desired sensitivity and specificity, particularly in African American patients. The goal of this project is to find and validate race-specific biomarkers for HCC and identify perturbed intercellular signaling pathways in HCC. If successful, the study will (1) contribute to a greater understanding of racial disparities in HCC, (2) enable accurate detection of HCC by using race as a factor, and (3) give insights into the mechanisms underlying the behavior of potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets.",Analysis of Racial Disparities in HCC by Systems Metabolomics,9302701,U01CA185188,"['α-Fetoproteins ', ' Fetuins ', ' Alpha-Fetoglobulin ', ' Alpha-1-Fetoprotein ', ' alpha-Fetoproteins ', ' Behavior ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Blood ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' cultured cell line ', ' Strains Cell Lines ', ' CellLine ', ' Cell Line ', ' neoplastic transformation ', ' Neoplastic Cell Transformation ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cells ', ' vapor phase chromatography ', ' Gas Chromatography ', ' Clinical Markers ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Enzyme Gene ', ' Enzymes ', ' Genes ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' non-A, non-B hepatitis ', ' non A, non B hepatitis ', ' hepatitis non A non B ', ' hep C ', ' Hepatitus C ', ' Hepatitis, Viral, Non-A, Non-B, Parenterally-Transmitted ', ' Hepatitis C virus infection ', ' Hepatitis C virus ', ' HCV infection ', ' HCV ', ' Hepatitis C ', ' liver carcinoma ', ' Liver Cells Carcinoma ', ' Hepatoma ', ' Hepatocellular cancer ', ' Hepatocellular Carcinoma ', ' Hepatocarcinoma ', ' Primary carcinoma of the liver cells ', ' University Hospitals ', ' In Vitro ', ' Incidence ', ' Liver ', ' hepatic organ system ', ' hepatic body system ', ' Liver Cirrhosis ', ' Hepatic Cirrhosis ', ' Mass Fragmentography ', ' mass fragmentometry ', ' ion trap mass spectrometry ', ' Mass-Gas Chromatography Spectrum Analysis ', ' Mass-Gas Chromatography Spectrometry ', ' Mass Fragmentographies ', ' Gas-Liquid-Mass Spectrometry Chromatography ', ' GCMS ', ' GC MS ', ' Methods ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Polysaccharides ', ' Glycans ', ' Proteins ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' recruit ', ' active recruitment ', ' Research ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Sensitivity and Specificity ', ' Signal Pathway ', ' Mass Spectrum Analysis ', ' Mass Spectrum Analyses ', ' Mass Spectrum ', ' Mass Spectroscopy ', ' Mass Spectrometry ', ' Mass Photometry/Spectrum Analysis ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Survival Rate ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' United States ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Biological ', ' Biochemical ', ' Chemicals ', ' Liver Cells ', ' Hepatic Parenchymal Cell ', ' Hepatic Cells ', ' Hepatocyte ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' European ', ' Patient Recruitments ', ' Investigation ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' Xenograft procedure ', ' xeno-transplantation ', ' xeno-transplant ', ' Xenotransplantation ', ' Xenograft ', ' Heterologous Transplantation ', ' Heterograft ', ' American ', ' Cell Proliferation ', ' Cellular Proliferation ', ' Cell Multiplication ', ' Cell Growth in Number ', ' Performance ', ' Participant ', ' ethnic difference ', ' ethnicity difference ', ' Reporting ', ' Gene Proteins ', ' Protein Gene Products ', ' Pathway Analysis ', ' Network Analysis ', ' Sampling ', ' Proteomics ', ' liquid chromatography mass spectrometry ', ' LC/MS ', ' Metabolic Pathway ', ' Tumor stage ', ' T-Stage ', ' metabolomics ', ' metabonomics ', ' metabolism measurement ', ' AFP gene ', ' HPAFP ', ' FETA ', ' AFP ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Stage at Diagnosis ', ' in vivo ', ' Validation ', ' Preparation ', ' cirrhotic ', ' Cirrhosis ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' risk prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' computer based prediction ', ' predictive modeling ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' transcriptomics ', ' Network-based ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' healthy volunteer ', ' therapeutic target ', ' network models ', ' high risk ', ' public health relevance ', ' population based ', ' candidate marker ', ' candidate biomarker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' cancer initiation ', ' candidate validation ', ' racial disparity ', ' race disparity ', ' disparities in race ', ' potential biomarker ', ' potential biological marker ', ' multiple omics ', ' specific biomarkers ', ' ethnic diversity ', ' ethnically diverse ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' ']",NCI,GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY,U01,2017,255915,0.0776127873449452
"Biobehavioral Determinants of the Microbiome and Preterm Birth in Black Women DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goals of this study are to elucidate the bio behavioral determinants that govern the structure and dynamics of the microbiome of African American (AA) women during pregnancy and to investigate whether microbiome composition is associated with PTB. The proposed study will contribute to a bio psychosocial understanding of within-race risk for PTB, providing insight into important risk and protective factors relevant to AA women who disproportionately experience PTB compared to any other US population. Our research is consistent with frameworks for eliminating racial disparities, which recognize the importance of studying potential risk factors within-race as a vital first step, and is congruent with the National Institute of Nursing Research goal of promoting and improving the health of individuals, families, and communities across the lifespan in a variety of clinical settings and within diverse populations. The study will prospectively enroll a socioeconomically diverse cohort of H 960 pregnant AA women and follow them through delivery, collecting data at three time points: twice via direct participant contact during prenatal care appointments (at 10-14 and 26-30 weeks' gestation), and once via review of the medical records from the delivery hospitalization. Using a nested case-control approach, we will designate as cases all women who experience PTB (an estimated 125 cases); an equal number of controls will be selected from among those who deliver a term infant. Using this study design we will: (1) Characterize the vaginal, oral, and gut microbiome during early and later pregnancy; (2) Examine whether bio behavioral factors linked with PTB - including biological indicators and experiences of stress, nutritional status, and health behaviors - influence the composition of the microbiome; (3) Determine whether the composition of the vaginal, oral, and gut microbiome in early and/or later pregnancy is associated with PTB; and (4) Investigate whether symptom patterns are associated with microbiomic milieu that increase the risk of PTB among AA women. The success of this research is supported by several factors. First, we have assembled a multidisciplinary collaboration of clinicians and basic and translational scientists representing expertise in infectious disease, obstetrics-gynecology, nutrition, genetics and epigenetics, stress physiology, epidemiology and informatics under the leadership of a nurse-scientist. Second, we have the support of the Atlanta Clinical and Translational Science Institute (CTSA award # NIH UL1TR000454); Emory's Interdisciplinary Training for Nurse Scientists Award (T32 NR012715), Emory's Reproductive and Perinatal Epidemiology Fellowship Award, and the Emory Integrated Genomics Core Laboratory. Third, Atlanta is home to AA women of broad SES, many of whom are served by Emory's affiliated delivery hospitals, enabling us to sample a diverse group of AA women, allowing for sufficient variation in the bio behavioral determinants under study to distinguish their independent and interactive effects on the microbiome and, ultimately, on the risk of PTB. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Preterm birth (PTB) occurs at unacceptably high rates within the United States, with African American women disproportionately affected. The composition of the microbiome during pregnancy may be a key mechanism for PTB. Our study will characterize the structure and dynamics of the vaginal, oral, and gut microbiome within the population most affected by PTB - African American women - in order to evaluate whether particular microbiome patterns are linked with PTB and to identify bio behavioral factors that impact microbiome structure and dynamics during pregnancy.",Biobehavioral Determinants of the Microbiome

"Circadian Genes and Adipose Function: Impact of Chronotype, Obesity and Race DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There has been an alarming increase in the prevalence of obesity in the United States, but women, in particular African Americans, have been especially hard it. It is thus crucial to identify novel pathways that mediate the increase prevalence of insulin resistance associated with obesity. Disturbances of the circadian clock system in peripheral tissues have emerged as a putative novel risk factor for weight gain and insulin resistance. While the cross-talk between the circadian system and metabolism has been well-documented in nocturnal animal models, in which, contrary to the human, the active period is aligned with high melatonin levels and elevated neuronal activity in the suprachiasmatic nucleus. The potential role of alterations in peripheral clock function in adipose tissue in promoting adiposity-related insulin resistance in women has not been elucidated. Additionally, bariatric surgery has emerged as a frontline treatment with over 200,000 procedures being performed in the US annually. In an ongoing collaboration with a bariatric surgeon, we have obtained preliminary evidence that bariatric surgery rapidly improves insulin action in primary human adipocytes. The central hypothesis of this application is that the reduction in insulin sensitivity in adipose tissue is mediated by alterations in the circadian expression of clock and metabolic genes, and that these disturbances are more pronounced in obese AA women versus non-Hispanic white (NHW) women. Subcutaneous fat biopsies from obese AA and NHW human volunteers will be collected 2 weeks prior to surgery, as well as from matched lean control women. Circadian gene expression will be measured in cultured adipose tissue over a 24 hr period and compared to the systemic insulin sensitivity and chronotype of each individual. During the week prior to surgery, bedtimes and mealtimes will be standardized for half of the obese subjects to determine the impact of central circadian alignment on peripheral circadian gene expression in subcutaneous and mesenteric fat collected at the start of the bariatric procedure. Finally, surgical patients will return 2 and 12 weeks post-surgery before long term weight loss has occurred and subcutaneous fat biopsies will be collected. At 2 weeks, we will determine if the rapid improvement in insulin sensitivity in adipose tissue is commensurate with improvement in the phase and amplitude of circadian gene expression in NHW and AA women. At 12 weeks, when normal meal schedules have resumed but patients remain obese, we will elucidate if bariatric surgery causes an earlier chronotype, which is associated with protection from the development of metabolic disease. At both time points, we will determine if the decreased long term efficacy of bariatric surgery in AA women is concomitant with a reduction in the restoration of peripheral circadian gene expression in adipose tissue. These studies should provide novel and important insights into the interplay of changes in peripheral circadian gene expression and insulin sensitivity that occurs in obesity in NHW and AA women, and may also lead to novel therapeutic interventions to reverse the current racial disparities in the prevalence of metabolic disease in women. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Women are at higher risk of becoming obese, particularly African American women who are 70% more likely to be obese than Non-Hispanic White women. We will test the central hypothesis that the reduction in insulin sensitivity in fat cells o obese women is mediated by perturbations in the daily cycle of gene expression. Furthermore, we will determine the beneficial impact of behavioral adjustment (scheduled sleep and meal times) or bariatric surgery on insulin responsiveness in human adipose tissue samples and explore any racial disparities in the responses obtained.","Circadian Genes and Adipose Function: Impact of Chronotype, Obesity and Race",9302743,R01DK103014,"['yellow adipose tissue ', ' white

"Inter-relationship between microbiota diversity, obesity and race in endometrial cancer PROJECT SUMMARY  Obesity and insulin resistance are factors associated with increased risk for and worse outcomes from endometrial cancer (EC). African American (AA) women suffer a higher mortality from EC than Caucasian (CAU) women, and this may be in part due to greater rates of both obesity and diabetes among AA versus CAU patients. Given that the gut microbiome differs by race and has been implicated in the underlying biology of both obesity and cancer, bacteria in the gut and uterus may be logical contributing causes for the racial and obesity disparities seen for EC. A significant gap in our knowledge is that the microbiota of the malignant uterus has not been previously characterized. We hypothesize that the EC microbiota exists, differs by obesity and race status and contributes to the pathogenesis of EC.  In our LKB1fl/flp53fl/fl mouse model of endometrioid EC, diet-induced obesity promoted tumor progression, resulting in a doubling of tumor size. Metabolomic profiling revealed significant differences between the ECs in obese versus lean mice, including enhanced energy metabolism and increased gut- microbiome associated metabolites in obese mice. The diabetes drug metformin had heightened efficacy in obese mice, via reversal of the detrimental effects that obesity had on both the gut microbiome and upregulation of energy metabolism. Our pilot study foundational for this grant proposal assessed the microbiota in 21 early stage endometrioid ECs of women and found that bacteria exist in the uterus of the post- menopausal woman. EC microbiota diversity was greater in the tumors of AA versus CAU women, and tumor microbiota profiles were distinct between ECs of obese and lean women. A phase 0 clinical trial of metformin in obese EC patients showed that response to metformin (defined as a decrease in tumor cell proliferation) aligned with greater impact on gut microbiome-associated metabolites. Thus, our preliminary work in both mice and women support a potential critical link between obesity, race, the microbiome and EC.  Thus, using our clinically relevant genetically engineered mouse model of obese EC, we will determine in Specific Aim 1 if the microbiota profiles differ between the normal and malignant endometrium in obese and lean post-menopausal, ovariectomized mice. In parallel, in Specific Aim 2 we will expand on our pilot study and assess if the microbiota differ between ECs of non-obese and obese post-menopausal AA and CAU women (N=160 total, 40 per group). Metabolomic profiling will be performed on the ECs from mice and women so as to elicit corresponding function related to obesity- and race-driven differences in the uterine microbiota. Overlay in the techniques of microbiota and metabolomic profiling as well as cross-species comparisons will facilitate discovery of the mechanisms of differing bacterial presence that occur with obesity and AA race in EC. This will potentially lead to microbiota-directed therapies and risk-reducing strategies that will improve outcomes for AA EC patients, which is a public health goal that aligns with the mission of the NIH/NCI. PROJECT NARRATIVE Although perturbations in the racially-influenced gut microbiome may partially underlie the obesity-cancer link, the impact of bacterial presence and function in the uterus on racial- and obesity-driven disparities in endometrial cancer has not been previously explored. Thus, we will delineate the inter-relationship between obesity, race and the microbiota of the uterus through our clinically relevant genetically engineered mouse model of obesity-driven endometrial cancer and in banked human endometrial cancer specimens from obese/non-obese and racially diverse women, as a means to discover if the microbiome contributes to the disparate outcomes in African-American women. Ultimately, we hope to develop microbiota-directed therapies and risk-reducing strategies to overcome the growing public health concern of disparities in endometrial cancer outcomes among African-American women.","Inter-relationship between microbiota diversity, obesity and race in endometrial cancer",9387916,R21CA220269,"['Bacteria ', ' Benzoates ', ' Biology ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' diabetes ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' dietary ', ' Diet ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Neoplasm of the Endometrium ', ' Endometrium Tumor ', ' Endometrial Tumor ', ' Endometrial Neoplasms ', ' Endometrium ', ' Energy Expenditure ', ' Energy Metabolism ', ' Foundations ', ' Goals ', ' treatment access ', ' health services availability ', ' health service access ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' accessibility to health services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Access to Care ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Insulin Resistance ', ' insulin resistant ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lipid Peroxidation ', ' Lipid Peroxides ', ' Lipoperoxides ', ' Lipid Hydroperoxide ', ' Fatty Acid Hydroperoxides ', ' Metformin ', ' N,N-dimethyl-imidodicarbonimidic diamide ', ' Dimethylguanylguanidine ', ' Dimethylbiguanidine ', ' Obese Mice ', ' ob/ob mouse ', ' Mission ', ' mortality ', ' Mus ', ' Murine ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Mice ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' Obesity ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Oxidative Phosphorylation ', ' Oxidative Phosphorylation Pathway ', ' Patients ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Play ', ' Public Health ', ' R Factors ', ' Resistance Factors ', ' R Plasmids ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Research Proposals ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Thinness ', ' Leanness ', ' Time ', ' Upregulation ', ' Up-Regulation ', ' womb ', ' Uterus ', ' Weight ', ' white race ', ' Occidental ', ' Caucasoid Race ', ' Caucasoid ', ' Caucasian Race ', ' Caucasian ', ' Caucasians ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' neoplastic progression ', ' neoplasm progression ', ' cancer progression ', ' tumor progression ', ' Clinical ', ' Malignant ', ' Malignant - descriptor ', ' Phase ', ' postmenopausal ', ' post-menopausal ', ' Postmenopausal Period ', ' Post-menopausal Period ', ' Post-Menopause ', ' Postmenopause ', ' Link ', ' prognostic ', ' white American ', ' caucasian American ', ' Endometrial ', ' insight ', ' Aromatic Amino Acids ', ' tool ', ' Specimen ', ' Research Specimen ', ' Knowledge ', ' Techniques ', ' Endometrial Carcinoma ', ' Endometrium Carcinoma ', ' Endometrium Cancer ', ' Endometrial Cancer ', ' Cell Proliferation ', ' Cellular Proliferation ', ' Cell Multiplication ', ' Cell Growth in Number ', ' lipid biosynthesis ', ' lipogenesis ', ' adipogenesis ', ' neoplastic cell ', ' Tumor Cell ', ' Prevention ', ' Pathogenesis ', ' Malignant Female Reproductive System Neoplasm ', ' gynecological malignancy ', ' gynecologic malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Female Reproductive System ', ' Malignant Gynecologic Tumor ', ' Malignant Gynecologic Neoplasm ', ' Gynecological Cancer ', ' Gynecologic Cancer ', ' Female Reproductive Cancer ', ' response ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' metabolomics ', ' metabonomics ', ' metabolism measurement ', ' Address ', ' Applications Grants ', ' Grant Proposals ', ' Cancer Patient ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Characteristics ', ' GEM model ', ' Genetically Engineered Mouse ', ' microbiome ', ' Outcome ', ' human study ', ' Non obese ', ' Nonobese ', ' man ', "" man's "", ' clinically relevant ', ' clinical relevance ', ' mouse model ', ' murine model ', ' therapeutic target ', ' tumor ', ' gut microbiota ', ' intestinal tract microflora ', ' intestinal microbiota ', ' gut microflora ', ' gut microbiotic ', ' tumor metabolism ', ' tumor cell metabolism ', ' cancer metabolism ', ' cancer cell metabolism ', ' gut microbiome ', ' intestinal microbiome ', ' gastrointestinal microbiome ', ' digestive tract microbiome ', ' improved outcome ', ' microbiota ', ' ethnic diversity ', ' ethnically diverse ', ' racial diversity ', ' racially diverse ', ' reproductive tract ', ' genital tract ', ' reproductive organ ', ' ']",NCI,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R21,2017,202928,0.07622739029226021
"Analysis of Racial Disparities in HCC by Systems Metabolomics ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a significant health problem in the United States. Compared to European Americans (EA), the incidence of HCC is higher in African Americans (AA) and is associated with more advanced tumor stage at diagnosis and lower survival rates. It has been reported that the sensitivity of α- fetoprotein (AFP) for the diagnosis of HCC in African Americans with hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is lower than that of patients of all other racial groups combined. We previously performed preliminary investigation into racial disparities through metabolomics profiling of sera from HCC cases and patients with liver cirrhosis by using both liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Through stratified analysis of the LC/GC-MS data, we identified different candidates that distinguish HCC cases from the cirrhotic controls among AA and EA. This application builds on these promising preliminary results to find and validate race-specific metabolites as biomarkers for HCC. This will be accomplished by targeted analysis of metabolites in liver tissues and sera from HCC cases and patients with liver cirrhosis representing AA and EA. Metabolites that differentiate HCC cases from cirrhotic controls in a race-specific manner will be selected by statistical and network-based methods. Then, a systems-oriented approach that combines these metabolites with other candidate biomarkers (genes, glycans, and proteins) will be utilized for the selection of key signaling pathways perturbed in HCC. Following validation of the candidates via independent samples from HCC cases, patients with liver cirrhosis, and healthy subjects, we will elucidate their functional roles through both in vitro and in vivo experiments. Successful completion of this research will enable us to identify HCC biomarkers and perturbed pathways that are race-specific as well as those that are shared by AA and EA. These findings will contribute not only to a greater understanding of racial disparities in HCC but also to improving diagnosis of HCC through race-specific biomarkers. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Currently used biomarkers for detecting hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in high-risk cirrhotic patients lack the desired sensitivity and specificity, particularly in African American patients. The goal of this project is to find and validate race-specific biomarkers for HCC and identify perturbed intercellular signaling pathways in HCC. If successful, the study will (1) contribute to a greater understanding of racial disparities in HCC, (2) enable accurate detection of HCC by using race as a factor, and (3) give insights into the mechanisms underlying the behavior of potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets.",Analysis of Racial Disparities in HCC by Systems Metabolomics,9392658,U01CA185188,"['α-Fetoproteins ', ' Fetuins ', ' Alpha-Fetoglobulin ', ' Alpha-1-Fetoprotein ', ' alpha-Fetoproteins ', ' Behavior ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Blood ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' cultured cell line ', ' Strains Cell Lines ', ' CellLine ', ' Cell Line ', ' neoplastic transformation ', ' Neoplastic Cell Transformation ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cells ', ' vapor phase chromatography ', ' Gas Chromatography ', ' Clinical Markers ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Enzyme Gene ', ' Enzymes ', ' Genes ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' non-A, non-B hepatitis ', ' non A, non B hepatitis ', ' hepatitis non A non B ', ' hep C ', ' Hepatitus C ', ' Hepatitis, Viral, Non-A, Non-B, Parenterally-Transmitted ', ' Hepatitis C virus infection ', ' Hepatitis C virus ', ' HCV infection ', ' HCV ', ' Hepatitis C ', ' liver carcinoma ', ' Liver Cells Carcinoma ', ' Hepatoma ', ' Hepatocellular cancer ', ' Hepatocellular Carcinoma ', ' Hepatocarcinoma ', ' Primary carcinoma of the liver cells ', ' University Hospitals ', ' In Vitro ', ' Incidence ', ' Liver ', ' hepatic organ system ', ' hepatic body system ', ' Liver Cirrhosis ', ' Hepatic Cirrhosis ', ' Mass Fragmentography ', ' mass fragmentometry ', ' ion trap mass spectrometry ', ' Mass-Gas Chromatography Spectrum Analysis ', ' Mass-Gas Chromatography Spectrometry ', ' Mass Fragmentographies ', ' Gas-Liquid-Mass Spectrometry Chromatography ', ' GCMS ', ' GC MS ', ' Methods ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Polysaccharides ', ' Glycans ', ' Proteins ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' recruit ', ' active recruitment ', ' Research ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Sensitivity and Specificity ', ' Signal Pathway ', ' Mass Spectrum Analysis ', ' Mass Spectrum Analyses ', ' Mass Spectrum ', ' Mass Spectroscopy ', ' Mass Spectrometry ', ' Mass Photometry/Spectrum Analysis ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Survival Rate ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' United States ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Biological ', ' Biochemical ', ' Chemicals ', ' Liver Cells ', ' Hepatic Parenchymal Cell ', ' Hepatic Cells ', ' Hepatocyte ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' European ', ' Patient Recruitments ', ' Investigation ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' Xenograft procedure ', ' xeno-transplantation ', ' xeno-transplant ', ' Xenotransplantation ', ' Xenograft ', ' Heterologous Transplantation ', ' Heterograft ', ' American ', ' Cell Proliferation ', ' Cellular Proliferation ', ' Cell Multiplication ', ' Cell Growth in Number ', ' Performance ', ' Participant ', ' ethnic difference ', ' ethnicity difference ', ' Reporting ', ' Gene Proteins ', ' Protein Gene Products ', ' Pathway Analysis ', ' Network Analysis ', ' Sampling ', ' Proteomics ', ' liquid chromatography mass spectrometry ', ' LC/MS ', ' Metabolic Pathway ', ' Tumor stage ', ' T-Stage ', ' metabolomics ', ' metabonomics ', ' metabolism measurement ', ' AFP gene ', ' HPAFP ', ' FETA ', ' AFP ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Stage at Diagnosis ', ' in vivo ', ' Validation ', ' Preparation ', ' cirrhotic ', ' Cirrhosis ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' risk prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' computer based prediction ', ' predictive modeling ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' transcriptomics ', ' Network-based ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' healthy volunteer ', ' therapeutic target ', ' network models ', ' high risk ', ' public health relevance ', ' population based ', ' candidate marker ', ' candidate biomarker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' cancer initiation ', ' candidate validation ', ' racial disparity ', ' race disparity ', ' disparities in race ', ' potential biomarker ', ' potential biological marker ', ' multiple omics ', ' specific biomarkers ', ' ethnic diversity ', ' ethnically diverse ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' ']",NCI,GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY,U01,2017,73651,0.0776127873449452
"Epigenetic and Biobehavioral Determinants of Preterm Birth in Black Women DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Preterm birth (PTB, birth prior to 37 weeks' gestation) is a leading cause of infant mortality. Of the known risk factors for PTB, among the strongest is African American (AA) race. Compared to Caucasians, AA women have more than 1.5 times the risk of PTB (16.8% vs. 10.5%). The proposed research will investigate whether specific bio behavioral factors linked to PTB influence the epigenetic regulation of genes to promote PTB in AA women. This research will contribute to a bio psychosocial understanding of within-race risk for PTB, providing insight into important risk and protective factors relevant to AA women. The proposed research is consistent with frameworks for eliminating racial disparities, which recognize the need to study risks within-race as a vital first step, and is congruent with the National Institute of Minority Health and Health Disparities goal of promoting understanding of the biological mechanisms involved in conditions that disproportionately affect health disparity populations.  To evaluate the hypothesis that epigenetic mechanisms mediate the relationship between specific bio behavioral factors and PTB for AA women, the proposed study will leverage bio behavioral and biologic data from an on-going longitudinal study of preterm birth in AA women (R01 NR014800) that is enrolling a socioeconomically diverse cohort of H 960 pregnant AA women and collecting data during prenatal care appointments (at 10-14 and 26-30 weeks' gestation) and at delivery. Using a nested case-control approach, cases are designated as those who experience PTB (an estimated 125 cases) and controls as those who experience a term birth. Building from this study design, we will: (1) characterize PBMC DNA methylation and RNA expression patterns over the course of pregnancy among AA women who deliver preterm and at term; (2) identify bio behavioral factors - including nutritional status, stress, an reproductive tract infections - that influence patterns of peripheral DNA methylation and RNA expression; (3) evaluate associations between PTB and both DNA methylation and RNA expression among AA women that are independent of the bio behavioral factors and (4) determine whether these epigenetic differences can be detected in the second and/or third trimester. The success of this research is supported by a multidisciplinary collaboration of clinicians, basic and translational scientists representing expertise in obstetrical outcomes and maternal-child health, genetics and epigenetics, nutrition, stress, epidemiology and informatics; the overlap of key personnel for the proposed study and the on-going R01 'Bio behavioral Determinants of the Micro biome and Preterm Birth for Black Women'; and support from Emory University's Clinical and Translational Science Institute (CTSA award # NIH UL1TR000454). Finally, Atlanta is home to AA women of broad socioeconomic status who are served by Emory's affiliated delivery hospitals, allowing for sufficient variation in the bio behavioral factrs under study to distinguish independent and interactive effects on DNA methylation and, ultimately, on the risk of PTB. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Preterm birth (PTB) occurs at unacceptably high rates in the United States, with African American (AA) women disproportionately affected. The proposed research will investigate whether bio behavioral factors linked to PTB influence the regulation and expression of genes to promote PTB in AA women. We will focus our investigation on bio behavioral factors that affect the inflammatory pathway - including poor nutritional status, stress and reproductive tract infections -- as, according to the Institute of Medicine, inflammation predominantly contributes to the excessive rates of PTB experienced by AA women. This research will contribute to a bio psychosocial understanding of within-race risk for PTB, providing insight into important risk and protective factors relevant to AA women who disproportionately

"Molecular determinant of racial disparity in prostate cancer DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Significant disparity in the incidence and clinical outcome of prostate cancer (PCa) exist between African- American (AA) men and their European American (EA) counterparts. Despite this recognition, we have not made a major leap in our understanding of the molecular causes associated with such disparity. This proposal is built upon our strong preliminary data on a proto-oncogene, Myb, which has remained largely unexplored in PCa. Our novel findings demonstrate that 1) Myb expression is significantly elevated in AA PCa with greater overall incidence as compared to EA PCa, 2) low intensity expression of Myb is also detected in some of the benign prostate tissues (BPH) from AA patients, while no expression is detected in EA BPH, 3) AA PCa cell lines (MDaPCa-2b and RC-77/T) exhibit high Myb expression and significant resistance to hormone-depletion and docetaxel (DTX) toxicity, 4) AA PCa cells also display high growth, migratory and invasive potential, which is associated with Myb overexpression, and 5) Myb interacts with AR and modulates the expression of androgen-responsive gene, KLK3/PSA, suggesting their cooperative role in gene regulation. Based on these promising findings, we hypothesize that relative greater incidence and overall expression of Myb in AA PCa cells underlies their inherently greater propensity to metastasize and evade therapeutic intervention. To test this hypothesis, we are proposing three specific aims. In aim 1, we will investigate the role of Myb in PCa aggressiveness and therapy-resistance. Using luciferase-tagged, Myb-overexpressing or -silenced, paired AA and EA PCa cell lines, we will examine the functional association of Myb with PCa growth and metastasis, and their response to castration- and docetaxel- therapies in an orthotopic mouse model. In Aim 2, we will examine the functional consequences of Myb-AR interaction and identify their downstream consequences. We will specifically examine whether Myb has a role in AR localization and transcriptional activation. Furthermore, we will assess the effect of Myb on transcriptional reprogramming of AR by using state of the art RNA-Seq and ChIP-Seq approaches. We will determine the shared and independent targets of Myb and AR in PCa cells and examine if Myb alters AR target gene specificity. In Aim 3, we will determine the clinical relevance of Myb in racial disparity associated with PCa. We will perform immunohistochemical (IHC) analysis to assess Myb and AR expression and localization (cytoplasmic vs. nuclear) in PCa, adjacent BPH, and uninvolved normal tissues from both AA and EA cases. We will then examine their correlation (alone and in combination) with race, tumor grade, metastasis incidence, PSA levels, and patient's survival. Together, these studies will provide experimental, mechanistic and clinical evidence for the role of Myb in aggressive behavior and therapeutic- resistance of PCa, and support the association of Myb with observed racial disparity. In the long-term, the resulting information will be useful in reducing the racial disparities in clinical outcomes of PCa by establishing the clinical utility of Myb as a risk predictor and/or therapeutic target for effective disease management. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Main barrier in achieving progress toward racial disparities reduction in prostate cancer is our limited understanding of the underlying molecular basis. The proposed research will examine the functional and clinical significance of Myb overexpression in prostate cancer aggressiveness and therapeutic resistance, the two major reasons for the poor clinical outcome of African American (AA) patients. The outcomes of our study will allow distinction between clinically indolent and aggressive prostate tumors, and pave the way for novel target-based therapies, which will ultimately reduce the enhanced burden of prostate cancer on African American population and improve overall survival of prostate cancer patients.",Molecular determinant of racial disparity in prostate cancer,9259945,U01CA185490,"['Affect ', ' Aggression ', ' Aggressive behavior ', ' Surgical Castration ', ' Castration ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cells ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Exhibits ', ' Gene Regulation Process ', ' Gene Regulation ', ' Gene Action Regulation ', ' Gene Expression Regulation ', ' Genes ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Growth ', ' Therapeutic Hormone ', ' Endocrine Gland Secretion ', ' Hormones ', ' Incidence ', ' Ligands ', ' Luciferases ', ' Luciferase Immunologic ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' mortality ', ' Neoplasm Metastasis ', ' tumor cell metastasis ', ' cancer metastasis ', ' Secondary Tumor ', ' Secondary Neoplasm ', ' Metastatic Tumor ', ' Metastatic Neoplasm ', ' Metastatic Mass ', ' Metastatic Lesion ', ' Metastasize ', ' Metastasis ', ' Patients ', ' Play ', ' Prostate ', ' Prostatic Gland ', ' Prostate Gland ', ' Prostatic Neoplasms ', ' Prostatic Neoplasia ', ' Prostate Tumor ', ' Prostate Neoplasms ', ' Proto-Oncogenes ', ' protooncogene ', ' c-ONC ', ' Cellular Oncogene ', ' Publishing ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Androgen Receptor ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Socioeconomic Factors ', ' Specificity ', ' T-Lymphocyte ', ' thymus derived lymphocyte ', ' Thymus-Dependent Lymphocytes ', ' T-Cells ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' hK3 Kallikrein ', ' gamma-Seminoprotein ', ' Seminin ', ' Semenogelase ', ' Prostate Specific Antigen Preproprotein ', ' Plasma Prekallikrein ', ' Plasma Kallikrein Precursor ', ' P-30 Antigen ', ' Kallikrein 3 ', ' EC 3.4.21.34 ', ' Prostate-Specific Antigen ', ' Transcription Activation ', ' Transcriptional Activation ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Benign ', ' Clinical ', ' Refractory ', ' Malignant ', ' Malignant - descriptor ', ' insight ', ' Indolent ', ' European ', ' Gene Targeting ', ' docetaxol ', ' Taxotere ', ' docetaxel ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Normal tissue morphology ', ' Normal Tissue ', ' Malignant neoplasm of prostate ', ' Prostatic Cancer ', ' Prostate Cancer ', ' Prostate CA ', ' Malignant prostatic tumor ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Prostate ', ' Disease Management ', ' Disorder Management ', ' PSA level ', ' Frequencies ', ' Nuclear ', ' American ', ' receptor expression ', ' Toxic effect ', ' Toxicities ', ' novel ', ' disease classification ', ' nosology ', ' disorder classification ', ' Modality ', ' Pathogenesis ', ' Reporting ', ' Therapeutic Intervention ', ' intervention therapy ', ' response ', ' RNA Interference ', ' Sequence-Specific Posttranscriptional Gene Silencing ', ' RNAi ', ' RNA Silencing ', ' Quelling ', ' Posttranscriptional Gene Silencing ', ' Post-Transcriptional Gene Silencing ', ' Tissue Sample ', ' KLK3 gene ', ' KLKB1 ', ' KLK3 ', ' Data ', ' Disease Marker ', ' Receptor Signaling ', ' Cancer Patient ', ' Characteristics ', ' Molecular ', ' Process ', ' treatment resistance ', ' therapeutic resistance ', ' resistant to therapy ', ' resistance to therapy ', ' therapy resistant ', ' vector ', ' knockdown ', ' knock-down ', ' LNCaP ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' disparity in cancer ', ' cancer disparity ', ' Resistance ', ' resistant ', ' clinically relevant ', ' clinical relevance ', ' clinically significant ', ' clinical significance ', ' mouse model ', ' murine model ', ' therapeutic target ', ' tumor ', ' overexpression ', ' overexpress ', ' over-expression ', ' public health relevance ', ' ChIP-seq ', ' chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequencing ', ' ChIP Sequencing ', ' transcriptome sequencing ', ' RNAseq ', ' RNA sequencing ', ' RNA Seq ', ' prostate cancer cell ', ' prostate tumor cell ', ' racial disparity ', ' race disparity ', ' disparities in race ', ' prostate cancer cell line ', ' disparity reduction ', ' reduce disparity ', ' androgen sensitive ', ' androgen responsive ', ' androgen dependent ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH ALABAMA,U01,2017,314363,-0.042979467301040394
"A nutrition-based approach to reduce heart disease risk among overweight African Americans: Use of soul food plant-based or omnivorous diets to address cardiovascular disease African Americans (AAs) are disproportionately affected by cardiovascular disease (CVD), having the highest death rates from CVD as compared with other racial/ethnic groups. In addition, AAs have the highest rates of obesity as compared to whites and Hispanics. People following plant-based dietary approaches, particularly vegan or vegetarian diets, have lower risks of CVD and lower body weights than omnivores. Vegan and vegetarian diets have been used effectively for weight loss and maintenance and for reversing CVD. Although intervention trials have shown a significant weight-loss and cholesterol-lowering effect of adoption of plant-based diets, t o date, most of these large randomized trials have had limited participation from AA participants. AAs tend to lose less weight during behavioral interventions than their white counterparts. In addition, most research has shown that AAs are more likely to discontinue participation in behavioral dietary interventions. This combination of higher attrition and lower weight loss may be due to a failure to address issues that are culturally relevant to the AA population. Our recent 6-month trial examined the use of a vegan diet as compared to 4 other plant-based dietary approaches (vegetarian, pesco-vegetarian, semi-vegetarian, or omnivorous). Weight loss among AAs in the vegan diet was significantly greater (-8.5±3.3%, n=3) than AAs randomized to diet approaches that will be similar to the omnivorous approach in our proposed study (semi- vegetarian/omnivorous groups, 1.4±1.8%, n=3). Of the 12 AA participants who began the study, only one did not complete the study (8% attrition rate) compared to 12 out of the 49 white participants (24% attrition). In total, these results point to the potential of an entirely plant-based dietary intervention to overcome two barriers encountered in previous studies aiming to improve dietary intake and weight loss among overweight AAs for CVD prevention: low weight loss results and high attrition rates.  The goal of this proposed study is to apply these findings in a CVD prevention intervention specifically for AAs living in the southeast U.S. We have developed a partnership with the owners of two soul food restaurants in Columbia, SC (one vegan, the other traditional).These restaurants, which focus on southern cuisine, are owned and operated by local AA families, and will assist with developing culturally-appropriate recipes for our intervention. W e will conduct a two-year dietary trial among overweight AA adults (N=130) randomized to follow one of two diets both emphasizing southern food culture and low-glycemic index and low-fat foods: Vegan or Omnivorous (omni) diet. This study will compare the impact of these diet patterns on changes in CVD risk factors, including LDL cholesterol and blood pressure, and body weight. If this intervention proves to be successful at reducing weight and CVD risk factors among AAs, it has the potential to be disseminated through a variety of locations throughout the US, including restaurants, federally qualified health clinics, churches, or neighborhood community centers. Our proposed project will examine the effect of adopting two different dietary patterns (vegan and omnivorous), which focus on southern cuisine, on both cardiovascular disease risk factors and weight loss among overweight African American adults. Our proposed research study will use a randomized design to examine the effects of adopting these two dietary patterns on cardiovascular disease risk factors and weight loss. We will partner with two local community restaurants to help inform intervention and recipe development.",A nutrition-based approach to reduce heart disease risk among overweight African Americans: Use of soul food plant-based or omnivorous diets to address cardiovascular disease,9380470,R01HL135220,"['Adoption ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Affect ', ' Behavior ', ' lifestyle modification ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' behavior intervention ', ' Life Style Modification ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' Blood Pressure ', ' Body Weight ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' Cholesterol ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Communities ', ' dietary ', ' Diet ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Family ', ' Fats ', ' Fatty acid glycerol esters ', ' Food or Food Product ', ' Food ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' heart disorder ', ' Cardiac Disorders ', ' Cardiac Diseases ', ' Heart Diseases ', ' LDL Cholesterol Lipoproteins ', ' beta-Lipoprotein Cholesterol ', ' Low Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol ', ' LDL Cholesterol ', ' Maintenance ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' nutrition ', ' Obesity ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Plants ', ' Edible Plants ', ' Food Plants ', ' Research ', ' Restaurants ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Southeastern United States ', ' Southeast US ', ' Southeast U.S. ', ' Taste Perception ', ' taste response ', ' taste processing ', ' gustatory response ', ' gustatory processing ', ' gustatory perception ', ' Taste ', ' Gustation ', ' Testing ', ' wt-loss ', ' body weight loss ', ' Weight Reduction ', ' Weight Loss ', ' Body Weight decreased ', ' Weight ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Hispanics ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Death Rate ', ' Ensure ', ' Failure ', ' African ', ' satisfaction ', ' diet intervention ', ' Nutritional Interventions ', ' Nutrition Interventions ', ' Dietary Intervention ', ' Letters ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' Vegetarian diet ', ' Vegetarianism ', ' cooking ', ' Vegan Diet ', ' veganism ', ' vegan ', ' Adopted ', ' Clinic ', ' Pattern ', ' Location ', ' Overweight ', ' Over weight ', ' Church ', ' cardiovascular disorder prevention ', ' cardiovascular disease prevention ', ' cardiac disease prevention ', ' CVD prevention ', ' cohort ', ' Recipe ', ' Participant ', ' research study ', ' disorder risk ', ' disease risk ', ' Intervention Trial ', ' Interventional trial ', ' cardiovascular risk factor ', ' cardiovascular risk ', ' Sampling ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Meta-Analysis ', ' Meta-Analyses ', ' Data Pooling ', ' Clinical Trial Overviews ', ' heart disease risk ', ' heart disorder risk ', ' cardiac disorder risk ', ' cardiac disease risk ', ' cardiovascular disorder risk ', ' cardiovascular disease risk ', ' Glycemic Index ', ' Glycemic Index Number ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Dietary intake ', ' Address ', ' Dietary Practices ', ' dietary pattern ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Preventative intervention ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' weight maintenance ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' randomized trial ', ' Randomization trial ', ' dietary approach ', ' community center ', ' ']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA AT COLUMBIA,R01,2017,716955,0.027728288462345874
"Integrated genomic analysis of racial disparities in endometrial cancer DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Although the incidence of endometrial cancer in African-American (AA) women is lower than in Caucasian (C) women, a striking racial disparity exists in endometrial cancer survival rates in the United States, with blacks having up to 30% worse survival rates than whites. Socio-demographic factors alone cannot account for this difference because differences in survival still occur when analyses are adjusted for black and white women by stage and by biologically aggressive (i.e., Type II) endometrial tumors. Uterine serous papillary carcinoma (USC), represents the most aggressive histologic subtype of endometrial cancer. This variant of endometrial carcinoma is up to three fold more frequent in AA women when compared to C women. On the basis of our recently published data on the genetic landscape of USC suggesting that genetic and biologic factors may underlie the racial disparity in survival rates and with the ultimate goal to develop novel, more specific and more effective treatment modalities for the diagnosis and therapy of USC so common in AA women, we propose the following: Aim 1: Identify through whole exome sequencing driver mutation candidates, loss of heterozygosity (LOH) patterns and copy number variations (CNV) in 200 USC samples and use bioinformatics strategies to perform a systematic assessment of genetic differences between AA vs C tumors, Aim 2: Evaluate miRNAs and mRNA expression differences in USC from AA and C and perform downstream analysis of pathways influencing disease in different groups of USC (i.e., c-erbB2+ vs negative and PIK3CA and CCNE1 mutants vs wild type) and Aim 3: Evaluate the biochemical properties of a subset of novel PIK3CA mutations and validate the c-erbB2/PIK3CA and CCNE1 pathways as novel targets for USC treatment using primary USC cell lines and targeted agents including trastuzumab and T-DM1 (i.e., mAbs targeting c-erbB2), AZD8055, GDC-0980 and CYC065 (i.e., a mTOR/PI3K/CDK inhibitors) in in vitro and in vivo assays. This proposal encompasses the first integrated analysis of genomic differences in USC developed by AA when compared to C women as well as the validation of the currently identified differentially expressed genes harboring key driver mutations as novel targets for USC therapy in minority. Relevance Definition and functional validation of key driver mutations and downstream signaling pathways differentially active in AA women harboring USC may be used to guide novel, highly effective targeted therapies against these highly aggressive tumors and, therefore, may have immediate clinical relevance on minority health. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Type II endometrial tumors such as uterine serous carcinoma (USC) are more commonly diagnosed in AA women when compared to C women, suggesting a genetic predisposition in black women to develop these biologically aggressive neoplasms. This proposal is designed to perform the first comprehensive analysis of genomic differences in USC developed by AA women when compared to C women. We will search for driver gene mutations, loss of heterozygosity (LOH) and copy number variations (CNV) and identify miRNAs and genes highly differentially expressed in USC developed by AA women when compared to C women. These studies will provide essential information for a better understanding of the genetic cause of the disparity in frequency of this diagnosis in AA women as well as the molecular basis responsible for the unfavorable prognosis more frequent in AA women relative to C women. Finally, our results will provide essential information for the development of USC-specific therapies for preventing progression of advanced/recurrent disease after conventional surgery and

"IBD Gene Mapping by Clinical and Population Subset PROJECT SUMMARY Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) are complex genetic disorders of the gastrointestinal tract, and a major health burden to patients and society. Tremendous progress has been made in dissecting IBD genetic etiology with identification of over 200 IBD loci by genome wide association studies (GWAS) but mainly limited to persons of European ancestry. The IBD Genetics Consortium (IBDGC) was established to facilitate multicenter collaborative studies of 6 Genetics Research Centers (GRCs) organized with a Data Coordinating Center (DCC). Our GRC at Johns Hopkins (JHGRC) has contributed to all IBDGC studies, meeting recruitment objectives and taking roles in IBDGC leadership positions. Our particular focus is on African American (AA) IBD genetics. We performed the first large-scale evaluation of European loci in the AA population, replicating several genes, but also finding unique African-ancestral variants within these loci, as well as identified multiple admixture significant loci. We also published the first AA IBD genome-wide association study (GWAS), a collaborative effort that identified two African-specific gene loci, and replicated multiple additional European loci. We have also explored why some loci with proven risk variants in Europeans and other populations only cause disease in one ancestral population but not others. More research in AA IBD is needed to understand the etiology of IBD in this ancestrally distinct, major American population. In this application we will re-evaluate the AA GWAS by better imputation, evaluate whole genome sequencing data to test low frequency and rare variants, and perform an evaluation for chromosome X variants. We will recruit a large number of AA IBD patients through our own and multiple Satellite Recruitment Centers to power a second AA IBD GWAS, both UC and CD, and meta-analyze with the first to identify more novel loci, identify more African specific risk variants, and replicate known loci for this population and replicate our admixture loci. We will also incorporate diverse data sources to incorporate into our GWAS analyses including RNA-Seq currently being generated on lymophoblastoid cell lines from AA CD cases and controls, and RNA-Seq that we will generate in colonic biopsies from UC cases and controls. We will evaluate chromatin differences and expression of genes in cell types relevant to IBD from European, AA and East Asian ancestries in an effort to better understand locus heterogeneity by ancestry. We will continue to participate in all IBDGC activities to maximize the Impact of IBD genetics research by this cooperative funding mechanism. According to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention, an estimated 1.4 million Americans suffer from Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD), a chronic debilitating disorder with no cure that includes Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. IBD ranks in the top 5 in prevalence for gastrointestinal disorders and represents a significant financial burden to society requiring a lifetime of medical care. This proposed research aims to determine the genetic variations that cause IBD which will aid in developing preventive measures, improving the quality of care with better treatments and educating patients through genetic counseling.",IBD Gene Mapping by Clinical and Population Subset,9402477,U01DK062431,"['Algorithms ', ' Biopsy ', ' cultured cell line ', ' Strains Cell Lines ', ' CellLine ',

"Race-related alternative splicing: novel targets in prostate cancer African American (AA) men exhibit 1.6-fold higher incidence and 2.4-fold higher mortality rates from prostate cancer (PCa) compared to white men. Although much of this disparity remains after controlling for factors related to social determinants of health, very few studies have used this population-based difference to identify molecular mechanisms of tumor aggressiveness. The proposed work addresses the urgent need to interrogate the molecular mechanisms driving the more aggressive PCa biology in AA men across the PCa progression continuum and to modulate such mechanisms for therapeutic application.  Our data from evaluating PCa biopsy tissue from AA and white patients has led to the discovery of alternative splicing as a novel molecular mechanism underlying more aggressive PCa in AA men. Preliminary analysis has indicated that several of these race-related alternative splicing events track with increased growth and more aggressive invasion characteristics of PCa in AA men. Additional preliminary work has demonstrated our capability to generate the first significant collection of PCa patient-derived explants and the first establishment of PCa patient-derived explants from AA patients.  We aim to extend our preliminary findings by 1) determining the pattern and frequency of candidate race- related splice variants across the PCa progression continuum, from localized PCa of varying degrees of aggressiveness to metastatic castration-resistant PCa, and defining the relationship between these variants and PCa cell biology, 2) assessing the effects of expression of particular race-related splice variants on mechanistic and functional biology in population-specific PCa cell lines and developing tools to pharmacologically modulate race-related oncogenic splice variants for therapeutic application using AA and white PCa cell lines and AA and white PCa patient-derived explants generated for this study and 3) defining the biological significance of cis- acting splicing elements and/or trans-acting splicing factors to driving the alternative splicing events specific to AA PCa.  The rationale for and impact of this study are that it will further our understanding of the molecular mechanisms driving PCa disparities and aid in development of novel precision biomarkers for prostate tumor aggressiveness and/or therapeutic agents against aggressive PCa. Such precision medicine interventions will reduce PCa disparities for AAs and will likely have impact on a subset of patients of all races with aggressive PCa. New AA and white PCa bio-specimens, AA and white PCa patient-derived explants and derivative cell lines and splicing-related materials and methods and tools resulting from the proposed work will be available to the nationwide cohort of scientists conducting research on PCa disparities. African American men are two times more likely to be diagnosed with prostate cancer than white men and are three times more likely to die from prostate cancer than white men. Our proposed work focuses on understanding the biological differences between African American and white prostate cancer and how to modulate these differences to treat aggressive prostate cancer.

"Culture, Family Process, and Developmental Outcomes in Asian American Youth DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Counter to the ""model minority"" stereotype, Asian American (AA) youth show a uniquely mixed pattern of behaviors. They report better academic performance, fewer externalizing problems (e.g., substance use, violence), but more internalizing problems (e.g., depression, suicide) than youth of other racial-ethnic groups. During emerging adulthood, the positive outcomes in AA youth do not seem to hold up, and poor mental health is exacerbated. In fact, the suicide rate among young AA women is alarming, posing a serious public concern. In addition, AA youth subgroups dramatically differ in youth outcomes: some subgroups fare well while others struggle. However, our current knowledge is seriously limited in understanding how parenting and parent-child relations help or hinder youth development among AA youth. The existing family-process model, which is derived mainly from Western conceptualization, does not seem to be adequate to predict health and behavioral outcomes in AA youth. For example, the associations between parenting and youth behaviors among AA youth do not often show a conventional pattern but in fact reveal a paradoxical pattern. Cultures vary in parenting beliefs and behaviors and how they establish parent-child relations. In addition, like all other minority youth, AA youth face acculturation, having to negotiate between parental and mainstream cultures. However, culturally unique aspects of family process and the issue of acculturation are often neglected in the existing parenting research. This study responds to the urgent need for reliable longitudinal data of AA youth, the fastest growing but one of the most understudied and misunderstood populations in the United States. This proposed study aims to formulate a culturally adequate family-process model that incorporates acculturation in family process to accurately explain the complex outcome patterns of AA youth. The study will collect annual longitudinal survey data from Filipino American and Korean American families in the state of Illinois (N=1,960; 350 youth, 350 mothers, and 280 fathers from 350 families with n=980 per group) with the following specific aims: (1) to examine the concurrent and longitudinal associations of family process (parental beliefs, parental behaviors, and parent-child relations) with academic achievement, externalizing problems, and internalizing problems among AA youth, (2) to delineate developmental trajectories and their determinants in family process for the three outcome domains during adolescence and through the transition to young adulthood among AA youth, and (3) to investigate the influences of acculturation on the ways family process is connected to youth outcomes and developmental trajectories among AA youth. The results of this study will guide AA parents to preserve the aspects of their parenting that produce and maintain positive youth behaviors but to modify their parenting or adopt new strategies to prevent serious internalizing problems or worsening of those problems. The results also can guide parents of other race/ethnic groups to adopt AA parenting methods to help maximize their child's potential growth without increasing mental-health problems. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Asian Americans are the fastest growing population in the United States, but they remain underserved and misunderstood, often labeled as the ""model minority."" This application responds to the urgent needs of Asian American youth by attempting to explain their significantly high rates of internalizing problems such as depression and suicide, their inability to sustain positive behaviors, and the significant disparities in health and behavioral outcomes among Asian American subgroups.","Culture, Family Process, and Developmental Outcomes in Asian American Youth",9244825,R01HD073200,"['Cultural Assimilation ', ' Acculturation ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' Adolescence ', ' Asian Americans ', ' Assertiveness ', ' authoritarian ', ' Authoritarianism ', ' Behavior ', ' Belief ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Infant and Child Development ', ' Child Development ', ' childrearing ', ' Parenting behavior ', ' Parenting ', ' Child Rearing ', ' Conflict ', ' Conflict (Psychology) ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Environment ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Ethnic group ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' Family ', ' Fathers ', ' Goals ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Growth ', ' Health ', ' Illinois ', ' Income ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Mainstreaming ', ' achievement Mainstream Education ', ' Educational Mainstreaming ', ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Methods ', ' Mothers ', ' Paint ', ' Parent-Child Relations ', ' parent offspring interaction ', ' parent child interaction ', ' Parent-Child Relationship ', ' Parents ', ' Poverty ', ' Biological Preservation ', ' preservation ', ' Biologic Preservation ', ' Public Health ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Research ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Stereotyping ', ' United States ', ' violent behavior ', ' violent ', ' Violence ', ' Woman ', ' oriental ', ' Asians ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', ' Longitudinal Surveys ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Youth ', ' Chinese ', ' Chinese People ', ' Label ', ' improved ', ' psychological ', ' psychologic ', ' Training ', ' using substances ', ' substance using ', ' substance use ', ' AOD use ', ' Alcohol or Other Drugs use ', ' young adulthood ', ' adult youth ', ' young adult ', ' Immigrant ', ' Empirical Research ', ' Knowledge ', ' Adopted ', ' Investigation ', ' Complex ', ' Pattern ', ' Occupational ', ' American ', ' elementary school ', ' grade school ', ' Performance ', ' Filipino American ', ' Korean American ', ' high school ', ' trait ', ' Mediation ', ' Negotiation ', ' Negotiating ', ' Academic achievement ', ' Reporting ', ' Modeling ', ' boys ', ' girls ', ' theories ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Data ', ' Indigenous ', ' Subgroup ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' Process ', ' depression and suicidality ', ' Depression and Suicide ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' suicide rate ', ' neglect ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' aged ', ' Family Process ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' public health relevance ', ' emerging adulthood ', ' behavioral outcome ', ' behavior outcome ', ' ']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,R01,2017,555865,0.06685910949037294
"Consequences and mechanism of aberrant splicing in African American prostate cancer disparities Summary There are striking population (race) disparities in prostate cancer (PCa) risk and survival outcome borne out of current health statistics. This is particularly evident between African American (AA) patients and their European American (EA) counterparts, where AAs exhibit a 1.5 to 2 fold higher risk of PCa incidence and mortality. We demonstrate that differential alternative RNA splicing takes place for oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes in PCa specimens of AA compared to EA patients. The differential splicing events result in the enrichment and in many instances generation of AA-specific splice variants not observed in EA cancers. We have cloned the AA and EA splice variant cDNAs for both phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase catalytic subunit delta (PIK3CD) and fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3), and ectopically introduced the clones individually into PCa cell lines. Compared to the EA variant-expressing lines, the AA variant-expressing lines are more oncogenic in in vitro cell proliferation and invasion assays, and exhibit greater tumor growth/metastasis and resistance to small molecule targeted therapy in xenograft mouse models. These findings may explain, in part, the observed cancer health disparities in the AA population relative to other racial groups. The mechanism responsible for the formation of AA-specific or -enriched mRNA splice variants are hypothesized to be due to the dysregulated expression of 6 key splicing factor s in AA PCa specimens. We refer to this dysregulation and associated production of AA-specific splice variants as an “AA splicing factor code in PCa disparities.” Notwithstanding these developments, a number of questions remain unresolved. First, what is the mechanism(s) of dysregulated expression of the 6 splicing factors? Second, can the production of AA-specific splice variants via exon skipping be directly attributed to the 6 dysregulated splicing factors? Lastly, how do the encoded proteins of the AA-specific short variants of PIK3CD and FGFR3 mediate a more oncogenic phenotype in PCa cells? The objectives of this application are to address these questions, and to provide a mechanistic framework of population-related differences in alternative RNA splicing, which is anticipated to facilitate future identification of druggable targets (e.g. splicing factors and/or resulting splice variant proteins) of AA tumor phenotype and disparities. Narrative African American (AA) prostate cancers express unique mRNA variants not found in European American (EA) cancers, which we hypothesize are responsible in part for the more aggressive nature of the disease and poorer prognosis in the AA population. Our underlying premise is that multiple key RNA splicing factors are uniquely dysregulated in AA prostate cancer, leading to the formation of these AA-specific mRNA variants that encode more oncogenic versions of signal transducing proteins. Our study is expected to identify the molecular mechanism(s) driving dysregulated splicing factor expression, define the cis-acting RNA sequence elements essential for the production of the AA-specific mRNA variants, and characterize protein isoform function encoded by the AA-specific variants, which may serve as future treatment options in cancer health disparities.",Consequences and

"Evaluation of molecular determinants of racial disparity in triple-negative breast cancer PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a very aggressive subtype with limited therapeutic options. Intriguingly, women of African American (AA) origin have much higher TNBC-related mortality rates compared to European American (EA) women. This difference is evident even after adjusting for socioeconomic status and access to care, indicating a biological basis. TNBC tumors in AA women exhibit higher rate of growth and metastasis in comparison to TNBC in EA women. There is an urgent need to understand the molecular mechanisms involved in aggressive progression and increased metastatic potential of AA-TNBC. In our preliminary studies, we observed that AA-TNBC cells have higher invasion and migration potential in comparison to EA-TNBC cells showing inherently aggressive nature of AA-TNBC. In a preliminary screen, we found that a large percentage of AA-TNBC tumors exhibit loss-of-tumor suppressor Liver Kinase B1 (LKB1) in comparison to EA-TNBC tumors. Our preliminary microarray studies also found that LKB1-loss in AA-TNBC results in activation of oncoproteins- YAP and TAZ. Our data suggest that with inherent loss of LKB1, AA-TNBC gain `an oncogenic input' in the form of activated YAP-TAZ signaling. Using in vitro studies, clinical AA-TNBC and EA-TNBC samples and patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models, we will test our hypothesis that inherent LKB1-loss in AA-TNBC results in activation of oncogenic YAP-TAZ signaling leading to aggressive progression and increased metastatic potential of AA-TNBC. Our novel findings also suggest that AA-TNBC tumors may be vulnerable to therapeutic strategies directed at YAP-TAZ inhibition. Based on our strong preliminary data, we will investigate how loss of LKB1 in AA-TNBC might lead to acquisition of higher YAP-TAZ, and drive growth and metastasis of AA-TNBC cells. We will also analyze AA-TNBC and EA-TNBC tumors to establish LKB1-loss and elevated YAP-TAZ as biomarkers of aggressive progression of AA-TNBC. We will utilize these biological insights to test and propose safe and effective therapeutic strategies to target AA-TNBC. Using patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models, we propose to investigate whether AA-TNBCs are particularly susceptible to YAP-TAZ inhibition strategies and whether currently clinically available drugs (screened from a drug library) can be repurposed to target YAP-TAZ in AA-TNBC. Secondly, we plan to examine whether Honokiol, a natural compound from Magnolia grandiflora, (selected from a screen of known bioactive compounds) and its novel analogs have the potential to inhibit YAP-TAZ in AA-TNBC. Our studies will provide new understanding how loss-of-LKB1 and gain-of-YAP-TAZ in AA-TNBC form a relentless axis that drives AA-TNBC. These studies will provide novel insight into molecular mechanisms underlying racial disparity in TNBC and provide a novel set of biomarkers and potential drug-targets to develop novel ways to reduce the disparity in clinical outcome of AA and EA TNBC patients. Project Narrative Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) in African American (AA) women is more aggressive than TNBC in European American (EA); 5-year relative survival for AA-TNBC is only 14% in comparison to 36% for EA- TNBC therefore it is imperative to understand the underlying molecular mechanisms leading to this racial disparity. Using in vitro studies, clinical AA-TNBC and EA-TNBC samples and patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models, we will test our hypothesis that inherent LKB1-loss in AA-TNBC tumors results in activation of oncoprotein- YAP-TAZ leading to ‘oncogene addiction’ and aggressive tumor progression. These studies will provide novel insight into molecular mechanisms underlying racial disparity in TNBC and provide a novel set of biomarkers and potential drug-targets to develop novel ways to reduce

"Brain-Gut Axis and Its Influence on Gestational Weight Gain ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Nearly two-thirds of US women of childbearing age are overweight or obese and nearly half, once pregnant, have excessive gestational weight gain (GWG). Excessive GWG is a significant predictor of poor obstetric outcomes and lifelong health risks for a woman and her infant. Obesity, which oftentimes worsens with each pregnancy and advancing age, increases obstetric and fetal complications. Inadequate GWG also poses risks to the mother and infant. African American (AA) women's rates of preexisting obesity and both excessive and inadequate GWG is higher than rates for women of other races, across nearly all BMI categories. Currently, the biobehavioral factors associated with excessive and inadequate GWG are poorly understood, yet in order to improve outcomes, are essential to identify, particularly for AA women. In the proposed pilot study, we will test the hypothesis that an underlying mechanism that contributes to within-race variability in GWG patterns is the structure and dynamics of the gut microbiome during pregnancy and, further, that the brain-gut axis is influenced by biobehavioral factors identified as important contributors to GWG. Increasing evidence supports that the gut microbiome greatly influences the bidirectional signaling between the gastrointestinal tract and the brain. Little is known about the intra-racial variations in the ut microbiome and the brain-gut axis. Even less is known about the gut microbiome across BMI categories, microbiome changes in pregnancy, and maternal behavior profiles linked with GWG. In the parent study, pregnant AA women are recruited among 18 to 35 year-old women during the 1st and 2nd trimesters. For the proposed sub-study an additional 3rd trimester prenatal encounter will be added for a subset of 80 women. This visit will occur between 35-41 weeks' gestation and will involve a 3rd rectal swab and completion of questionnaires on stress, mood, and diet. Nearly all data used in the sub-study will be from the 1st and 3rd trimester data collections. Upon analysis, a two-sample t-test or ANOVA will be used to compare the logarithm transformations of microbes. To compare the percentage of microbes within the same women from 1st to 3rd trimester time points, a paired t-test will be performed on the logarithm transformed percentages. For a more detailed trend analysis over the time points, a mixed effects ANOVA will be performed. Partial correlation analyses will be used to test for pairwise linear associations between the outcomes and interval and/or total GWG after adjusting for the biological and/or psychosocial factors. With the parent study underway, a strong research team is actively investigating the role of the microbiome in AA women's obstetric outcomes, particularly preterm birth. Ms. Edwards, the PI of this proposed study, is gaining vital experience and is poised to begin collecting data and analyzing results. As obesity and improper GWG are known contributors to racial disparities in birth outcomes and chronic conditions, the proposed study will serve as a step toward ameliorating health disparities in AA families.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: African American (AA) women have higher rates of both excessive and inadequate gestational weight gain (GWG) compared to women of other races -- both of which are significantly predictive of poor obstetric outcomes and lifelong health risks for the woman and her infant. The underlying biobehavioral factors associated with both excessive and inadequate GWG are poorly understood, yet are essential to identify, particularly for AA women, in order that effective interventions may be developed. In the proposed pilot study, we will investigate dysregulation of the ""brain-gut"" axis as an underlying mechanism contributing to within-race variability in GWG patterns.            ",Brain-Gut

"A Follow-up Study for Causes of Cancer in Black Women African-American (AA) women have a higher incidence of many cancers (e.g., colon, pancreas) and higher cancer mortality (e.g., breast, colon, pancreas) relative to other American women, and many of these differences are unexplained. The Black Women's Health Study (BWHS), the largest follow-up study of AA women, was begun in 1995 to provide relevant information on these racial disparities. 59,000 AA women ages 21-69 from 17 states enrolled by completing health questionnaires. The BWHS has successfully followed them for cancer through biennial questionnaires and linkage to 24 cancer registries in the states in which >95% of participants live. Data have been collected on numerous potential risk factors (e.g, medical, reproductive, lifestyle, psychosocial, socioeconomic, air pollution). Cancer diagnoses are validated by hospital and cancer registry pathology data. A DNA/oral microbiome biorepository contains saliva-mouthwash samples from 26,800 participants. Blood sample collection, in progress, has obtained blood samples from 9,300 participants to date (14,000+ expected) . Breast tumor tissue has been collected for 750 incident breast cancers. The study has identified 5,631 incident cancers to date, including 2,651 breast cancers. The study has published extensively on nongenetic and genetic risk factors for breast cancer and other cancers. Because participants were young at baseline (median age = 38), accrual of less common cancers was slow. Participants have now reached ages of high cancer incidence, meaning that sufficient numbers will be accrued for informative assessment. This infrastructure proposal has 3 aims: (1) continue and enhance follow-up and data collection in the BWHS, adding information (including Medicare data) on cancer treatments and outcomes (2) manage and enhance biologic sample collection by adding additional samples to the saliva/mouthwash and blood repositories, collecting tumor tissue for all solid cancers in addition to breast cancer, collecting full-field digital prediagnostic mammograms, and genotyping with a genome-wide array all incident cancer cases for which we have a DNA sample (~2,800) together with an equal number of controls with DNA; (3) share the data in consortial projects. Continuation of the BWHS is a high priority because: a) 89% of participants are still cancer-free due to the young age at baseline; b) follow-up has been successful and unbiased ; c) the BWHS can assess the effects of exposures (e.g., class 2 and class 3 obesity, premature birth, experiences of racism) that are less prevalent in other populations; d) increasingly large numbers are needed to study scientific questions and BWHS genetic, nongenetic, and biospecimen data will contribute to numerous consortia to study a range of cancers; e) the BWHS has a record of high productivity; f) further work is needed to understand numerous racial disparities in cancer incidence and survival. In sum, continuation of the BWHS will contribute appreciably to knowledge about cancer etiology and survival in an underserved population; the biolospecimen and mammogram repositories will contribute greatly to that effort, as will participation in consortial studies. Incidence and mortality rates of many cancers continue to be disproportionately high among AA women. The Black Women's Health Study, a follow-up study of 59,000 AA women, has contributed important information on risk factors for cancer and has obtained blood samples from over 9,300 participants to date and saliva samples (source of DNA and oral microbiome) from 26,800. Continued follow-up, addition of tumor tissue samples, digital images from screening mammograms, and genome-wide SNP data from cancer cases, and participation of the BWHS in collaborative studies, will produce valuable information that can lead to more effective prevention and treatment measures for cancer in AA women.",A Follow-up Study for Causes of Cancer in Black Women,9313515,U01CA164974,"['Affect ', ' ages ', ' Age ', ' Air Pollution ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Blood ', ' Breast ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Censuses ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Colon ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Collection ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' DNA ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Endometrium ', ' Followup Studies ', ' Follow-Up Studies ', ' Genotype ', ' Health ', ' health insurance for disabled ', ' Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Disabled Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Aged and Disabled, Title 18 ', ' Medicare ', ' Level of Health ', ' Health Status ', ' Hospitals ', ' Incidence ', ' Income ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Kidney ', ' renal ', ' Kidney Urinary System ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Life Style ', ' Lifestyle ', ' Lung ', ' pulmonary ', ' Lung Respiratory System ', ' Mammography ', ' mammographic exams ', ' mammographic examinations ', ' Mammogram ', ' Medical Records ', ' mortality ', ' Mouthwash ', ' Persons ', ' Newsletter ', ' Obesity ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Online Systems ', ' web based ', ' online computer ', ' On-Line Systems ', ' Ovary ', ' Pancreas ', ' Pancreatic ', ' Pathology ', ' Productivity ', ' Publishing ', ' Questionnaires ', ' Rectum ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Saliva ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Female Health ', "" Women's Health "", ' Treatment outcome ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' Nonrespondent ', ' preterm delivery ', ' premature delivery ', ' premature childbirth ', ' Preterm Birth ', ' Prematurely delivering ', ' Pre-term birth ', ' Premature Birth ', ' Blood Sample ', ' Blood specimen ', ' specimen collection ', ' sample collection ', ' Solid ', ' Medical ', ' racism ', ' Link ', ' Sample Size ', ' Funding ', ' Solid Tumor ', ' Solid Neoplasm ', ' Knowledge ', ' Source ', ' System ', ' Tumor Tissue ', ' psychosocial ', ' American ', ' digital imaging ', ' computer imaging ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' cohort ', ' Manuscripts ', ' Participant ', ' Prevention ', ' reproductive ', ' neoplasm registry ', ' cancer registry ', ' genetic risk factor ', ' inherited factor ', ' Sampling ', ' repository ', ' cancer therapy ', ' anticancer therapy ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Treatment ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Therapy ', ' Cancer Treatment ', ' cancer diagnosis ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Tissue Sample ', ' Pancreatic Lymphoma ', ' pancreas lymphoma ', ' Address ', ' Mammary Neoplasms ', ' mammary tumor ', ' Mammary Cancer ', ' Breast Tumors ', ' Breast Neoplasms ', ' Breast Cancer Risk Factor ', ' Data ', ' Multiple Cancer Sites ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Sum ', ' Cancer Cause ', ' Cancer Etiology ', ' Collection ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' nonmalignant ', ' Non-Malignant ', ' Tissue Chip ', ' Tissue Arrays ', ' Tissue Microarray ', ' Preparation ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socio-economically ', ' socio-economic ', ' socioeconomics ', ' website ', ' web site ', ' total oral microbial community ', ' oral microbiome ', ' cost ', ' digital ', ' underserved people ', ' under served population ', ' Underserved Population ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' disparity in cancer ', ' cancer disparity ', ' genome-wide ', ' genomewide ', ' genome scale ', ' non-genetic ', ' nongenetic ', ' biobank ', ' biorepository ', ' sharing data ', ' screening ', ' racial disparity ', ' race disparity ', ' disparities in race ', ' Genetic study ', ' Breast Cancer Patient ', ' Breast Tumor Patient ', ' cancer survival ', ' ']",NCI,BOSTON UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CAMPUS,U01,2017,2195369,-0.04888732288836776
"A new approach to controlling chlamydia transmission in young people Abstract Chlamydia trachomatis (Ct) is the most commonly reported sexually transmitted infection in the U.S., is a major cause of infertility, pelvic inflammatory disease and ectopic pregnancy among women and has been associated with increased HIV acquisition. Because women experience the most severe sequelae, the focus of Ct prevention in the U.S. has been on screening sexually active women < 25 years old. Though men are reservoirs of the infection, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have not recommended targeting men due to lack of evidence for this approach. This research will fill this gap. African American (AA) women are 7.5 times more likely to be infected with Ct than whites, thus AA are the focus of this research. We hypothesize that screening AA men is essential to curbing the high rates of Ct among young AA women and that a bundled approach will by synergistic. Our community-based pilot program, called “Check it,” is a pilot- tested male screening program which targeted AA men aged 15-25. At the core of this intervention is male Ct screening, but it is also bundled with other evidence-based and best practices for Ct control including: venue- based sampling (VBS), social network peer referral, modest monetary incentives (MMI), screening of target men, rescreening of target men found to be Ct positive with text reminders (Text-RS) , expedited treatment for index men (EIT) and for the partners (EPT), and Wed-based education (Web-Ed). The goal of this study is to examine the effectiveness of a pilot-tested, bundled Ct prevention program focusing on screening young AA men for the prevention of Ct among young AA women: Aim 1. To determine the impact of Check it on women's Ct rates – This aim has a formative phase and an intervention phase. In the formative phase, the pilot Check it is developed and manualized. In the intervention, Check it is implemented and evaluated. We hypothesize that, post-intervention, Ct rates among AA women in the intervention community will be significantly lower compared to rates in the control communities, and that Check it will result in high rates of index/partner treatment and rescreening. Aim 2. To model the potential impact and optimal coverage needed - Using inputs from this study and the literature, a deterministic population-based epidemiological model will be used to model the number of cases averted by Check it and to determine the potential impact at different intensities of the intervention. Aim 3. To determine the cost effectiveness of Check it - Time motion studies will be conducted and used as inputs for the cost-benefit/effectiveness analysis of the Check it Program in order to distinguish study from program costs. If Check it is found to be effective as hypothesized, we will conduct future translational research to disseminate the program. This research has the potential for practical application by improving reproductive health and high impact by removing disparities in the control of Ct among AA men. . Public Health Significance Rates of Chlamydia trachomatis (Ct), a major cause of reproductive morbidity and potential facilitator of HIV transmission, are 7 times higher among African American (AA) women compared to white women constituting an alarming health disparity. The present approach of screening women only is not working and screening men, the reservoirs of infection, should be considered. The goal of this research is to test the effectiveness (measured, potential and cost) and to translate “Check it”, which is a pilot-tested, bundled seek, test and treat intervention targeting young African American men to reduce infections in young AA women.  ",A new approach to controlling chlamydia transmission in young people,9327020,R01HD086794,"['Affect ', ' post treatment ', ' After-Treatment ', ' After Care ', ' Aftercare ', ' Awareness ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' CDC ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' Charge ', ' bedsonia ', ' Miyagawanella ', ' Chlamydia ', ' Rickettsia trachomae ', ' C. trachomatis ', ' C trachomatis ', ' Chlamydia trachomatis ', ' Communities ', ' Community Pharmacy ', ' cost benefit effectiveness ', ' cost benefit economics ', ' Cost Benefit Analyses ', ' Cost-Benefit Analysis ', ' cost effectiveness ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Future ', ' Geography ', ' Goals ', ' Hair ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' Incentives ', ' indexing ', ' Infection ', ' Infertility ', ' infertile ', ' fertility loss ', ' fertility cessation ', ' Difficulty conceiving ', ' Cannot achieve a pregnancy ', ' Literature ', ' male ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Persons ', ' Ectopic Pregnancy ', ' extrauterine pregnancy ', ' Public Health ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Sexual Partners ', ' sex partner ', ' Sexually Transmitted Diseases ', ' Venereal Infections ', ' Venereal Disorders ', ' Venereal Diseases ', ' Sexually Transmitted Infection ', ' Sexually Transmitted Disorder ', ' Target Populations ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Time and Motion Studies ', ' Translating ', ' Transportation ', ' Urine Urinary System ', ' Urine ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Social Network ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Phase ', ' Trust ', ' sexually active ', ' Pelvic Inflammatory Disease ', ' Fostering ', ' Logistics ', ' Reproductive Health ', ' uptake ', ' Community Networks ', ' programs ', ' Clinic ', ' experience ', ' Participant ', ' disorder prevention ', ' disease prevention ', ' Prevention program ', ' peer ', ' Prevention ', ' Reporting ', ' medical examination ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' social stigma ', ' stigma ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Legal ', ' Educational Materials ', ' High Prevalence ', ' translation research ', ' Translational Science ', ' Translational Research ', ' Transmission ', ' transmission process ', ' Text ', ' Behavioral ', ' post intervention ', ' cost ', ' community intervention ', ' epidemiological model ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel approaches ', ' new approaches ', ' novel strategies ', ' cost effective ', ' cost-effective ', ' aged ', ' man ', "" man's "", ' practical application ', ' application in practice ', ' community organizations ', ' effectiveness measure ', ' evidence base ', ' population based ', ' young man ', ' adolescent men ', ' adolescent man ', ' screening ', ' peer networks ', ' reproductive morbidity ', ' ']",NICHD,TULANE UNIVERSITY OF LOUISIANA,R01,2017,598827,0.11128796825787918
"Smartphone-Delivered, Diabetes-Modified Behavioral Activation Treatment (Smartphone DM-BAT) in AAs With T2DM The proposed K24 renewal application is designed to support the career and research trajectory of the candidate by providing protected time to conduct patient-oriented research on interventions to reduce complications and deaths from diabetes in ethnic minority groups and mentor the next generation of women and minority clinical investigators in health disparities research. In the first 5 years of the current K24 grant, the candidate has trained 40 mentees including: 7 faculty, 2 post-docs, 2 doctoral students, 1 fellow, and 17 medical students. He has 147 abstracts/presentations and 156 peer-reviewed publications with mentees. In addition, in the past 5 years, he submitted 27 grants with mentees of which 10 were funded. The specific aims of the proposed K24 renewal application will be accomplished by completing the following three objectives: Mentoring Objective: To increase the pool of clinical researchers who can conduct patient-oriented research and successfully compete for peer-reviewed grants, as well as mentor the next generation of women and minority clinical investigators, who are engaged in the national effort to reduce and eliminate health care disparities. This will be accomplished by mentoring 2 women/minority investigators each year for 5 years. Career Development Objective: To obtain additional training in leadership, health economics, and health informatics that would greatly enhance the candidate's research capability and make him a more effective mentor to trainees in clinical research. This will be accomplished by completing 4 courses a year in leadership, health economics, and health informatics Research Objective: The primary objective is to test the efficacy of the Smartphone DM-BAT intervention comprised of smartphone-delivered, diabetes-modified behavioral activation treatment (education, skills training and behavior activation), home monitoring with feedback (FORA home telemonitoring system) and care delivered by nurse educators in improving HbA1c levels in AAs with poorly controlled T2DM. The secondary objectives are to test the efficacy of the Smartphone DM-BAT intervention in improving BP control and quality of life in AAs with poorly controlled T2DM. Exploratory analyses will examine the role of process (information, motivation, self-efficacy, depression) and behavioral measures (diet, exercise and medication adherence) as mediators of metabolic control. Mentorship is an important component of career advancement in academic medicine. Several studies have established that lack of mentoring is a reason for poor career advancement and attrition, particularly among women and minority faculty. The candidate who has a track record of mentoring women and minority faculty would benefit from the protected time for mentoring afforded by the proposed K24 renewal award, while allowing continued research to eliminate disparities in diabetes.

"Comparative Effectiveness of Genomics Assay for Active Surveillance Failure Prediction in African American Men:  the impact of genetic ancestry and socioeconomic status. ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Prostate Cancer (PCa) is the most common malignancy in men but overtreatment is a major public health concern. To address this, Genomic Health Inc. in collaboration with academic and military hospitals validated a 17-gene relative expression assay to predict the probability of adverse pathologic features at the time of radical prostatectomy to improve the safety of active surveillance. Their Oncotype DX (ODX) assay improves the prognostic accuracy beyond standard clinical parameters at the time of biopsy. The ODX GPS is scaled from 0-100 and increases the number of men deemed eligible for active surveillance by decreasing the pre-test probability of adverse pathology and allows patients and providers to confidently elect active surveillance to avoid upfront treatment morbidity.  ODX has been validated in largely European American (EA) populations but has yet to be adequately assessed in high-risk African American (AA) men. Our overarching hypothesis is that the prognostic accuracy of Oncotype DX varies by race and by socioeconomic status and genetic ancestry among AAs. This is significant since AAs have the highest risk of PCa and PCa mortality and are more likely to harbor adverse pathology in their prostate despite being eligible for active surveillance by clinical parameters. Risk of aggressive PCa varies across studies in AA men based on socioeconomic factors including insurance, education and income. Moreover, gene expression varies significantly between AA and EA prostate tumors. Given this, ODX can be dangerous for AAs if prediction performance is poorer or differs significantly between AAs and EAs or between subpopulations of AAs with clinically localized prostate cancer (CLPCa).  To assess the prediction performance of ODX in AAs with CLPCa, we propose the following Specific Aims: (1) to compare the effectiveness of the ODX GPS as a predictor of adverse pathology in archived specimen from 100 AA and 50 EA men with CLPCa; (2) to compare the prediction performance of the GPS for adverse pathology in archived specimen from 150 AAs with CLPCa from divergent socio-demographic (income, education, insurance status) backgrounds; (3) to assess for variation in GPS prediction performance in 100 previously recruited AAs with CLPCa by degree of genetic European or African ancestry.  Should this comparative effectiveness study reveal variations in prediction performance by race, socioeconomic status or genetic ancestry, a calibrated GPS score could be provided. Alternatively, if the ODX assay inadequately measures risk of adverse pathology we prevent its use in men of African ancestry. In either scenario we improve the safety of active surveillance for a high-risk PCa population. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The morbidity associated with the upfront treatment of prostate cancer has led to the promotion of active surveillance to delay or avoid treatment-related complications. However, active surveillance is grossly underutilized due the inability of standard clinical parameters to detect adverse pathologic features in the prostates of eligible men. Our protocol will improve the safety of active surveillance by evaluating the effectiveness of a genomics assay for the prediction of adverse pathology in high-risk African American prostate cancer patients.",Comparative Effectiveness of Genomics Assay for Active Surveillance Failure Prediction in African American Men:  the impact of genetic ancestry and socioeconomic status.,9199234,R21CA202552,"['University Medical Centers ', ' Academic Medical Centers ', ' Adoption ', ' Affect ', ' Archives ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Biopsy ', ' Calibration ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Dangerousness ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Protocol Screening ', ' Eligibility ', ' Eligibility Determination ', ' Future ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Genes ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Hospitals ', ' Military Hospitals ', ' Veterans Hospitals ', ' Income ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Insurance ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Pathology ', ' Patients ', ' Probability ', ' Prostate ', ' Prostatic Gland ', ' Prostate Gland ', ' Prostatic Neoplasms ', ' Prostatic Neoplasia ', ' Prostate Tumor ', ' Prostate Neoplasms ', ' Public Health ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Receiver Operating Characteristics ', ' Receiver Operator Characteristics ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' recruit ', ' active recruitment ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Safety ', ' Socioeconomic Factors ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Measures ', ' Treatment outcome ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' Uninsured ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Prostatovesiculectomy ', ' Radical Prostatectomy ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' prognostic ', ' Failure ', ' African ', ' European ', ' Collaborations ', ' Genetic ', ' Specimen ', ' Research Specimen ', ' Malignant neoplasm of prostate ', ' Prostatic Cancer ', ' Prostate Cancer ', ' Prostate CA ', ' Malignant prostatic tumor ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Prostate ', ' Knowledge ', ' Insurance Coverage ', ' Insurance Status ', ' Investigation ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' Pattern ', ' American ', ' Performance ', ' novel ', ' Modality ', ' Gene Expression Profiling ', ' gene expression assay ', ' gene expression analysis ', ' Transcript Expression Analysis ', ' Transcript Expression Analyses ', ' Gene Expression Pattern Analysis ', ' Gene Expression Monitoring ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' performance tests ', ' Abate ', ' Genomics ', ' cancer therapy ', ' anticancer therapy ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Treatment ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Therapy ', ' Cancer Treatment ', ' Provider ', ' Effectiveness ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' low socioeconomic status ', ' low socioeconomic position ', ' low socio-economic status ', ' low socio-economic position ', ' low SES ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Cancer Patient ', ' Pathologic ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socio-economically ', ' socio-economic ', ' socioeconomics ', ' cancer gene expression ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' disparity in cancer ', ' cancer disparity ', ' comparative effectiveness ', ' compare effectiveness ', ' high risk ', ' public health relevance ', ' Biological Markers ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' social health determinants ', ' prostate biopsy ', ' ']",NCI,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,R21,2017,174014,-0.03988954248682602
"The Impact of the Intrauterine and Early Childhood Environments on Neurocognitive and Metabolic Development in African American Youth: Focus on the Gut-Brain Axis PROJECT ABSTRACT  Environmental exposures during the critical prenatal and early childhood periods can result in lifelong health consequences. Mechanisms underlying these exposure-health relationships are complex, with exogenous exposures (such as chemical toxicants, infectious agents, diet) and endogenous processes (such as gene expression, inflammation and oxidative stress) activating metabolic pathways that lead to adverse health outcomes. Both adverse exposures and their health consequences disproportionately impact African American (AA) women and children, highlighting that health disparities begin in utero and are amplified postnatally. Among outcomes disproportionately experienced by AA children are preterm birth, neurodevelopmental deficits, and obesity – all linked to environmental exposures, yet poorly understood due to their etiologic complexity. Our team is currently investigating preterm birth and neurodevelopment through 18-months in relation to pre- and postnatal exposures to environmental toxicants and biopsychosocial risk factors in cohorts of pregnant AA women (R01NR014800, R01MD009064) and their infants (R01MD009746) and via our P50 Children's Center (P50ES026071) in collaboration with the Emory HERCULES Exposome Research Center (P30 ES019776).  Through ECHO, we propose to elucidate exposures and risk pathways that contribute to neurodevelopmental deficits and obesity in preschool aged AA children by: (1) Assembling an Atlanta ECHO cohort of ~440 AA socioeconomically diverse mother-child pairs by combining extant cohorts for whom the prenatal, perinatal, and early childhood environments are, or will be, characterized; (2) Completing the analysis and synthesis of data from the Atlanta ECHO cohort to characterize mother-child pairs in terms of prenatal and early childhood exposures (toxicants, stressors and neuroendocrine-immune activation, nutritional and metabolic status, microbiome and infections, bonding and interaction); epigenetic and metabolomic profiles; and perinatal outcomes (gestational age, size-for-gestation); (3) Testing cohort-specific hypotheses related to prenatal and early childhood exposures and neurodevelopmental outcomes and obesity in AA children at 2, 3, 4, and 5 years of age; (4) Participating in ECHO-wide consortium studies to identify risk and protective factors that moderate associations between environmental exposures, typical growth and development, and adverse child health outcomes. Our cohort's participation in the ECHO consortium will contribute to a biopsychosocial understanding of within- and between-race risk for adverse child health outcomes, providing insight into risk and protective factors relevant to AA families. The proposed research is consistent with frameworks for eliminating racial disparities, which recognize the need to study risks within-race as a vital first step, and is congruent with the National Institute of Minority Health and Health Disparities goal of promoting understanding of the biological mechanisms involved in conditions that disproportionately affect health disparity populations. PROJECT NARRATIVE Both adverse environmental exposures and their health consequences disproportionately impact African American (AA) women and children, highlighting that health disparities begin in utero and are amplified postnatally. AA children are more likely to experience preterm birth, neurodevelopmental deficits, and obesity – all linked to environmental exposures, yet poorly understood due to their etiologic complexity. Our goal is to use a sociodemographically diverse Atlanta ECHO cohort of AA mother-child pairs to study the mechanistic pathways through which early life exogenous and endogenous exposures contribute to neurodevelopmental deficits and obesity in preschool aged AA children in order to guide future prevention and intervention efforts.",The Impact of the Intrauterine and Early Childhood Environments

"The Role of Inflammation in the Racial Disparities in Ovarian Cancer Survival ABSTRACT This application will provide the candidate, Dr. Peres, with the necessary career development and research experiences to propel her career as an independent molecular cancer epidemiologist. Dr. Peres’ long-term career goal is to integrate the fields of cancer epidemiology and molecular biology to disentangle the independent and joint effects of molecular and environmental risk factors on cancer etiology and prognosis, with a special emphasis on how these factors influence health disparities. Epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) is the deadliest gynecologic malignancy in the U.S. and African American (AA) women have a much poorer prognosis in comparison to women of European ancestry (EA). The contributing factors to this survival disparity are relatively unknown, and research in this area is in its infancy due to the small numbers of AA women in existing epidemiologic studies on EOC. Given the suggested link between chronic inflammation and EOC etiology and prognosis coupled with the observed differences in biomarkers of inflammation by race, we posit that differences in inflammation may be contributing to the EOC survival gap in AA women. The proposed research will capitalize on two existing population-based case-control studies, the African American Cancer Epidemiology Study (AACES) and the North Carolina Ovarian Cancer Study (NCOCS), to evaluate how the independent and joint effects of systemic and local inflammation in the tumor microenvironment influences EOC prognosis among AA women and whether differences in these inflammatory biomarkers are contributing to the racial survival disparity in EOC. Leukocyte cell type and distribution will be used as markers of systemic and local inflammation. Circulating leukocytes will be obtained from the complete blood cell count at diagnosis and a peripheral blood sample obtained after diagnosis. Leukocyte proportions will be inferred from peripheral blood DNA methylation data (Illumina MethylationEPIC BeadChip) using cell mixture deconvolution methods. To measure local inflammation, we will use immunohistochemistry to obtain counts of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (FOXP3, CD3, CD8) and neutrophils (CD66b) within the primary tumor and measure the Klintrup score, a general marker of overall inflammation with the tumor and within each leukocyte cell type. Lastly, we will evaluate whether inflammatory-related exposures (e.g., obesity, analgesic medication use, genital body powder exposure) contribute to systemic and/or local inflammation, and whether these biomarkers are mediators of the relationship between inflammatory-related exposures and EOC survival. In order to achieve the proposed research objectives, Dr. Peres will obtain additional knowledge in cancer epigenetics, molecular biology and bioinformatics through her training and career development activities as well as the mentoring provided by her interdisciplinary advisory committee. The proposed research will improve our understanding of the contributing factors to poor EOC survival among AA women and will likely have a considerable impact on our over-arching goal of reducing the existing racial survival disparity in EOC. PROJECT NARRATIVE Ovarian cancer is the fifth leading cause of cancer deaths among U.S. women. African American women experience the worst ovarian cancer survival, yet the causes of this racial survival disparity are not fully understood. We propose to evaluate how systemic and local inflammation, as well as their interplay, influences ovarian cancer prognosis among African American women and whether differences in these inflammatory markers are contributing to the racial survival disparity in ovarian cancer. This study will improve our overall understanding of ovarian cancer prognosis in African American women, to which little is known, as well as provide valuable data that can inform the applicability of

"An integrated substance use, violence, and HIV/AIDS syndemic risk-reduction intervention for African American Couples PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Synergistic interactions between substance use, violence and HIV/AIDS (SAVA syndemic) are closely linked with HIV acquisition in the African American (AA) population. However, no interventions have been developed to address SAVA syndemic risk-reduction for currently HIV-negative but high-risk heterosexual AA couples in the United States (US). This application is focused on adapting and pretesting the feasibility and acceptability of a couple-based SAVA syndemic informed risk-reduction intervention for HIV-negative, AA heterosexual couples who report high-risk sexual behaviors, intimate partner violence (IPV, perpetration and/or victimization), and substance (drug) use. The proposed work builds on the results from a previous K01 award that developed an integrated IPV-HIV risk-reduction intervention among low-income urban abused women. Specifically, findings showed promising impact of the intervention, but also indicated the importance of expanding its scope to incorporate substance use and involve women’s steady partners in the intervention. The proposed research includes two specific aims focused on adapting a SAVA informed intervention for high-risk AA heterosexual couples (aim 1) and pilot testing the resulting HIV risk-reduction intervention (aim 2). The adaptation of the intervention will be guided by Cognitive-Behavioral Theory (CBT) with specific intervention elements drawn from Cognitive Behavioral Couple Therapy (CBCT) and Behavioral Activation (BA). Year 1 of the project will be focused on conducting key informant interviews with 30 AA couples who report high-risk sexual behaviors, IPV, and substance use and adapting the SAVA syndemic informed HIV risk-reduction intervention for AA couples. A portion of year 1 and year 2 of the project will involve a randomized clinical trial (RCT) with 40 AA couples randomized to the SAVA informed risk-reduction intervention (20) or treatment as usual (20) using a random allocation sequence of group assignments within blocks of 10 that will be created using SAS. Participants will complete pre- and 3-month post-intervention behavioral assessments to measure changes in condom use, IPV, and substance use and biological testing for STIs. Percentage of couples who consent to participate, intervention attendance, intervention satisfaction, revictimization due to study participation, and percentage of couples who return for 3-month follow-ups will be tracked to determine feasibility and acceptability of the adapted intervention. Given the disproportionate impact of HIV on AAs in the US, this study addresses a key gap in literature by adapting and testing the first SAVA informed risk-reduction intervention for high-risk, HIV-negative, heterosexual AA couples. It is expected that the proposed intervention will help in addressing a NIH and Office of AIDS Research (OAR) high priority research area, “to reduce health disparities in the incidence of new HIV infections” with its focus on a highly vulnerable and marginalized group in the US and co-occurring HIV-related risk factors among couples. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research is relevant to public health because it addresses a key gap in literature by adapting and testing the first SAVA informed risk-reduction intervention for high-risk, HIV-negative, heterosexual African American couples. This study aligns with the goals of the President’s National HIV/AIDS strategy, “to reduce HIV-related health disparities and health inequalities in communities at high-risk for HIV infection” and with the NIH and Office of AIDS Research (OAR) high priority research area, “to reduce health disparities in the incidence of new HIV infections.” The SAVA informed HIV risk-intervention can help to decrease heterosexual risk for HIV among African American couples, thereby reducing HIV-related racial and gender disparities in the US.","An integrated substance use, violence, and HIV/AIDS syndemic risk-reduction intervention for African American Couples",9410847,R03DA044866,"['Acquired Immuno-Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency ', ' AIDS ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome ', ' Behavior ', ' Communities ', ' Couples ', ' Diagnosis ', ' abuses drugs ', ' abuse of drugs ', ' Drug abuse ', ' Elements ', ' Goals ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' HIV Infections ', ' antigen positive AIDS test ', ' antibody positive AIDS test ', ' HTLV-III Seropositivity ', ' HTLV-III Seroconversion ', ' HIV Seroconversion ', ' HIV Positivity ', ' HIV Positive ', ' HIV Antibody Positivity ', ' Anti-HIV Positivity ', ' AIDS Seropositivity ', ' AIDS Seroconversion ', ' HIV Seropositivity ', ' Incidence ', ' Infection ', ' Interview ', ' Literature ', ' Mission ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Positive Reinforcements ', ' Public Health ', ' Publishing ', ' Random Allocation ', ' Random Selection ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' recruit ', ' active recruitment ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Safety ', ' Sexual Partners ', ' sex partner ', ' Testing ', ' United States ', ' Vaginal ', ' Vagina ', ' violent behavior ', ' violent ', ' Violence ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' Mediating ', ' Magazine ', ' Journals ', ' base ', ' career ', ' Area ', ' Randomized Clinical Trials ', ' Link ', ' using substances ', ' substance using ', ' substance use ', ' AOD use ', ' Alcohol or Other Drugs use ', ' satisfaction ', ' drug use ', ' Drug usage ', ' abuse of women ', ' abuse of females ', ' Abused women ', ' Abused females ', ' Battered Women ', ' Anal Sex ', ' Couples Therapy ', ' Research Priority ', ' Victimization ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' Test Result ', ' Unsafe Sex ', ' Unprotected Sex ', ' High-Risk Sex ', ' experience ', ' condoms ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Reporting ', ' AIDS/HIV problem ', ' HIV/AIDS problem ', ' HIV/AIDS ', ' AIDS/HIV ', ' HIV risk ', ' theories ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Risk Reduction ', ' Behavior assessment ', ' behavioral assessment ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' high risk sexual behavior ', ' risky sexual behavior ', ' high risk sexual activity ', ' high risk sex behavior ', ' high risk sex activity ', ' Low income ', ' Address ', ' Biological Testing ', ' Consent ', ' Data ', ' Mentored Research Scientist Development Award ', ' Research Scientist Development Award ', ' Mentored Training Award ', ' K01 Program ', ' K01 Mechanism ', ' K01 Award ', ' NIH Office of AIDS Research ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Cognitive ', ' Transmission ', ' transmission process ', ' Heterosexuals ', ' informant ', ' Behavioral ', ' post intervention ', ' sexual risk behavior ', ' sex risk ', ' intimate partner violence ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' high risk ', ' treatment as usual ', ' usual care ', ' revictimization ', ' health inequalities ', ' follow up assessment ', ' screening ', ' racial disparity ', ' race disparity ', ' disparities in race ', ' gender disparity ', ' Acquired Immunologic Deficiency Syndrome ', ' ']",NIDA,"UNIV OF MARYLAND, COLLEGE PARK",R03,2017,146309,0.004731504216790403
"Smart Walk: A Smartphone Physical Activity Program for African American Women ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Project Summary/Abstract National data show that 82% of African American (AA) women are overweight or obese, and 57% are obese. The health risks associated with the high prevalence of overweight and obesity among AA women is concerning, as these risks contribute to subsequent chronicities including cardiovascular disease (CVD) and type 2 diabetes (T2D). Physical activity (PA) is an established mechanism to manage weight and to improve myriad cardiometabolic disease risk factors. However, despite these benefits, only 36% of AA women meet the national PA guidelines. The low PA levels among AA women coupled with the high prevalence of overweight/obesity and other chronic disease conditions indicate the need for effective strategies to promote sustained high PA in this high-risk population. Technology-based platforms (i.e. Smartphone applications, Internet, social media) represent potential channels to deliver PA interventions to AA women. However, few researchers have explored these platforms to deliver culturally relevant PA interventions to AA women. This represents a missed opportunity given the established success of technology-delivered behavior change interventions and data suggesting that AA women use Internet, social media, and Smartphones at equal or greater rates than other race/ethnic groups. Over the past 5 years, the applicant of this proposed work has focused on filling this gap in the published research through the development and evaluation of technology-based approaches to increase PA among AA women. Trained as a behavioral scientist, his graduate and postdoctoral training has been focused in the social and psychological sciences, with a particular emphasis on the development and evaluation of theory- driven, culturally relevant technology-based PA interventions for AA women. The research and training proposed in the current application will extend and refine the candidate's PA and health disparities research trajectory through : 1) focused training in the physiological and biochemical mechanisms underpinning cardiometabolic disease risk factors responsive to PA intervention, and 2) evaluation of the effects of a culturall relevant Smartphone-delivered PA program (Smart Walk) to improve (baseline to 6 months) and maintain (7 months to 12 months) higher PA levels among AA women and improve cardiometabolic disease risk factors. The candidate has identified a supportive and stimulating research environment at Arizona State University to pursue the proposed research. Under the mentorship and Drs. Barbara Ainsworth, Colleen Keller, Glenn Gaesser, and Sonia Vega-Lopez, he will gain the necessary skills to establish himself as an independent behavioral and health disparities research scientist. In the K99 portion of the grant award, the applicant will gan explicit training in the physiological and biochemical mechanisms underpinning cardiometabolic disease risk factors responsive to PA intervention through didactic coursework and hands-on clinical laboratory experience. Training in this research area will complement his already strong social science background by allowing him to gain a deeper understanding of the physiological mechanisms associated with the health-enhancing benefits of PA. In the R00 phase of the grant award, the applicant will deploy the training acquired during the K99 phase and build logically upon his previous health disparities research trajectory by implementing a 12-month technology-based PA randomized controlled trial to evaluate the effects of a culturally relevant Smartphone-delivered PA intervention to improve (baseline to 6 months) and maintain (7 months to 12 months) high PA levels and reduce cardiometabolic disease risk among obese AA women. Seventy-six obese AA women will receive either a culturally relevant, Social Cognitive Theory-based PA promotion program delivered using a Smartphone application or a wellness contact control condition. PA, fitness, and cardiometabolic disease risk factors will be evaluated. Potential physiological mechanisms through which PA may impact cardiometabolic disease risk factors will also be explored. The proposed research and training activities support the immediate and long-term career goals of the applicant. The applicant's immediate career goal is to enhance his theory based PA research to include salient mechanisms that underpin PA effects on health (i.e. inflammation), towards the prevention and treatment of cardiometabolic disease risk factors among AA women. His long-term career goals are to: a) establish an independent, externally-funded program of research focused on the identification of effective strategies to promote sustained PA among racial/ethnic minorities, and 2) reduce the disproportionate burden of the cardiometabolic diseases among high-risk minority populations. The training and research activities proposed in the current K99/R00 application will assist the candidate in achieving these career goals, and advance PA and health disparities science. Project Narrative The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effects of a culturally relevant Smartphone-delivered physical activity intervention to improve and maintain high physical activity levels and reduce cardiometabolic disease risk among obese African American women. In a 12-month randomized controlled trial, 76 sedentary and obese African American women will receive either a culturally relevant, Social Cognitive Theory-based physical activity intervention delivered using a Smartphone application or a wellness contact control condition. Primary study outcomes include changes in physical activity and feasibility and acceptability of the Smartphone- delivered program; secondary outcomes include cardiorespiratory fitness, cardiometabolic disease risk factors, and potential physiological mechanisms through which physical activity may impact cardiometabolic disease risk factors.",Smart Walk: A Smartphone Physical

"Enhancing Glaucoma Medication Adherence Among African Americans ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Glaucoma is the leading cause of irreversible blindness among African Americans (AA) who are more than three times more likely to develop glaucoma when compared to Caucasians. Changes associated with the progression of glaucoma can have a serious negative impact on an individual's quality of life, independence, and everyday functioning. Accumulating research indicates that pressure-reducing eye drops can significantly delay or prevent the onset of disease; however, such preventative efforts have been found to be limited due to problems with poor medication adherence. Lacking are available health promotion interventions that minimize this important health disparity. Thus, in our research program, we demonstrated this health disparity for glaucoma medication adherence (Dreer et al., 2012). Next, we conducted several follow-up studies in order to develop a culturally relevant and informed, health promotion-based intervention to improve glaucoma medication adherence among AA's. As part of the intervention development process, we conducted several focus groups with AA glaucoma patients to elicit the salient barriers and facilitators related to glaucoma medication adherence, and then formed a community-based participatory research team comprised of AA's with glaucoma (Dreer et al., 2013). The resulting intervention was based on a multi-component empowerment framework that includes glaucoma education, motivational interviewing, and problem-solving training to improve glaucoma medication adherence. We recently pilot tested the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of the intervention among AA's. Findings revealed significant improvements in objective medication adherence (Dreer et al., under review). Therefore, we now propose to further evaluate the efficacy of this intervention for improving glaucoma medication adherence among AA patients in a large-scale randomized clinical trial (RCT).  The patient population for the RCT will consist of 240 adult AA's with glaucoma and who are aged = 21 years who seek services at the University of Alabama at Birmingham's Glaucoma Clinic within the Department of Ophthalmology. The RCT will have two treatment arms; patients will be randomized following eligibility determination and written informed consent. The usual care only arm will consist of the standard medical care for glaucoma (medicine, laser trabeculoplasty, conventional surgery, or a combination of any of these). The second arm will consist of usual care as just described plus the culturally relevant, health promotion-based intervention. The primary outcome (objective glaucoma medication adherence) and secondary outcomes will be assessed at baseline before intervention initiation and at 3, 7, and 12-month in-clinic follow-up visits by a research interviewer masked to subjects' randomization. The practical question to be addressed is does a culturally relevant, health promotion-based intervention improve glaucoma medication adherence among a high-risk segment of the population? Information from this project will be particularly useful for AA's with glaucoma, their families, and eye care providers. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Poor adherence to glaucoma therapy is a significant healthcare issue that may result in unwarranted changes in medications, increased healthcare expenditure, risk to the patient if surgical intervention is required and further deterioration of vision, all of which can be prevented. This can subsequently have a negative impact on an individual's quality life, independence, and everyday living. The multifaceted and culturally relevant, health promotion-based intervention, lacking in this area, is designed to take critical steps toward addressing this problem by motivating change for healthy lifestyle behaviors and improving problem-solving strategies to better manage barriers related to glaucoma medication adherence, particularly among African American patients who are at greater risk for glaucoma and poor adherence compared to Caucasians.",Enhancing Glaucoma Medication Adherence Among African Americans,9292329,R01EY025331,"['adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Alabama ', ' Awareness ', ' Behavior ', ' Belief ', ' Control Groups ', ' Diagnosis ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Elements ', ' Protocol Screening ', ' Eligibility ', ' Eligibility Determination ', ' Expenditure ', ' Eyeball ', ' Eye ', ' ophthalmopathy ', ' eye disorder ', ' Eye diseases ', ' Eye Drops ', ' Eyedrops ', ' Family ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Followup Studies ', ' Follow-Up Studies ', ' Future ', ' glaucomatous ', ' Glaucoma ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' Health Promotion ', ' Informed Consent ', ' Interviewer ', ' Language ', ' Lasers ', ' Laser Radiation ', ' Laser Electromagnetic ', ' Literature ', ' Masks ', ' Medicine ', ' Methodology ', ' Ophthalmology ', ' Optometry ', ' Optometries ', ' Paper ', ' Patient Education ', ' Patient Training ', ' Patient Instruction ', ' Patients ', ' Perception ', ' pressure ', ' Problem Solving ', ' Publishing ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Socioeconomic Factors ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Trabeculoplasty ', ' Trabeculectomy ', ' Universities ', ' visual function ', ' Sight ', ' Vision ', ' white race ', ' Occidental ', ' Caucasoid Race ', ' Caucasoid ', ' Caucasian Race ', ' Caucasian ', ' Caucasians ', ' Generations ', ' Measures ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Schedule ', ' Treatment Cost ', ' Caring ', ' Magazine ', ' Journals ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' incision ', ' Otomy ', ' Surgical incisions ', ' Area ', ' Medical ', ' Randomized Clinical Trials ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Sample Size ', ' Disease Progression ', ' disorder onset ', ' disease onset ', ' Onset of illness ', ' Knowledge ', ' Disease Management ', ' Disorder Management ', ' programs ', ' Clinic ', ' Blindness ', ' visual loss ', ' vision loss ', ' Test Result ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' surgery ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' interest ', ' Visit ', ' Services ', ' experience ', ' skills ', ' empowerment ', ' racial difference ', ' race differences ', ' motivational enhancement therapy ', ' motivational interview ', ' emotional distress ', ' feeling upset ', ' feeling distress ', ' Deterioration ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Provider ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Readiness ', ' Preparedness ', ' Address ', ' Dose ', ' Adherence ', ' Data ', ' Effectiveness of Interventions ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Conventional Surgery ', ' Preparation ', ' Process ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socio-economically ', ' socio-economic ', ' socioeconomics ', ' medication adherence ', ' drug compliance ', ' drug adherence ', ' medication compliance ', ' underserved people ', ' under served population ', ' Underserved Population ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' therapy efficacy ', ' therapeutically effective ', ' therapeutic efficacy ', ' intervention efficacy ', ' Treatment Efficacy ', ' coping ', ' blind ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' aged ', ' community based participatory research ', ' participatory action research ', ' community based research ', ' community based design ', ' therapy development ', ' treatment development ', ' intervention development ', ' develop therapy ', ' vision science ', ' visual science ', ' high risk ', ' public health relevance ', ' patient population ', ' primary outcome ', ' secondary outcome ', ' treatment as usual ', ' usual care ', ' arm ', ' healthy lifestyle ', ' trial design ', ' treatment group ', ' high risk population ', ' high risk group ', ' ']",NEI,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,R01,2017,367500,0.06606190269712187
"Food Allergy Outcomes Related to White and African American Racial Differences (FORWARD) PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Background: Food allergy (FA) is a potentially life-threatening condition that affects an estimated 8% of children in the United States. Although differences between African American (AA) and White children in the prevalence and severity of other atopic conditions such as asthma and eczema have been well described, little is known about such differences in FA. The limited existing literature indicates that AA children may have worse clinical outcomes, including rates of FA-related fatal anaphylaxis and FA-related emergency department (ED) visits, than their White peers. Phenotypic and endotypic differences, including rates of sensitization and co-morbidities, between AA and White children are beginning to be examined. Data on racial differences in FA management practices are incomplete; preliminary data suggest that AA families spend significantly less on allergen-free foods and FA medications than do White families. Families caring for children with FA experience significant impairments in psychosocial outcomes, including FA-related quality of life (FAQoL); however, these data come primarily from White, privately insured families, and little is known about psychosocial outcomes in AA families. Two recent reviews concluded that existing studies examining racial disparities in FA are far too methodologically limited to draw definitive conclusions, primarily due to reliance on self-report of FA diagnosis and cross-sectional designs. Specific Aims and Methods: Our goal is to prospectively study a cohort of 600 AA and White children (0-12 years) with FA in order to: 1) Determine variability in clinical FA outcomes between AA and White patients via bimonthly remote assessments, biannual clinic visits, and medical chart review over a two-year period; 2) Examine phenotypic and endotypic differences between AA and White children with FA using specific laboratory specimen collection techniques and assays; 3) Identify differences between AA and White children in FA management practices by parent report (e.g. allergen avoidance and epinephrine carriage); and 4) Determine differences between AA and White children in psychosocial FA-related outcomes (e.g., FA-related quality of life, bullying, anxiety, and worry) via the above survey methods. Hypotheses and Expected Results: We hypothesize that compared to White children, AA children will: have higher rates of food-allergic reactions and FA-related healthcare utilization; demonstrate unique FA phenotypes and endotypes; have poorer knowledge of FA management and worse adherence to preventative behaviors; have limited access to medications and allergen-free foods; and report better quality of life. Significance and Effects on Other Research: Confirming and further characterizing differences between AA and White children with FA will provide the data required to develop clinical guidelines, optimize treatment, and build health policies that meet the needs of both AA and White children. Project Narrative Childhood food allergy is a serious health condition affecting 8% of children in the US. The goal of this proposal is to develop a prospective longitudinal cohort to systematically investigate disparities between African American and White children in food allergy clinical and psychosocial outcomes, food allergy phenotypes and endotypes, and food allergy management practices.",Food Allergy Outcomes Related to White and African American Racial Differences (FORWARD),9398764,R01AI130348,"['Affect ', ' Allergens ', ' Rhinitis allergic atopic ', ' Atopic rhinitis ', ' Allergic rhinosinusitis ', ' Allergic rhinitis due to allergen ', ' Allergic rhinitis ', ' Anaphylactic Shock ', ' Anaphylactic Reaction ', ' Anaphylaxis ', ' Anxiety ', ' Bronchial Asthma ', ' Asthma ', ' Behavior ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Biological Assay ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Puericulture ', ' Child Care ', ' Clinic Visits ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Comorbidity ', ' Diagnosis ', ' dietary ', ' Diet ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' eczematous ', ' Eczematous Dermatitis ', ' Eczema ', ' Eosinophilia ', ' Therapeutic Epinephrine ', ' Adrenaline ', ' Epinephrine ', ' Family ', ' stool ', ' Feces ', ' Food or Food Product ', ' Food ', ' Food Allergy ', ' Food Hypersensitivity ', ' Future ', ' Geography ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' healthcare policy ', ' health care policy ', ' Health Policy ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' Hospitalization ', ' IgE ', ' Immunoglobulin E ', ' IgG4 ', ' Laboratories ', ' Literature ', ' Medical Records ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Parents ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Physicians ', ' Prospective Studies ', ' Public Health ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' recruit ', ' active recruitment ', ' Research ', ' Schools ', ' Survey Methodology ', ' Survey Method ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' Self Management ', ' Guidelines ', ' improved ', ' specimen collection ', ' sample collection ', ' Peripheral ', ' Site ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' white American ', ' caucasian American ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' healthcare utilization ', ' healthcare service utilization ', ' healthcare service use ', ' health care service use ', ' Health Care Utilization ', ' health care service utilization ', ' Policies ', ' tool ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' bullying ', ' bully ', ' Severities ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' Reaction ', ' Techniques ', ' psychosocial ', ' Visit ', ' experience ', ' cohort ', ' Practice Management ', ' peer ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Self-Report ', ' racial difference ', ' race differences ', ' Reporting ', ' Allergic ', ' Sampling ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Skin ', ' food allergen ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Adherence ', ' Data ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socio-economically ', ' socio-economic ', ' socioeconomics ', ' Allergic Reaction ', ' manage symptom ', ' symptom management ', ' microbiome ', ' cost ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' Prevalence ', ' prospective ', ' Impairment ', ' therapy design ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' Biological Markers ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' Emergency department visit ', ' Emergency room visit ', ' Emergency care visit ', ' ER visit ', ' ED visit ', ' racial disparity ', ' race disparity ', ' disparities in race ', ' Longitudinal cohort ', ' Longterm cohort ', ' Long-term cohort ', ' ']",NIAID,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,R01,2017,848350,0.05254318296827079
"The African American Non-Resident Fatherhood Program DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application requests support for a study to examine the effects of an intervention aimed at increasing paternal involvement in African American non-resident fathers. Although the number of children living without fathers has grown nationally, the greatest percentage of children living apart from their fathers is found among African American (AA) families. Two thirds of all AA children in the United States live in households without their biological father. Father presence is important to the emotional, social and developmental wellbeing of children throughout the child's life. Positive father involvement is also important to the health and wellbeing of fathers themselves. Therefore, the purpose of this project is to test the Building Bridges to Fatherhood (BBTF) program, an innovative video-based fatherhood program developed with the guidance of a Fathers Advisory Council. The purpose of the BBTF program is to increase and sustain paternal involvement among AA fathers and their young children (2-5 years). The BBTF program will be tested in a randomized clinical trial among 180 families of young children across 2 large predominantly African American areas (west-side and south-side) of a large Midwestern city. Fathers will be recruited via key informants from multiple community sites (i.e. churches, barbershops, community centers, schools, day care centers, local business establishments, dry cleaners, and sports venues) and randomly assigned to either the BBTF intervention or a Financial Literacy (FL) attention control group. Participants will be assessed at pre-intervention, 12 weeks and 24 weeks using self-report measures completed by fathers and the child's biological mother and participate in a booster session at 18 weeks. Dependent variables include: paternal involvement (material and in-kind [non-monetary] support and direct father/child interaction), father parenting competence (self-efficacy, satisfaction, parenting skills and knowledge), father psychological wellbeing (self-esteem, general and racial stress), father communication and problem solving, and father and maternal reports of child behavior and development (cognitive, emotional, and social). Further, father-mother relationship quality will be examined for its mediating effect on fathers' outcomes and paternal involvement. This application builds on our prior research: (1) refining an effective and culturally relevant parent training model so that it has enhanced social and contextual validity for African American non- resident fathers, and (2) providing a real-world intervention for fathers that has as its primary aim to facilitate and sustain father involvement i early childhood, before father estrangement becomes entrenched and intractable. This study is consistent with the NINR goals for the 21st century to address cultural and ethnic disparities in health promotion and intervention activities by developing innovative, culturally responsive, evidence-based interventions that are tailored to the individual. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  This application to test an innovative culturally relevant fatherhood program for increasing and sustaining paternal involvement among African American (AA) non-resident fathers is relevant to public health because over two-thirds of AA children live in homes without their fathers. Children with fathers who are continuously and actively involved have better behavioral, social, and emotional development and fathers who are continuously and actively involved with their children also fare better than fathers who are not. Thus, an effective fatherhood program holds great promise for improving the health outcomes and social well-being of children and fathers.",The African American Non-Resident Fatherhood Program,9269906,R01NR011182,"['ages ', ' Age ', ' Behavior ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Child Behavior ', ' Infant and Child Development ', ' Child Development ', ' childrearing ', ' Parenting behavior ', ' Parenting ', ' Child Rearing ', ' Cities ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' Control Groups ', ' Experimental Designs ', ' Family ', ' Father-Child Relationship ', ' Father-Child Relations ', ' Fathers ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' Health Promotion ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' Hospitals ', ' Household ', ' Newborn Infant ', ' newborn children ', ' newborn child ', ' Newborns ', ' 0-4 weeks old ', ' Mothers ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' Parents ', ' Problem Solving ', ' Public Health ', ' Questionnaires ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' recruit ', ' active recruitment ', ' Research ', ' Research Support ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Schools ', ' self esteem ', ' Social Development ', ' Social support ', ' social support network ', ' Sports ', ' Stress ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Unmarried Father ', ' Child Support ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' Businesses ', ' Competence ', ' Criminal Justice ', ' Mediating ', ' Outcome Measure ', ' base ', ' divorce/separation ', ' role model ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Biological ', ' psychological ', ' psychologic ', ' Randomized Clinical Trials ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' satisfaction ', ' Collaborations ', ' fatherhood ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Side ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' System ', ' interest ', ' Visit ', ' Church ', ' early childhood ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' skills ', ' Participant ', ' father role ', ' paternity ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Self-Report ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' Emotional ', ' Modeling ', ' father child interaction ', ' father offspring interaction ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Future Generations ', ' Childbirth ', ' child birth ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Address ', ' Day center care ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Request for Applications ', ' NIH RFA ', ' Cognitive ', ' Characteristics ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' informant ', ' Behavioral ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' 5 year old ', ' five years of age ', ' five year old ', ' age 5 years ', ' 5 years of age ', ' Evidence based intervention ', ' demographics ', ' public health relevance ', ' community setting ', ' intervention effect ', ' efficacy testing ', ' health equity ', ' attentional control ', ' community center ', ' financial literacy ', ' ethnic disparity ', ' ethnicity disparity ', ' ']",NINR,RUSH UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2017,381781,0.08037055017426363
"MIC-1 and its functional partners in prostate cancer racial disparity ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Prostate cancer (PCa) is the most common non-cutaneous malignancy in the United States males and is the second leading cause of cancer deaths in men. In this regard, epidemiologic data have also provided evidence of racial disparity, including younger age, higher incidence and aggressiveness of PCa at diagnosis and inferior survival rates of African Americans (AA) relative to Caucasian patients in the Unites States. The explanation for these differences is still unknown. On the other hand, our recent results combined with prior studies have revealed that MIC-1 and its functional partners EGFR and CXCR4 were more frequent in AA compared to Caucasian PCa patients. Importantly, recent reports have revealed that EGFR and CXCR4 mediate Docetaxel resistance in PCa cells. Therefore, the central hypothesis of this proposal is that the up- regulation of MIC-1 signaling cascade may cooperate with EGFR and CXCR4 oncogenic pathways for the acquisition of a more aggressive behavior, survival and therapeutic resistance of PCa cells and contribute to the racial disparity between AA versus Caucasian patients. The overall objective is to establish the signaling elements modulated by MIC-1/transforming growth factor-ß receptors (TGF-ßRs) and their functional cross- talks with EGFR and CXCR4 cascades in tumor and tumor-associated stromal cells during prostate carcinogenesis and bone metastases that contribute to the ethnic disparity in AA vs. Caucasian patients. The therapeutic benefit to targeting MIC-1 cascade and its functional partners for reversing the chemoresistance of PC cells will also be investigated using PCa cell models and human PCa tissues from AA and Caucasian men. To test this hypothesis, three specific aims were proposed. Aim I will establish the involvement of MIC-1, EGFR and CXCR4 in racial disparity by performing immunohistochemical analyses of their expression on a large panel of benign and malignant tissues and DNA microarrays with PC cell lines relevant to AA and Caucasian men. Aim II will delineate molecular mechanisms of MIC-1 and its signaling cross-talks with EGFR and CXCR4 cascades involved in the growth, invasion and alterations of metabolic pathways using in vitro PCa cell models relevant to AA and Caucasian PCa patients. Aim III will determine the therapeutic benefit to target MIC-1 cascade for improving the anti-carcinogenic effects of docetaxel using in vitro and in vivo PCa cell models. Finally, we also demonstrate the molecular mechanism associated with Docetaxel resistance and its relationship with MIC-1 in PCa cells relevant to AA and Caucasian patients. Taken together, these studies will delineate the functional interplay between MIC-1 and its interacting partners EGFR and CXCR4 and their potential role in disease aggressiveness and therapy resistance to better understand their involvement in the racial disparity between AA and Caucasian patients. The overall outcome of this application will reveal the clinical interest to use combination of MIC-1, EGFR and CXCR4 as molecular biomarkers for an earlier and accurate diagnosis, response to therapy and impact on therapeutic intervention of AA and Caucasian patients. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The research project aims to establish the role of MIC-1 and its interacting partners EGFR and CXCR4 in prostate cancer (PCa) pathogenesis, aggressiveness and their involvement in the racial disparity between African American (AA) and Caucasian men. The studies will delineate the signaling elements modulated by MIC-1 and its functional partners EGFR and CXCR4 that contribute to PCa progression, bone metastases, chemoresistance and interethnic disparity using a large panel of prostatic tissue specimens and PCa cell lines relevant to PCa and bone metastases derived from AA and Caucasian patients. Further, the autocrine/paracrine role of MIC-1 in PCa will be established using recombinant human MIC-1 protein using stromal and tumor cells. The benefit of down-regulating MIC-1 for reversing Docetaxel resistance will be determined using in vitro and in vivo PCa cell models.

"Role of chemokine receptor in disparities associated with prostate cancer progres DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): African-American (AA) men have higher incidence of prostate cancer (PCa) than European American (EA). Furthermore, PCa in AA men is characterized by poor prognosis and dismal therapeutic outcomes. However, the mechanism/s associated with this health disparity remain unclear. Thus, identification of molecular mechanisms underlying such disparity is greatly desired in order to develop effective therapeutic and management approaches. It is becoming well appreciated that the chemokine-ligand axis is crucially involved in tumor cell trafficking and the development of organ-specific metastases, which is the major cause of PCa associated deaths. Our laboratory is the first to show that CC chemokine receptor 9 (CCR9) is selectively overexpressed in prostate cancers with negligible expression in normal prostate epithelia. Our exciting preliminary data show significantly higher expression of CCR9 in AA PCa cell lines and clinical samples compared to cell lines and clinical samples derived from EA. Furthermore, serum CCL25, which is natural ligand for CCR9 was higher in AA and PCa cell lines from AA (MDA-PCa-2b) and showed higher invasive and migratory potential as well as less response to chemotherapeutics in vitro compared to EA cell lines (C4-2b). Based upon these encouraging data, we hypothesize that CCR9-CCL25 axis underlies the poor prognosis and therapeutic outcome in AA men with PCa. To test our hypothesis, we propose to investigate the CCR9- CCL25 mediated mechanism associated with (i) aggressive cell phenotype in AA samples, (ii) homing and tumor growth in bone and the potential role of this chemokine-receptor axis in improving chemotherapeutic efficacy of clinical regimens in AA patients. We further aim to establish CCR9 as a biomarker for PCa progression and aggressive disease. To accomplish our aims, we have generated CCR9 anti-body against CCR9 and CCL25, which will be used to block this axis during in vitro assays to determine its role in migration, invasion, survival and chemoresistance; determining its potential role in metastasis as well as determining therapeutic efficacy of Docetaxel in vivo using AA and EA cell lines. In addition, siRNA duplexes or specific pharmacological inhibitors against CCR9 driven signaling molecules will be used to dissect the CCR9 mediated mechanism involved in migration, invasion, survival and chemoresistance. We are optimistic that the successful completion of these studies will define the role of this newly identified chemokine in PCa health disparity. Furthermore, it will enable the design and development of rational therapies directed against the CCR9-CCL25 to reduce/eliminate disparity in therapeutic outcomes. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Our goal is to determine the potential involvement of CC chemokine receptor-9 in disparity associated with poor disease and therapeutic outcome in African American patients. The outcomes of our study will (i) allow to determine the CCR9-mediated molecular pathways involved in PCa graveness and chemo resistant phenotypes, (ii) determine the CCR9-mediated mechanisms metastasis and (iii) establish the clinico- pathological significance of CCR9 in PCa health disparity. Our project will impact 1) development CCR9 expression as a new biomarker for aggressive disease and 2) therapeutic outcome of AA patients.",Role of chemokine receptor in disparities associated with

"DIDACTIC: Dissemination and Implementation of a Diet and Activity Community Trial DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): South Carolina has some of the largest health disparities in the nation, and these are invariably more extreme in African Americans (AA) compared to European Americans. The chronic diseases that present the greatest public health challenges are now known to be inflammation related, and AAs tend to have greater inherent sensitivity to inflammation modulators. The proposed dissemination and implementation research is based on our efficacious intervention trial, ""Diet & Activity Community Trial: High-Risk Inflammation"" [R24 MD002769- 01], which focused on diet, physical activity, and stress reduction in collaboration with the AA faith community to reduce inflammation (referred to as the HEALS intervention). Extraordinary success in engaging the AA faith and greater AA community allows us to propose to disseminate and implement this intervention. We will ensure that the proposed dissemination and implementation research contributes to achieving our overall goal of reducing health disparities among AAs through the following specific aims: (1) Disseminate and implement the successful HEALS intervention in the AA faith community; (2) Evaluate and monitor the dissemination process for adoption, recruitment, retention, and fidelity to the HEALS intervention trial including testing the effect of the disseminated intervention using a variety of non-invasive measures that are relevant to overall health status, proven to be related to chronic inflammation in the intervention-phase trial, and that can (and will) be employed in a community setting; (3) Conduct a cost-effectiveness analysis of intervention dissemination and implementation to reduce health disparities in parameters associated with inflammation, from both budgetary and societal perspectives; and (4) Enhance the capacity of the target community to sustain the delivery of the evidence-based intervention and for community partners to engage in future research and programming to address health disparities through cultivation of a network of active church and community educators and leadership development activities. We will utilize a community-based participatory research approach to recruit 30 churches and 450 participants using a lay health, train-the-trainer model that decentralizes the research process and is suitable for dissemination and implementation research. We also will engage 30 ""mentor"" lay health educators (members of church education teams) who participated in the intervention trial phase to mentor and train newly recruited lay health educators for church education teams for the proposed dissemination and implementation research. We propose to use non-invasive approaches to measure key variables during dissemination and implementation. Cost-effectiveness analysis is an important component and will yield information on required inputs and outputs. The proposed research offers an opportunity to build upon a history of successful collaboration by disseminating and implementing evidence- based intervention with a focus on sustainability of efforts through capacity-building and leadership development to address health disparities in the AA community to address health disparities. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: African Americans (AA) in South Carolina have some of the most extreme health disparities in the nation and most of these can be traced to the effects of poor diet, low levels of physical activity, and stress in increasing chronic inflammation. We have developed an efficacious intervention for dissemination and implementation in partnership with and by our community stakeholders in the AA community to stem the high rates of inflammation rising tide of chronic disease rates in this community. The proposed research also will include assessing the costs associated with dissemination and implementation and focus on enhancing sustainability through capacity building and leadership development activities.",DIDACTIC: Dissemination and Implementation of a Diet and Activity Community Trial,9252502,R01HL122285,"['Adoption ', ' Awareness ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Communities ', ' Community Participation ', ' cost assessment ', ' assess cost ', ' Cost Analyses ', ' Cost Analysis ', ' Decentralization ', ' dietary ', ' Diet ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Family ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Level of Health ', ' Health Status ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' Inflammation ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' Obesity ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Ownership ', ' Public Health ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' recruit ', ' active recruitment ', ' Research ', ' South Carolina ', ' Stress ', ' Testing ', ' Translations ', ' Universities ', ' Measures ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' Trainers Training ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Chronic ', ' Phase ', ' Ensure ', ' Training ', ' Physical activity ', ' Trust ', ' European ', ' R24 ', ' R-24 Monoclonal Antibody ', ' MoAb R24 ', ' Monoclonal Antibody R24 ', ' cancer prevention ', ' Collaborations ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' Church ', ' American ', ' cancer risk ', ' success ', ' Participant ', ' member ', ' Intervention Trial ', ' Interventional trial ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' theories ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Health Educators ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Effectiveness ', ' research data dissemination ', ' research dissemination ', ' Address ', ' Cost Effectiveness Analysis ', ' cost-effectiveness analysis ', ' cost-effective analysis ', ' cost efficient analysis ', ' cost effectiveness analyses ', ' cost effective analysis ', ' Cost Effective Analyses ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Cancer Control Science ', ' Cancer Control ', ' Community Trial ', ' Monitor ', ' Process ', ' Community Health ', ' Output ', ' implementation research ', ' dissemination research ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Evidence based intervention ', ' stem ', ' community based participatory research ', ' participatory action research ', ' community based research ', ' community based design ', ' therapy design ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' health training ', ' high risk ', ' public health relevance ', ' community setting ', ' evidence base ', ' high standard ', ' inflammatory marker ', ' inflammation marker ', ' leadership development ', ' racial health disparity ', ' racial disparities in health ', ' Healthy Eating ', ' ']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA AT COLUMBIA,R01,2017,567979,0.12791418231308868
"Sustaining palliative care to drug users with HIV/AIDS & health disparities DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): With increasing HIV survival and disability, informal (unpaid) caregivers play a growing role in the well-being of persons living with HIV/AIDS (PLHAs), especially as they enter end of life (EOL). Major goals of palliative care (PC) programs are to enhance the quality of life (QOL) of patients and their families, optimize function, and facilitate patient-family decision making on EOL treatment and discussion with medical providers. African American (AA) injection drug users (IDUs) experience disparities in prevalence and outcomes of HIV, in part due to their suboptimal healthcare and treatment adherence, and have low access to PC. The PI's research indicates most AA IDU PLHAs have caregivers and that they play a key role in their healthcare, treatment adherence and mental health. Our preliminary findings also suggest AA IDU PLHAs' caregivers have major risks for burnout and early cessation of care. Research is needed to understand ways to promote AA IDU PLHAs' HIV care and facilitate discussion and mutual understanding of their treatment goals and EOL care preferences with caregivers and providers to ensure their and their caregivers' QOL. The proposed mixed methods, longitudinal study is based on a social ecological, network resource framework and builds on the study team's novel HIV caregiving research program, pediatric HIV PC clinic program, and research on patient- provider communication on EOL issues. Caregiving can be highly stressful, and costly of financial and social resources, which can lead to caregiver burnout (e.g., role overload, captivity) and cessation of care. Major risks of care cessation include recipients' late stage illness, intensive (personal) care needs, substance abuse and other problem behaviors, and caregivers' lack of social support. Preliminary findings from our recent Beacon study suggest caregivers of were highly involved in AA IDU PLHA care recipients' medical adherence and had a dearth of social support. And 79% of recipients reported pain, which was associated with illicit drug use, posing a potential threat to their caregiving relationship and QOL. The proposed study expands our caregiving research program into new areas of PC, EOL, and caregiver resiliencies. The study will comprise four long- term follow-up assessment of the Beacon sample (up to six years) and new recruits (n=400 dyads, half from Beacon); and a qualitative component exploring PC, EOL, and caregiving resiliencies from caregiver and recipient perspectives. The study will address some of the methodological and theoretical limitations of prior caregiving and PC research. The findings will inform the team's later development of interventions to promote AA IDU PLHA caregivers' and recipients' sustained care and QOL by potentially intervening at the dyad, support network or medical provider level. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Relevance Caregivers provide a range of assistance critical to PLHAs' palliative care (PC) and quality of life (QOL). Research is needed to understand how to sustain caregiving and caregivers' QOL through end of life (EOL) of vulnerable African American, injection drug using (IDU) PLHAs. The study represents an obvious next step to the new team's PC, EOL, and caregiving research by identifying barriers and facilitators to sustained HIV care, its impact on QOL, and implications to adult HIV PC practice.",Sustaining palliative care to drug users with HIV/AIDS & health disparities,9215531,R01NR014050,"['Acquired Immunologic Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immuno-Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency ', ' AIDS ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Affect ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Elderly ', ' Communication ', ' Financial cost ', ' Decision Making ', ' Diamorphine ', ' Diacetylmorphine ', ' Heroin ', ' Information Disclosure ', ' Disclosure ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Expenditure ', ' Family ', ' Goals ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' Memory ', ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Persons ', ' Pain ', ' Painful ', ' Palliative Care ', ' comfort care ', ' Palliative Treatment ', ' Palliative Therapy ', ' Patients ', ' Play ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' recruit ', ' active recruitment ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Rewards ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Self Care ', ' personal care ', ' Social support ', ' social support network ', ' Testing ', ' Translations ', ' virology ', ' Measures ', ' Care Givers ', ' Caregivers ', ' Intensive Care ', ' Outcome Assessment ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' depressive ', ' depression symptom ', ' Emotional Depression ', ' depressive symptoms ', ' Health Benefit ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' doubt ', ' Uncertainty ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' Area ', ' Medical ', ' Ensure ', ' disability ', ' drug use ', ' Drug usage ', ' behavioral problem ', ' Problem behavior ', ' Collaborations ', ' Drug user ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' cognitively impaired ', ' cognitive loss ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' programs ', ' Clinic ', ' burnout ', ' burn-out ', ' Lifestyle-related condition ', ' Lifestyle-Related Problem ', ' Lifestyle-Related Disorder ', ' Behavior-Related Problem ', ' Behavior-Related Disorder ', ' Injecting drug user ', ' persons who inject drugs ', ' people who inject illicit drugs ', ' people who inject drugs ', ' PWID ', ' Injection Drug User ', ' experience ', ' novel ', ' member ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' AIDS/HIV problem ', ' HIV/AIDS problem ', ' HIV/AIDS ', ' AIDS/HIV ', ' Substance abuse problem ', ' substance abuse ', ' abuse of substances ', ' end of life care ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' social stigma ', ' stigma ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy ', ' highly active anti-retroviral therapy ', ' HAART ', ' Provider ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' therapy adherence ', ' Address ', ' end of life ', ' end-of-life ', ' Adherence ', ' care giving ', ' caregiving ', ' resilience ', ' care preference ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' therapy development ', ' treatment development ', ' intervention development ', ' develop therapy ', ' public health relevance ', ' clinical care ', ' evidence base ', ' pediatric human immunodeficiency virus ', ' pediatric HIV ', ' treatment adherence ', ' clinical practice ', ' follow up assessment ', ' cocaine use ', ' multiple chronic conditions ', ' multimorbidity ', ' injection drug use ', ' support network ', ' care recipients ', ' care receiver ', ' informal care ', ' caregiving research ', ' research on caregiving ', ' care giving research ', ' illicit drug use ', ' ']",NINR,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R01,2017,448896,0.03508098508929571
"Molecular determinant of racial disparity in prostate cancer DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Significant disparity in the incidence and clinical outcome of prostate cancer (PCa) exist between African- American (AA) men and their European American (EA) counterparts. Despite this recognition, we have not made a major leap in our understanding of the molecular causes associated with such disparity. This proposal is built upon our strong preliminary data on a proto-oncogene, Myb, which has remained largely unexplored in PCa. Our novel findings demonstrate that 1) Myb expression is significantly elevated in AA PCa with greater overall incidence as compared to EA PCa, 2) low intensity expression of Myb is also detected in some of the benign prostate tissues (BPH) from AA patients, while no expression is detected in EA BPH, 3) AA PCa cell lines (MDaPCa-2b and RC-77/T) exhibit high Myb expression and significant resistance to hormone-depletion and docetaxel (DTX) toxicity, 4) AA PCa cells also display high growth, migratory and invasive potential, which is associated with Myb overexpression, and 5) Myb interacts with AR and modulates the expression of androgen-responsive gene, KLK3/PSA, suggesting their cooperative role in gene regulation. Based on these promising findings, we hypothesize that relative greater incidence and overall expression of Myb in AA PCa cells underlies their inherently greater propensity to metastasize and evade therapeutic intervention. To test this hypothesis, we are proposing three specific aims. In aim 1, we will investigate the role of Myb in PCa aggressiveness and therapy-resistance. Using luciferase-tagged, Myb-overexpressing or -silenced, paired AA and EA PCa cell lines, we will examine the functional association of Myb with PCa growth and metastasis, and their response to castration- and docetaxel- therapies in an orthotopic mouse model. In Aim 2, we will examine the functional consequences of Myb-AR interaction and identify their downstream consequences. We will specifically examine whether Myb has a role in AR localization and transcriptional activation. Furthermore, we will assess the effect of Myb on transcriptional reprogramming of AR by using state of the art RNA-Seq and ChIP-Seq approaches. We will determine the shared and independent targets of Myb and AR in PCa cells and examine if Myb alters AR target gene specificity. In Aim 3, we will determine the clinical relevance of Myb in racial disparity associated with PCa. We will perform immunohistochemical (IHC) analysis to assess Myb and AR expression and localization (cytoplasmic vs. nuclear) in PCa, adjacent BPH, and uninvolved normal tissues from both AA and EA cases. We will then examine their correlation (alone and in combination) with race, tumor grade, metastasis incidence, PSA levels, and patient's survival. Together, these studies will provide experimental, mechanistic and clinical evidence for the role of Myb in aggressive behavior and therapeutic- resistance of PCa, and support the association of Myb with observed racial disparity. In the long-term, the resulting information will be useful in reducing the racial disparities in clinical outcomes of PCa by establishing the clinical utility of Myb as a risk predictor and/or therapeutic target for effective disease management. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Main barrier in achieving progress toward racial disparities reduction in prostate cancer is our limited understanding of the underlying molecular basis. The proposed research will examine the functional and clinical significance of Myb overexpression in prostate cancer aggressiveness and therapeutic resistance, the two major reasons for the poor clinical outcome of African American (AA) patients. The outcomes of our study will allow distinction between clinically indolent and aggressive prostate tumors, and pave the way for novel target-based therapies, which will ultimately reduce the enhanced burden of prostate cancer on African American population and improve overall survival of prostate cancer patients.",Molecular determinant of racial disparity in prostate cancer,9392380,U01CA185490,"['Affect ', ' Aggression ', ' Aggressive behavior ', ' Surgical Castration ', ' Castration ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cells ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Exhibits ', ' Gene Regulation Process ', ' Gene Regulation ', ' Gene Action Regulation ', ' Gene Expression Regulation ', ' Genes ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Growth ', ' Therapeutic Hormone ', ' Endocrine Gland Secretion ', ' Hormones ', ' Incidence ', ' Ligands ', ' Luciferases ', ' Luciferase Immunologic ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' mortality ', ' Neoplasm Metastasis ', ' tumor cell metastasis ', ' cancer metastasis ', ' Secondary Tumor ', ' Secondary Neoplasm ', ' Metastatic Tumor ', ' Metastatic Neoplasm ', ' Metastatic Mass ', ' Metastatic Lesion ', ' Metastasize ', ' Metastasis ', ' Patients ', ' Play ', ' Prostate ', ' Prostatic Gland ', ' Prostate Gland ', ' Prostatic Neoplasms ', ' Prostatic Neoplasia ', ' Prostate Tumor ', ' Prostate Neoplasms ', ' Proto-Oncogenes ', ' protooncogene ', ' c-ONC ', ' Cellular Oncogene ', ' Publishing ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Androgen Receptor ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Socioeconomic Factors ', ' Specificity ', ' T-Lymphocyte ', ' thymus derived lymphocyte ', ' Thymus-Dependent Lymphocytes ', ' T-Cells ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' hK3 Kallikrein ', ' gamma-Seminoprotein ', ' Seminin ', ' Semenogelase ', ' Prostate Specific Antigen Preproprotein ', ' Plasma Prekallikrein ', ' Plasma Kallikrein Precursor ', ' P-30 Antigen ', ' Kallikrein 3 ', ' EC 3.4.21.34 ', ' Prostate-Specific Antigen ', ' Transcription Activation ', ' Transcriptional Activation ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Benign ', ' Clinical ', ' Refractory ', ' Malignant ', ' Malignant - descriptor ', ' insight ', ' Indolent ', ' European ', ' Gene Targeting ', ' docetaxol ', ' Taxotere ', ' docetaxel ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Normal tissue morphology ', ' Normal Tissue ', ' Malignant neoplasm of prostate ', ' Prostatic Cancer ', ' Prostate Cancer ', ' Prostate CA ', ' Malignant prostatic tumor ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Prostate ', ' Disease Management ', ' Disorder Management ', ' PSA level ', ' Frequencies ', ' Nuclear ', ' American ', ' receptor expression ', ' Toxic effect ', ' Toxicities ', ' novel ', ' disease classification ', ' nosology ', ' disorder classification ', ' Modality ', ' Pathogenesis ', ' Reporting ', ' Therapeutic Intervention ', ' intervention therapy ', ' response ', ' RNA Interference ', ' Sequence-Specific Posttranscriptional Gene Silencing ', ' RNAi ', ' RNA Silencing ', ' Quelling ', ' Posttranscriptional Gene Silencing ', ' Post-Transcriptional Gene Silencing ', ' Tissue Sample ', ' KLK3 gene ', ' KLKB1 ', ' KLK3 ', ' Data ', ' Disease Marker ', ' Receptor Signaling ', ' Cancer Patient ', ' Characteristics ', ' Molecular ', ' Process ', ' treatment resistance ', ' therapeutic resistance ', ' resistant to therapy ', ' resistance to therapy ', ' therapy resistant ', ' vector ', ' knockdown ', ' knock-down ', ' LNCaP ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' disparity in cancer ', ' cancer disparity ', ' Resistance ', ' resistant ', ' clinically relevant ', ' clinical relevance ', ' clinically significant ', ' clinical significance ', ' mouse model ', ' murine model ', ' therapeutic target ', ' tumor ', ' overexpression ', ' overexpress ', ' over-expression ', ' public health relevance ', ' ChIP-seq ', ' chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequencing ', ' ChIP Sequencing ', ' transcriptome sequencing ', ' RNAseq ', ' RNA sequencing ', ' RNA Seq ', ' prostate cancer cell ', ' prostate tumor cell ', ' racial disparity ', ' race disparity ', ' disparities in race ', ' prostate cancer cell line ', ' disparity reduction ', ' reduce disparity ', ' androgen sensitive ', ' androgen responsive ', ' androgen dependent ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH ALABAMA,U01,2017,41253,-0.042979467301040394
"Racial Disparity in Bladder Cancer and Identification of Altered Metabolism in African American Compare to European Bladder Cancer Project Summary/Abstract It has known that bladder cancer (BCa) mortality is higher in African American patients. Disparity exists between African-American (AA) and European-American (EA), in the clinical outcome of BCa. The long-term objective of our research plan is to reduce the disproportionate effects of bladder cancer (BCa) on African American. A guiding principle of our methodology is that alterations in mitochondrial metabolites exist between African American and European American BCa and that these differences can explain, in part, BCa health disparity. In this application, we propose to use the technique of metabolomic profiling to uncover these underlying differences. To date, a metabolomic analyses aimed at understanding of bladder cancer health disparity has not been reported. We have recently published the first study describing metabolic alterations associated with bladder cancer. In preliminary studies, we have profiled the metabolome of BCa from AA and EA patients and identified a distinct AA race-specific expression pattern in mitochondrial metabolites and lipids. In this proposal, we will i) characterize the mitochondrial associated metabolites in AA and EA BCa, ii) verify the D-2HG and associated enzymes (GLS, ADHFE1, and IDH1/2) in BCa patients and establish a therapeutically targeted deregulation pathway for glutamine metabolism in AA BCa iii) assess the levels of lyso PC and PC and the function of their metabolizing enzymes PLA1A and LRAT in AA BCa. The successful completion of the proposed studies will have a significant impact in the field of Bladder cancer health disparity and metabolism. Importantly, findings from our study have the potential to reveal racially exclusive metabolic markers and therapeutic targets for BCa. Taken together, the information gleaned from this proposal could rapidly revolutionize current diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutic approaches by revealing the biological underpinnings of bladder cancer health disparity. Project Narrative This proposal expects to develop a panel of mitochondrial metabolic markers in tissues and urine. The study is supported by a seminal publication highlighting the ability of the PI to develop urine-based metabolic markers for bladder cancer smoker by: 1. utilizing urine based metabolites as non-invasive biomarkers; and, 2. developing race associated perturbed metabolic pathways specific to bladder cancer that could be further harnessed to develop better treatment strategies or combinatorial therapy with the existing drugs. Overall, this proposal is expected to delineate 2-Hydroxy glutaric acid, glutamine metabolism, and associated mitocondrial metabolites with AA BCa and develop a first-generation panel of metabolic markers in urine of AA BCa patients.",Racial Disparity in Bladder Cancer and Identification of Altered Metabolism in African American Compare to European Bladder Cancer,9388440,R01CA220297,"['Accounting ', ' Acetylation ', ' Acetyltransferase ', ' Alcohol-NAD+ Oxidoreductase ', ' Alcohol dehydrogenase ', ' inhibitor ', ' inhibitor/antagonist ', ' L-Aspartic Acid ', ' Aspartic Acid ', ' Bioenergetics ', ' Biologic Factor ', ' Biological Factors ', ' Urinary Bladder Malignant Tumor ', ' Urinary Bladder Cancer ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Bladder ', ' Malignant Bladder Neoplasm ', ' Bladder Cancer ', ' Malignant neoplasm of urinary bladder ', ' Cystectomy ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Enzyme Gene ', ' Enzymes ', ' Genes ', ' neuroglia tumor ', ' neuroglia neoplasm ', ' glial-derived tumor ', ' Neuroglial Tumor ', ' Neuroglial Neoplasm ', ' Glial Tumor ', ' Glial Neoplasm ', ' Glial Cell Tumors ', ' Glioma ', ' Liver Glutaminase ', ' L glutamine amidohydrolase ', ' GA Protein ', ' EC 3.5.1.2 ', ' Breast Cell Glutaminase ', ' Glutaminase ', ' Q.

"A Follow-up Study for Causes of Cancer in Black Women DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Black Women's Health Study (BWHS), the largest follow-up study for cancer in African American (AA) women, began in 1995 when 59,000 women (median age, 38) from across the U.S. enrolled. The BWHS has successfully followed participants with biennial questionnaires for data on incident disease and medical, reproductive, behavioral, psychosocial, and socioeconomic factors, linked addresses to U.S. census data, and are currently linking to air pollution data. Cancer diagnoses are validated by pathology data from hospitals and cancer registries. A DNA bio repository was established through collection of cheek cell samples from 26,800 participants. Despite initial slow accrual of cancers due to the young age of participants at entry, the BWHS has published extensively on risk factors for breast cancer; sufficient cases of lung cancer, colorectal cancer, and colon adenomas are now available. We propose to (1) continue follow-up/data collection; (2) establish a repository of 17,800 blood samples; (3) share data/samples in consortia projects. Continuation of the BWHS is highly desirable: 90% of participants are still cancer-free; follow-up has been successful and unbiased; the cohort has reached ages at which cancer incidence increases markedly; effects of exposures (e.g., severe obesity, racism) that are less common in other populations can be studied; the DNA has made valuable contributions to genetic cancer studies and is a major replication source for studies of breast cancer and related phenotypes in AA and other groups; the BWHS is a key contributor to consortia projects of rarer cancers in /\As; and the BWHS has been highly productive. Because levels of many blood markers are unfavorable among AAs and few studies of blood biomarkers in relation to cancer incidence have been carried out specifically in /\As, we propose to establish a repository of blood samples in the BWHS. A successful pilot study demonstrated the feasibility of our methods and participation was unbiased and similar to that in other large follow-up studies. The repository will increase by 60% the limited number of AA women with available blood samples being followed in U.S. cancer cohort studies. AA women continue to be disproportionately affected by many cancers. Continuation of the BWHS will permit continuation of its valuable contributions to understanding cancer etiology in this understudied group. A blood repository will greatly increase the value of the BWHS resource by permitting studies that help to fill the knowledge gap about the relation of biomarkers to cancer incidence and survival in AAs. The assessment of serious nonmalignant illnesses in the BWHS enhances the value of this resource at no cost to the study of cancer.

"The role of resilience in addressing racial disparities in adverse HIV-related outcomes Project Summary/Abstract  In the United States (U.S.), African Americans/Blacks (AAs) are the racial/ethnic group most adversely impacted by the HIV epidemic. As such, one of the goals of the White House National HIV/AIDS Strategy is to permanently reduce long-standing health disparities in HIV disease. Lower HIV clinic attendance and suboptimal antiretroviral therapy (ART) use (i.e., initiation, modification, and adherence) by AAs are likely the main mediators of continually worse HIV virologic responses among AAs compared to Caucasians. However, despite the development and implementation of interventions targeting many known individual-level risk and protective factors for clinic attendance and ART use, substantial racial disparities remain. Persistent disparities may be due, in part, to the adverse conditions that characterize the high risk neighborhood environments (e.g., socioeconomic deprivation and violence) in which HIV+ AAs disproportionately reside. However, despite such adversities some AAs demonstrate resilience (i.e., displaying positive behaviors/outcomes despite adversity) which may be critical to reducing persistent racial disparities. Compared to the risk environment, individual, interpersonal, and neighborhood resilience represent novel and more malleable intervention targets for reducing persistent disparities. Unfortunately, resilience remains understudied in the HIV literature, perhaps due to the absence of a reliable and valid resilience measure for HIV+ adults that captures all resilience components. The objective of the proposed research is to develop a reliable and valid measure of individual, interpersonal, and neighborhood resilience; to document its psychometric properties; and to assess longitudinally whether higher resilience facilitates positive HIV outcomes among HIV+ AAs by the level of the risk environment. Data on HIV+ AAs enrolled in the UNC CFAR HIV Clinical Cohort and the UAB 1917 Clinic Cohort will be used for the proposed study. Specifically, this study aims to (1) use advanced concept mapping, which is a mixed methods approach, to generate items that capture all components of resilience; (2) perform psychometric testing of concept mapping items to create a reliable and valid resilience measure that includes all components of resilience; (3a) examine whether resilience and non-resilience individual-level factors (e.g., alcohol/drug use, mental illness, and health insurance) are prospectively associated with HIV outcomes (e.g., clinic attendance, ART adherence, and virologic suppression) by the level of the neighborhood risk environment; and (3b) assess for interactions between resilience and non-resilience individual-level factors by the level of the risk environment. This study responds to the critical need to develop a multi-component resilience measure for HIV+ adults and to establish whether resilience facilitates positive HIV outcomes among HIV+ AAs. Our important findings may lead to the development and implementation of novel multilevel resilience-related interventions to reduce persistent racial disparities in HIV disease. Project Narrative  This innovative project will determine whether resilience facilitates positive HIV outcomes among HIV+ African American/Black (AA) adults in the United States (U.S.) by the level of the neighborhood risk environment. Completing this work will provide critical evidence about the relationship between resilience and HIV outcomes among HIV+ AAs from two longitudinal HIV clinic cohort studies. Such critical evidence is necessary to justify the investment of limited resources into developing interventions targeted at enhancing resilience among AAs to (a) reduce persistent HIV racial disparities in the U.S. and (b) help achieve the goals of the White House National HIV/AIDS Strategy.",The role of resilience in addressing racial disparities in adverse HIV-related outcomes,9345085,R01MH112386,"['adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Alcohol Chemical Class ', ' Alcohols ', ' Behavior ', ' psychological disorder ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Buffers ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Environment ', ' Epidemic ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Family ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' antigen positive AIDS test ', ' antibody positive AIDS test ', ' HTLV-III Seropositivity ', ' HTLV-III Seroconversion ', ' HIV Seroconversion ', ' HIV Positivity ', ' HIV Positive ', ' HIV Antibody Positivity ', ' Anti-HIV Positivity ', ' AIDS Seropositivity ', ' AIDS Seroconversion ', ' HIV Seropositivity ', ' Health Insurance ', ' Investments ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Literature ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Methods ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Persons ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Psychometrics ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Testing ', ' United States ', ' violent behavior ', ' violent ', ' Violence ', ' virology ', ' white race ', ' Occidental ', ' Caucasoid Race ', ' Caucasoid ', ' Caucasian Race ', ' Caucasian ', ' Caucasians ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' Mediating ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' Failure ', ' Individual ', ' drug use ', ' Drug usage ', ' Research Priority ', ' Clinic ', ' experience ', ' cohort ', ' novel ', ' AIDS/HIV problem ', ' HIV/AIDS problem ', ' HIV/AIDS ', ' AIDS/HIV ', ' Sampling ', ' Property ', ' response ', ' deprivation ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' therapy adherence ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Address ', ' Adherence ', ' Data ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Modification ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socio-economically ', ' socio-economic ', ' socioeconomics ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' antiretroviral therapy ', ' resilience ', ' Outcome ', ' Prevalence ', ' prospective ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' high risk ', ' racial disparity ', ' race disparity ', ' disparities in race ', ' behavioral outcome ', ' behavior outcome ', ' concept mapping ', ' concept maps ', ' ']",NIMH,BROWN UNIVERSITY,R01,2017,717864,0.0633305176792059
"Race - adiposity interactions regulate mechanisms determining insulin sensitivity DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Project summary. Insulin resistance plays a major role in the etiology of chronic metabolic diseases, many of which differ with race/ethnicity. Previous studies using mainly indirect methods suggest that insulin sensitivity is lower in African-Americans (AA) vs. European-Americans (EA). However, results are discrepant, differing with the method used and the obesity status of the participants. Our preliminary data using the reference standard glucose clamp indicate that in lean individuals, insulin sensitivity i lower among AA, while in obese individuals, insulin sensitivity is higher among AA. We hypothesize that this race/body mass index (BMI) interaction may be explained in part by significantly lower visceral/hepatic adiposity in AA that results in less impairment of insulin sensitivity among obese AA individuals. Conversely, we hypothesize that inherently greater oxidative stress impairs insulin sensitivity in AA, explaining lower insulin sensitivity in lean AA vs. EA. This is based on our preliminary data indicating that a circulating marker of cumulative oxidative stress was significantly associated with insulin-stimulated glucose disposal in AA but not EA, and that production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in vitro was greater in AA vs. EA. We propose to test these hypotheses by prospectively comparing skeletal muscle and hepatic insulin sensitivity in healthy lean, overweight, and obese AA and EA using the hyperinsulinemic isoglycemic glucose clamp with tracer-labeled glucose. Analysis of ancestral genetic admixture will permit simultaneous assessment of the contribution of ancestry to main outcomes. With our first aim, we will test the hypothesis that a significant race-by-BMI interaction will be detected n skeletal muscle and hepatic insulin sensitivity, such that at low BMI AA are less insulin sensitive but at high BMI AA are more insulin sensitive, when compared with EA. The second aim will test the hypothesis that at high BMI, AA will have greater hepatic and skeletal muscle insulin sensitivity due to lower hepatic and visceral fat. The third aim will test the hypothesis that greater bioenergetic efficiency and ROS production within skeletal muscle mitochondria will be associated with lower skeletal muscle insulin sensitivity in lean AA. A secondary aim will test the hypothesis that skeletal muscle and hepatic insulin sensitivity are better associated with adipokines, cytokines, lipids, blood pressure, and vascular function in EA than in AA. Relevance. Results from this study elucidating why the underlying pathophysiology of insulin resistance differs with genetic background may guide development of personalized treatment strategies with implications for several chronic metabolic diseases (e.g., type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and cancer). PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We will test the hypothesis that the underlying pathophysiology of insulin resistance differs with genetic background. We predict that insulin resistance will occur secondary to visceral and hepatic obesity in European Americans, but is driven by inherently greater oxidative stress in African Americans. Results from this study may guide the development of individualized treatment strategies for prevention and reversal of insulin resistance, and may have implications for a race-specific role of insulin resistance in the etiology of chronic metabolic disease.",Race - adiposity interactions regulate mechanisms determining insulin sensitivity,9336301,R01DK096388,"['adulthood ', ' Adult Human ',

"Exploring factors related to racial disparities in ovarian cancer incidence and survival: the OCWAA consortium PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT    Invasive epithelial ovarian cancer accounts for 5% of malignancies and, while it is the eighth most common  cancer in US women, it is the fifth leading cause of cancer deaths. Many of the established and suspected risk  factors for ovarian cancer show racial differences in the prevalence and/or timing of exposures. Racial  differences in incidence and survival are likely due to a combination of factors, including differences in the  prevalence of risk factors, treatment received, prevalence of comorbidities, and socioeconomic characteristics.  The newly-­formed consortium, Ovarian Cancer in Women of African Ancestry (OCWAA), brings together  investigators experienced in studying the epidemiology of ovarian cancer and dedicated to understanding  racial differences in risk and outcomes in ovarian cancer. The OCWAA consortium includes an ongoing  population-­based case-­control study in African American (AA) women, three completed population-­based  case-­control studies that include both AA and white cases and controls and two unique cohort studies with  large numbers of AA participants. To address racial differences in incidence and survival, we will  comprehensively examine reproductive and lifestyle exposures which differ in prevalence and/or timing

"EPHA6 as a novel candidate driver gene in colon cancer ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our long-term objective is to elucidate the etiologic factors contributing to disparate colon cancer (CRC) outcomes in African Americans (AA), who continue to exhibit the highest CRC incidence and mortality rates in the U.S, even after accounting for socioeconomic and access to care factors. We recently reported the first comprehensive molecular characterization of AA CRCs, identifying a 15 gene-set as preferentially mutated in AA as compared to Caucasian CRCs. On a broader scale, it is likely that these ethnicity-associated differences in CRC mutational landscapes may have potential to impact on broader disparities in cancer behaviors. In particular, our study identified the, accounting for ~6% of AA vs. 0% of Caucasians CRC cases. EPHA6 belongs to a broader family of ephrin receptor tyrosine kinases that function as oncogenes or tumor suppressors depending on the cancer type. Intriguingly, our study was the first to implicate EPHA6 in CRCs, with the finding of recurrent mutations in this gene selectively in AA CRCs, suggesting a provocative ethnicity-associated difference in routes of colon carcinogenesis. Accordingly, the specific goals of the current proposal are: (AIM 1) To characterize EPHA6 signaling and determine the functional consequences of EPHA6 mutations identified in AA CRCs. We will use in-depth phospho-proteomics and gene expression profiling approaches in AA CRC cell lines engineered to express wild-type (WT) or mutant versions of EPHA6 to characterize EPHA6 signaling and to determine the molecular consequences of EPHA6 mutations. Furthermore, we will compare the phenotypic effects of WT vs. mutant EPHA6 on tumor growth characteristics, using in vitro and xenograft models; (AIM 2) To determine if loss of EPHA6 enhances susceptibility to colon cancer. We will use EPHA6 null mice to determine if loss of EPHA6 induces colon tumorigenesis in chemical carcinogen and Apc Min models of colon cancer. As a complementary approach to Aim 1, we will further dissect and refine EPHA6 signaling pathway, in vivo, using proteomics and gene profiling in EPHA6 WT vs. null mouse colons; (AIM 3) To determine the generality of EPHA6 mutations, and their association with clinically-relevant histopathological features. The AA CRC cases used in our initial study were derived exclusively from Northeast Ohio. Given the history of differing patterns of mass internal migration of AAs within U.S, we will re-sequence EPHA6 in AA CRC cases from Southwestern Texas, to test if EPHA6 is common CRC mutational target in geographically distinct AA populations. Furthermore, given that all of the EPHA6-mutant CRCs identified in our initial study arose in proximal colon, we will re-sequence EPHA6 in a fresh set of AA CRCs from Northeast Ohio to determine if EPHA6-mutant CRC cases define a distinct, morphologically recognizable, subset of CRCs. Success in these studies will uncover new mechanisms underlying colon tumorigenesis and may identify new therapeutic targets for CRC, in addition to having broad epidemiological implications in elucidating the etiologic factors potentially contributing to aggressive colon cancer phenotypes in African Americans. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: African Americans are more likely to be diagnosed with and to die as a result of colon cancer than any other ethnic group in the United States. Identifying the mechanisms involved in colon tumor progression in African Americans is therefore critical for elucidating the etiologic factors contributing to outcome disparities in African Americans. Our proposed studies are designed to delineate the molecular mechanisms associated with colon cancer progression in African Americans with an overarching goal of guiding clinical management for this deadly disease in this population.",EPHA6 as a novel candidate driver gene in colon cancer,9242584,R01CA204549,"['Accounting ', ' Allelomorphs ', ' Alleles ', ' Diazene, dimethyl-, 1-oxide ', '

"IBD Gene Mapping by Clinical and Population Subset PROJECT SUMMARY Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) are complex genetic disorders of the gastrointestinal tract, and a major health burden to patients and society. Tremendous progress has been made in dissecting IBD genetic etiology with identification of over 100 IBD loci by genome wide association studies (GWAS) but mainly limited to persons of European ancestry. The IBD Genetics Consortium (IBDGC) was established to facilitate multicenter collaborative studies of 6 Genetics Research Centers (GRCs) organized with a Data Coordinating Center (DCC). Our GRC at Johns Hopkins (JHGRC) has contributed to all IBDGC studies, led the largest genome wide linkage study in IBD and has led the IBDGC in a focus on African American (AA) IBD genetics (recruiting 88% of study subjects). We published the first large clinical characterization of AA IBD, serological associations of AA CD, clinical disparity studies, and most recently evaluation of admixture in AA CD, NOD2 the other four most well characterized CD genetic loci. More research in AA IBD is needed to understand the etiology of IBD in this ancestrally distinct, major American population, and also because diverse allelic and haplotype structure, and potential for unique functional variants will yield benefits for all populations. Additionally, a major challenge, especially for non- coding associations, is to know which SNPs are causative vs. those in linkage disequilibrium. Comparing association patterns across populations and evaluating function of associated SNPs that map to potential transcription factor (TF) sites active in IBD related cells will be beneficial. Our Aims in the next funding period are to (1) facilitate more comprehensive IBD gene discovery and evaluation in the AA population, and (2) to characterize the epigenome relevant to IBD and evaluate the most provocative non-coding SNPs across populations that map to potential TF binding sites for alterning genomic function. For the first Aim, we have enlarged our recruitment to12 satellite recruitment centers and will recruit 1000 AA IBD cases (with potential of 2600 cases) over the next five years. Immunochip IBD genotyping in AA's and a first stage AA CD GWAS IBD are underway, with facilitation of a 2nd stage ancillary R01 AA CD GWAS with Emory University planned for Year 3. We will perform an IBDGC AA UC GWAS of 1000 cases in year 4. We will compare IBD associations across ethnic groups to define most consistent non-coding SNPs. For Aim 2, we've assembled a team to help us characterize IBD relevant epigenomic annotation. We will purify immune cells from resected colon of patients, perform ChIP-Seq, and evaluate SNPs that map to TF binding sites using in-vitro enhancer assays in transfected cell lines. We will play a major role in all IBDGC activities, with our team of genetic statistical, genomic, immunology, and microbiome co-investigators, by our ability to obtain biological materials (including blood, biopsy, resection, and stool) and to recall patients for re-sampling, and by working cooperatively to maximize productivity of the IBDGC and its GRCs and DCC. PROJECT NARRATIVE According to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention, an estimated 1.4 million Americans suffer from Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD), a chronic debilitating disorder with no cure that includes Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. IBD ranks in the top 5 in prevalence for gastrointestinal disorders and represents a significant financial burden to society requiring a lifetime of medical care. This proposed research aims to determine the genetic variations that cause IBD which will aid in developing preventive measures, improving the quality of care with better treatments and educating patients through genetic counseling.",IBD Gene Mapping by Clinical and Population Subset,9724909,U01DK062431,"['Achievement ', ' Achievement Attainment ', ' Alleles ', ' Allelomorphs ', ' Architecture ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Autoimmunity ', ' Autoimmune Status ', ' Binding Sites ', ' Reactive Site ', ' Combining Site ', ' Biocompatible Materials ', ' biological material ', ' Biomaterials ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Biopsy ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Cell Line ', ' cultured cell line ', ' Strains Cell Lines ', ' CellLine ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' CDC ', ' Chromatin ', ' Chromosome Mapping ', ' genetic mapping ', ' Total Human and Non-Human Gene Mapping ', ' Linkage Mapping ', ' Gene Mapping Genetics ', ' Gene Mapping ', ' Gene Localization ', ' Ulcerative Colitis ', ' Ulcerated Colitis ', ' Colon ', ' Community Health Centers ', ' Satellite Centers ', "" Crohn's disease "", ' regional enteritis ', ' eleocolitis ', ' Granulomatous Enteritis ', "" Crohn's disorder "", "" Crohn's "", ' Crohn disease ', ' Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' type one diabetes ', ' type I diabetes ', ' ketosis prone diabetes ', ' juvenile diabetes mellitus ', ' juvenile diabetes ', ' insulin dependent diabetes ', ' Type I Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Type 1 diabetes ', ' Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus ', ' T1DM ', ' T1D ', ' T1 diabetes ', ' T1 DM ', ' Sudden-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Ketosis-Prone Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Juvenile-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' IDDM ', ' Brittle Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' DNA ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' Epithelial Cells ', ' Ethnic group ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Feces ', ' stool ', ' Gastrointestinal Diseases ', ' gastrointestinal disorder ', ' Gastrointestinal Diseases and Manifestations ', ' Gastrointestinal tract structure ', ' digestive canal ', ' alimentary tract ', ' Gastrointestinal Tract ', ' GI Tract ', ' Digestive Tract ', ' Alimentary Canal ', ' Gene Expression Regulation ', ' Gene Regulation Process ', ' Gene Regulation ', ' Gene Action Regulation ', ' Genes ', ' Regulator Genes ', ' trans acting element ', ' regulatory gene ', ' Transcriptional Regulatory Elements ', ' Genetic Counseling ', ' Genotype ', ' Goals ', ' Haplotypes ', ' Health ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Immune System Diseases ', ' Immunological System Dysfunction ', ' Immunological Dysfunction ', ' Immunological Diseases ', ' Immunologic Diseases ', ' Immunodeficiency and Immunosuppression Disorders ', ' Immune System and Related Disorders ', ' Immune System Dysfunction ', ' Immune System Disorder ', ' Immune Dysfunction ', ' Immune Disorders ', ' Immune Diseases ', ' In Vitro ', ' Inflammatory Bowel Diseases ', ' Inflammatory Intestinal Disorder ', ' Inflammatory Intestinal Disease ', ' Inflammatory Bowel Disorder ', ' Intestines ', ' bowel ', ' Intestinal ', ' Linkage Disequilibrium ', ' Systemic Lupus Erythematosus ', ' systemic lupus erythematosis ', ' disseminated lupus erythematosus ', ' Systemic SLE -

"The Role of Inflammation in the Racial Disparities in Ovarian Cancer Survival ABSTRACT This application will provide the candidate, Dr. Peres, with the necessary career development and research experiences to propel her career as an independent molecular cancer epidemiologist. Dr. Peres’ long-term career goal is to integrate the fields of cancer epidemiology and molecular biology to disentangle the independent and joint effects of molecular and environmental risk factors on cancer etiology and prognosis, with a special emphasis on how these factors influence health disparities. Epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) is the deadliest gynecologic malignancy in the U.S. and African American (AA) women have a much poorer prognosis in comparison to women of European ancestry (EA). The contributing factors to this survival disparity are relatively unknown, and research in this area is in its infancy due to the small numbers of AA women in existing epidemiologic studies on EOC. Given the suggested link between chronic inflammation and EOC etiology and prognosis coupled with the observed differences in biomarkers of inflammation by race, we posit that differences in inflammation may be contributing to the EOC survival gap in AA women. The proposed research will capitalize on two existing population-based case-control studies, the African American Cancer Epidemiology Study (AACES) and the North Carolina Ovarian Cancer Study (NCOCS), to evaluate how the independent and joint effects of systemic and local inflammation in the tumor microenvironment influences EOC prognosis among AA women and whether differences in these inflammatory biomarkers are contributing to the racial survival disparity in EOC. Leukocyte cell type and distribution will be used as markers of systemic and local inflammation. Circulating leukocytes will be obtained from the complete blood cell count at diagnosis and a peripheral blood sample obtained after diagnosis. Leukocyte proportions will be inferred from peripheral blood DNA methylation data (Illumina MethylationEPIC BeadChip) using cell mixture deconvolution methods. To measure local inflammation, we will use immunohistochemistry to obtain counts of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (FOXP3, CD3, CD8) and neutrophils (CD66b) within the primary tumor and measure the Klintrup score, a general marker of overall inflammation with the tumor and within each leukocyte cell type. Lastly, we will evaluate whether inflammatory-related exposures (e.g., obesity, analgesic medication use, genital body powder exposure) contribute to systemic and/or local inflammation, and whether these biomarkers are mediators of the relationship between inflammatory-related exposures and EOC survival. In order to achieve the proposed research objectives, Dr. Peres will obtain additional knowledge in cancer epigenetics, molecular biology and bioinformatics through her training and career development activities as well as the mentoring provided by her interdisciplinary advisory committee. The proposed research will improve our understanding of the contributing factors to poor EOC survival among AA women and will likely have a considerable impact on our over-arching goal of reducing the existing racial survival disparity in EOC. PROJECT NARRATIVE Ovarian cancer is the fifth leading cause of cancer deaths among U.S. women. African American women experience the worst ovarian cancer survival, yet the causes of this racial survival disparity are not fully understood. We propose to evaluate how systemic and local inflammation, as well as their interplay, influences ovarian cancer prognosis among African American women and whether differences in these inflammatory markers are contributing to the racial survival disparity in ovarian cancer. This study will improve our overall understanding of ovarian cancer prognosis in African American women, to which little is known, as well as provide valuable data that can inform the applicability of

"An integrated substance use, violence, and HIV/AIDS syndemic risk-reduction intervention for African American Couples PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Synergistic interactions between substance use, violence and HIV/AIDS (SAVA syndemic) are closely linked with HIV acquisition in the African American (AA) population. However, no interventions have been developed to address SAVA syndemic risk-reduction for currently HIV-negative but high-risk heterosexual AA couples in the United States (US). This application is focused on adapting and pretesting the feasibility and acceptability of a couple-based SAVA syndemic informed risk-reduction intervention for HIV-negative, AA heterosexual couples who report high-risk sexual behaviors, intimate partner violence (IPV, perpetration and/or victimization), and substance (drug) use. The proposed work builds on the results from a previous K01 award that developed an integrated IPV-HIV risk-reduction intervention among low-income urban abused women. Specifically, findings showed promising impact of the intervention, but also indicated the importance of expanding its scope to incorporate substance use and involve women’s steady partners in the intervention. The proposed research includes two specific aims focused on adapting a SAVA informed intervention for high-risk AA heterosexual couples (aim 1) and pilot testing the resulting HIV risk-reduction intervention (aim 2). The adaptation of the intervention will be guided by Cognitive-Behavioral Theory (CBT) with specific intervention elements drawn from Cognitive Behavioral Couple Therapy (CBCT) and Behavioral Activation (BA). Year 1 of the project will be focused on conducting key informant interviews with 30 AA couples who report high-risk sexual behaviors, IPV, and substance use and adapting the SAVA syndemic informed HIV risk-reduction intervention for AA couples. A portion of year 1 and year 2 of the project will involve a randomized clinical trial (RCT) with 40 AA couples randomized to the SAVA informed risk-reduction intervention (20) or treatment as usual (20) using a random allocation sequence of group assignments within blocks of 10 that will be created using SAS. Participants will complete pre- and 3-month post-intervention behavioral assessments to measure changes in condom use, IPV, and substance use and biological testing for STIs. Percentage of couples who consent to participate, intervention attendance, intervention satisfaction, revictimization due to study participation, and percentage of couples who return for 3-month follow-ups will be tracked to determine feasibility and acceptability of the adapted intervention. Given the disproportionate impact of HIV on AAs in the US, this study addresses a key gap in literature by adapting and testing the first SAVA informed risk-reduction intervention for high-risk, HIV-negative, heterosexual AA couples. It is expected that the proposed intervention will help in addressing a NIH and Office of AIDS Research (OAR) high priority research area, “to reduce health disparities in the incidence of new HIV infections” with its focus on a highly vulnerable and marginalized group in the US and co-occurring HIV-related risk factors among couples. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research is relevant to public health because it addresses a key gap in literature by adapting and testing the first SAVA informed risk-reduction intervention for high-risk, HIV-negative, heterosexual African American couples. This study aligns with the goals of the President’s National HIV/AIDS strategy, “to reduce HIV-related health disparities and health inequalities in communities at high-risk for HIV infection” and with the NIH and Office of AIDS Research (OAR) high priority research area, “to reduce health disparities in the incidence of new HIV infections.” The SAVA informed HIV risk-intervention can help to decrease heterosexual risk for HIV among African American couples, thereby reducing HIV-related racial and gender disparities in the US.","An integrated substance use, violence, and HIV/AIDS syndemic risk-reduction intervention for African American Couples",9535982,R03DA044866,"['Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immunologic Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immuno-Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency ', ' AIDS ', ' Behavior ', ' Communities ', ' Couples ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Drug abuse ', ' abuses drugs ', ' abuse of drugs ', ' Elements ', ' Goals ', ' HIV ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV Infections ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' HIV Seropositivity ', ' antigen positive AIDS test ', ' antibody positive AIDS test ', ' HTLV-III Seropositivity ', ' HTLV-III Seroconversion ', ' HIV antibody positive ', ' HIV Seroconversion ', ' HIV Positivity ', ' HIV Positive ', ' Anti-HIV Positivity ', ' AIDS Seropositivity ', ' AIDS Seroconversion ', ' Incidence ', ' Infection ', ' Interview ', ' Literature ', ' Mission ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Positive Reinforcements ', ' Public Health ', ' Publishing ', ' Random Allocation ', ' Random Selection ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Safety ', ' Sexual Partners ', ' sex partner ', ' Testing ', ' United States ', ' Vagina ', ' Vaginal ', ' Violence ', ' violent behavior ', ' violent ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Mediating ', ' Magazine ', ' Journals ', ' base ', ' career ', ' Area ', ' Randomized Clinical Trials ', ' Link ', ' using substances ', ' substance using ', ' substance use ', ' AOD use ', ' Alcohol or Other Drugs use ', ' satisfaction ', ' drug use ', ' Drug usage ', ' abuse of women ', ' abuse of females ', ' Abused women ', ' Abused females ', ' Battered Women ', ' Anal Sex ', ' Couples Therapy ', ' Research Priority ', ' Victimization ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' Test Result ', ' Unsafe Sex ', ' Unprotected Sex ', ' High-Risk Sex ', ' experience ', ' condoms ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Reporting ', ' AIDS/HIV problem ', ' HIV/AIDS problem ', ' HIV/AIDS ', ' AIDS/HIV ', ' HIV risk ', ' theories ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Risk Reduction ', ' Behavior assessment ', ' behavioral assessment ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' high risk sexual behavior ', ' risky sexual behavior ', ' high risk sexual activity ', ' high risk sex behavior ', ' high risk sex activity ', ' Low income ', ' Address ', ' Biological Testing ', ' Consent ', ' Data ', ' Mentored Research Scientist Development Award ', ' Research Scientist Development Award ', ' Mentored Training Award ', ' K01 Program ', ' K01 Mechanism ', ' K01 Award ', ' NIH Office of AIDS Research ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Cognitive ', ' Transmission ', ' transmission process ', ' Heterosexuals ', ' informant ', ' Behavioral ', ' post intervention ', ' sexual risk behavior ', ' sex risk ', ' intimate partner violence ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' high risk ', ' usual care ', ' treatment as usual ', ' revictimization ', ' health inequalities ', ' follow up assessment ', ' screening ', ' race disparity ', ' disparities in race ', ' racial disparity ', ' gender disparity ', ' recruit ', ' ']",NIDA,"UNIV OF MARYLAND, COLLEGE PARK",R03,2018,146309,0.004731504216790403
"Hypertensive Medication Adherence in Young African American Women Project Abstract Uncontrolled hypertension [HTN] due to poor blood pressure [BP] medication adherence in young and early middle age African American [AA] women is a leading contributor for the sustained hypertension disparities in the US. AA women in the US 20-44 years of age, have the highest prevalence of Hypertension [HTN] when compared to White women of the same age group. Uncontrolled HTN is a significant risk factor for stroke, heart failure, kidney disease, and early mortality, especially in this at-risk group. Barriers prohibiting BP medication adherence have been well characterized across the AA population except in young AA women who bear an unequal and different burden of stressors than older AA women. However, important underlying factors including HTN illness perceptions/representations, unique psychosocial factors including resilient coping, and their influence on good BP medication adherence have not been sufficiently studied among this vulnerable group. Evidence indicating that AAs acquire HTN at younger ages, are less adherent, and are more resistant to treatment compared to other ethnic groups provides a compelling impetus to identify positive and modifiable factors that contribute to BP medication adherence. The specific aims of this cross-sectional dissertation study are to examine the relationships among sociodemographic & clinical profiles, HTN illness perceptions, and BP medication adherence; and examine the relationships between psychosocial factors, resilient coping style, and BP medication adherence when controlling for sociodemographic factors in a sample of young hypertensive AA women. An exploratory aim will examine the relationship of resilient coping as a potential moderator of high or low adverse stress exposure and its effect on BP medication adherence to elicit understanding of variability in BP medication adherence among this subgroup of hypertensive women. A total of 110 AA women diagnosed with HTN, 18-45 years of age, will be recruited through an ongoing community health heart screening project which is targeting AA women diagnosed with HTN, at-risk for HTN, and other cardiovascular disease risk factors in a large southern urban setting. Descriptive, bivariate correlation, and logistic regression will be used for statistical analysis of the aims. Completion of the proposed study is the first step towards understanding the impact of modifiable factors such as HTN illness perceptions and resilient coping, and their impact on BP medication adherence in this vulnerable population. This study will provide important data to inform development and testing of effective and targeted interventions to reduce HTN disparities while improving health outcomes in a population predisposed to adverse cardiovascular events. Project Narrative Young and early middle age adult AA women represent a growing group of ethnic minority women diagnosed with hypertension in the United States. This study will examine novel constructs (HTN illness Perceptions and Resilient Coping) and psychosocial factors in relation to hypertension medication adherence to determine their importance in facilitating medication adherence in a population for whom limited information is known regarding factors associated with increased levels of medication adherence.

"Maintenance and Enhancement of the Atlanta African American Maternal-Child Cohort: Exposome Profiling via High-resolution Metabolomics and Integration of Microbiome-Metabolome-Epigenome Data PROJECT ABSTRACT Environmental exposures during the critical prenatal and early childhood periods can result in lifelong health consequences. Mechanisms underlying these exposure-health relationships are complex, with exogenous exposures (such as chemical toxicants) affecting endogenous processes (such as gene regulation and metabolism), which perturb metabolic pathways that lead to adverse health outcomes. Both adverse exposures and their health consequences disproportionately impact African American (AA) women and children, highlighting that health disparities begin in utero and are amplified postnatally. Among outcomes disproportionately experienced by AA children are preterm birth, neurodevelopmental deficits, and obesity – all linked to environmental exposures, yet poorly understood due to etiologic complexity. Our team is currently investigating preterm birth and neurodevelopment through 18-months in relation to pre- and postnatal exposures to environmental toxicants and biopsychosocial risk factors in cohorts of pregnant AA women (R01NR014800, R01MD009064) and their infants (R01MD009746) and via our P50 Children's Environmental Health Center (P50ES026071) in collaboration with the Emory HERCULES Exposome Research Center (P30 ES019776). We are also evaluating child obesity and neurodevelopment at 2-5 years of age under the Environmental Child Health Outcomes (ECHO) program (UG3OD023318). Through this R24 mechanism, we propose to: (1) Continue to enroll AA women at 8-14 wks' gestation, collect data at three time points during pregnancy, and engage delivered mother-child dyads in on-going postnatal follow-up studies to allow continued investigation of relationships between prenatal and early childhood exposures to chemical and non- chemical stressors and child health outcomes (Cohort Maintenance Aim); (2) Evaluate the performance of high-resolution mass spectrometry coupled with gas chromatography (GC-HRMS) for quantifying persistent organic pollutants (POPs) microliter serum volumes by comparing measured POP concentrations to those measured using conventional targeted analytic chemistry approaches in the same cohort (Resource Infrastructure – Exposure Characterization Aim); and (3) Adapt tools for multi-omic data integration to enable the display, visualization, and integration of comprehensive exposure assessment and biological effect data – to include chemical toxicant concentrations and metabolomic (KEGG pathway), epigenomic (gene methylation and expression), and microbiome data – and the analysis of associations with pregnancy and birth outcomes within our cohort and across cohort collaborations (Resource Infrastructure - Data Preparation Aim). Through this work, we expect to advance environmental health science around the assessment of chemical mixtures (with a focus on POPs) and their adverse preclinical (metabolic and epigenetic) health effects in our own high disparity population of pregnant women and newborns and to support other cohorts and cross-cohort collaborations involving the use of high-dimensional multi-omic data. PROJECT NARRATIVE By maintaining the Atlanta African American (AA) Maternal-Child Cohort and expanding its omic infrastructure to incorporate high-resolution mass spectrometry coupled with gas chromatography (GC-HRMS) and software tools to integrate multi-omic data, the proposed work will advance environmental health science around the assessment of chemical mixtures (with a focus on persistent organic pollutants [POPs]) and their preclinical health effects, including perturbation of metabolome, epigenome, and microbiome profiles. This work will maximize exposomic profiling within our own high disparity population of pregnant AA women and newborns, and will facilitate such approaches in other cohorts and cross-cohort collaborations.",Maintenance and Enhancement of the Atlanta African American Maternal-Child Cohort: Exposome Profiling via High-resolution Metabolomics and Integration of Microbiome-Metabolome-Epigenome Data,9581826,R24ES029490,"['Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Birth ', ' Parturition ', ' Blood Volume ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Analytical Chemistry ', ' Analytic Chemistry ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Gas Chromatography ', ' vapor phase chromatography ', ' Liquid Chromatography ', ' Data Analyses ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Environment ', ' Environmental Exposure ', ' Environmental Health ', ' Environmental Health Science ', ' Follow-Up Studies ', ' Followup Studies ', ' Gene Expression Regulation ', ' Gene Regulation Process ', ' Gene Regulation ', ' Gene Action Regulation ', ' Genes ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Infant ', ' Newborn Infant ', ' newborn children ', ' newborn child ', ' Newborns ', ' 0-4 weeks old ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Maintenance ', ' Metabolism ', ' Metabolic Processes ', ' Intermediary Metabolism ', ' Methylation ', ' Mothers ', ' Obesity ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Pesticides ', ' Phenols ', ' Hydroxybenzene ', ' Carbolic Acid ', ' Carbol ', ' Phenotype ', ' Polychlorinated Biphenyls ', ' polychlorobiphenyl ', ' Polychlorobiphenyl Compounds ', ' PCBs ', ' Pregnancy ', ' Gestation ', ' Pregnant Women ', ' pregnant mothers ', ' expecting mother ', ' expectant mother ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Smoking ', ' Software Tools ', ' Computer Software Tools ', ' Mass Spectrum Analysis ', ' Mass Spectrum Analyses ', ' Mass Spectrum ', ' Mass Spectroscopy ', ' Mass Spectrometry ', ' Mass Photometry/Spectrum Analysis ', ' Stress ', ' Time ', ' Toxic Environmental Substances ', ' environmental toxicant ', ' Toxic Environmental Agents ', ' Environmental Toxin ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' ranpirnase ', ' P30 Protein ', ' P30 ', ' P-30 Protein ', ' Measures ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' phthalates ', ' Premature Birth ', ' preterm delivery ', ' premature delivery ', ' premature childbirth ', ' Preterm Birth ', ' Prematurely delivering ', ' Pre-term birth ', ' Visualization ', ' Imagery ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Biological ', ' Link ', ' Chemicals ', ' Blood Serum ', ' Serum ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' Measurement ', ' R24 ', ' R-24 Monoclonal Antibody ', ' MoAb R24 ', ' Monoclonal Antibody R24 ', ' Collaborations ', ' Metabolic ', ' Exposure to ', ' tool ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Investigation ', ' milliliter ', ' Complex ', ' postnatal ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' stressor ', ' early childhood ', ' tandem mass spectrometry ', ' cohort ', ' toxicant ', ' neurodevelopment ', ' Neural Development ', ' prenatal ', ' unborn ', ' Toddler ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' Sampling ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Metabolic Pathway ', ' Etiology ', ' disease causation ', ' causation ', ' Causality ', ' metabolomics ', ' metabonomics ', ' metabolism measurement ', ' Data ', ' Mononuclear ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Resolution ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Epigenetic Mechanism ', ' Epigenetic Change ', ' Epigenetic ', ' Epigenetic Process ', ' Preparation ', ' Process ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' urinary ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socio-economically ', ' socio-economic ', ' socioeconomics ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' in utero ', ' preclinical ', ' pre-clinical ', ' microbiome ', ' epigenomics ', ' data integration ', ' Neurodevelopmental Deficit ', ' biopsychosocial ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Coupled ', ' toxic exposure ', ' Toxicant exposure ', ' five years of age ', ' five year old ', ' age 5 years ', ' 5 years of age ', ' 5 year old ', ' chlorinated hydrocarbon pesticide ', ' organochlorine pesticide ', ' pregnant ', ' adverse consequence ', ' adverse outcome ', ' epigenome ', ' persistent organic pollutants ', ' multi-omics ', ' multiple omics ', ' metabolic profile ', ' metabonome ', ' metabolome ', ' neonatal outcome ', ' polybrominated diphenyl ether ', ' high dimensionality ', ' Child Health ', ' ']",NIEHS,EMORY UNIVERSITY,R24,2018,388428,0.06883822574120756
"Inter-relationship between microbiota diversity, obesity and race in endometrial cancer PROJECT SUMMARY  Obesity and insulin resistance are factors associated with increased risk for and worse outcomes from endometrial cancer (EC). African American (AA) women suffer a higher mortality from EC than Caucasian (CAU) women, and this may be in part due to greater rates of both obesity and diabetes among AA versus CAU patients. Given that the gut microbiome differs by race and has been implicated in the underlying biology of both obesity and cancer, bacteria in the gut and uterus may be logical contributing causes for the racial and obesity disparities seen for EC. A significant gap in our knowledge is that the microbiota of the malignant uterus has not been previously characterized. We hypothesize that the EC microbiota exists, differs by obesity and race status and contributes to the pathogenesis of EC.  In our LKB1fl/flp53fl/fl mouse model of endometrioid EC, diet-induced obesity promoted tumor progression, resulting in a doubling of tumor size. Metabolomic profiling revealed significant differences between the ECs in obese versus lean mice, including enhanced energy metabolism and increased gut- microbiome associated metabolites in obese mice. The diabetes drug metformin had heightened efficacy in obese mice, via reversal of the detrimental effects that obesity had on both the gut microbiome and upregulation of energy metabolism. Our pilot study foundational for this grant proposal assessed the microbiota in 21 early stage endometrioid ECs of women and found that bacteria exist in the uterus of the post- menopausal woman. EC microbiota diversity was greater in the tumors of AA versus CAU women, and tumor microbiota profiles were distinct between ECs of obese and lean women. A phase 0 clinical trial of metformin in obese EC patients showed that response to metformin (defined as a decrease in tumor cell proliferation) aligned with greater impact on gut microbiome-associated metabolites. Thus, our preliminary work in both mice and women support a potential critical link between obesity, race, the microbiome and EC.  Thus, using our clinically relevant genetically engineered mouse model of obese EC, we will determine in Specific Aim 1 if the microbiota profiles differ between the normal and malignant endometrium in obese and lean post-menopausal, ovariectomized mice. In parallel, in Specific Aim 2 we will expand on our pilot study and assess if the microbiota differ between ECs of non-obese and obese post-menopausal AA and CAU women (N=160 total, 40 per group). Metabolomic profiling will be performed on the ECs from mice and women so as to elicit corresponding function related to obesity- and race-driven differences in the uterine microbiota. Overlay in the techniques of microbiota and metabolomic profiling as well as cross-species comparisons will facilitate discovery of the mechanisms of differing bacterial presence that occur with obesity and AA race in EC. This will potentially lead to microbiota-directed therapies and risk-reducing strategies that will improve outcomes for AA EC patients, which is a public health goal that aligns with the mission of the NIH/NCI. PROJECT NARRATIVE Although perturbations in the racially-influenced gut microbiome may partially underlie the obesity-cancer link, the impact of bacterial presence and function in the uterus on racial- and obesity-driven disparities in endometrial cancer has not been previously explored. Thus, we will delineate the inter-relationship between obesity, race and the microbiota of the uterus through our clinically relevant genetically engineered mouse model of obesity-driven endometrial cancer and in banked human endometrial cancer specimens from obese/non-obese and racially diverse women, as a means to discover if the microbiome contributes to the disparate outcomes in African-American women. Ultimately, we hope to develop microbiota-directed therapies and risk-reducing strategies to overcome the growing public health concern of disparities in endometrial cancer outcomes among African-American women.","Inter-relationship between microbiota diversity, obesity and race in endometrial cancer",9571217,R21CA220269,"['Bacteria ', ' Benzoates ', ' Biology ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Diet ', ' dietary ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Endometrial Neoplasms ', ' Neoplasm of the Endometrium ', ' Endometrium Tumor ', ' Endometrial Tumor ', ' Endometrium ', ' Energy Metabolism ', ' Energy Expenditure ', ' Foundations ', ' Goals ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' treatment access ', ' health services availability ', ' health service access ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' accessibility to health services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Access to Care ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Insulin Resistance ', ' insulin resistant ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lipid Peroxidation ', ' Metformin ', ' N,N-dimethyl-imidodicarbonimidic diamide ', ' Dimethylguanylguanidine ', ' Dimethylbiguanidine ', ' Obese Mice ', ' ob/ob mouse ', ' Mission ', ' mortality ', ' Mus ', ' Murine ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Mice ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' Obesity ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Oxidative Phosphorylation ', ' Oxidative Phosphorylation Pathway ', ' Patients ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Play ', ' Public Health ', ' resistance factors ', ' R Plasmids ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Research Proposals ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Thinness ', ' Leanness ', ' Time ', ' Up-Regulation ', ' Upregulation ', ' Uterus ', ' womb ', ' Weight ', ' Caucasians ', ' white race ', ' Occidental ', ' Caucasoid Race ', ' Caucasoid ', ' Caucasian Race ', ' Caucasian ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' neoplastic progression ', ' neoplasm progression ', ' cancer progression ', ' tumor progression ', ' Clinical ', ' Malignant ', ' Malignant -

"Georgia CaRes DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Georgia Regents University (GRU) has been home to Georgia's only NCI MB-CCOP since 2004. With its affiliate site, University Cancer & Blood Center (UCBC), GRU has enrolled nearly 800 patients to NCI clinical trials: 39% of them African American (AA) and other minorities, with accrual split between treatment trials (48%) and prevention and control trials (52%). Building on this successful track record, GRU Cancer Center (GRUCC) and UCBC are joining forces with Morehouse School of Medicine (MSM) and the Jiann-Ping Hsu College of Public Health (JPHCOPH) at Georgia Southern University to become the NCORP Minority/Underserved Community Site for Georgia. The need to sustain and grow an NCORP that focuses on minority and underserved populations in Georgia is great. Georgia has some of the nation's worst cancer disparities, particularity between African Americans (AA) and Caucasians (CA) and between rural and urban populations. The disparities are glaring for some of the most common cancers. Not only do AA men in Georgia have the highest rate of prostate cancer among AA men in the country, they are almost twice as likely to be diagnosed with the disease as CA men in Georgia and three times as likely to die from it. In Georgia, AA women die of breast cancer 25% more often than CA women, and AA die of colorectal cancer 45% more than CA. The Specific Aims of the proposed NCORP M/U site for Georgia are to: 1) Implement a NCORP M/U Site for Georgia that meets or exceeds all NCI requirements; 2) Contribute to the design, conduct and translation of the national NCORP research agenda, particularity studies that pertain to minority and underserved populations; and 3) expand patient and provider access to-and enrollment/participation in-cancer prevention, control, imaging, treatment and screening/post-surveillance clinical trials and cancer care delivery research throughout Georgia, particularly for minority and underserved populations in urban and rural settings. Key sub-aims include the implementation of a leadership development program to cultivate the next generation of NCORP investigators and leaders and engagement to key stakeholders and community partners in all aspects of the NCORP research agenda. Georgia represents a unique opportunity to pursue research directed towards cancer disparities and to affect  minority and underserved communities' accrual to clinical trials and cancer care delivery research studies.  30% of its 9.9M residents are AA (vs. 12% in the U.S.) and 75% of its counties are rural, most of them  medically underserved.

"Molecular determinant of racial disparity in prostate cancer DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Significant disparity in the incidence and clinical outcome of prostate cancer (PCa) exist between African- American (AA) men and their European American (EA) counterparts. Despite this recognition, we have not made a major leap in our understanding of the molecular causes associated with such disparity. This proposal is built upon our strong preliminary data on a proto-oncogene, Myb, which has remained largely unexplored in PCa. Our novel findings demonstrate that 1) Myb expression is significantly elevated in AA PCa with greater overall incidence as compared to EA PCa, 2) low intensity expression of Myb is also detected in some of the benign prostate tissues (BPH) from AA patients, while no expression is detected in EA BPH, 3) AA PCa cell lines (MDaPCa-2b and RC-77/T) exhibit high Myb expression and significant resistance to hormone-depletion and docetaxel (DTX) toxicity, 4) AA PCa cells also display high growth, migratory and invasive potential, which is associated with Myb overexpression, and 5) Myb interacts with AR and modulates the expression of androgen-responsive gene, KLK3/PSA, suggesting their cooperative role in gene regulation. Based on these promising findings, we hypothesize that relative greater incidence and overall expression of Myb in AA PCa cells underlies their inherently greater propensity to metastasize and evade therapeutic intervention. To test this hypothesis, we are proposing three specific aims. In aim 1, we will investigate the role of Myb in PCa aggressiveness and therapy-resistance. Using luciferase-tagged, Myb-overexpressing or -silenced, paired AA and EA PCa cell lines, we will examine the functional association of Myb with PCa growth and metastasis, and their response to castration- and docetaxel- therapies in an orthotopic mouse model. In Aim 2, we will examine the functional consequences of Myb-AR interaction and identify their downstream consequences. We will specifically examine whether Myb has a role in AR localization and transcriptional activation. Furthermore, we will assess the effect of Myb on transcriptional reprogramming of AR by using state of the art RNA-Seq and ChIP-Seq approaches. We will determine the shared and independent targets of Myb and AR in PCa cells and examine if Myb alters AR target gene specificity. In Aim 3, we will determine the clinical relevance of Myb in racial disparity associated with PCa. We will perform immunohistochemical (IHC) analysis to assess Myb and AR expression and localization (cytoplasmic vs. nuclear) in PCa, adjacent BPH, and uninvolved normal tissues from both AA and EA cases. We will then examine their correlation (alone and in combination) with race, tumor grade, metastasis incidence, PSA levels, and patient's survival. Together, these studies will provide experimental, mechanistic and clinical evidence for the role of Myb in aggressive behavior and therapeutic- resistance of PCa, and support the association of Myb with observed racial disparity. In the long-term, the resulting information will be useful in reducing the racial disparities in clinical outcomes of PCa by establishing the clinical utility of Myb as a risk predictor and/or therapeutic target for effective disease management. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Main barrier in achieving progress toward racial disparities reduction in prostate cancer is our limited understanding of the underlying molecular basis. The proposed research will examine the functional and clinical significance of Myb overexpression in prostate cancer aggressiveness and therapeutic resistance, the two major reasons for the poor clinical outcome of African American (AA) patients. The outcomes of our study will allow distinction between clinically indolent and aggressive prostate tumors, and pave the way for novel target-based therapies, which will ultimately reduce the enhanced burden of prostate cancer on African American population and improve overall survival of prostate cancer patients.",Molecular determinant of racial disparity in prostate cancer,9476951,U01CA185490,"['Affect ', ' Aggressive behavior ', ' Aggression ', ' Castration ', ' Surgical Castration ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Exhibits ', ' Gene Expression Regulation ', ' Gene Regulation Process ', ' Gene Regulation ', ' Gene Action Regulation ', ' Genes ', ' Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Hormones ', ' Therapeutic Hormone ', ' Endocrine Gland Secretion ', ' Incidence ', ' Ligands ', ' Luciferases ', ' Luciferase Immunologic ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' mortality ', ' Neoplasm Metastasis ', ' tumor cell metastasis ', ' cancer metastasis ', ' Secondary Tumor ', ' Secondary Neoplasm ', ' Metastatic Tumor ', ' Metastatic Neoplasm ', ' Metastatic Mass ', ' Metastatic Lesion ', ' Metastasize ', ' Metastasis ', ' Patients ', ' Play ', ' Prostate ', ' Prostatic Gland ', ' Prostate Gland ', ' Prostatic Neoplasms ', ' Prostatic Neoplasia ', ' Prostate Tumor ', ' Prostate Neoplasms ', ' Proto-Oncogenes ', ' protooncogene ', ' c-ONC ', ' Cellular Oncogene ', ' Publishing ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Androgen Receptor ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Socioeconomic Factors ', ' Specificity ', ' T-Lymphocyte ', ' thymus derived lymphocyte ', ' Thymus-Dependent Lymphocytes ', ' T-Cells ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Prostate-Specific Antigen ', ' hK3 Kallikrein ', ' gamma-Seminoprotein ', ' Seminin ', ' Semenogelase ', ' Prostate Specific Antigen Preproprotein ', ' Plasma Prekallikrein ', ' Plasma Kallikrein Precursor ', ' P-30 Antigen ', ' Kallikrein 3 ', ' EC 3.4.21.34 ', ' Transcription Activation ', ' Transcriptional Activation ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Benign ', ' Clinical ', ' Refractory ', ' Malignant ', ' Malignant - descriptor ', ' insight ', ' Indolent ', ' European ', ' Gene Targeting ', ' docetaxol ', ' Taxotere ', ' docetaxel ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Normal tissue morphology ', ' Normal Tissue ', ' Malignant neoplasm of prostate ', ' Prostatic Cancer ', ' Prostate Cancer ', ' Prostate CA ', ' Malignant prostatic tumor ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Prostate ', ' Disease Management ', ' Disorder Management ', ' PSA level ', ' Frequencies ', ' Nuclear ', ' American ', ' receptor expression ', ' Toxic effect ', ' Toxicities ', ' novel ', ' disease classification ', ' nosology ', ' disorder classification ', ' Modality ', ' Pathogenesis ', ' Reporting ', ' Therapeutic Intervention ', ' intervention therapy ', ' response ', ' RNA Interference ', ' Sequence-Specific Posttranscriptional Gene Silencing ', ' RNAi ', ' RNA Silencing ', ' Quelling ', ' Posttranscriptional Gene Silencing ', ' Post-Transcriptional Gene Silencing ', ' Tissue Sample ', ' KLK3 gene ', ' KLKB1 ', ' KLK3 ', ' Data ', ' Disease Marker ', ' Receptor Signaling ', ' Cancer Patient ', ' Characteristics ', ' Molecular ', ' Process ', ' treatment resistance ', ' therapeutic resistance ', ' resistant to therapy ', ' resistance to therapy ', ' therapy resistant ', ' vector ', ' knockdown ', ' knock-down ', ' LNCaP ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' disparity in cancer ', ' cancer disparity ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' resistant ', ' Resistance ', ' clinical relevance ', ' clinically relevant ', ' clinical significance ', ' clinically significant ', ' murine model ', ' mouse model ', ' therapeutic target ', ' tumor ', ' overexpress ', ' over-expression ', ' overexpression ', ' public health relevance ', ' chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequencing ', ' ChIP Sequencing ', ' ChIP-seq ', ' RNAseq ', ' RNA sequencing ', ' RNA Seq ', ' transcriptome sequencing ', ' prostate tumor cell ', ' prostate cancer cell ', ' race disparity ', ' disparities in race ', ' racial disparity ', ' prostate cancer cell line ', ' reduce disparity ', ' disparity reduction ', ' androgen responsive ', ' androgen dependent ', ' androgen sensitive ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH ALABAMA,U01,2018,314363,-0.042979467301040394
"Analysis of Racial Disparities in HCC by Systems Metabolomics ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a significant health problem in the United States. Compared to European Americans (EA), the incidence of HCC is higher in African Americans (AA) and is associated with more advanced tumor stage at diagnosis and lower survival rates. It has been reported that the sensitivity of α- fetoprotein (AFP) for the diagnosis of HCC in African Americans with hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is lower than that of patients of all other racial groups combined. We previously performed preliminary investigation into racial disparities through metabolomics profiling of sera from HCC cases and patients with liver cirrhosis by using both liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Through stratified analysis of the LC/GC-MS data, we identified different candidates that distinguish HCC cases from the cirrhotic controls among AA and EA. This application builds on these promising preliminary results to find and validate race-specific metabolites as biomarkers for HCC. This will be accomplished by targeted analysis of metabolites in liver tissues and sera from HCC cases and patients with liver cirrhosis representing AA and EA. Metabolites that differentiate HCC cases from cirrhotic controls in a race-specific manner will be selected by statistical and network-based methods. Then, a systems-oriented approach that combines these metabolites with other candidate biomarkers (genes, glycans, and proteins) will be utilized for the selection of key signaling pathways perturbed in HCC. Following validation of the candidates via independent samples from HCC cases, patients with liver cirrhosis, and healthy subjects, we will elucidate their functional roles through both in vitro and in vivo experiments. Successful completion of this research will enable us to identify HCC biomarkers and perturbed pathways that are race-specific as well as those that are shared by AA and EA. These findings will contribute not only to a greater understanding of racial disparities in HCC but also to improving diagnosis of HCC through race-specific biomarkers. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Currently used biomarkers for detecting hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in high-risk cirrhotic patients lack the desired sensitivity and specificity, particularly in African American patients. The goal of this project is to find and validate race-specific biomarkers for HCC and identify perturbed intercellular signaling pathways in HCC. If successful, the study will (1) contribute to a greater understanding of racial disparities in HCC, (2) enable accurate detection of HCC by using race as a factor, and (3) give insights into the mechanisms underlying the behavior of potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets.",Analysis of Racial Disparities in HCC by Systems Metabolomics,9527764,U01CA185188,"['alpha-Fetoproteins ', ' α-Fetoproteins ', ' Fetuins ', ' Alpha-Fetoglobulin ', ' Alpha-1-Fetoprotein ', ' Behavior ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Cell Line ', ' cultured cell line ', ' Strains Cell Lines ', ' CellLine ', ' Neoplastic Cell Transformation ', ' neoplastic transformation ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Gas Chromatography ', ' vapor phase chromatography ', ' Clinical Markers ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Enzymes ', ' Enzyme Gene ', ' Genes ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Hepatitis C ', ' non-A, non-B hepatitis ', ' non A, non B hepatitis ', ' hepatitis non A non B ', ' hep C ', ' Hepatitus C ', ' Hepatitis, Viral, Non-A, Non-B, Parenterally-Transmitted ', ' Hepatitis C virus infection ', ' HCV infection ', ' Primary carcinoma of the liver cells ', ' liver carcinoma ', ' Liver Cells Carcinoma ', ' Hepatoma ', ' Hepatocellular cancer ', ' Hepatocellular Carcinoma ', ' Hepatocarcinoma ', ' University Hospitals ', ' In Vitro ', ' Incidence ', ' Liver ', ' hepatic organ system ', ' hepatic body system ', ' Liver Cirrhosis ', ' Hepatic Cirrhosis ', ' Mass Fragmentography ', ' mass fragmentometry ', ' ion trap mass spectrometry ', ' Mass-Gas Chromatography Spectrum Analysis ', ' Mass-Gas Chromatography Spectrometry ', ' Mass Fragmentographies ', ' Gas-Liquid-Mass Spectrometry Chromatography ', ' GCMS ', ' GC MS ', ' Methods ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Polysaccharides ', ' Glycans ', ' Proteins ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Research ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Sensitivity and Specificity ', ' Signal Pathway ', ' Mass Spectrum Analysis ', ' Mass Spectrum Analyses ', ' Mass Spectrum ', ' Mass Spectroscopy ', ' Mass Spectrometry ', ' Mass Photometry/Spectrum Analysis ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Survival Rate ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' United States ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Biological ', ' Biochemical ', ' Chemicals ', ' Liver Cells ', ' Hepatic Parenchymal Cell ', ' Hepatic Cells ', ' Hepatocyte ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' European ', ' participant recruitment ', ' Patient Recruitments ', ' Investigation ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' Xenograft procedure ', ' xeno-transplantation ', ' xeno-transplant ', ' Xenotransplantation ', ' Xenograft ', ' Heterologous Transplantation ', ' Heterograft ', ' American ', ' Cell Proliferation ', ' Cellular Proliferation ', ' Cell Multiplication ', ' Cell Growth in Number ', ' Performance ', ' Participant ', ' ethnic difference ', ' ethnicity difference ', ' Reporting ', ' Gene Proteins ', ' Protein Gene Products ', ' Pathway Analysis ', ' Network Analysis ', ' Sampling ', ' Proteomics ', ' liquid chromatography mass spectrometry ', ' LC/MS ', ' Metabolic Pathway ', ' Tumor stage ', ' T-Stage ', ' metabolomics ', ' metabonomics ', ' metabolism measurement ', ' AFP gene ', ' HPAFP ', ' FETA ', ' AFP ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Stage at Diagnosis ', ' in vivo ', ' Validation ', ' Preparation ', ' cirrhotic ', ' Cirrhosis ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' risk prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' prediction model ', ' computer based prediction ', ' predictive modeling ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' transcriptomics ', ' Network-based ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' healthy volunteer ', ' therapeutic target ', ' network models ', ' high risk ', ' public health relevance ', ' population based ', ' candidate biomarker ', ' candidate marker ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' Biological Markers ', ' cancer initiation ', ' candidate validation ', ' race disparity ', ' disparities in race ', ' racial disparity ', ' potential biological marker ', ' potential biomarker ', ' multi-omics ', ' multiple omics ', ' specific biomarkers ', ' ethnically diverse ', ' ethnic diversity ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' experimental study ', ' recruit ', ' marker validation ', ' biomarker validation ', ' ']",NCI,GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY,U01,2018,255915,0.0776127873449452
"The role of resilience in addressing racial disparities in adverse HIV-related outcomes Project Summary/Abstract  In the United States (U.S.), African Americans/Blacks (AAs) are the racial/ethnic group most adversely impacted by the HIV epidemic. As such, one of the goals of the White House National HIV/AIDS Strategy is to permanently reduce long-standing health disparities in HIV disease. Lower HIV clinic attendance and suboptimal antiretroviral therapy (ART) use (i.e., initiation, modification, and adherence) by AAs are likely the main mediators of continually worse HIV virologic responses among AAs compared to Caucasians. However, despite the development and implementation of interventions targeting many known individual-level risk and protective factors for clinic attendance and ART use, substantial racial disparities remain. Persistent disparities may be due, in part, to the adverse conditions that characterize the high risk neighborhood environments (e.g., socioeconomic deprivation and violence) in which HIV+ AAs disproportionately reside. However, despite such adversities some AAs demonstrate resilience (i.e., displaying positive behaviors/outcomes despite adversity) which may be critical to reducing persistent racial disparities. Compared to the risk environment, individual, interpersonal, and neighborhood resilience represent novel and more malleable intervention targets for reducing persistent disparities. Unfortunately, resilience remains understudied in the HIV literature, perhaps due to the absence of a reliable and valid resilience measure for HIV+ adults that captures all resilience components. The objective of the proposed research is to develop a reliable and valid measure of individual, interpersonal, and neighborhood resilience; to document its psychometric properties; and to assess longitudinally whether higher resilience facilitates positive HIV outcomes among HIV+ AAs by the level of the risk environment. Data on HIV+ AAs enrolled in the UNC CFAR HIV Clinical Cohort and the UAB 1917 Clinic Cohort will be used for the proposed study. Specifically, this study aims to (1) use advanced concept mapping, which is a mixed methods approach, to generate items that capture all components of resilience; (2) perform psychometric testing of concept mapping items to create a reliable and valid resilience measure that includes all components of resilience; (3a) examine whether resilience and non-resilience individual-level factors (e.g., alcohol/drug use, mental illness, and health insurance) are prospectively associated with HIV outcomes (e.g., clinic attendance, ART adherence, and virologic suppression) by the level of the neighborhood risk environment; and (3b) assess for interactions between resilience and non-resilience individual-level factors by the level of the risk environment. This study responds to the critical need to develop a multi-component resilience measure for HIV+ adults and to establish whether resilience facilitates positive HIV outcomes among HIV+ AAs. Our important findings may lead to the development and implementation of novel multilevel resilience-related interventions to reduce persistent racial disparities in HIV disease. Project Narrative  This innovative project will determine whether resilience facilitates positive HIV outcomes among HIV+ African American/Black (AA) adults in the United States (U.S.) by the level of the neighborhood risk environment. Completing this work will provide critical evidence about the relationship between resilience and HIV outcomes among HIV+ AAs from two longitudinal HIV clinic cohort studies. Such critical evidence is necessary to justify the investment of limited resources into developing interventions targeted at enhancing resilience among AAs to (a) reduce persistent HIV racial disparities in the U.S. and (b) help achieve the goals of the White House National HIV/AIDS Strategy.",The role of resilience in addressing racial disparities in adverse HIV-related outcomes,9549135,R01MH112386,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Alcohols ', ' Alcohol Chemical Class ', ' Behavior ', ' Mental disorders ', ' psychological disorder ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Buffers ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Environment ', ' Epidemic ', ' Ethnic group ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Family ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' HIV ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV Seropositivity ', ' antigen positive AIDS test ', ' antibody positive AIDS test ', ' HTLV-III Seropositivity ', ' HTLV-III Seroconversion ', ' HIV antibody positive ', ' HIV Seroconversion ', ' HIV Positivity ', ' HIV Positive ', ' Anti-HIV Positivity ', ' AIDS Seropositivity ', ' AIDS Seroconversion ', ' Health Insurance ', ' health insurance plan ', ' Investments ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Literature ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Methods ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Persons ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Psychometrics ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Testing ', ' United States ', ' Violence ', ' violent behavior ', ' violent ', ' virology ', ' Caucasians ', ' white race ', ' Occidental ', ' Caucasoid Race ', ' Caucasoid ', ' Caucasian Race ', ' Caucasian ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Mediating ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' Failure ', ' Individual ', ' drug use ', ' Drug usage ', ' Research Priority ', ' Clinic ', ' experience ', ' cohort ', ' novel ', ' AIDS/HIV problem ', ' HIV/AIDS problem ', ' HIV/AIDS ', ' AIDS/HIV ', ' Sampling ', ' Property ', ' response ', ' deprivation ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' therapy adherence ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Address ', ' Adherence ', ' Data ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Modification ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socio-economically ', ' socio-economic ', ' socioeconomics ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' antiretroviral treatment ', ' anti-retroviral treatment ', ' anti-retroviral therapy ', ' antiretroviral therapy ', ' resilience ', ' Outcome ', ' Prevalence ', ' prospective ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' high risk ', ' race disparity ', ' disparities in race ', ' racial disparity ', ' behavior outcome ', ' behavioral outcome ', ' concept maps ', ' concept mapping ', ' protective factors ', ' ']",NIMH,BROWN UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,684725,0.0633305176792059
"The Role of The Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System, ARMC5, and Neprilysin in Glucose Metabolism among African Americans PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Joshua J. Joseph, MD, is an Assistant Professor in the Division of Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism at The Ohio State University. Dr. Joseph seeks a Mentored Patient- Oriented Research Career Development Award in order to obtain the skills, knowledge, and mentored research experience that are essential for a career as a clinician scientist in the field of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) prevention. This proposal is aimed at determining the role of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) in glucose metabolism and the development of T2DM among African Americans (AAs). AAs are 1.7 times as likely to develop T2DM in the US and are twice as likely to die from T2DM compared to non-Hispanic whites. Thus, this represents an area of critical need. The objectives of this proposal are to determine the role of the RAAS, endothelin-1, ARMC5 (armadillo repeat containing 5) and RAAS antagonism in glucose metabolism and the development of diabetes. The specific aims of this research proposal are: (1) to determine the associations of aldosterone and endothelin-1, individually and combined, with HOMA-insulin resistance, HOMA-β cell function, fasting plasma glucose and incident T2DM among AAs without T2DM at baseline in the Jackson Heart Study (JHS); (2) to determine a) the cross-sectional associations of predicted damaging ARMC5 mutations with plasma aldosterone, plasma renin activity, fasting glucose, and prevalent T2DM and b) the longitudinal association with incident T2DM among AAs in the JHS; (3) to determine the impact of RAAS antagonism or RAAS and neprilysin antagonism vs. placebo with changes in glucose metabolism over 6 months assessed via glucose clamp studies among AAs. For Aim 1, we propose predictive epidemiological analyses in the JHS, an observational investigation of cardiovascular disease among AAs, to determine the association of a combination of aldosterone and endothelin-1 with glucose metabolism, prevalent and incident T2DM. For Aim 2, we propose genetic analyses in the JHS, to determine the association of ARMC5 genetic variants with components of glucose metabolism, prevalent and incident T2DM. For Aim 3, we propose a 26- week clinical trial to test the effect of RAAS antagonism on β-cell function and insulin resistance in AAs with impaired glucose tolerance. The goals during the award period include developing expertise in the design, performance, analysis and presentation of clinical research through mentored research, didactic coursework, and formal training in clinical investigation of glucose metabolism, clinical trial methodology, genetic, genomic and other –omic analytic techniques and predictive/causal modeling. Long-term career goals include developing a career as an independent investigator focused on finding new approaches for preventing and treating T2DM, particularly among historically understudied populations in biomedical research. The proposed research aims to provide new insights into the contribution of the RAAS to changes in glucose metabolism in the development of T2DM. This work will lay the foundation to develop novel therapeutic targets for T2DM. PROJECT NARRATIVE African Americans have a higher prevalence, incidence and mortality from type 2 diabetes mellitus compared to non-Hispanic whites. The proposed research aims to investigate the role of the renin-angiotensin- aldosterone system in glucose metabolism and the development of type 2 diabetes among African Americans. This work will inform efforts to find new therapeutic targets for type 2 diabetes prevention to reduce racial/ethnic disparities in type 2 diabetes.","The Role of The Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone

"Everyone at the Table: A State of the Science Symposium to Identify Evidence-Based Approaches to Increasing Participation of African American Men in Cancer Research The proposed symposium, “Everyone at the Table: A State of the Science Symposium to Identify Evidence- Based Approaches to Increasing Participation of African American Men in Cancer Research,” seeks to better understand the underrepresentation of AA men in colorectal (CRC) and prostate cancer research studies. Prostate and CRC cancer health disparities exact a tremendous toll on AA men across the cancer continuum from prevention and screening through treatment and survivorship. Though these disparities in outcomes such as stage at diagnosis, functional status, and morbidity are already significant, the continued underrepresentation of AA men in prostate and CRC research studies could further widen these disparities. As new horizons for novel treatment approaches, such as personalized medicine, are explored, inadequate representation of AA men could both limit the generalizability of important research studies and limit opportunities to elucidate mechanisms for existing disparities. Therefore, we seek to bring together a diverse group of stakeholders including AA males from the community, health care providers, community partners, and multidisciplinary researchers from across a variety of research settings to together to achieve the following Specific Aims: (1) To systematically review the extant scientific literature related to the recruitment and retention of AA men in CRC and prostate cancer research studies, with a specific focus on how social determinants of health impacts research participation; (2) To critically evaluate the research literature and achieve consensus on the best practices related to the recruitment and retention of AA men in cancer-related research and identify gaps in knowledge where additional research is needed; and (3) To accelerate the dissemination of evidence-based recruitment and retention practices that effectively engage AA men in cancer- related research. Prior to the symposium, invited experts will review and summarize the scientific literature related to the recruitment and retention of AA males in CRC and prostate cancer research studies. Symposium attendees will review the summation prior to the meeting to facilitate a critical evaluation of the scientific literature (Day One). Attendees with then identify best practices in engaging AA males in cancer clinical research studies, generate evidence-based guidance for investigators recruiting and retaining AA males in clinical research studies, and identify research needed to advance our understanding of recruitment and retention of AA males to cancer research studies (Day Two). Symposium findings will be broadly disseminated to equip cancer researchers, healthcare providers, and community residents with the information and tools needed to optimize the recruitment and retention of AA males. The proposed conference, “Everyone at the Table: A State of the Science Symposium to Identify Evidence- Based Approaches to Increasing Participation of African American Men in Cancer Research,” provides an exceptional opportunity to advance our understanding of the best ways to engage African American men in prostate and colorectal cancer research studies . Research scientists, leaders from community-based organizations, and lay community residents will convene to critically evaluate the scientific literature and identify best practices for the recruitment and retention of African American men in cancer research studies. The conference findings and resultant guidance on AA male recruitment should assist scientists and lay research partners alike in their collective efforts to ensure adequate AA male representation in cancer research s tudies .",Everyone at the Table: A State of the Science Symposium to Identify Evidence-Based Approaches to Increasing Participation of African American Men in Cancer Research,9613175,R13MD012439,"['Automobile Driving ', ' driving ', ' Bronchi ', ' Budgets ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Communities ', ' Statistical Data Interpretation ', ' statistical analysis ', ' Statistical Data Analysis ', ' Statistical Data Analyses ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health Personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health workforce ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Incidence ', ' Life Expectancy ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Literature ', ' Lung ', ' pulmonary ', ' Lung Respiratory System ', ' male ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' Probability ', ' Prostate ', ' Prostatic Gland ', ' Prostate Gland ', ' Publishing ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Science ', ' survivorship ', ' Translations ', ' Woman ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Community Healthcare ', ' Community Health Care ', ' symposium ', ' symposia ', ' summit ', ' convention ', ' conference ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' Area ', ' Ensure ', ' Evaluation ', ' insight ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Glare ', ' Review Literature ', ' Shapes ', ' tool ', ' Consensus ', ' Malignant neoplasm of prostate ', ' Prostatic Cancer ', ' Prostate Cancer ', ' Prostate CA ', ' Malignant prostatic tumor ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Prostate ', ' Multimedia ', ' Multimedium ', ' Knowledge ', ' Scientist ', ' Country ', ' interest ', ' Colorectal ', ' colorectum ', ' colo-rectal ', ' Colon or Rectum ', ' meetings ', ' functional status ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' member ', ' research study ', ' racial difference ', ' race differences ', ' Prevention ', ' Reporting ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Address ', ' High Prevalence ', ' Stage at Diagnosis ', ' Strategic Planning ', ' Subgroup ', ' survive cancer ', ' Cancer Survivor ', ' Scientific Evaluation ', ' trend ', ' sex ', ' Colo-rectal Cancer ', ' Colorectal Cancer ', ' systematic review ', ' years of life lost to disease ', ' years of life lost to disability ', ' disease burden ', ' burden of disease ', ' burden of illness ', ' cancer research ', ' anti-cancer research ', ' anticancer research ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' disparity in cancer ', ' cancer disparity ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' ethnic minority ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' community organizations ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' evidence base ', ' social health determinants ', ' screening ', ' personalized treatment ', ' personalized therapy ', ' personalization of treatment ', ' personalized medicine ', ' race disparity ', ' disparities in race ', ' racial disparity ', ' Minority Participation ', ' recruiting minorities ', ' Minority Recruitment ', ' Scientific Inquiry ', ' racial minority ', ' recruit ', ' obstacle to healthcare ', ' obstacle to care ', ' barrier to treatment ', ' barrier to healthcare ', ' barrier to health care ', ' barrier to care ', ' ']",NIMHD,UNIVERSITY OF TENNESSEE HEALTH SCI CTR,R13,2018,49994,-0.0016648401454322753
"Enhancing Glaucoma Medication Adherence Among African Americans ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Glaucoma is the leading cause of irreversible blindness among African Americans (AA) who are more than three times more likely to develop glaucoma when compared to Caucasians. Changes associated with the progression of glaucoma can have a serious negative impact on an individual's quality of life, independence, and everyday functioning. Accumulating research indicates that pressure-reducing eye drops can significantly delay or prevent the onset of disease; however, such preventative efforts have been found to be limited due to problems with poor medication adherence. Lacking are available health promotion interventions that minimize this important health disparity. Thus, in our research program, we demonstrated this health disparity for glaucoma medication adherence (Dreer et al., 2012). Next, we conducted several follow-up studies in order to develop a culturally relevant and informed, health promotion-based intervention to improve glaucoma medication adherence among AA's. As part of the intervention development process, we conducted several focus groups with AA glaucoma patients to elicit the salient barriers and facilitators related to glaucoma medication adherence, and then formed a community-based participatory research team comprised of AA's with glaucoma (Dreer et al., 2013). The resulting intervention was based on a multi-component empowerment framework that includes glaucoma education, motivational interviewing, and problem-solving training to improve glaucoma medication adherence. We recently pilot tested the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of the intervention among AA's. Findings revealed significant improvements in objective medication adherence (Dreer et al., under review). Therefore, we now propose to further evaluate the efficacy of this intervention for improving glaucoma medication adherence among AA patients in a large-scale randomized clinical trial (RCT).  The patient population for the RCT will consist of 240 adult AA's with glaucoma and who are aged = 21 years who seek services at the University of Alabama at Birmingham's Glaucoma Clinic within the Department of Ophthalmology. The RCT will have two treatment arms; patients will be randomized following eligibility determination and written informed consent. The usual care only arm will consist of the standard medical care for glaucoma (medicine, laser trabeculoplasty, conventional surgery, or a combination of any of these). The second arm will consist of usual care as just described plus the culturally relevant, health promotion-based intervention. The primary outcome (objective glaucoma medication adherence) and secondary outcomes will be assessed at baseline before intervention initiation and at 3, 7, and 12-month in-clinic follow-up visits by a research interviewer masked to subjects' randomization. The practical question to be addressed is does a culturally relevant, health promotion-based intervention improve glaucoma medication adherence among a high-risk segment of the population? Information from this project will be particularly useful for AA's with glaucoma, their families, and eye care providers. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Poor adherence to glaucoma therapy is a significant healthcare issue that may result in unwarranted changes in medications, increased healthcare expenditure, risk to the patient if surgical intervention is required and further deterioration of vision, all of which can be prevented. This can subsequently have a negative impact on an individual's quality life, independence, and everyday living. The multifaceted and culturally relevant, health promotion-based intervention, lacking in this area, is designed to take critical steps toward addressing this problem by motivating change for healthy lifestyle behaviors and improving problem-solving strategies to better manage barriers related to glaucoma medication adherence, particularly among African American patients who are at greater risk for glaucoma and poor adherence compared to Caucasians.",Enhancing Glaucoma Medication Adherence Among African Americans,9557046,R01EY025331,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Alabama ', ' Awareness ', ' Behavior ', ' Belief ', ' Control Groups ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Elements ', ' Eligibility Determination ', ' Protocol Screening ', ' Eligibility ', ' Health Expenditures ', ' healthcare expenditure ', ' health-care expenditures ', ' health care expenditure ', ' Eye ', ' Eyeball ', ' Eye diseases ', ' ophthalmopathy ', ' eye disorder ', ' Eyedrops ', ' Eye Drops ', ' Family ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Follow-Up Studies ', ' Followup Studies ', ' Future ', ' Glaucoma ', ' glaucomatous ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health Promotion ', ' promoting health ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' Informed Consent ', ' Interviewer ', ' Language ', ' Lasers ', ' Laser Radiation ', ' Laser Electromagnetic ', ' Literature ', ' Masks ', ' Medicine ', ' Methodology ', ' Ophthalmology ', ' Optometry ', ' Optometries ', ' Paper ', ' Patient Education ', ' Patient Training ', ' Patient Instruction ', ' Patients ', ' Perception ', ' pressure ', ' Problem Solving ', ' Publishing ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Socioeconomic Factors ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Trabeculectomy ', ' Trabeculoplasty ', ' Universities ', ' Vision ', ' visual function ', ' Sight ', ' Caucasians ', ' white race ', ' Occidental ', ' Caucasoid Race ', ' Caucasoid ', ' Caucasian Race ', ' Caucasian ', ' Generations ', ' Measures ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Schedule ', ' Treatment Cost ', ' Caring ', ' Magazine ', ' Journals ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' incision ', ' Otomy ', ' Surgical incisions ', ' Area ', ' Medical ', ' Randomized Clinical Trials ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Sample Size ', ' Disease Progression ', ' disorder onset ', ' disease onset ', ' Onset of illness ', ' Knowledge ', ' Disease Management ', ' Disorder Management ', ' programs ', ' Clinic ', ' Blindness ', ' visual loss ', ' vision loss ', ' Test Result ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' surgery ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' interest ', ' Visit ', ' Services ', ' experience ', ' skills ', ' empowerment ', ' racial difference ', ' race differences ', ' motivational enhancement therapy ', ' motivational interview ', ' emotional distress ', ' feeling upset ', ' feeling distress ', ' Deterioration ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Provider ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Readiness ', ' Preparedness ', ' Address ', ' Dose ', ' Adherence ', ' Data ', ' Effectiveness of Interventions ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Clinical Trials Design ', ' Conventional Surgery ', ' Preparation ', ' Process ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socio-economically ', ' socio-economic ', ' socioeconomics ', ' medication adherence ', ' drug compliance ', ' drug adherence ', ' medication compliance ', ' underserved people ', ' under served population ', ' Underserved Population ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' therapy efficacy ', ' therapeutically effective ', ' therapeutic efficacy ', ' intervention efficacy ', ' Treatment Efficacy ', ' coping ', ' blind ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' aged ', ' participatory action research ', ' community based research ', ' community based design ', ' community based participatory research ', ' treatment development ', ' intervention development ', ' develop therapy ', ' therapy development ', ' visual science ', ' vision science ', ' high risk ', ' public health relevance ', ' patient population ', ' primary outcome ', ' secondary outcome ', ' usual care ', ' treatment as usual ', ' arm ', ' healthy lifestyle ', ' treatment group ', ' high risk group ', ' high risk population ', ' primary care provider ', ' care providers ', ' intervention arm ', ' treatment arm ', ' ']",NEI,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,R01,2018,367500,0.06606190269712187
"Using epigenomic subtyping to understand the racial differences in lymphoma PROJECT SUMMARY Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), the most common aggressive type of lymphomas, is characterized by marked clinical and pathological heterogeneity that is reflected at the molecular level. It is well known that although the incidence rates for DLBCL were lower for African Americans (AA) than for European Americans (EA), AA patients were diagnosed at a significantly younger age and have worse 5-year survival compared with EA patients. The reason for this apparent racial/ethnic difference is unclear and cannot be fully explained by social stressors or access to care. We speculate that epigenetic variations could underlie the racial/ethnic differences because the pathogenesis of DLBCL is strongly linked to perturbation of epigenetic mechanisms, and population-specific cytosine modifications are a fundamental feature between human populations. In addition, greater epigenetic heterogeneity is linked with more aggressive DLBCL and poorer survival outcomes. Most prior studies of DLBCL epigenetics have assessed 5-methylcytosines (5mC) in predominantly EA patients. No studies have evaluated 5-hydroxymethylcytosines (5hmC), an emerging stable and abundant modification with distinct gene regulatory and cellular functions, due mainly to technical limitations. Most importantly, no studies have assessed concurrently 5mC and 5hmC in both EA and AA DLBCL patients. Without an effective technique to obtain the complete landscape of modified cytosines, development of targeted epigenetic approaches to improve DLBCL disparities is unlikely. The objective of this Exploratory/Developmental study is to distinguish 5hmC from 5mC at the time of DLBCL diagnosis between AA and EA patients and evaluate their clinical significance. Our hypothesis is that the 5mC/5hmC signatures in tumor tissues differ between AA and EA patients and that these differences contribute to the well-known racial/ethnic differences in DLBCL risk and outcomes. The Specific Aims are to 1) distinguish 5hmC from 5mC in EA and AA patients and evaluate population-specific 5mC/5hmC loci; and 2) determine therapeutic response-associated 5hmC/5mC loci. Specifically, we will obtain tissues for 120 patients with DLBCL (60 AA and 60 EA) from the University of Chicago Lymphoma Biobank. We will combine an innovative technique, the Tet-assisted Bisulfite Sequencing (TAB-Seq) and the new Illumina EPIC array to accurately distinguish 5hmC from 5mC. We will perform an epigenome-wide scan to assess differences in 5hmC/5mC modification levels between AA and EA patients at presentation and also integrate both modifications to predict therapeutic response, defined as relapse within 24 months after treatment. This proposal addresses a critical research question in a highly innovative, cost-efficient, and timely manner, providing important data for the first time on the complete landscape of modified cytosines for racial/ethnic differences in DLBCL. The results are expected to have positive impact because it is possible that the identified epigenetic loci/biomarkers will provide new targets for individualized preventive and therapeutic interventions to decrease mortality and burden of DLBCL. PROJECT NARRATIVE PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: African Americans were diagnosed of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), the most aggressive lymphoma in adults, at a significantly younger age (54 years vs. 65 years) and have worse 5-year survival (45% vs. 54%) compared with European American patients. This work seeks to understand the biological bases of the racial/ethnic differences by identifying complete DNA methylation and hydroxymethylation signatures at the time of diagnosis between African American and European American patients with DLBCL. Successful completion of this study will lead to a much better understanding of epigenetic factors that underlie the apparent racial/ethnic differences in DLBCL, which should accelerate the development of race-based individualized preventive and therapeutic interventions to substantially reduce the disparities observed in DLBCL among patients from different ethnic groups.",Using epigenomic subtyping to understand the racial differences in lymphoma,9572405,R21MD011439,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Affect ', ' Aftercare ', ' post treatment ', ' After-Treatment ', ' After Care ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' B-Lymphocytes ', ' Bursa-Equivalent Lymphocyte ', ' Bursa-Dependent Lymphocytes ', ' B-cell ', ' B-Cells ', ' B cells ', ' B cell ', ' B blood cells ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Breast ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Cell physiology ', ' Subcellular Process ', ' Cellular Process ', ' Cellular Physiology ', ' Cellular Function ', ' Cell Process ', ' Cell Function ', ' Chicago ', ' Colon ', ' Cytosine ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Endometrium ', ' Ethnic group ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Genes ', ' Regulator Genes ', ' trans acting element ', ' regulatory gene ', ' Transcriptional Regulatory Elements ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' treatment access ', ' health services availability ', ' health service access ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' accessibility to health services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Access to Care ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Incidence ', ' indexing ', ' Liver ', ' hepatic organ system ', ' hepatic body system ', ' Lymphoma ', ' Reticulolymphosarcoma ', ' Malignant Lymphoma ', ' Germinoblastoma ', ' Germinoblastic Sarcoma ', ' mortality ', ' Patients ', ' Prostate ', ' Prostatic Gland ', ' Prostate Gland ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Relapse ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Specificity ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Treatment outcome ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Enhancers ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Biological ', ' Link ', ' Individual ', ' African ', ' European ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Biological Function ', ' Biological Process ', ' Solid Tumor ', ' Solid Neoplasm ', "" large cell Diffuse non-Hodgkin's lymphoma "", ' Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma ', ' DLBCL ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' DNA Methylation ', ' Scanning ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' Techniques ', ' Tumor Tissue ', ' American ', ' stressor ', ' tumor initiation ', ' novel ', ' member ', ' racial difference ', ' race differences ', ' ethnic difference ', ' ethnicity difference ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' Pathogenesis ', ' social ', ' Therapeutic Intervention ', ' intervention therapy ', ' Sampling ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Prediction of Response to Therapy ', ' treatment response prediction ', ' treatment prediction ', ' therapy prediction ', ' predict treatment response ', ' predict therapy response ', ' predict therapeutic response ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Preventative intervention ', ' Regulatory Element ', ' Tetanus Helper Peptide ', ' Tet ', ' Epigenetic Mechanism ', ' Epigenetic Change ', ' Epigenetic ', ' Epigenetic Process ', ' exploratory developmental study ', ' R21 Program ', ' R21 Mechanism ', ' Exploratory/Developmental Grant ', ' Pathologic ', ' Molecular ', ' Modification ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' epigenomics ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel approaches ', ' new approaches ', ' novel strategies ', ' Outcome ', ' cost efficient ', ' Approaches to prevention ', ' Prevention approach ', ' Population ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' clinical significance ', ' clinically significant ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' epigenetic variation ', ' tumor ', ' public health relevance ', ' therapeutic response ', ' response to treatment ', ' treatment response ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' Biological Markers ', ' biorepository ', ' biobank ', ' epigenetic biomarker ', ' epigenetic marker ', ' epigenome ', ' bisulfite-seq ', ' Bisulfite-based sequencing ', ' BS-seq ', ' bisulfite sequencing ', ' survival outcome ', ' reduce disparity ', ' disparity reduction ', ' ']",NIMHD,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,R21,2018,200434,0.13967388191090063
"IBD Gene Mapping by Clinical and Population Subset PROJECT SUMMARY Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) are complex genetic disorders of the gastrointestinal tract, and a major health burden to patients and society. Tremendous progress has been made in dissecting IBD genetic etiology with identification of over 200 IBD loci by genome wide association studies (GWAS) but mainly limited to persons of European ancestry. The IBD Genetics Consortium (IBDGC) was established to facilitate multicenter collaborative studies of 6 Genetics Research Centers (GRCs) organized with a Data Coordinating Center (DCC). Our GRC at Johns Hopkins (JHGRC) has contributed to all IBDGC studies, meeting recruitment objectives and taking roles in IBDGC leadership positions. Our particular focus is on African American (AA) IBD genetics. We performed the first large-scale evaluation of European loci in the AA population, replicating several genes, but also finding unique African-ancestral variants within these loci, as well as identified multiple admixture significant loci. We also published the first AA IBD genome-wide association study (GWAS), a collaborative effort that identified two African-specific gene loci, and replicated multiple additional European loci. We have also explored why some loci with proven risk variants in Europeans and other populations only cause disease in one ancestral population but not others. More research in AA IBD is needed to understand the etiology of IBD in this ancestrally distinct, major American population. In this application we will re-evaluate the AA GWAS by better imputation, evaluate whole genome sequencing data to test low frequency and rare variants, and perform an evaluation for chromosome X variants. We will recruit a large number of AA IBD patients through our own and multiple Satellite Recruitment Centers to power a second AA IBD GWAS, both UC and CD, and meta-analyze with the first to identify more novel loci, identify more African specific risk variants, and replicate known loci for this population and replicate our admixture loci. We will also incorporate diverse data sources to incorporate into our GWAS analyses including RNA-Seq currently being generated on lymophoblastoid cell lines from AA CD cases and controls, and RNA-Seq that we will generate in colonic biopsies from UC cases and controls. We will evaluate chromatin differences and expression of genes in cell types relevant to IBD from European, AA and East Asian ancestries in an effort to better understand locus heterogeneity by ancestry. We will continue to participate in all IBDGC activities to maximize the Impact of IBD genetics research by this cooperative funding mechanism. According to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention, an estimated 1.4 million Americans suffer from Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD), a chronic debilitating disorder with no cure that includes Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. IBD ranks in the top 5 in prevalence for gastrointestinal disorders and represents a significant financial burden to society requiring a lifetime of medical care. This proposed research aims to determine the genetic variations that cause IBD which will aid in developing preventive measures, improving the quality of care with better treatments and educating

"EPHA6 as a novel candidate driver gene in colon cancer ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our long-term objective is to elucidate the etiologic factors contributing to disparate colon cancer (CRC) outcomes in African Americans (AA), who continue to exhibit the highest CRC incidence and mortality rates in the U.S, even after accounting for socioeconomic and access to care factors. We recently reported the first comprehensive molecular characterization of AA CRCs, identifying a 15 gene-set as preferentially mutated in AA as compared to Caucasian CRCs. On a broader scale, it is likely that these ethnicity-associated differences in CRC mutational landscapes may have potential to impact on broader disparities in cancer behaviors. In particular, our study identified the, accounting for ~6% of AA vs. 0% of Caucasians CRC cases. EPHA6 belongs to a broader family of ephrin receptor tyrosine kinases that function as oncogenes or tumor suppressors depending on the cancer type. Intriguingly, our study was the first to implicate EPHA6 in CRCs, with the finding of recurrent mutations in this gene selectively in AA CRCs, suggesting a provocative ethnicity-associated difference in routes of colon carcinogenesis. Accordingly, the specific goals of the current proposal are: (AIM 1) To characterize EPHA6 signaling and determine the functional consequences of EPHA6 mutations identified in AA CRCs. We will use in-depth phospho-proteomics and gene expression profiling approaches in AA CRC cell lines engineered to express wild-type (WT) or mutant versions of EPHA6 to characterize EPHA6 signaling and to determine the molecular consequences of EPHA6 mutations. Furthermore, we will compare the phenotypic effects of WT vs. mutant EPHA6 on tumor growth characteristics, using in vitro and xenograft models; (AIM 2) To determine if loss of EPHA6 enhances susceptibility to colon cancer. We will use EPHA6 null mice to determine if loss of EPHA6 induces colon tumorigenesis in chemical carcinogen and Apc Min models of colon cancer. As a complementary approach to Aim 1, we will further dissect and refine EPHA6 signaling pathway, in vivo, using proteomics and gene profiling in EPHA6 WT vs. null mouse colons; (AIM 3) To determine the generality of EPHA6 mutations, and their association with clinically-relevant histopathological features. The AA CRC cases used in our initial study were derived exclusively from Northeast Ohio. Given the history of differing patterns of mass internal migration of AAs within U.S, we will re-sequence EPHA6 in AA CRC cases from Southwestern Texas, to test if EPHA6 is common CRC mutational target in geographically distinct AA populations. Furthermore, given that all of the EPHA6-mutant CRCs identified in our initial study arose in proximal colon, we will re-sequence EPHA6 in a fresh set of AA CRCs from Northeast Ohio to determine if EPHA6-mutant CRC cases define a distinct, morphologically recognizable, subset of CRCs. Success in these studies will uncover new mechanisms underlying colon tumorigenesis and may identify new therapeutic targets for CRC, in addition to having broad epidemiological implications in elucidating the etiologic factors potentially contributing to aggressive colon cancer phenotypes in African Americans. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: African Americans are more likely to be diagnosed with and to die as a result of colon cancer than any other ethnic group in the United States. Identifying the mechanisms involved in colon tumor progression in African Americans is therefore critical for elucidating the etiologic factors contributing to outcome disparities in African Americans. Our proposed studies are designed to delineate the molecular mechanisms associated with colon cancer progression in African Americans with an overarching goal of guiding clinical management for this deadly disease in this population.",EPHA6 as a novel candidate driver gene in colon cancer,9437766,R01CA204549,"['Accounting ', ' Alleles ', ' Allelomorphs ', ' Azoxymethane ', ' Diazene, dimethyl-,

"Circadian Genes and Adipose Function: Impact of Chronotype, Obesity and Race DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There has been an alarming increase in the prevalence of obesity in the United States, but women, in particular African Americans, have been especially hard it. It is thus crucial to identify novel pathways that mediate the increase prevalence of insulin resistance associated with obesity. Disturbances of the circadian clock system in peripheral tissues have emerged as a putative novel risk factor for weight gain and insulin resistance. While the cross-talk between the circadian system and metabolism has been well-documented in nocturnal animal models, in which, contrary to the human, the active period is aligned with high melatonin levels and elevated neuronal activity in the suprachiasmatic nucleus. The potential role of alterations in peripheral clock function in adipose tissue in promoting adiposity-related insulin resistance in women has not been elucidated. Additionally, bariatric surgery has emerged as a frontline treatment with over 200,000 procedures being performed in the US annually. In an ongoing collaboration with a bariatric surgeon, we have obtained preliminary evidence that bariatric surgery rapidly improves insulin action in primary human adipocytes. The central hypothesis of this application is that the reduction in insulin sensitivity in adipose tissue is mediated by alterations in the circadian expression of clock and metabolic genes, and that these disturbances are more pronounced in obese AA women versus non-Hispanic white (NHW) women. Subcutaneous fat biopsies from obese AA and NHW human volunteers will be collected 2 weeks prior to surgery, as well as from matched lean control women. Circadian gene expression will be measured in cultured adipose tissue over a 24 hr period and compared to the systemic insulin sensitivity and chronotype of each individual. During the week prior to surgery, bedtimes and mealtimes will be standardized for half of the obese subjects to determine the impact of central circadian alignment on peripheral circadian gene expression in subcutaneous and mesenteric fat collected at the start of the bariatric procedure. Finally, surgical patients will return 2 and 12 weeks post-surgery before long term weight loss has occurred and subcutaneous fat biopsies will be collected. At 2 weeks, we will determine if the rapid improvement in insulin sensitivity in adipose tissue is commensurate with improvement in the phase and amplitude of circadian gene expression in NHW and AA women. At 12 weeks, when normal meal schedules have resumed but patients remain obese, we will elucidate if bariatric surgery causes an earlier chronotype, which is associated with protection from the development of metabolic disease. At both time points, we will determine if the decreased long term efficacy of bariatric surgery in AA women is concomitant with a reduction in the restoration of peripheral circadian gene expression in adipose tissue. These studies should provide novel and important insights into the interplay of changes in peripheral circadian gene expression and insulin sensitivity that occurs in obesity in NHW and AA women, and may also lead to novel therapeutic interventions to reverse the current racial disparities in the prevalence of metabolic disease in women. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Women are at higher risk of becoming obese, particularly African American women who are 70% more likely to be obese than Non-Hispanic White women. We will test the central hypothesis that the reduction in insulin sensitivity in fat cells o obese women is mediated by perturbations in the daily cycle of gene expression. Furthermore, we will determine the beneficial impact of behavioral adjustment (scheduled sleep and meal times) or bariatric surgery on insulin responsiveness in human adipose tissue samples and explore any racial disparities in the responses obtained.","Circadian Genes and Adipose Function: Impact of Chronotype, Obesity and Race",9518879,R01DK103014,"['Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', '

"Prostate Cancer Susceptibility Gene Identification in Chromosome 5 Candidate Region There are well documented, marked racial disparities in prostate cancer (PCa) incidence and mortality in the United States between African American (AA) and European American (EA) men. These disparities cannot be fully explained by differences in screening or treatment differences by race, and other environmental and biological risk factors have not been well characterized. We hypothesize that racial differences in the distribution of genetic risk factors may contribute to the observed disparities. We recently identified a region on chromosome 5q35 that is associated with PCa in AA men. Preliminary analyses in this region have suggested two loci involved in chromatin regulation, and several genes including COL23A1, TSPAN17, and GRM6. These are genes that have not been well characterized in the literature, however hints of their role in PCa can be found within previous expression studies. Here, we propose to examine the region on chromosome 5q35 in greater depth, using both gene mapping and gene function analyses. In Aim 1, we will perform fine mapping in this region in a much larger set of AA men (2241 cases, 1808 controls) from multiple existing data sources to identify candidate susceptibility loci. We will then perform validation analyses in an independent set of 600 AA cases and 1650 controls and in a second independent sample of 700 cases and 700 controls from the NCI Ghana Prostate Study. Results will be combined across studies using meta-analysis. Aim 2 will explore the functional significance of the top candidate genes identified in our prior work and in Aim 1, including COL23A1 and TSPAN17, using banked tissue samples (Aim 2.A) and cell lines (Aim 2.B). For Aim 2.A, Expression of mRNA will be assessed in 112 fresh frozen PCa samples selected to represent EA men, AA men, high Gleason grade (GG, >4+3) and low GG (<3+4) equally. Protein expression will be assessed using IHC in paraffin embedded PCa samples, using the same race/grade sampling method. For Aim 2.B, multiple cell lines representing a range of PCa aggressiveness and both EA and AA origin will be used to evaluate protein expression and biological function of these proteins. Protein expression will be determined using immunoblot analysis. If clinical data suggest the candidate gene is overexpressed in PCa, we will knock it down, and if expression is lost in PCa we will overexpress it. We will perform cell growth, transformation, migration and invasion assays to determine if altering gene expression will regulate cellular function. We will also perform cell counting assays to measure cell growth over an eight day period. Soft agar and clonogenic assays will be used to assay transformation. Boyden chamber assays will be used to assess changes in migration and invasion. Study results will provide insight into genetic risk factors for PCa that might help explain racial disparities in incidence and mortality and thereby provide biological targets for reducing these disparities. The co-PIs have successfully collaborated on a similar project examining a different region on chromosome 7q31. This study will provide insight into genetic risk factors for prostate cancer through a thorough interrogation of a susceptibility region of the genome on 5q35 previously identified in a sample of African American men. These genes may help explain racial disparities in incidence and mortality. Understanding genes involved in PCa carcinogenesis and progression in African American men will provide biological targets for reducing these disparities.",Prostate Cancer Susceptibility Gene Identification in Chromosome 5 Candidate Region,9511117,R21CA220311,"['Affect ', ' Agar ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Cell Count ', ' Cell Number ', ' cell growth ', ' Cellular Growth ', ' Cellular Expansion ', ' Cell Line ', ' cultured cell line ', ' Strains Cell Lines ', ' CellLine ', ' Cell physiology ', ' Subcellular Process ', ' Cellular Process ', ' Cellular Physiology ', ' Cellular Function ', ' Cell Process ', ' Cell Function ', ' Chromatin ', ' Chromosome Mapping ', ' genetic mapping ', ' Total Human and Non-Human Gene Mapping ', ' Linkage Mapping ', ' Gene Mapping Genetics ', ' Gene Mapping ', ' Gene Localization ', ' Chromosomes ', ' Chromosomes, Human, Pair 5 ', ' Chromosome 5 ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Data Sources ', ' DNA ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' Freezing ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Genes ', ' Genome ', ' Ghana ', ' Gold Coast ', ' Incidence ', ' Literature ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Methods ', ' mortality ', ' Prostate ', ' Prostatic Gland ', ' Prostate Gland ', ' Publishing ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Messenger RNA ', ' mRNA ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Tissue Banks ', ' Tissue Collection ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' United States ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Paraffin Embedding ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' Blood Sample ', ' Blood specimen ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Biological ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Predisposition ', ' insight ', ' African ', ' European ', ' data base ', ' Data Bases ', ' Databases ', ' Biological Function ', ' Biological Process ', ' gene function ', ' Gleason Grade for Prostate Cancer ', ' Gleason-SC ', ' Gleason Sum ', ' Gleason Score for Prostate Cancer ', ' Gleason Score ', ' Gleason Grade ', ' Malignant neoplasm of prostate ', ' Prostatic Cancer ', ' Prostate Cancer ', ' Prostate CA ', ' Malignant prostatic tumor ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Prostate ', ' Source ', ' American ', ' carcinogenesis ', ' Cancer Induction ', ' Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction ', ' reverse transcriptase PCR ', ' RTPCR ', ' RT-PCR ', ' racial difference ', ' race differences ', ' genetic risk factor ', ' inherited factor ', ' Regulation ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' case control ', ' Genomics ', ' Cancer-Predisposing Gene ', ' Cancer Susceptibility Gene ', ' Meta-Analysis ', ' Meta-Analyses ', ' Data Pooling ', ' Clinical Trial Overviews ', ' cell bank ', ' protein expression ', ' Tissue Sample ', ' Candidate Disease Gene ', ' Candidate Gene ', ' Data ', ' Data Element ', ' Immunoblot Analysis ', ' Regulatory Element ', ' mRNA Expression ', ' Chromatin Structure ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Validation ', ' Characteristics ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' protein function ', ' deep sequencing ', ' whole genome association study ', ' whole genome association studies ', ' whole genome association analysis ', ' genomewide association study ', ' genomewide association studies ', ' genomewide association scan ', ' genome wide association studies ', ' genome wide association scan ', ' genome wide association ', ' GWAS ', ' GWA study ', ' genome wide association study ', ' cost ', ' Population ', ' migration ', ' susceptibility variant ', ' susceptibility locus ', ' susceptibility allele ', ' predisposing gene ', ' Predisposition gene ', ' Susceptibility Gene ', ' overexpress ', ' over-expression ', ' overexpression ', ' risk locus ', ' risk loci ', ' risk genotype ', ' risk gene ', ' risk allele ', ' Risk-associated variant ', ' risk variant ', ' screening ', ' race disparity ', ' disparities in race ', ' racial disparity ', ' prostate cancer cell line ', ' targeted sequencing ', ' admixture mapping ', ' reduce disparity ', ' disparity reduction ', ' prostate cancer risk ', ' ']",NCI,WAYNE STATE UNIVERSITY,R21,2018,178029,-0.02572341348689715
"Reducing Emergency Diabetes Care for Older African Americans African Americans (AAs) with diabetes (DM) seek emergency department (ED) care twice as often as Whites. About 40% of AAs with DM have an ED visit each year, and 24% use the ED as their usual place of care (vs. 13% of Whites). The reasons for these racial disparities in ED use are complex, but the scientific premise of the proposed randomized controlled trial (RCT) is that poor access to primary care and poor DM self-care lead to high ED use in AAs with DM. A culturally relevant intervention that mitigates these factors may reduce the need for ED use in this high risk population. This RCT will compare the efficacy of COPDE (COmmunity Care to Prevent Diabetes Emergencies) vs. Enhanced Usual Care (EUC) to reduce DM-related ED visits and/or hospitalizations over 12 months (primary outcome) in 230 AAs with DM, 50 years and older, after an ED visit. COPDE is a collaborative intervention of Primary Care Physicians, (PCPs), a DM nurse educator, and Community Health Workers (CHWs) that extends from the ED into the community. The CHWs will: 1) deliver in-home DM education to increase participants’ knowledge and skills to manage DM; 2) use DM-specific Behavioral Activation to reinforce DM self-care; and 3) facilitate telehealth visits with PCPs and a DM nurse educator to increase access to care. The control treatment, EUC, is usual medical care that is enhanced with DM self-care education. EUC matches COPDE in treatment intensity (i.e., number and duration of in-home visits) and delivery of DM self-care education, but does not include COPDE’s other active elements (i.e., Behavioral Activation and telehealth). The treatment comparison will identify COPDE’s specific efficacy over and above EUC. We hypothesize that COPDE will halve the rate of incident DM-related ED visits and/or hospitalizations relative to EUC. The three secondary outcomes are: 1) subjective perceptions of access to care; 2) receipt of DM Quality Metrics (i.e., objective indicators of realized access to care); and 3) DM self-care. A mediation analysis will determine if changes in one or more of these variables explain COPDE’s efficacy. Exploratory Aims will: 1) determine if COPDE reduces “all cause” ED visits/hospitalizations; 2) determine if Community Need Index scores (which reflect the extent of economic and structural barriers to care), literacy, age, and/or sex moderate treatment effects; 3) determine if COPDE improves glycemic control, impacts DM- related health beliefs, reduces depression, and/or improves quality-of-life; 4) identify COPDE treatment features that confer cultural relevance; and 5) estimate COPDE’s costs and net financial benefits. This RCT is significant because rates of ED use among AAs with DM are rapidly rising, and new ways to treat this high risk population are needed. This RCT is innovative because: 1) it tests the first ED-to-community intervention designed to reduce the need for ED use in AAs with DM, and 2) it determines if participants who reside in high- need as well as low-need communities equally benefit. If successful, COPDE will meet Healthy People 2020’s twin goals of reducing the personal and societal costs of DM and achieve health equity for all Americans. This research aims to reduce the need for emergency room visits in African Americans with diabetes by improving access to care and ability to manage diabetes. If successful, this research will help to meet Healthy People 2020’s goals of reducing the personal and societal costs of diabetes and achieving health equity for all.",Reducing Emergency Diabetes Care for Older African Americans,9523476,R01DK114033,"['Age ', ' ages ', ' Communities ', ' Community Health Aides ', ' community health worker ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Economics ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Elements ', ' Emergency Situation ', ' Emergencies ', ' Nursing Faculty ', ' Nursing Staff Development Specialist ', ' Nursing Staff Developer ', ' Nurse Educator ', ' Clinical Nurse Educator ', ' Clinical Faculty ', ' Goals ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' treatment access ', ' health services availability ', ' health service access ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' accessibility to health services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Access to Care ', ' Glycosylated hemoglobin A ', ' hemoglobin A1c ', ' Hemoglobin A(1) ', ' HbA1c ', ' HbA1 ', ' Hb A1c ', ' Hb A1a+b ', ' Hb A1 ', ' Glycohemoglobin A ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Income ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' indexing ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' literacy ', ' Client satisfaction ', ' Patient Satisfaction ', ' Patients ', ' Perception ', ' Primary Care Physician ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Primary Care ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Questionnaires ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Research ', ' Self Care ', ' personal care ', ' Testing ', ' Twin Multiple Birth ', ' Twins ', ' Treatment outcome ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Mediating ', ' Caring ', ' improved ', ' Medical ', ' Individual ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' Knowledge ', ' Complex ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' Visit ', ' Accident and Emergency department ', ' Emergency room ', ' Emergency Department ', ' American ', ' skills ', ' Participant ', ' Mediation ', ' Negotiation ', ' Negotiating ', ' racial difference ', ' race differences ', ' health belief ', ' health-related belief ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' telehealth ', ' Improve Access ', ' sex ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socio-economically ', ' socio-economic ', ' socioeconomics ', ' Emergency medical care ', ' Emergency healthcare ', ' Emergency health care ', ' Emergency Room care ', ' Emergency Department care ', ' ER care ', ' ED care ', ' Emergency Care ', ' Behavioral ', ' home visit ', ' House Call ', ' Home visitation ', ' cost ', ' community intervention ', ' diabetic management ', ' diabetes management ', ' glycemic control ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' treatment effect ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' therapy design ', ' primary outcome ', ' secondary outcome ', ' usual care ', ' treatment as usual ', ' efficacy testing ', ' compare efficacy ', ' comparative efficacy ', ' health equity ', ' Healthy People 2020 ', ' Emergency room visit ', ' Emergency care visit ', ' ER visit ', ' ED visit ', ' Emergency department visit ', ' race disparity ', ' disparities in race ', ' racial disparity ', ' built environment ', ' high risk group ', ' high risk population ', ' obstacle to healthcare ', ' obstacle to care ', ' barrier to treatment ', ' barrier to healthcare ', ' barrier to health care ', ' barrier to care ', ' societal costs ', ' ']",NIDDK,THOMAS JEFFERSON UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,700857,0.07353430090895631
"Race-related alternative splicing: novel targets in prostate cancer African American (AA) men exhibit 1.6-fold higher incidence and 2.4-fold higher mortality rates from prostate cancer (PCa) compared to white men. Although much of this disparity remains after controlling for factors related to social determinants of health, very few studies have used this population-based difference to identify molecular mechanisms of tumor aggressiveness. The proposed work addresses the urgent need to interrogate the molecular mechanisms driving the more aggressive PCa biology in AA men across the PCa progression continuum and to modulate such mechanisms for therapeutic application.  Our data from evaluating PCa biopsy tissue from AA and white patients has led to the discovery of alternative splicing as a novel molecular mechanism underlying more aggressive PCa in AA men. Preliminary analysis has indicated that several of these race-related alternative splicing events track with increased growth and more aggressive invasion characteristics of PCa in AA men. Additional preliminary work has demonstrated our capability to generate the first significant collection of PCa patient-derived explants and the first establishment of PCa patient-derived explants from AA patients.  We aim to extend our preliminary findings by 1) determining the pattern and frequency of candidate race- related splice variants across the PCa progression continuum, from localized PCa of varying degrees of aggressiveness to metastatic castration-resistant PCa, and defining the relationship between these variants and PCa cell biology, 2) assessing the effects of expression of particular race-related splice variants on mechanistic and functional biology in population-specific PCa cell lines and developing tools to pharmacologically modulate race-related oncogenic splice variants for therapeutic application using AA and white PCa cell lines and AA and white PCa patient-derived explants generated for this study and 3) defining the biological significance of cis- acting splicing elements and/or trans-acting splicing factors to driving the alternative splicing events specific to AA PCa.  The rationale for and impact of this study are that it will further our understanding of the molecular mechanisms driving PCa disparities and aid in development of novel precision biomarkers for prostate tumor aggressiveness and/or therapeutic agents against aggressive PCa. Such precision medicine interventions will reduce PCa disparities for AAs and will likely have impact on a subset of patients of all races with aggressive PCa. New AA and white PCa bio-specimens, AA and white PCa patient-derived explants and derivative cell lines and splicing-related materials and methods and tools resulting from the proposed work will be available to the nationwide cohort of scientists conducting research on PCa disparities. African American men are two times more likely to be diagnosed with prostate cancer than white men and are three times more likely to die from prostate cancer than white men. Our proposed work focuses on understanding the biological differences between African American and white prostate cancer and how to modulate these differences to treat aggressive prostate cancer. Ultimately, this will reduce the disproportionate burden from prostate cancer among African Americans and improve clinical outcomes for men of all races with aggressive prostate cancer.",Race-related alternative splicing: novel targets in prostate cancer,9523404,R01CA220314,"['Affect ', ' Alternative Splicing ', ' Alternative RNA Splicing ', ' Alternate Splicing ', ' Automobile Driving ', ' driving ', ' Biology ', ' Biopsy ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Castration ', ' Surgical Castration ', ' Cell Line ', ' cultured cell line ', ' Strains Cell Lines ', ' CellLine ', ' Chromatin ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Elements ', ' Exhibits ', ' Exons ', ' Spliced Genes ', ' Gene Splicing ', ' Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' treatment access ', ' health services availability ', ' health service access ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' accessibility to health services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Access to Care ', ' Hormone Receptor ', ' Incidence ', ' Inflammation ', ' Maintenance ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Methods ', ' mortality ', ' Oligonucleotides ', ' oligos ', ' Oligo ', ' Patients ', ' Pharmacology ', ' Prostatic Neoplasms ', ' Prostatic Neoplasia ', ' Prostate Tumor ', ' Prostate Neoplasms ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Research ', ' RNA Splicing ', ' Splicing ', ' Metastatic to ', ' Signal Pathway ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Work ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Biological ', ' lung cancer ', ' Pulmonary malignant Neoplasm ', ' Pulmonary Cancer ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Lung ', ' Malignant neoplasm of lung ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Therapeutic Agents ', ' Genetic ', ' Reporter ', ' tool ', ' Malignant neoplasm of liver ', ' malignant liver tumor ', ' liver cancer ', ' Hepatic Cancer ', ' Specimen ', ' Research Specimen ', ' Malignant neoplasm of prostate ', ' Prostatic Cancer ', ' Prostate Cancer ', ' Prostate CA ', ' Malignant prostatic tumor ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Prostate ', ' Cellular biology ', ' cell biology ', ' Scientist ', ' Frequencies ', ' Event ', ' Pattern ', ' cohort ', ' expectation ', ' novel ', ' Prevention ', ' Modeling ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Small Interfering RNA ', ' siRNA ', ' Short interfering RNA ', ' Disease Resistance ', ' resistant to disease ', ' resistant disease ', ' resistance to disease ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' tumorigenesis ', ' Oncogenesis ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Cancer Biology ', ' Cancer Patient ', ' Collection ', ' computer analyses ', ' computational analysis ', ' computational analyses ', ' Computer Analysis ', ' Characteristics ', ' Molecular ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' preclinical ', ' pre-clinical ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel approaches ', ' new approaches ', ' novel strategies ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' disparity in cancer ', ' cancer disparity ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' Oncogenic ', ' tumor ', ' overexpress ', ' over-expression ', ' overexpression ', ' population based ', ' effective treatment ', ' effective therapy ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' Biological Markers ', ' social health determinants ', ' prostate tumor cell ', ' prostate cancer cell ', ' screening ', ' castration resistant prostate cancer ', ' CRISPR/Cas system ', ' CRISPR ', ' Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats ', ' precision-based medicine ', ' precision medicine ', ' prostate cancer cell line ', ' transcriptional differences ', ' differentially expressed ', ' differential expression ', ' patient subtypes ', ' patient subpopulations ', ' patient subgroups ', ' patient subsets ', ' racially diverse ', ' racial diversity ', ' prostate cancer progression ', ' ']",NCI,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,394176,-0.04939491538058413
"Exploring factors related to racial disparities in ovarian cancer incidence and survival: the OCWAA consortium PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT    Invasive epithelial ovarian cancer accounts for 5% of malignancies and, while it is the eighth most common  cancer in US women, it is the fifth leading cause of cancer deaths. Many of the established and suspected risk  factors for ovarian cancer show racial differences in the prevalence and/or timing of exposures. Racial  differences in incidence and survival are likely due to a combination of factors, including differences in the  prevalence of risk factors, treatment received, prevalence of comorbidities, and socioeconomic characteristics.  The newly-­formed consortium, Ovarian Cancer in Women of African Ancestry (OCWAA), brings together  investigators experienced in studying the epidemiology of ovarian cancer and dedicated to understanding  racial differences in risk and outcomes in ovarian cancer. The OCWAA consortium includes an ongoing  population-­based case-­control study in African American (AA) women, three completed population-­based  case-­control studies that include both AA and white cases and controls and two unique cohort studies with  large numbers of AA participants. To address racial differences in incidence and survival, we will  comprehensively examine reproductive and lifestyle exposures which differ in prevalence and/or timing  between AA and white women, access to care, treatment and socioeconomic factors, and determine whether  they explain racial disparities. We propose to harmonize risk factor, clinical and outcome data from the  participating studies in the OCWAA consortium in order to accomplish the study goals and carry out race-­ specific analyses of incidence and survival. We will use traditional methods to calculate population attributable  risk percent (PAR%) for associated risk factors.  We will use a novel and exploratory approach, a Markov  state-­transition microsimulation model, to estimate the extent to which racial differences in patterns of  exposure to known risk factors explain racial differences in ovarian cancer age-­specific incidence and use this  same method to estimate the extent to which racial differences in patterns of exposure, treatment, and  prognostic factors explain racial differences in ovarian cancer survival. The proposed study will be the largest  of its kind and the first to be adequately powered to evaluate epidemiologic and clinical factors affecting  incidence and survival of ovarian cancer in AA women. The infrastructure generated by this application will  enable OCWAA to create a base on which to support future scientific proposals.      PROJECT NARRATIVE    African American women have lower incidence of ovarian cancer but much worse survival than white women.  While access to appropriate treatment is likely a major contributor, it does not completely explain differences in  survival by race. We propose to harmonize data from six existing epidemiologic studies to examine differences  in risk factor exposures that may explain risk differences in incidence, and to examine risk and prognostic  factors to evaluate their contribution to disparities in survival.    ",Exploring factors

"Smart Walk: A Smartphone Physical Activity Program for African American Women ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Project Summary/Abstract National data show that 82% of African American (AA) women are overweight or obese, and 57% are obese. The health risks associated with the high prevalence of overweight and obesity among AA women is concerning, as these risks contribute to subsequent chronicities including cardiovascular disease (CVD) and type 2 diabetes (T2D). Physical activity (PA) is an established mechanism to manage weight and to improve myriad cardiometabolic disease risk factors. However, despite these benefits, only 36% of AA women meet the national PA guidelines. The low PA levels among AA women coupled with the high prevalence of overweight/obesity and other chronic disease conditions indicate the need for effective strategies to promote sustained high PA in this high-risk population. Technology-based platforms (i.e. Smartphone applications, Internet, social media) represent potential channels to deliver PA interventions to AA women. However, few researchers have explored these platforms to deliver culturally relevant PA interventions to AA women. This represents a missed opportunity given the established success of technology-delivered behavior change interventions and data suggesting that AA women use Internet, social media, and Smartphones at equal or greater rates than other race/ethnic groups. Over the past 5 years, the applicant of this proposed work has focused on filling this gap in the published research through the development and evaluation of technology-based approaches to increase PA among AA women. Trained as a behavioral scientist, his graduate and postdoctoral training has been focused in the social and psychological sciences, with a particular emphasis on the development and evaluation of theory- driven, culturally relevant technology-based PA interventions for AA women. The research and training proposed in the current application will extend and refine the candidate's PA and health disparities research trajectory through : 1) focused training in the physiological and biochemical mechanisms underpinning cardiometabolic disease risk factors responsive to PA intervention, and 2) evaluation of the effects of a culturall relevant Smartphone-delivered PA program (Smart Walk) to improve (baseline to 6 months) and maintain (7 months to 12 months) higher PA levels among AA women and improve cardiometabolic disease risk factors. The candidate has identified a supportive and stimulating research environment at Arizona State University to pursue the proposed research. Under the mentorship and Drs. Barbara Ainsworth, Colleen Keller, Glenn Gaesser, and Sonia Vega-Lopez, he will gain the necessary skills to establish himself as an independent behavioral and health disparities research scientist. In the K99 portion of the grant award, the applicant will gan explicit training in the physiological and biochemical mechanisms underpinning cardiometabolic disease risk factors responsive to PA intervention through didactic coursework and hands-on clinical laboratory experience. Training in this research area will complement his already strong social science background by allowing him to gain a deeper understanding of the physiological mechanisms associated with the health-enhancing benefits of PA. In the R00 phase of the grant award, the applicant will deploy the training acquired during the K99 phase and build logically upon his previous health disparities research trajectory by implementing a 12-month technology-based PA randomized controlled trial to evaluate the effects of a culturally relevant Smartphone-delivered PA intervention to improve (baseline to 6 months) and maintain (7 months to 12 months) high PA levels and reduce cardiometabolic disease risk among obese AA women. Seventy-six obese AA women will receive either a culturally relevant, Social Cognitive Theory-based PA promotion program delivered using a Smartphone application or a wellness contact control condition. PA, fitness, and cardiometabolic disease risk factors will be evaluated. Potential physiological mechanisms through which PA may impact cardiometabolic disease risk factors will also be explored. The proposed research and training activities support the immediate and long-term career goals of the applicant. The applicant's immediate career goal is to enhance his theory based PA research to include salient mechanisms that underpin PA effects on health (i.e. inflammation), towards the prevention and treatment of cardiometabolic disease risk factors among AA women. His long-term career goals are to: a) establish an independent, externally-funded program of research focused on the identification of effective strategies to promote sustained PA among racial/ethnic minorities, and 2) reduce the disproportionate burden of the cardiometabolic diseases among high-risk minority populations. The training and research activities proposed in the current K99/R00 application will assist the candidate in achieving these career goals, and advance PA and health disparities science. Project Narrative The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effects of a culturally relevant Smartphone-delivered physical activity intervention to improve and maintain high physical activity levels and reduce cardiometabolic disease risk among obese African American women. In a 12-month randomized controlled trial, 76 sedentary and obese African American women will receive either a culturally relevant, Social Cognitive Theory-based physical activity intervention delivered using a Smartphone application or a wellness contact control condition. Primary study outcomes include changes in physical activity and feasibility and acceptability of the Smartphone- delivered program; secondary outcomes include cardiorespiratory fitness, cardiometabolic disease risk factors, and potential physiological mechanisms through which physical activity may impact cardiometabolic disease risk factors.",Smart Walk: A Smartphone Physical

"Slow wave sleep (SWS) and the effect of African ancestry on amyloid burden, a longitudinal study 7. PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT:  African-Americans (AAs) have an increased prevalence of Alzheimer's disease (AD) compared to whites, which traditionally has been associated to the presence of vascular disease. However, a recent community- based study of non-demented elderly, as well as our preliminary data, suggest that AAs have higher amyloid burden after adjusting for vascular risk factors, which points to the presence of additional genetic or physiological differences on AD-risk by race. The purpose of this study is to test whether poor slow wave sleep (SWS) is one of these factors. Sleep disturbances vary between AAs and non-Hispanic whites. AAs take longer to fall asleep, have shorter sleep duration, lower sleep efficiency and, more characteristically, less SWS duration when compared to whites. Relatedly, amyloid positive healthy elderly, as well as those with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD, experience more sleep fragmentation and more decreased SWS and REM sleep duration than their healthy counterparts. This suggests: i) that disturbed sleep contributes to AD- neurodegeneration (or that sleep is particularly sensitive to amyloid deposition); and, ii) that race-related sleep differences might contribute to the reported increases in amyloid burden in AAs. The study has two goals: first, to confirm that black race is associated in vivo with longitudinal increases in amyloid-PET uptake and cognitive decline; second, to demostrate that poor SWS at baseline is associated with these increases after controling for the cardiovascular morbidity that is shared between sleep disturbances and dementia and might confound these associations. In consultation with community stakeholders, we will recruit 150 cognitively normal AA elderly (ages 55-75 years) and 60 whites balanced by age, sex, BMI, education and other socio- demographic variables and from the same Brooklyn neighborhoods. Visit one will include a full clinical evaluation, neuropsychological tests and clinical labs. Participants will later undergo home monitoring for OSA for two nights followed by 5 days of actigraphy. Subjects with normal sleep breathing will be invited to perform 2 nights of nocturnal polysomnography (NPSG) followed by a second final visit in which amyloid load and cerebrovascular morbidity will be analyzed by 11C-PiB PET-MR. All subjects will be invited to repeat both visits after 30 months. This study has the potential to identify clinical predictors of amyloid burden in cognitively normal AA elderly and would be an important step towards the prevention of dementia in the black community as well as the reduction of health inequities. 8. PROJECT NARRATIVE:  Recent evidence suggests that older African-Americans (AAs) are at a higher risk of developing amyloid deposition independently of vascular disease, which would partially account for the increased prevalence of dementia among AAs. In this proposal, we will extend our prior work in this population to test whether poor slow wave sleep (SWS), which is more common among AAs when compared to whites, is one of the factors that explains these associations. This study has the potential to identify clinical (and treatable) predictors of amyloid burden in cognitively normal AA elderly and would be an important step towards the prevention of dementia in the black community as well as the reduction of health inequities.","Slow wave sleep (SWS) and the effect of African ancestry on amyloid burden, a longitudinal study",9523017,R01AG056531,"['Age ', ' ages ', ' Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Alzheimers Dementia ', "" Alzheimer's "", ' Alzheimer syndrome ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Amyloid ', ' Amyloid Substance ', ' Apnea ', ' Breathing ', ' inspiration ', ' Respiratory Inspiration ', ' Respiratory Aspiration ', ' Behavior ', ' Black race ', ' Blood Vessels ', ' vascular ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' circulatory system ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Cognition ', ' Communities ', ' Consultations ', ' Amyloid deposition ', ' Diffusion ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Geographic Locations ', ' geographic site ', ' Geographical Location ', ' Geographic Region ', ' Geographic Area ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Hygiene ', ' Income ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' indexing ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' Memory ', ' Morbidity -

"Food Allergy Outcomes Related to White and African American Racial Differences (FORWARD) PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Background: Food allergy (FA) is a potentially life-threatening condition that affects an estimated 8% of children in the United States. Although differences between African American (AA) and White children in the prevalence and severity of other atopic conditions such as asthma and eczema have been well described, little is known about such differences in FA. The limited existing literature indicates that AA children may have worse clinical outcomes, including rates of FA-related fatal anaphylaxis and FA-related emergency department (ED) visits, than their White peers. Phenotypic and endotypic differences, including rates of sensitization and co-morbidities, between AA and White children are beginning to be examined. Data on racial differences in FA management practices are incomplete; preliminary data suggest that AA families spend significantly less on allergen-free foods and FA medications than do White families. Families caring for children with FA experience significant impairments in psychosocial outcomes, including FA-related quality of life (FAQoL); however, these data come primarily from White, privately insured families, and little is known about psychosocial outcomes in AA families. Two recent reviews concluded that existing studies examining racial disparities in FA are far too methodologically limited to draw definitive conclusions, primarily due to reliance on self-report of FA diagnosis and cross-sectional designs. Specific Aims and Methods: Our goal is to prospectively study a cohort of 600 AA and White children (0-12 years) with FA in order to: 1) Determine variability in clinical FA outcomes between AA and White patients via bimonthly remote assessments, biannual clinic visits, and medical chart review over a two-year period; 2) Examine phenotypic and endotypic differences between AA and White children with FA using specific laboratory specimen collection techniques and assays; 3) Identify differences between AA and White children in FA management practices by parent report (e.g. allergen avoidance and epinephrine carriage); and 4) Determine differences between AA and White children in psychosocial FA-related outcomes (e.g., FA-related quality of life, bullying, anxiety, and worry) via the above survey methods. Hypotheses and Expected Results: We hypothesize that compared to White children, AA children will: have higher rates of food-allergic reactions and FA-related healthcare utilization; demonstrate unique FA phenotypes and endotypes; have poorer knowledge of FA management and worse adherence to preventative behaviors; have limited access to medications and allergen-free foods; and report better quality of life. Significance and Effects on Other Research: Confirming and further characterizing differences between AA and White children with FA will provide the data required to develop clinical guidelines, optimize treatment, and build health policies that meet the needs of both AA and White children. Project Narrative Childhood food allergy is a serious health condition affecting 8% of children in the US.

"The role of natural selection in SLE risk among African-Americans ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a severe autoimmune disorder that disproportionately affects African Americans (AA). Despite tremendous progress in elucidating its genetic etiology, research has been mainly limited to Caucasians, and little progress has been made in the identification of the specific disease-predisposing functional variations. Since the genome structure of a population is influenced by environmental pressures, and immune responses are particularly sensitive to the environment, it is possible that, throughout evolution, population-specific positive natural selection has led to a increased frequency of alleles that also predispose to autoimmune diseases like SLE. The goal of this project is to discover functional SLE risk variants in AAs while improving our understanding of the genetic basis of SLE that is due to natural selection. In order to accomplish this, Dr. Ramos will (1) identify regions of the genome that have been the target of recent positive natural selection in AA using two complementary population genetics statistics, (2) identify regions that are both predisposing to SLE and under selection, and (3) compute thorough functional annotation of the adaptive SLE risk variants to identify adaptive functional variation associated with SLE.  Dr. Ramos is a human geneticist in the Division of Rheumatology at the Medical University of South Carolina (MUSC). Her long-term career goal is to become an independent translational researcher in the genetics of autoimmunity. To facilitate her transition into an independent investigator, she seeks to further her skills and broaden the multidisciplinary nature of her research by training in population and evolutionary genetics, and bioinformatics and computational tools for the analysis of high-dimensional large-scale datasets. The environment for the success of Dr. Ramos is provided by (1) a mentorship team with the mentorship track record and varied expertise needed to support her project, (2) the availability of samples from unique African American and African populations and the established infrastructure to continue and expand studies on these populations, (3) support from the endowed Smart State Center in Inflammation and Fibrosis, the Multidisciplinary Clinical Research Center (MCRC) for Rheumatic Diseases in African Americans, and the growing Center Genomic Medicine, and (4) the Department of Medicine's robust mentorship program.  The identification of functional adaptive alleles that contribute to SLE risk in AA will contributeto an understanding of the role of positive natural selection in shaping SLE risk and vastly improve knowledge about the etiology of SLE in AA. These results will provide critical preliminary data supporting extramural applications to conduct focused analysis of sequence data, functional studies, expand to other populations and to other autoimmune diseases. The training will enable Dr. Ramos to achieve her long-term objective of becoming an independent investigator leading multidisciplinary teams conducting innovative genomic research in autoimmune disease. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Relevance This project is highly relevant to public health because African Americans (AA) has a higher prevalence and substantial risk of autoimmune diseases such as lupus, but has been largely understudied and the reasons for this health disparity remain elusive. This study will integrate evidence for positive natural selection with biological information to identify adaptive functional variation associated with lupus in AA. Identifying the genetic variations that cause lupus and understanding the role of natural selection in shaping its risk will greatly expand our knowledge about the etiology of lupus in AA and contribute to the development of interventions to reduce risk, improved diagnosis, targeted therapies, and improved outcomes.",The role of natural selection in SLE risk among African-Americans,9481258,K01AR067280,"['Affect ', ' Africa ', ' Alleles ', ' Allelomorphs ', ' Amino Acids ', ' aminoacid ', ' Autoimmune Diseases ', ' autoimmune disorder ', ' Autoimmunity ', ' Autoimmune Status ', ' Binding Sites ', ' Reactive Site ', ' Combining Site ', ' Cell Line ', ' cultured cell line ', ' Strains Cell Lines ', ' CellLine ', ' Chromatin ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease susceptibility ', ' liability to disease ', ' Diathesis ', ' Environment ', ' Evolution ', ' Fibrosis ', ' Future ', ' Gene Frequency ', ' allelic frequency ', ' Allele Frequency ', ' Genes ', ' Population Genetics ', ' Genome ', ' Human Genome ', ' human whole genome ', ' Goals ', ' Haplotypes ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Incidence ', ' indexing ', ' Inflammation ', ' Island ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Systemic Lupus Erythematosus ', ' systemic lupus erythematosis ', ' disseminated lupus erythematosus ', ' Systemic SLE -

"A nutrition-based approach to reduce heart disease risk among overweight African Americans: Use of soul food plant-based or omnivorous diets to address cardiovascular disease African Americans (AAs) are disproportionately affected by cardiovascular disease (CVD), having the highest death rates from CVD as compared with other racial/ethnic groups. In addition, AAs have the highest rates of obesity as compared to whites and Hispanics. People following plant-based dietary approaches, particularly vegan or vegetarian diets, have lower risks of CVD and lower body weights than omnivores. Vegan and vegetarian diets have been used effectively for weight loss and maintenance and for reversing CVD. Although intervention trials have shown a significant weight-loss and cholesterol-lowering effect of adoption of plant-based diets, t o date, most of these large randomized trials have had limited participation from AA participants. AAs tend to lose less weight during behavioral interventions than their white counterparts. In addition, most research has shown that AAs are more likely to discontinue participation in behavioral dietary interventions. This combination of higher attrition and lower weight loss may be due to a failure to address issues that are culturally relevant to the AA population. Our recent 6-month trial examined the use of a vegan diet as compared to 4 other plant-based dietary approaches (vegetarian, pesco-vegetarian, semi-vegetarian, or omnivorous). Weight loss among AAs in the vegan diet was significantly greater (-8.5±3.3%, n=3) than AAs randomized to diet approaches that will be similar to the omnivorous approach in our proposed study (semi- vegetarian/omnivorous groups, 1.4±1.8%, n=3). Of the 12 AA participants who began the study, only one did not complete the study (8% attrition rate) compared to 12 out of the 49 white participants (24% attrition). In total, these results point to the potential of an entirely plant-based dietary intervention to overcome two barriers encountered in previous studies aiming to improve dietary intake and weight loss among overweight AAs for CVD prevention: low weight loss results and high attrition rates.  The goal of this proposed study is to apply these findings in a CVD prevention intervention specifically for AAs living in the southeast U.S. We have developed a partnership with the owners of two soul food restaurants in Columbia, SC (one vegan, the other traditional).These restaurants, which focus on southern cuisine, are owned and operated by local AA families, and will assist with developing culturally-appropriate recipes for our intervention. W e will conduct a two-year dietary trial among overweight AA adults (N=130) randomized to follow one of two diets both emphasizing southern food culture and low-glycemic index and low-fat foods: Vegan or Omnivorous (omni) diet. This study will compare the impact of these diet patterns on changes in CVD risk factors, including LDL cholesterol and blood pressure, and body weight. If this intervention proves to be successful at reducing weight and CVD risk factors among AAs, it has the potential to be disseminated through a variety of locations throughout the US, including restaurants, federally qualified health clinics, churches, or neighborhood community centers. Our proposed project will examine the effect of adopting two different dietary patterns (vegan and omnivorous), which focus on southern cuisine, on both cardiovascular disease risk factors and weight loss among overweight African American adults. Our proposed research study will use a randomized design to examine the effects of adopting these two dietary patterns on cardiovascular disease risk factors and weight loss. We will partner with two local community restaurants to help inform intervention and recipe development.",A nutrition-based approach to reduce heart disease risk among overweight African Americans: Use of soul food plant-based or omnivorous diets to address cardiovascular disease,9525400,R01HL135220,"['Adoption ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Affect ', ' Behavior ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' behavior intervention ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Blood Pressure ', ' Body Weight ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cholesterol ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Communities ', ' Diet ', ' dietary ', ' Ethnic group ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Family ', ' Fatty acid glycerol esters ', ' Fats ', ' Food ', ' Food or Food Product ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Heart Diseases ', ' heart disorder ', ' Cardiac Disorders ', ' Cardiac Diseases ', ' LDL Cholesterol Lipoproteins ', ' beta-Lipoprotein Cholesterol ', ' Low Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol ', ' LDL Cholesterol ', ' Maintenance ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' nutrition ', ' Obesity ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Plants ', ' Edible Plants ', ' Food Plants ', ' Research ', ' Restaurants ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Southeastern United States ', ' Southeast US ', ' Southeast U.S. ', ' Taste Perception ', ' taste response ', ' taste processing ', ' gustatory response ', ' gustatory processing ', ' gustatory perception ', ' Taste ', ' Gustation ', ' Testing ', ' Body Weight decreased ', ' wt-loss ', ' body weight loss ', ' Weight Reduction ', ' Weight Loss ', ' Weight ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Hispanics ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Death Rate ', ' Ensure ', ' Failure ', ' African ', ' satisfaction ', ' diet intervention ', ' Nutritional Interventions ', ' Nutrition Interventions ', ' Dietary Intervention ', ' Letters ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' Vegetarian diet ', ' Vegetarianism ', ' cooking ', ' Vegan Diet ', ' veganism ', ' vegan ', ' Adopted ', ' Clinic ', ' Pattern ', ' Location ', ' Overweight ', ' Over weight ', ' Church ', ' cardiovascular disorder prevention ', ' cardiovascular disease prevention ', ' cardiac disease prevention ', ' CVD prevention ', ' cohort ', ' Recipe ', ' Participant ', ' research study ', ' Intervention Trial ', ' Interventional trial ', ' cardiovascular risk factor ', ' cardiovascular risk ', ' Sampling ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Meta-Analysis ', ' Meta-Analyses ', ' Data Pooling ', ' Clinical Trial Overviews ', ' heart disease risk ', ' heart disorder risk ', ' cardiac disorder risk ', ' cardiac disease risk ', ' cardiovascular disorder risk ', ' cardiovascular disease risk ', ' Glycemic Index ', ' Glycemic Index Number ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Dietary intake ', ' Address ', ' Dietary Practices ', ' dietary pattern ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Preventative intervention ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' weight maintenance ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Population ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' Randomization trial ', ' randomized trial ', ' dietary approach ', ' community center ', ' ']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA AT COLUMBIA,R01,2018,647576,0.027728288462345874
"Vitamin D Deficiency Leads to Increased Intra-Prostatic Androgens  in African American Men PROJECT SUMMARY This proposal is built around our hypothesis that intra-prostatic androgens may be the link between two undisputable disparities in African American (AA) men; vitamin D deficiency and prostate cancer (PCa). We propose that the molecular response of prostate tissues to low vitamin D status leads to increased intracellular import of not only vitamin D, but also androgens. Megalin is the endocytic membrane receptor that imports globulin-bound vitamin D and androgens. We observed that in AA men only, the expression of prostatic megalin increased with vitamin D deficiency and increased with the percentage of West African Ancestry. We propose that long term vitamin D deficiency in AA men leads to a compensatory increase in megalin to maintain tissue levels when the serum is deficient. In turn, high megalin would also import more androgens, thus driving hormonal carcinogenesis.  Hypothesis: Low vitamin D status in African American men drives increased androgen import into the prostate via the membrane endocytic receptor megalin. The objective is to both determine clinical significance and to delve into the mechanisms that regulate of hormone import.  Specific Aim 1: To determine the relationship between intra-prostatic concentrations of androgens with vitamin D status in African American men. The effect of vitamin D deficiency on the serum and intra- prostatic distribution of androgens will be examined using an existing patient cohort.  Specific Aim 2: To delineate the role of megalin-mediated endocytic transport in determining intracellular levels of androgens and vitamin D in human primary prostatic cells from African-American men. The results of Aim 1 will define the relationships between the hormones through correlative data. Whereas the experiments in Aim 2 will demonstrate that megalin is the mechanism of endocytic import for hormones using an in vitro model.  Significance: This proposal addresses a knowledge gap with clear clinical implications for AA men. Although the disparity in vitamin D deficiency in AA is not disputable, the significance remains controversial given that AA men do not have altered bone health, which is a classical symptom of vitamin D deficiency. As well, the disparity in PCa in AA is not disputable and there are likely multiple biological contributors including socioeconomic status in many cases. Our findings may have wide implications to the clinical concern and management of vitamin D deficiency in AA men. Moreover, a proven link between vitamin D deficiency and hormone import may extend to other hormonal cancers. For example, megalin is also present in breast cancer and there is pronounced breast cancer disparity for African American women. PROJECT NARRATIVE This proposal is based on the two irrefutable disparities of prostate cancer and vitamin D deficiency in African American men. Although vitamin D deficiency has been linked to an increase in prostate cancer aggressiveness and mortality, there are no supplementation or deficiency guidelines for cancer prevention and other non-calcemic roles of vitamin D. The goal of this project is determine if vitamin D deficiency leads to higher levels of androgen in the prostate, which may be the link between vitamin D and prostate cancer disparities in African American men.",Vitamin D Deficiency Leads to Increased Intra-Prostatic Androgens  in African American Men,9598264,R21CA231610,"['Androgens ', ' Therapeutic Androgen ', ' Androgenic Compounds ', ' Androgenic Agents ', ' Automobile Driving ', ' driving ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Blood Circulation ', ' Circulation ', ' Bloodstream ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Diffusion ', ' Endocytosis ', ' Epithelium ', ' Epithelium Part ', ' Globulins ', ' Serum Globulins ', ' Goals ', ' Hormones ', ' Therapeutic Hormone ', ' Endocrine Gland Secretion ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Kidney ', ' renal ', ' Kidney Urinary System ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' mortality ', ' Patients ', ' Prostate ', ' Prostatic Gland ', ' Prostate Gland ', ' Proteins ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Sex Hormone-Binding Globulin ', ' Testosterone-Estradiol Binding Globulin ', ' Sex Steroid-Binding Protein ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Vitamin D ', ' VIT D ', ' Vitamin D Deficiency ', ' Vitamin D-Binding Protein ', ' Vitamin D-Binding Globulin ', ' Transcalciferin ', ' Group-Specific Component Globulin ', ' Gc Globulin ', ' Calciferol-Binding Protein ', ' Woman ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Mediating ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' Area ', ' Benign ', ' Clinical ', ' Biological ', ' Link ', ' Blood Serum ', ' Serum ', ' African ', ' cancer prevention ', ' gp 330 ', ' Renal Glycoprotein GP330 ', ' Nephritis Antigen GP 330 ', ' Megalin ', ' Low-Density Lipoprotein Receptor-Related Protein-2 ', ' LRP-2 Receptor ', ' LRP-2 ', ' Heymann Nephritis Antigen GP330 ', "" Heyman's Nephritis Antigen GP330 "", ' Glycoprotein 330 ', ' GP330 Antigen ', ' LDL-Receptor Related Protein 2 ', ' Specimen ', ' Research Specimen ', ' Malignant neoplasm of prostate ', ' Prostatic Cancer ', ' Prostate Cancer ', ' Prostate CA ', ' Malignant prostatic tumor ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Prostate ', ' Knowledge ', ' Hormonal ', ' Membrane ', ' membrane structure ', ' receptor ', ' Receptor Protein ', ' cohort ', ' response ', ' Binding ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Hormonal Carcinogenesis ', ' Supplementation ', ' in vitro Model ', ' Molecular ', ' Prostatic ', ' bone health ', ' disparity in cancer ', ' cancer disparity ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' clinical significance ', ' clinically significant ', ' Hormone use ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' experimental study ', ' prostate cancer risk ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT CHICAGO,R21,2018,208670,-0.07195306511236385
"Molecular determinant of racial disparity in prostate cancer DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Significant disparity in the incidence and clinical outcome of prostate cancer (PCa) exist between African- American (AA) men and their European American (EA) counterparts. Despite this recognition, we have not made a major leap in our understanding of the molecular causes associated with such disparity. This proposal is built upon our strong preliminary data on a proto-oncogene, Myb, which has remained largely unexplored in PCa. Our novel findings demonstrate that 1) Myb expression is significantly elevated in AA PCa with greater overall incidence as compared to EA PCa, 2) low intensity expression of Myb is also detected in some of the benign prostate tissues (BPH) from AA patients, while no expression is detected in EA BPH, 3) AA PCa cell lines (MDaPCa-2b and RC-77/T) exhibit high Myb expression and significant resistance to hormone-depletion and docetaxel (DTX) toxicity, 4) AA PCa cells also display high growth, migratory and invasive potential, which is associated with Myb overexpression, and 5) Myb interacts with AR and modulates the expression of androgen-responsive gene, KLK3/PSA, suggesting their cooperative role in gene regulation. Based on these promising findings, we hypothesize that relative greater incidence and overall expression of Myb in AA PCa cells underlies their inherently greater propensity to metastasize and evade therapeutic intervention. To test this hypothesis, we are proposing three specific aims. In aim 1, we will investigate the role of Myb in PCa aggressiveness and therapy-resistance. Using luciferase-tagged, Myb-overexpressing or -silenced, paired AA and EA PCa cell lines, we will examine the functional association of Myb with PCa growth and metastasis, and their response to castration- and docetaxel- therapies in an orthotopic mouse model. In Aim 2, we will examine the functional consequences of Myb-AR interaction and identify their downstream consequences. We will specifically examine whether Myb has a role in AR localization and transcriptional activation. Furthermore, we will assess the effect of Myb on transcriptional reprogramming of AR by using state of the art RNA-Seq and ChIP-Seq approaches. We will determine the shared and independent targets of Myb and AR in PCa cells and examine if Myb alters AR target gene specificity. In Aim 3, we will determine the clinical relevance of Myb in racial disparity associated with PCa. We will perform immunohistochemical (IHC) analysis to assess Myb and AR expression and localization (cytoplasmic vs. nuclear) in PCa, adjacent BPH, and uninvolved normal tissues from both AA and EA cases. We will then examine their correlation (alone and in combination) with race, tumor grade, metastasis incidence, PSA levels, and patient's survival. Together, these studies will provide experimental, mechanistic and clinical evidence for the role of Myb in aggressive behavior and therapeutic- resistance of PCa, and support the association of Myb with observed racial disparity. In the long-term, the resulting information will be useful in reducing the racial disparities in clinical outcomes of PCa by establishing the clinical utility of Myb as a risk predictor and/or therapeutic target for effective disease management. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Main barrier in achieving progress toward racial disparities reduction in prostate cancer is our limited understanding of the underlying molecular basis. The proposed research will examine the functional and clinical significance of Myb overexpression in prostate cancer aggressiveness and therapeutic resistance, the two major reasons for the poor clinical outcome of African American (AA) patients. The outcomes of our study will allow distinction between clinically indolent and aggressive prostate tumors, and pave the way for novel target-based therapies, which will ultimately reduce the enhanced burden of prostate cancer on African American population and improve overall survival of prostate cancer patients.",Molecular determinant of racial disparity in prostate cancer,9598105,U01CA185490,"['Affect ', ' Aggressive behavior ', ' Aggression ', ' Castration ', ' Surgical Castration ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Exhibits ', ' Gene Expression Regulation ', ' Gene Regulation Process ', ' Gene Regulation ', ' Gene Action Regulation ', ' Genes ', ' Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Hormones ', ' Therapeutic Hormone ', ' Endocrine Gland Secretion ', ' Incidence ', ' Ligands ', ' Luciferases ', ' Luciferase Immunologic ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' mortality ', ' Neoplasm Metastasis ', ' tumor cell metastasis ', ' cancer metastasis ', ' Secondary Tumor ', ' Secondary Neoplasm ', ' Metastatic Tumor ', ' Metastatic Neoplasm ', ' Metastatic Mass ', ' Metastatic Lesion ', ' Metastasize ', ' Metastasis ', ' Patients ', ' Play ', ' Prostate ', ' Prostatic Gland ', ' Prostate Gland ', ' Prostatic Neoplasms ', ' Prostatic Neoplasia ', ' Prostate Tumor ', ' Prostate Neoplasms ', ' Proto-Oncogenes ', ' protooncogene ', ' c-ONC ', ' Cellular Oncogene ', ' Publishing ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Androgen Receptor ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Socioeconomic Factors ', ' Specificity ', ' T-Lymphocyte ', ' thymus derived lymphocyte ', ' Thymus-Dependent Lymphocytes ', ' T-Cells ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Prostate-Specific Antigen ', ' hK3 Kallikrein ', ' gamma-Seminoprotein ', ' Seminin ', ' Semenogelase ', ' Prostate Specific Antigen Preproprotein ', ' Plasma Prekallikrein ', ' Plasma Kallikrein Precursor ', ' P-30 Antigen ', ' Kallikrein 3 ', ' EC 3.4.21.34 ', ' Transcription Activation ', ' Transcriptional Activation ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Benign ', ' Clinical ', ' Refractory ', ' Malignant ', ' Malignant - descriptor ', ' insight ', ' Indolent ', ' European ', ' Gene Targeting ', ' docetaxol ', ' Taxotere ', ' docetaxel ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Normal tissue morphology ', ' Normal Tissue ', ' Malignant neoplasm of prostate ', ' Prostatic Cancer ', ' Prostate Cancer ', ' Prostate CA ', ' Malignant prostatic tumor ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Prostate ', ' Disease Management ', ' Disorder Management ', ' PSA level ', ' Frequencies ', ' Nuclear ', ' American ', ' receptor expression ', ' Toxic effect ', ' Toxicities ', ' novel ', ' disease classification ', ' nosology ', ' disorder classification ', ' Modality ', ' Pathogenesis ', ' Reporting ', ' Therapeutic Intervention ', ' intervention therapy ', ' response ', ' RNA Interference ', ' Sequence-Specific Posttranscriptional Gene Silencing ', ' RNAi ', ' RNA Silencing ', ' Quelling ', ' Posttranscriptional Gene Silencing ', ' Post-Transcriptional Gene Silencing ', ' Tissue Sample ', ' KLK3 gene ', ' KLKB1 ', ' KLK3 ', ' Data ', ' Disease Marker ', ' Receptor Signaling ', ' Cancer Patient ', ' Characteristics ', ' Molecular ', ' Process ', ' treatment resistance ', ' therapeutic resistance ', ' resistant to therapy ', ' resistance to therapy ', ' therapy resistant ', ' vector ', ' knockdown ', ' knock-down ', ' LNCaP ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' disparity in cancer ', ' cancer disparity ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' resistant ', ' Resistance ', ' clinical relevance ', ' clinically relevant ', ' clinical significance ', ' clinically significant ', ' murine model ', ' mouse model ', ' therapeutic target ', ' tumor ', ' overexpress ', ' over-expression ', ' overexpression ', ' public health relevance ', ' chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequencing ', ' ChIP Sequencing ', ' ChIP-seq ', ' RNAseq ', ' RNA sequencing ', ' RNA Seq ', ' transcriptome sequencing ', ' prostate tumor cell ', ' prostate cancer cell ', ' race disparity ', ' disparities in race ', ' racial disparity ', ' prostate cancer cell line ', ' reduce disparity ', ' disparity reduction ', ' androgen responsive ', ' androgen dependent ', ' androgen sensitive ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH ALABAMA,U01,2018,41253,-0.042979467301040394
"GeNYC: Genomic Implementation Research in the Diverse Settings and Populations of New York City The promise of genomic medicine implementation transforming healthcare and improving health will not be realized until discoveries become relevant to and available for use by diverse populations and the clinicians who care for them. Our GeNYC team is prepared to help medical genomics become an innovative, collaborative discipline with inclusiveness, health and health equity at its core. We have decades of experience engaging diverse stakeholders- researchers, patients, clinicians, advocates and entrepreneurs- to conduct chronic disease prevention and control clinical trials in our large health system and network of safety net clinics. In our 16 trials recently mean completed or underway, 80% included primary care or community sites, with a 732 participants/study, 69% were African ancestry (AA) or Latino, 17% refused, and we retained 84%. We chose toharness this expertise to conduct genomic implementation research. At the heart of our team is a Genomics Stakeholder Board. Together, we conducted GUARDD, a multi-site pragmatic clinical trial (PCT) to study effects and challenges of incorporating genetic risk information into primary care. We tested AA adults with hypertension, without diabetes or chronic kidney disease (CKD) for APOL1 high-risk variants nearly exclusive to AAs, that increase kidney failure risk 10-fold. We recruited 2052 AA adults from 15 community and academic primary care practices in NYC, trained lay staff who returned APOL1 results to patients and alerted clinicians of results through clinical decision support in electronic health records (EHRs). Our co-primary outcome, systolic blood pressure (SBP) at 3m (retention rate 93%) reduced by 6mmHg in those told they had high-risk APOL1 genotypes vs. 3mmHg if told they were low-risk (p=0.008).  We are now prepared and committed to join IGNITE II and conduct genomic implementation PCTs in diverse settings and populations. We brought a transdisciplinary team together for this purpose, and to study the impact of APO1 risk information on a broader phenotype of AA patients, including those with CKD, who have even higher risk for kidney failure and are often undiagnosed by primary care providers. We aim to: (1) Serve as an enhanced diversity site for IGNITE2, facilitating recruitment and retention of patients into genomic implementation PCTs; and (2) Conduct GUARDD-US, a network-wide PCT expanding GUARDD to AA patients without and with CKD and to other IGNITE sites with different patient and provider populations. We will randomize patients to APOL1 testing vs. waitlist control, and evaluate impact on SBP, renal diagnosis, cost effectiveness and psycho-behavioral outcomes, so results can inform decisions by clinicians, policymakers and payers. If successful, GeNYC may provide a robust framework for future endeavors to implement genomic medicine in diverse clinical practices, validate APOL1 risk-informed management of hypertensive AA patients at high risk of kidney failure, contribute to important efforts to eliminate racial, ethnic and ancestral disparities in health, and show that vulnerable populations can be the first to benefit from genomic discoveries. Our stakeholder-engaged team is experienced in conducting clinical trials in diverse populations, including one with >2000 African ancestry patients with high genetic risk for CKD.

"African American Families Fighting Parental Cancer Together ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  In 2015, an estimated 340,000 parents of school age children will be newly diagnosed with cancer in the U.S. Parental cancer causes significant emotional distress in both diagnosed parents and children. African American (AA) adults experience a disproportionate burden of solid tumor cancers (e.g., breast, prostate, lung, and colon) which puts AA adolescents, a vulnerable population to begin with, at high risk for parental cancer related distress. Treatments have been somewhat successful for younger school age children (ages 7-12) of cancer patients but most treatment studies have included white middle class samples. Differences in attitudes, daily functioning and levels of distress among different ethnic and racial groups are well-documented, yet few culturally sensitive family intervention programs have been developed for AA families coping with cancer. Building on the PI's previous studies with AA families coping with parental cancer, we propose to conduct a randomized control trial to address this gap. We will of a culturally sensitive family-based intervention that targets the parent child relationship in AA families coping with the impact of solid tumor parental cancer. We will randomize 172 AA families coping with parental cancer to either Families Fighting Cancer Together (FFCT) or to parent psycho-education (TAU). Both manualized treatments include 5 bi-monthly sessions over 10 weeks. Subjects will be African American parents diagnosed for the first time in the past 12 months with Stage I, II, or III solid tumor cancers with at least one child between the ages of 12 and 18 living at home. Patients will be recruited from 3 large inner city cancer centers where there is an estimated 500 eligible low to middle income AA cancer patients a year. Family assessments will be done at baseline, post-treatment (10 weeks), 6-month, and 12-month follow-up. The proposed R01 research has the following aims: Aim 1: Compare the efficacy of FFCT to TAU in reducing depressive symptoms (CDI) and anxiety (RCMAS) in AA adolescents at post-treatment and long term outcome (6 and 12-month follow-up). Aim 2: Compare the efficacy of FFCT to TAU in reducing parental stress (PCQ: impact of illness on child/concerns about parenting) in AA parents at post-treatment and long term outcome (6 and 12-month follow-up). Exploratory Aims: 1. Explore whether moderators identified in Caucasian samples have a similar impact on treatment in AA samples. Specifically, we will examine: a) perceived level of group support, b) gender and age of adolescent, c) parent's marital status, d) SES, and e) stage of parent's cancer on the impact of treatment. 2. Explore whether changes in parent-child attachment and communication mediate the association between treatment and depressive symptoms (CDI) and anxiety (RCMAS) at 6 and12-month follow-up. Treatments to help adolescents cope with the impact of parental cancer are urgently needed, particularly those designed to reach low-income AA populations. Developing effective and transportable family-based interventions for this population could improve developmental adjustment to this significant life stressor at a critical point in the livesof adolescents. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  This project directly addresses cancer health disparities, which is relevant to NCI's mission.

"Racial Disparity in Bladder Cancer and Identification of Altered Metabolism in African American Compare to European Bladder Cancer Project Summary/Abstract It has known that bladder cancer (BCa) mortality is higher in African American patients. Disparity exists between African-American (AA) and European-American (EA), in the clinical outcome of BCa. The long-term objective of our research plan is to reduce the disproportionate effects of bladder cancer (BCa) on African American. A guiding principle of our methodology is that alterations in mitochondrial metabolites exist between African American and European American BCa and that these differences can explain, in part, BCa health disparity. In this application, we propose to use the technique of metabolomic profiling to uncover these underlying differences. To date, a metabolomic analyses aimed at understanding of bladder cancer health disparity has not been reported. We have recently published the first study describing metabolic alterations associated with bladder cancer. In preliminary studies, we have profiled the metabolome of BCa from AA and EA patients and identified a distinct AA race-specific expression pattern in mitochondrial metabolites and lipids. In this proposal, we will i) characterize the mitochondrial associated metabolites in AA and EA BCa, ii) verify the D-2HG and associated enzymes (GLS, ADHFE1, and IDH1/2) in BCa patients and establish a therapeutically targeted deregulation pathway for glutamine metabolism in AA BCa iii) assess the levels of lyso PC and PC and the function of their metabolizing enzymes PLA1A and LRAT in AA BCa.

"A new approach to controlling chlamydia transmission in young people Abstract Chlamydia trachomatis (Ct) is the most commonly reported sexually transmitted infection in the U.S., is a major cause of infertility, pelvic inflammatory disease and ectopic pregnancy among women and has been associated with increased HIV acquisition. Because women experience the most severe sequelae, the focus of Ct prevention in the U.S. has been on screening sexually active women < 25 years old. Though men are reservoirs of the infection, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have not recommended targeting men due to lack of evidence for this approach. This research will fill this gap. African American (AA) women are 7.5 times more likely to be infected with Ct than whites, thus AA are the focus of this research. We hypothesize that screening AA men is essential to curbing the high rates of Ct among young AA women and that a bundled approach will by synergistic. Our community-based pilot program, called “Check it,” is a pilot- tested male screening program which targeted AA men aged 15-25. At the core of this intervention is male Ct screening, but it is also bundled with other evidence-based and best practices for Ct control including: venue- based sampling (VBS), social network peer referral, modest monetary incentives (MMI), screening of target men, rescreening of target men found to be Ct positive with text reminders (Text-RS) , expedited treatment for index men (EIT) and for the partners (EPT), and Wed-based education (Web-Ed). The goal of this study is to examine the effectiveness of a pilot-tested, bundled Ct prevention program focusing on screening young AA men for the prevention of Ct among young AA women: Aim 1. To determine the impact of Check it on women's Ct rates – This aim has a formative phase and an intervention phase. In the formative phase, the pilot Check it is developed and manualized. In the intervention, Check it is implemented and evaluated. We hypothesize that, post-intervention, Ct rates among AA women in the intervention community will be significantly lower compared to rates in the control communities, and that Check it will result in high rates of index/partner treatment and rescreening. Aim 2. To model the potential impact and optimal coverage needed - Using inputs from this study and the literature, a deterministic population-based epidemiological model will be used to model the number of cases averted by Check it and to determine the potential impact at different intensities of the intervention. Aim 3. To determine the cost effectiveness of Check it - Time motion studies will be conducted and used as inputs for the cost-benefit/effectiveness analysis of the Check it Program in order to distinguish study from program costs. If Check it is found to be effective as hypothesized, we will conduct future translational research to disseminate the program. This research has the potential for practical application by improving reproductive health and high impact by removing disparities in the control of Ct among AA men. . Public Health Significance Rates of Chlamydia trachomatis (Ct), a major cause of reproductive morbidity and potential facilitator of HIV transmission, are 7 times higher among African American (AA) women compared to white women constituting an alarming health disparity. The present approach of screening women only is not working and screening men, the reservoirs of infection, should be considered. The goal of this research is to test the effectiveness (measured, potential and cost) and to translate “Check it”, which is a pilot-tested, bundled seek, test and treat intervention targeting young African American men to reduce infections in young AA women.  ",A new approach to controlling chlamydia transmission in young people,9487276,R01HD086794,"['Affect ', ' Aftercare ', ' post treatment ', ' After-Treatment ', ' After Care ', ' Awareness ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' CDC ', ' Charge ', ' Chlamydia ', ' bedsonia ', ' Miyagawanella ', ' Chlamydia trachomatis ', ' Rickettsia trachomae ', ' C. trachomatis ', ' C trachomatis ', ' Communities ', ' Community Pharmacy ', ' Cost-Benefit Analysis ', ' cost benefit effectiveness ', ' cost benefit economics ', ' Cost Benefit Analyses ', ' cost effectiveness ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Future ', ' Geography ', ' Goals ', ' Hair ', ' HIV ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' Incentives ', ' indexing ', ' Infection ', ' Infertility ', ' infertile ', ' fertility loss ', ' fertility cessation ', ' Difficulty conceiving ', ' Cannot achieve a pregnancy ', ' Literature ', ' male ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Persons ', ' Ectopic Pregnancy ', ' extrauterine pregnancy ', ' Public Health ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Sexual Partners ', ' sex partner ', ' Sexually Transmitted Diseases ', ' Venereal Infections ', ' Venereal Disorders ', ' Venereal Diseases ', ' Sexually Transmitted Infection ', ' Sexually Transmitted Disorder ', ' Target Populations ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Time and Motion Studies ', ' Translating ', ' Transportation ', ' Urine ', ' Urine Urinary System ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Social Network ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Phase ', ' Trust ', ' sexually active ', ' Pelvic Inflammatory Disease ', ' Fostering ', ' Logistics ', ' Reproductive Health ', ' uptake ', ' Community Networks ', ' programs ', ' Clinic ', ' experience ', ' Participant ', ' Prevention program ', ' peer ', ' Prevention ', ' Reporting ', ' medical examination ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' social stigma ', ' stigma ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Legal ', ' Educational Materials ', ' High Prevalence ', ' translation research ', ' Translational Science ', ' Translational Research ', ' Transmission ', ' transmission process ', ' Text ', ' Behavioral ', ' post intervention ', ' cost ', ' community intervention ', ' epidemiological model ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel approaches ', ' new approaches ', ' novel strategies ', ' cost-effective ', ' cost effective ', ' aged ', "" man's "", ' man ', ' application in practice ', ' practical application ', ' community organizations ', ' effectiveness measure ', ' evidence base ', ' population based ', ' monetary incentive ', ' financial reward ', ' financial incentive ', ' adolescent men ', ' adolescent man ', ' young man ', ' screening ', ' peer networks ', ' reproductive morbidity ', ' program costs ', ' screening program ', ' annual screening ', ' routine screening ', ' ']",NICHD,TULANE UNIVERSITY OF LOUISIANA,R01,2018,587024,0.11128796825787918
"MIC-1 and its functional partners in prostate cancer racial disparity ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Prostate cancer (PCa) is the most common non-cutaneous malignancy in the United States males and is the second leading cause of cancer deaths in men. In this regard, epidemiologic data have also provided evidence of racial disparity, including younger age, higher incidence and aggressiveness of PCa at diagnosis and inferior survival rates of African Americans (AA) relative to Caucasian patients in the Unites States. The explanation for these differences is still unknown. On the other hand, our recent results combined with prior studies have revealed that MIC-1 and its functional partners EGFR and CXCR4 were more frequent in AA compared to Caucasian PCa patients. Importantly, recent reports have revealed that EGFR and CXCR4 mediate Docetaxel resistance in PCa cells. Therefore, the central hypothesis of this proposal is that the up- regulation of MIC-1 signaling cascade may cooperate with EGFR and CXCR4 oncogenic pathways for the acquisition of a more aggressive behavior, survival and therapeutic resistance of PCa cells and contribute to the racial disparity between AA versus Caucasian patients. The overall objective is to establish the signaling elements modulated by MIC-1/transforming growth factor-ß receptors (TGF-ßRs) and their functional cross- talks with EGFR and CXCR4 cascades in tumor and tumor-associated stromal cells during prostate carcinogenesis and bone metastases that contribute to the ethnic disparity in AA vs. Caucasian patients. The therapeutic benefit to targeting MIC-1 cascade and its functional partners for reversing the chemoresistance of PC cells will also be investigated using PCa cell models and human PCa tissues from AA and Caucasian men. To test this hypothesis, three specific aims were proposed. Aim I will establish the involvement of MIC-1, EGFR and CXCR4 in racial disparity by performing immunohistochemical analyses of their expression on a large panel of benign and malignant tissues and DNA microarrays with PC cell lines relevant to AA and Caucasian men. Aim II will delineate molecular mechanisms of MIC-1 and its signaling cross-talks with EGFR and CXCR4 cascades involved in the growth, invasion and alterations of metabolic pathways using in vitro PCa cell models relevant to AA and Caucasian PCa patients. Aim III will determine the therapeutic benefit to target MIC-1 cascade for improving the anti-carcinogenic effects of docetaxel using in vitro and in vivo PCa cell models. Finally, we also demonstrate the molecular mechanism associated with Docetaxel resistance and its relationship with MIC-1 in PCa cells relevant to AA and Caucasian patients. Taken together, these studies will delineate the functional interplay between MIC-1 and its interacting partners EGFR and CXCR4 and their potential role in disease aggressiveness and therapy resistance to better understand their involvement in the racial disparity between AA and Caucasian patients. The overall outcome of this application will reveal the clinical interest to use combination of MIC-1, EGFR and CXCR4 as molecular biomarkers for an earlier and accurate diagnosis, response to therapy and impact on therapeutic intervention of AA and Caucasian patients. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The research project aims to establish the role of MIC-1 and its interacting partners EGFR and CXCR4 in prostate cancer (PCa) pathogenesis, aggressiveness and their involvement in the racial disparity between African American (AA) and Caucasian men. The studies will delineate the signaling elements modulated by MIC-1 and its functional partners EGFR and CXCR4 that contribute to PCa progression, bone metastases, chemoresistance and interethnic disparity using a large panel of prostatic tissue specimens and PCa cell lines relevant to PCa and bone metastases derived from AA and Caucasian patients. Further, the autocrine/paracrine role of MIC-1 in PCa will be established using recombinant human MIC-1 protein using stromal and tumor cells. The benefit of down-regulating MIC-1 for reversing Docetaxel resistance will be determined using in vitro and in vivo PCa cell models.

"Evaluation of molecular determinants of racial disparity in triple-negative breast cancer PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a very aggressive subtype with limited therapeutic options. Intriguingly, women of African American (AA) origin have much higher TNBC-related mortality rates compared to European American (EA) women. This difference is evident even after adjusting for socioeconomic status and access to care, indicating a biological basis. TNBC tumors in AA women exhibit higher rate of growth and metastasis in comparison to TNBC in EA women. There is an urgent need to understand the molecular mechanisms involved in aggressive progression and increased metastatic potential of AA-TNBC. In our preliminary studies, we observed that AA-TNBC cells have higher invasion and migration potential in comparison to EA-TNBC cells showing inherently aggressive nature of AA-TNBC. In a preliminary screen, we found that a large percentage of AA-TNBC tumors exhibit loss-of-tumor suppressor Liver Kinase B1 (LKB1) in comparison to EA-TNBC tumors. Our preliminary microarray studies also found that LKB1-loss in AA-TNBC results in activation of oncoproteins- YAP and TAZ. Our data suggest that with inherent loss of LKB1, AA-TNBC gain `an oncogenic input' in the form of activated YAP-TAZ signaling. Using in vitro studies, clinical AA-TNBC and EA-TNBC samples and patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models, we will test our hypothesis that inherent LKB1-loss in AA-TNBC results in activation of oncogenic YAP-TAZ signaling leading to aggressive progression and increased metastatic potential of AA-TNBC. Our novel findings also suggest that AA-TNBC tumors may be vulnerable to therapeutic strategies directed at YAP-TAZ inhibition. Based on our strong preliminary data, we will investigate how loss of LKB1 in AA-TNBC might lead to acquisition of higher YAP-TAZ, and drive growth and metastasis of AA-TNBC cells. We will also analyze AA-TNBC and EA-TNBC tumors to establish LKB1-loss and elevated YAP-TAZ as biomarkers of aggressive progression of AA-TNBC. We will utilize these biological insights to test and propose safe and effective therapeutic strategies to target AA-TNBC. Using patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models, we propose to investigate whether AA-TNBCs are particularly susceptible to YAP-TAZ inhibition strategies and whether currently clinically available drugs (screened from a drug library) can be repurposed to target YAP-TAZ in AA-TNBC. Secondly, we plan to examine whether Honokiol, a natural compound from Magnolia grandiflora, (selected from a screen of known bioactive compounds) and its novel analogs have the potential to inhibit YAP-TAZ in AA-TNBC. Our studies will provide new understanding how loss-of-LKB1 and gain-of-YAP-TAZ in AA-TNBC form a relentless axis that drives AA-TNBC. These studies will provide novel insight into molecular mechanisms underlying racial disparity in TNBC and provide a novel set of biomarkers and potential drug-targets to develop novel ways to reduce the disparity in clinical outcome of AA and EA TNBC patients. Project Narrative Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) in African American (AA) women is more aggressive than TNBC in European American (EA); 5-year relative survival for AA-TNBC is only 14% in comparison to 36% for EA- TNBC therefore it is imperative to understand the underlying molecular mechanisms leading to this racial disparity. Using in vitro studies, clinical AA-TNBC and EA-TNBC samples and patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models, we will test our hypothesis that inherent LKB1-loss in AA-TNBC tumors results in activation of oncoprotein- YAP-TAZ leading to ‘oncogene addiction’ and aggressive tumor progression. These studies will provide novel insight into molecular mechanisms underlying racial disparity in TNBC and provide a novel set of biomarkers and potential drug-targets to develop novel ways to reduce

"Integrated genomic analysis of racial disparities in endometrial cancer DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Although the incidence of endometrial cancer in African-American (AA) women is lower than in Caucasian (C) women, a striking racial disparity exists in endometrial cancer survival rates in the United States, with blacks having up to 30% worse survival rates than whites. Socio-demographic factors alone cannot account for this difference because differences in survival still occur when analyses are adjusted for black and white women by stage and by biologically aggressive (i.e., Type II) endometrial tumors. Uterine serous papillary carcinoma (USC), represents the most aggressive histologic subtype of endometrial cancer. This variant of endometrial carcinoma is up to three fold more frequent in AA women when compared to C women. On the basis of our recently published data on the genetic landscape of USC suggesting that genetic and biologic factors may underlie the racial disparity in survival rates and with the ultimate goal to develop novel, more specific and more effective treatment modalities for the diagnosis and therapy of USC so common in AA women, we propose the following: Aim 1: Identify through whole exome sequencing driver mutation candidates, loss of heterozygosity (LOH) patterns and copy number variations (CNV) in 200 USC samples and use bioinformatics strategies to perform a systematic assessment of genetic differences between AA vs C tumors, Aim 2: Evaluate miRNAs and mRNA expression differences in USC from AA and C and perform downstream analysis of pathways influencing disease in different groups of USC (i.e., c-erbB2+ vs negative and PIK3CA and CCNE1 mutants vs wild type) and Aim 3: Evaluate the biochemical properties of a subset of novel PIK3CA mutations and validate the c-erbB2/PIK3CA and CCNE1 pathways as novel targets for USC treatment using primary USC cell lines and targeted agents including trastuzumab and T-DM1 (i.e., mAbs targeting c-erbB2), AZD8055, GDC-0980 and CYC065 (i.e., a mTOR/PI3K/CDK inhibitors) in in vitro and in vivo assays. This proposal encompasses the first integrated analysis of genomic differences in USC developed by AA when compared to C women as well as the validation of the currently identified differentially expressed genes harboring key driver mutations as novel targets for USC therapy in minority. Relevance Definition and functional validation of key driver mutations and downstream signaling pathways differentially active in AA women harboring USC may be used to guide novel, highly effective targeted therapies against these highly aggressive tumors and, therefore, may have immediate clinical relevance on minority health. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Type II endometrial tumors such as uterine serous carcinoma (USC) are more commonly diagnosed in AA women when compared to C women, suggesting a genetic predisposition in black women to develop these biologically aggressive neoplasms. This proposal is designed to perform the first comprehensive analysis of genomic differences in USC developed by AA women when compared to C women. We will search for driver gene mutations, loss of heterozygosity (LOH) and copy number variations (CNV) and identify miRNAs and genes highly differentially expressed in USC developed by AA women when compared to C women.

"Precision Interception of Aggressive Prostate Cancer in African American Men Abstract Precision Interception of Aggressive Prostate Cancer in African American Men Prostatic adenocarcinoma (PCa) is the most frequently diagnosed non-cutaneous malignancy and a leading cause of male cancer death. African American (AA) men die from PCa at a rate more than double that of men of any other race or ethnicity. The causes of this disparity are multifactorial and certainly include unequal access to screening and treatment. Biological differences in the tumors of AA and non-AA men have also been reported that may reflect underlying tumor differences that may also affect prognosis and treatment choice. Our ability to predict and monitor PCa progression and make better treatment choices in AA men is critical to reducing dispari- ties in PCa among AA men. To address these issues, we propose a “precision interception” approach designed to impede cancer progres- sion at early stages and avoid development of lethal disease in AA PCa cases. Precision interception approach- es use knowledge of molecular signatures and other clinical and epidemiological data to interrupt PCa before it is lethal to the patient. Thus, our proposal will focus on newly diagnosed or recurrent AA PCa patients, with the goal to develop and implement tools that can “intercept” the development of castrate-resistant or metastatic PCa and death from PCa in AA men. These approaches can thereby reduce PCa-specific disparities in mortality ex- perienced by AA men.  We will use the “Men of African Descent and Carcinoma of the Prostate” (MADCaP) network that has substan- tial resources to address disparities in PCa in AA men. The team assembled here has previously collaborated to develop translational research that is led by established basic and clinical experts who have worked together to develop each concept. The result is a novel inter-disciplinary collaboration with the potential to maximize clinical impact on PCa disparities in AA men. An Administration Core and Biosample and Biomarker Core support the projects. The projects and cores integrate community engagement activities, and the Dana Farber Harvard Can- cer Center SPORE in Prostate Cancer, which itself has substantial resources for preclinical and clinical transla- tion. These resources are complemented by the MADCaP Implementation Network (MADCaP-IN) that includes community and inner city clinics that see a substantial proportion of AA PCa cases. The MADCaP-IN will serve as the centers for research participant accrual as well as centers for the implementation of current and future clinical research. We also include a Dvelopmental Research Pilot program that will focus on implementation and dissemination of our research to have maximal impact on communities. Our proposed translational research should have substantial translational/clinical impact, improve management of and outcomes, and reduce PCa disparities in AA men with PCa. PROJECT 1 NARRATIVE This P20 grant will develop knowledge and infrastructure required to address prostate cancer disparities, particularly those that affect African American men.

"Epigenetic and Biobehavioral Determinants of Preterm Birth in Black Women DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Preterm birth (PTB, birth prior to 37 weeks' gestation) is a leading cause of infant mortality. Of the known risk factors for PTB, among the strongest is African American (AA) race. Compared to Caucasians, AA women have more than 1.5 times the risk of PTB (16.8% vs. 10.5%). The proposed research will investigate whether specific bio behavioral factors linked to PTB influence the epigenetic regulation of genes to promote PTB in AA women. This research will contribute to a bio psychosocial understanding of within-race risk for PTB, providing insight into important risk and protective factors relevant to AA women. The proposed research is consistent with frameworks for eliminating racial disparities, which recognize the need to study risks within-race as a vital first step, and is congruent with the National Institute of Minority Health and Health Disparities goal of promoting understanding of the biological mechanisms involved in conditions that disproportionately affect health disparity populations.  To evaluate the hypothesis that epigenetic mechanisms mediate the relationship between specific bio behavioral factors and PTB for AA women, the proposed study will leverage bio behavioral and biologic data from an on-going longitudinal study of preterm birth in AA women (R01 NR014800) that is enrolling a socioeconomically diverse cohort of H 960 pregnant AA women and collecting data during prenatal care appointments (at 10-14 and 26-30 weeks' gestation) and at delivery. Using a nested case-control approach, cases are designated as those who experience PTB (an estimated 125 cases) and controls as those who experience a term birth. Building from this study design, we will: (1) characterize PBMC DNA methylation and RNA expression patterns over the course of pregnancy among AA women who deliver preterm and at term; (2) identify bio behavioral factors - including nutritional status, stress, an reproductive tract infections - that influence patterns of peripheral DNA methylation and RNA expression; (3) evaluate associations between PTB and both DNA methylation and RNA expression among AA women that are independent of the bio behavioral factors and (4) determine whether these epigenetic differences can be detected in the second and/or third trimester. The success of this research is supported by a multidisciplinary collaboration of clinicians, basic and translational scientists representing expertise in obstetrical outcomes and maternal-child health, genetics and epigenetics, nutrition, stress, epidemiology and informatics; the overlap of key personnel for the proposed study and the on-going R01 'Bio behavioral Determinants of the Micro biome and Preterm Birth for Black Women'; and support from Emory University's Clinical and Translational Science Institute (CTSA award # NIH UL1TR000454). Finally, Atlanta is home to AA women of broad socioeconomic status who are served by Emory's affiliated delivery hospitals, allowing for sufficient variation in the bio behavioral factrs under study to distinguish independent and interactive effects on DNA methylation and, ultimately, on the risk of PTB. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Preterm birth (PTB) occurs at unacceptably high rates in the United States, with African American (AA) women disproportionately affected. The proposed research will investigate whether bio behavioral factors linked to PTB influence the regulation and expression of genes to promote PTB in AA women. We will focus our investigation on bio behavioral factors that affect the inflammatory pathway - including poor nutritional status, stress and reproductive tract infections -- as, according to the Institute of Medicine, inflammation predominantly contributes to the excessive rates of PTB experienced by AA women. This research will contribute to a bio psychosocial understanding of within-race risk for PTB, providing insight into important risk and protective factors relevant to AA women who disproportionately experience PTB.",Epigenetic and Biobehavioral Determinants of Preterm Birth in Black Women,9471273,R01MD009064,"['Accounting ', ' Affect ', ' Appointment ', ' Award ', ' Biology ', ' Birth ', '

"Consequences and mechanism of aberrant splicing in African American prostate cancer disparities Summary There are striking population (race) disparities in prostate cancer (PCa) risk and survival outcome borne out of current health statistics. This is particularly evident between African American (AA) patients and their European American (EA) counterparts, where AAs exhibit a 1.5 to 2 fold higher risk of PCa incidence and mortality. We demonstrate that differential alternative RNA splicing takes place for oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes in PCa specimens of AA compared to EA patients. The differential splicing events result in the enrichment and in many instances generation of AA-specific splice variants not observed in EA cancers. We have cloned the AA and EA splice variant cDNAs for both phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase catalytic subunit delta (PIK3CD) and fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3), and ectopically introduced the clones individually into PCa cell lines. Compared to the EA variant-expressing lines, the AA variant-expressing lines are more oncogenic in in vitro cell proliferation and invasion assays, and exhibit greater tumor growth/metastasis and resistance to small molecule targeted therapy in xenograft mouse models. These findings may explain, in part, the observed cancer health disparities in the AA population relative to other racial groups. The mechanism responsible for the formation of AA-specific or -enriched mRNA splice variants are hypothesized to be due to the dysregulated expression of 6 key splicing factor s in AA PCa specimens. We refer to this dysregulation and associated production of AA-specific splice variants as an “AA splicing factor code in PCa disparities.” Notwithstanding these developments, a number of questions remain unresolved. First, what is the mechanism(s) of dysregulated expression of the 6 splicing factors? Second, can the production of AA-specific splice variants via exon skipping be directly attributed to the 6 dysregulated splicing factors? Lastly, how do the encoded proteins of the AA-specific short variants of PIK3CD and FGFR3 mediate a more oncogenic phenotype in PCa cells? The objectives of this application are to address these questions, and to provide a mechanistic framework of population-related differences in alternative RNA splicing, which is anticipated to facilitate future identification of druggable targets (e.g. splicing factors and/or resulting splice variant proteins) of AA tumor phenotype and disparities. Narrative African American (AA) prostate cancers express unique mRNA variants not found in European American (EA) cancers, which we hypothesize are responsible in part for the more aggressive nature of the disease and poorer prognosis in the AA population. Our underlying premise is that multiple key RNA splicing factors are uniquely dysregulated in AA prostate cancer, leading to the formation of these AA-specific mRNA variants that encode more oncogenic versions of signal transducing proteins. Our study is expected to identify the molecular mechanism(s) driving dysregulated splicing factor expression, define the cis-acting RNA sequence elements essential for the production of the AA-specific mRNA variants, and characterize protein isoform function encoded by the AA-specific variants, which may serve as future treatment options in cancer health disparities.",Consequences and

"Depletion of pancreatic lipid improves beta-cell function in early type 2 diabetes The decline in first-phase insulin secretion is a key event in the etiology of type 2 diabetes (T2D). Although the cause of beta-cell failure is not clear, “lipotoxicity” has been proposed. Bariatric surgery and very-low calorie diets in patients with T2D induce disease remission, characterized by a return of first-phase insulin secretion and a depletion of pancreas lipid. However, these are extreme approaches to treating T2D, and non-invasive, sustainable, yet equally effective, treatments are needed. We have shown in individuals at risk for T2D that an intervention with a weight-maintaining low-glycemic (LG) diet selectively depletes visceral adipose tissue and ectopic lipid in muscle while preserving thigh subcutaneous adipose and lean body mass. This observation suggests that such diets are able to “remodel” body composition by re-partitioning energy away from metabolically harmful lipid stores. Participants on the LG diet also demonstrated improved insulin sensitivity and a dramatic (9-fold) increase in first-phase insulin secretion. Thus, we hypothesize that a weight-maintaining LG diet will selectively deplete ectopic adipose tissue, including pancreatic lipid, and will permit recovery of beta-cell function in individuals with T2D. Rescue of beta-cell function may be particularly important in African-Americans (AA), who as a group demonstrate a high prevalence of T2D, for reasons that cannot be explained by lifestyle. AA are likely to be vulnerable to beta-cell failure due to inherently high beta-cell responsiveness (demonstrable in healthy young children). Further, it has been shown that pancreas lipid is a determinant of prediabetes specifically in AA. Thus, we hypothesize that an LG diet will be particularly beneficial to beta-cell function and glycemic control among AA. To test these hypotheses, we will conduct a randomized clinical trial to examine the impact a weight-maintaining LG diet vs a Control diet (ADA/USDA) with all food provided on changes in pancreatic lipid by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and first-phase insulin secretion by hyperglycemic clamp and oral meal test in AA and European-American (EA) individuals with early T2D (<5 yr since diagnosis). The study will be powered to examine race-specific effects (race x diet interaction). This proposal responds to PA-17-021, “Addressing Health Disparities in NIDDK Diseases.” The results from this study could change clinical care guidelines to incorporate an LG diet, which may reduce the disproportionate burden of T2D and its complications experienced by AA. Type 2 diabetes develops because the pancreas is no longer able to secrete enough insulin to control blood sugar. Patients with type 2 diabetes have more fat in their pancreas than healthy individuals, and if pancreas fat is reduced, insulin secretion returns. In this study, we will determine if a low sugar diet can reduce pancreas fat and improve insulin secretion and glucose control in patients with type 2 diabetes.",Depletion of pancreatic lipid improves beta-cell function in early type 2 diabetes,9493137,R01DK116726,"['Adipose tissue ', ' yellow adipose tissue ', ' white adipose tissue ', ' adipose ', ' Fatty Tissue ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Blood Glucose ', ' Blood Sugar ', ' Body Composition ', ' Cell physiology ', ' Subcellular Process ', ' Cellular Process ', ' Cellular Physiology ', ' Cellular Function ', ' Cell Process ', ' Cell Function ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' type two diabetes ', ' type II DM ', ' type 2 DM ', ' maturity onset diabetes ', ' ketosis resistant diabetes ', ' adult onset diabetes ', ' Type II diabetes ', ' Type II Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Type 2 diabetes ', ' Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus ', ' T2DM ', ' T2D ', ' T2 DM ', ' Stable Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Slow-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Noninsulin Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Non-Insulin Dependent Diabetes ', ' NIDDM ', ' Maturity-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' MODY ', ' Ketosis-Resistant Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Adult-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Diet ', ' dietary ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Pharmacotherapy ', ' drug treatment ', ' Drug Therapy ', ' Fatty acid glycerol esters ', ' Fats ', ' Food ', ' Food or Food Product ', ' Hyperglycemia ', ' hyperglycemic ', ' Insulin ', ' Regular Insulin ', ' Novolin R ', ' Humulin R ', ' Insulin Resistance ', ' insulin resistant ', ' Life Style ', ' Lifestyle ', ' Lipids ', ' Longevity ', ' lifespan ', ' life span ', ' Length of Life ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' MRI ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MR Imaging ', ' Muscle ', ' muscular ', ' Muscle Tissue ', ' Obesity ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Pancreas ', ' Pancreatic ', ' Patients ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Testing ', ' Thigh structure ', ' Thigh ', ' Weight ', ' Glucose Clamp ', ' Euglycemic Clamping ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Guidelines ', ' improved ', ' Phase ', ' Randomized Clinical Trials ', ' disability ', ' Failure ', ' Individual ', ' Recovery ', ' European ', ' sugar ', ' Populations at Risk ', ' Disease Progression ', ' Low-Fat Diet ', ' Fat-Restricted Diet ', ' Metabolic ', ' tool ', ' Prediabetes syndrome ', ' syndrome x ', ' prediabetic ', ' pre-diabetic ', ' pre-diabetes ', ' Prediabetic State ', ' Prediabetes ', ' Calories ', ' Event ', ' Oral ', ' Visceral ', ' subcutaneous ', ' restoration ', ' Closure by clamp ', ' Clampings ', ' Disease remission ', ' Remission ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' cell injury ', ' cell damage ', ' Cellular injury ', ' Participant ', ' ethnic difference ', ' ethnicity difference ', ' response ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' insulin sensitivity ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Beta Cell ', ' βCell ', ' β-cells ', ' β-cell ', ' Insulin Secreting Cell ', ' Insulin Cell ', ' insulin secretion ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Etiology ', ' disease causation ', ' causation ', ' Causality ', ' Address ', ' bariatric surgery ', ' weight loss surgery ', ' stomach stapling ', ' obesity surgery ', ' implantable gastric stimulation banding ', ' gastric bypass surgery ', ' gastric banding ', ' Symptoms ', ' High Prevalence ', ' National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases ', ' NIDDK ', ' Characteristics ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' weight maintenance ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' glycemic control ', ' glucose regulation ', ' glucose homeostasis ', ' glucose control ', ' blood glucose regulation ', ' Prevalence ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' nondiabetic ', ' non-diabetic ', ' clinical care ', ' patient population ', ' therapeutic response ', ' response to treatment ', ' treatment response ', ' effective treatment ', ' effective therapy ', ' lean body mass ', ' ']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,R01,2018,532756,0.042192509624213295
"The Impact of the Intrauterine and Early Childhood Environments on Neurocognitive and Metabolic Development in African American Youth: Focus on the Gut-Brain Axis PROJECT ABSTRACT  Environmental exposures during the critical prenatal and early childhood periods can result in lifelong health consequences. Mechanisms underlying these exposure-health relationships are complex, with exogenous exposures (such as chemical toxicants, infectious agents, diet) and endogenous processes (such as gene expression, inflammation and oxidative stress) activating metabolic pathways that lead to adverse health outcomes. Both adverse exposures and their health consequences disproportionately impact African American (AA) women and children, highlighting that health disparities begin in utero and are amplified postnatally. Among outcomes disproportionately experienced by AA children are preterm birth, neurodevelopmental deficits, and obesity – all linked to environmental exposures, yet poorly understood due to their etiologic complexity. Our team is currently investigating preterm birth and neurodevelopment through 18-months in relation to pre- and postnatal exposures to environmental toxicants and biopsychosocial risk factors in cohorts of pregnant AA women (R01NR014800, R01MD009064) and their infants (R01MD009746) and via our P50 Children's Center (P50ES026071) in collaboration with the Emory HERCULES Exposome Research Center (P30 ES019776).  Through ECHO, we propose to elucidate exposures and risk pathways that contribute to neurodevelopmental deficits and obesity in preschool aged AA children by: (1) Assembling an Atlanta ECHO cohort of ~440 AA socioeconomically diverse mother-child pairs by combining extant cohorts for whom the prenatal, perinatal, and early childhood environments are, or will be, characterized; (2) Completing the analysis and synthesis of data from the Atlanta ECHO cohort to characterize mother-child pairs in terms of prenatal and early childhood exposures (toxicants, stressors and neuroendocrine-immune activation, nutritional and metabolic status, microbiome and infections, bonding and interaction); epigenetic and metabolomic profiles; and perinatal outcomes (gestational age, size-for-gestation); (3) Testing cohort-specific hypotheses related to prenatal and early childhood exposures and neurodevelopmental outcomes and obesity in AA children at 2, 3, 4, and 5 years of age; (4) Participating in ECHO-wide consortium studies to identify risk and protective factors that moderate associations between environmental exposures, typical growth and development, and adverse child health outcomes. Our cohort's participation in the ECHO consortium will contribute to a biopsychosocial understanding of within- and between-race risk for adverse child health outcomes, providing insight into risk and protective factors relevant to AA families. The proposed research is consistent with frameworks for eliminating racial disparities, which recognize the need to study risks within-race as a vital first step, and is congruent with the National Institute of Minority Health and Health Disparities goal of promoting understanding of the biological mechanisms involved in conditions that disproportionately affect health disparity populations. PROJECT NARRATIVE Both adverse environmental exposures and their health consequences disproportionately impact African American (AA) women and children, highlighting that health disparities begin in utero and are amplified postnatally. AA children are more likely to experience preterm birth, neurodevelopmental deficits, and obesity – all linked to environmental exposures, yet poorly understood due to their etiologic complexity. Our goal is to use a sociodemographically diverse Atlanta ECHO cohort of AA mother-child pairs to study the mechanistic pathways through which early life exogenous and endogenous exposures contribute to neurodevelopmental deficits and obesity in preschool aged AA children in order to guide future prevention and intervention efforts.",The Impact of the Intrauterine and Early Childhood Environments

"Analysis of Racial Disparities in HCC by Systems Metabolomics ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a significant health problem in the United States. Compared to European Americans (EA), the incidence of HCC is higher in African Americans (AA) and is associated with more advanced tumor stage at diagnosis and lower survival rates. It has been reported that the sensitivity of α- fetoprotein (AFP) for the diagnosis of HCC in African Americans with hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is lower than that of patients of all other racial groups combined. We previously performed preliminary investigation into racial disparities through metabolomics profiling of sera from HCC cases and patients with liver cirrhosis by using both liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Through stratified analysis of the LC/GC-MS data, we identified different candidates that distinguish HCC cases from the cirrhotic controls among AA and EA. This application builds on these promising preliminary results to find and validate race-specific metabolites as biomarkers for HCC. This will be accomplished by targeted analysis of metabolites in liver tissues and sera from HCC cases and patients with liver cirrhosis representing AA and EA. Metabolites that differentiate HCC cases from cirrhotic controls in a race-specific manner will be selected by statistical and network-based methods. Then, a systems-oriented approach that combines these metabolites with other candidate biomarkers (genes, glycans, and proteins) will be utilized for the selection of key signaling pathways perturbed in HCC. Following validation of the candidates via independent samples from HCC cases, patients with liver cirrhosis, and healthy subjects, we will elucidate their functional roles through both in vitro and in vivo experiments. Successful completion of this research will enable us to identify HCC biomarkers and perturbed pathways that are race-specific as well as those that are shared by AA and EA. These findings will contribute not only to a greater understanding of racial disparities in HCC but also to improving diagnosis of HCC through race-specific biomarkers. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Currently used biomarkers for detecting hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in high-risk cirrhotic patients lack the desired sensitivity and specificity, particularly in African American patients. The goal of this project is to find and validate race-specific biomarkers for HCC and identify perturbed intercellular signaling pathways in HCC. If successful, the study will (1) contribute to a greater understanding of racial disparities in HCC, (2) enable accurate detection of HCC by using race as a factor, and (3) give insights into the mechanisms underlying the behavior of potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets.",Analysis of Racial Disparities in HCC by Systems Metabolomics,9598135,U01CA185188,"['alpha-Fetoproteins ', ' α-Fetoproteins ', ' Fetuins ', ' Alpha-Fetoglobulin ', ' Alpha-1-Fetoprotein ', ' Behavior ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Cell Line ', ' cultured cell line ', ' Strains Cell Lines ', ' CellLine ', ' Neoplastic Cell Transformation ', ' neoplastic transformation ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Gas Chromatography ', ' vapor phase chromatography ', ' Clinical Markers ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Enzymes ', ' Enzyme Gene ', ' Genes ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Hepatitis C ', ' non-A, non-B hepatitis ', ' non A, non B hepatitis ', ' hepatitis non A non B ', ' hep C ', ' Hepatitus C ', ' Hepatitis, Viral, Non-A, Non-B, Parenterally-Transmitted ', ' Hepatitis C virus infection ', ' HCV infection ', ' Primary carcinoma of the liver cells ', ' liver carcinoma ', ' Liver Cells Carcinoma ', ' Hepatoma ', ' Hepatocellular cancer ', ' Hepatocellular Carcinoma ', ' Hepatocarcinoma ', ' University Hospitals ', ' In Vitro ', ' Incidence ', ' Liver ', ' hepatic organ system ', ' hepatic body system ', ' Liver Cirrhosis ', ' Hepatic Cirrhosis ', ' Mass Fragmentography ', ' mass fragmentometry ', ' ion trap mass spectrometry ', ' Mass-Gas Chromatography Spectrum Analysis ', ' Mass-Gas Chromatography Spectrometry ', ' Mass Fragmentographies ', ' Gas-Liquid-Mass Spectrometry Chromatography ', ' GCMS ', ' GC MS ', ' Methods ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Polysaccharides ', ' Glycans ', ' Proteins ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Research ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Sensitivity and Specificity ', ' Signal Pathway ', ' Mass Spectrum Analysis ', ' Mass Spectrum Analyses ', ' Mass Spectrum ', ' Mass Spectroscopy ', ' Mass Spectrometry ', ' Mass Photometry/Spectrum Analysis ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Survival Rate ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' United States ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Biological ', ' Biochemical ', ' Chemicals ', ' Liver Cells ', ' Hepatic Parenchymal Cell ', ' Hepatic Cells ', ' Hepatocyte ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' European ', ' participant recruitment ', ' Patient Recruitments ', ' Investigation ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' Xenograft procedure ', ' xeno-transplantation ', ' xeno-transplant ', ' Xenotransplantation ', ' Xenograft ', ' Heterologous Transplantation ', ' Heterograft ', ' American ', ' Cell Proliferation ', ' Cellular Proliferation ', ' Cell Multiplication ', ' Cell Growth in Number ', ' Performance ', ' Participant ', ' ethnic difference ', ' ethnicity difference ', ' Reporting ', ' Gene Proteins ', ' Protein Gene Products ', ' Pathway Analysis ', ' Network Analysis ', ' Sampling ', ' Proteomics ', ' liquid chromatography mass spectrometry ', ' LC/MS ', ' Metabolic Pathway ', ' Tumor stage ', ' T-Stage ', ' metabolomics ', ' metabonomics ', ' metabolism measurement ', ' AFP gene ', ' HPAFP ', ' FETA ', ' AFP ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Stage at Diagnosis ', ' in vivo ', ' Validation ', ' Preparation ', ' cirrhotic ', ' Cirrhosis ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' risk prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' prediction model ', ' computer based prediction ', ' predictive modeling ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' transcriptomics ', ' Network-based ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' healthy volunteer ', ' therapeutic target ', ' network models ', ' high risk ', ' public health relevance ', ' population based ', ' candidate biomarker ', ' candidate marker ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' Biological Markers ', ' cancer initiation ', ' candidate validation ', ' race disparity ', ' disparities in race ', ' racial disparity ', ' potential biological marker ', ' potential biomarker ', ' multi-omics ', ' multiple omics ', ' specific biomarkers ', ' ethnically diverse ', ' ethnic diversity ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' experimental study ', ' recruit ', ' marker validation ', ' biomarker validation ', ' ']",NCI,GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY,U01,2018,67546,0.0776127873449452
"A Follow-up Study for Causes of Cancer in Black Women African-American (AA) women have a higher incidence of many cancers (e.g., colon, pancreas) and higher cancer mortality (e.g., breast, colon, pancreas) relative to other American women, and many of these differences are unexplained. The Black Women's Health Study (BWHS), the largest follow-up study of AA women, was begun in 1995 to provide relevant information on these racial disparities. 59,000 AA women ages 21-69 from 17 states enrolled by completing health questionnaires. The BWHS has successfully followed them for cancer through biennial questionnaires and linkage to 24 cancer registries in the states in which >95% of participants live. Data have been collected on numerous potential risk factors (e.g, medical, reproductive, lifestyle, psychosocial, socioeconomic, air pollution). Cancer diagnoses are validated by hospital and cancer registry pathology data. A DNA/oral microbiome biorepository contains saliva-mouthwash samples from 26,800 participants. Blood sample collection, in progress, has obtained blood samples from 9,300 participants to date (14,000+ expected) . Breast tumor tissue has been collected for 750 incident breast cancers. The study has identified 5,631 incident cancers to date, including 2,651 breast cancers. The study has published extensively on nongenetic and genetic risk factors for breast cancer and other cancers. Because participants were young at baseline (median age = 38), accrual of less common cancers was slow. Participants have now reached ages of high cancer incidence, meaning that sufficient numbers will be accrued for informative assessment. This infrastructure proposal has 3 aims: (1) continue and enhance follow-up and data collection in the BWHS, adding information (including Medicare data) on cancer treatments and outcomes (2) manage and enhance biologic sample collection by adding additional samples to the saliva/mouthwash and blood repositories, collecting tumor tissue for all solid cancers in addition to breast cancer, collecting full-field digital prediagnostic mammograms, and genotyping with a genome-wide array all incident cancer cases for which we have a DNA sample (~2,800) together with an equal number of controls with DNA; (3) share the data in consortial projects. Continuation of the BWHS is a high priority because: a) 89% of participants are still cancer-free due to the young age at baseline; b) follow-up has been successful and unbiased ; c) the BWHS can assess the effects of exposures (e.g., class 2 and class 3 obesity, premature birth, experiences of racism) that are less prevalent in other populations; d) increasingly large numbers are needed to study scientific questions and BWHS genetic, nongenetic, and biospecimen data will contribute to numerous consortia to study a range of cancers; e) the BWHS has a record of high productivity; f) further work is needed to understand numerous racial disparities in cancer incidence and survival. In sum, continuation of the BWHS will contribute appreciably to knowledge about cancer etiology and survival in an underserved population; the biolospecimen and mammogram repositories will contribute greatly to that effort, as will participation in consortial studies. Incidence and mortality rates of many cancers continue to be disproportionately high among AA women. The Black Women's Health Study, a follow-up study of 59,000 AA women, has contributed important information on risk factors for cancer and has obtained blood samples from over 9,300 participants to date and saliva samples (source of DNA and oral microbiome) from 26,800. Continued follow-up, addition of tumor tissue samples, digital images from screening mammograms, and genome-wide SNP data from cancer cases, and participation of the BWHS in collaborative studies, will produce valuable information that can lead to more effective prevention and treatment measures for cancer in AA women.",A Follow-up Study for Causes of Cancer in Black Women,9571225,U01CA164974,"['Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Air Pollution ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Breast ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Censuses ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Colon ', ' Data Analyses ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Collection ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' DNA ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Endometrium ', ' Follow-Up Studies ', ' Followup Studies ', ' Genotype ', ' Health ', ' Medicare ', ' health insurance for disabled ', ' Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Disabled Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Aged and Disabled, Title 18 ', ' Health Status ', ' Level of Health ', ' Hospitals ', ' Incidence ', ' Income ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Kidney ', ' renal ', ' Kidney Urinary System ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Life Style ', ' Lifestyle ', ' Lung ', ' pulmonary ', ' Lung Respiratory System ', ' Mammography ', ' mammographic exams ', ' mammographic examinations ', ' Mammogram ', ' Medical Records ', ' mortality ', ' Mouthwash ', ' Persons ', ' Newsletter ', ' Obesity ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Online Systems ', ' web based ', ' online computer ', ' On-Line Systems ', ' Ovary ', ' Pancreas ', ' Pancreatic ', ' Pathology ', ' Productivity ', ' Publishing ', ' Questionnaires ', ' Rectum ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Saliva ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', "" Women's Health "", ' Female Health ', ' Treatment outcome ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Nonrespondent ', ' Premature Birth ', ' preterm delivery ', ' premature delivery ', ' premature childbirth ', ' Preterm Birth ', ' Prematurely delivering ', ' Pre-term birth ', ' Blood Sample ', ' Blood specimen ', ' specimen collection ', ' sample collection ', ' Solid ', ' Medical ', ' racism ', ' Link ', ' Sample Size ', ' Funding ', ' Solid Tumor ', ' Solid Neoplasm ', ' Knowledge ', ' Source ', ' System ', ' Tumor Tissue ', ' psychosocial ', ' American ', ' digital imaging ', ' computer imaging ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' cohort ', ' Manuscripts ', ' Participant ', ' Prevention ', ' reproductive ', ' neoplasm registry ', ' cancer registry ', ' genetic risk factor ', ' inherited factor ', ' Sampling ', ' repository ', ' cancer therapy ', ' anticancer therapy ', ' anti-cancer therapy ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Treatment ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Therapy ', ' Cancer Treatment ', ' cancer diagnosis ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Tissue Sample ', ' Pancreatic Lymphoma ', ' pancreas lymphoma ', ' Address ', ' Mammary Neoplasms ', ' mammary tumor ', ' Mammary Cancer ', ' Breast Tumors ', ' Breast Neoplasms ', ' Breast Cancer Risk Factor ', ' breast cancer risk ', ' Data ', ' Multiple Cancer Sites ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Sum ', ' Cancer Cause ', ' Cancer Etiology ', ' Collection ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' nonmalignant ', ' Non-Malignant ', ' Tissue Chip ', ' Tissue Arrays ', ' Tissue Microarray ', ' Preparation ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socio-economically ', ' socio-economic ', ' socioeconomics ', ' website ', ' web site ', ' oral microbiome ', ' cost ', ' digital ', ' underserved people ', ' under served population ', ' Underserved Population ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' disparity in cancer ', ' cancer disparity ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' genomewide ', ' genome scale ', ' genome-wide ', ' nongenetic ', ' non-genetic ', ' biorepository ', ' biobank ', ' sharing data ', ' screening ', ' race disparity ', ' disparities in race ', ' racial disparity ', ' Genetic study ', ' Breast Tumor Patient ', ' Breast Cancer Patient ', ' cancer survival ', ' ']",NCI,BOSTON UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CAMPUS,U01,2018,3317576,-0.04888732288836776
"Genetic underpinnings of cardiorenal risk in Africans and African Americans ABSTRACT Hypertension (HTN) has earlier onset and takes on a more severe form in African Americans (AAs) as compared to other U.S. populations, which translates to higher rates of cardiovascular disease (CVD) endpoints including stroke and end stage renal disease. The rates of related comorbidities including type 2 diabetes (T2D) and chronic kidney disease (CKD) are also higher in AAs. These remarkable disparities equate to important consequences for the health of AA communities. Emerging data suggest genetic markers originating in Africa incur disease risk in this population. Prior genetic association studies of HTN, T2D, and CKD have been undertaken in AAs. However, the ancestral genetic variation coverage and sample sizes that have been achieved in genetic studies of European Ancestry populations have not yet been achieved for African ancestry populations. Additionally, a direct comparison of risk alleles between AA and African populations has yet to be made. To address these important research gaps, we propose a study that substantially expands the number of AAs with relevant phenotype and genotype data and dramatically improves the coverage of African specific genetic variation in a large number of AAs belonging to existing cardiovascular epidemiology cohorts. We propose genotyping 8000 AAs from the REasons for Geographic and Racial Differences in Stroke (REGARDS) study and 2000 West Africans from the Human Health and Heredity in Africa (H3A) Kidney Network, newly bringing these 10,000 participants into genetic studies. We will combine these data with existing genotype data from 2000 H3A participants and recently generated high-coverage whole genome sequence (WGS) data on ~6500 AAs, with relevant phenotype data, from the NHLBI’s Trans- Omics for Precision Medicine (TOPMed) program. The TOPMed WGS data will be further used to impute sequence variants into REGARDS, H3A and the ~15,000 previously genotyped AA participants from other NHLBI cohorts. We will use these unprecedented resources to conduct the most comprehensive study of cardiorenal traits (blood pressure, renal function, fasting glucose) in AAs to date. We will follow up our top variant-association findings in an independent replication sample of 11,000 AAs with relevant data. Finally, we will test whether variants associated with these risk factors are also associated with CVD outcomes. Our proposed study, including a total of ~40,500 AAs and 4000 West Africans, will provide us an unprecedented opportunity to evaluate the role of genetic variation, and in particular African-derived genetic variation, in the increased susceptibility to CVD and renal disease in AAs. ! PROJECT NARRATIVE African Americans are overburdened by hypertension and related comorbidities, representing a major area of racial health disparity, with African Americans having higher risk and worse outcomes. The proposed work will identify novel genetic risk factors for various cardiorenal measures in African Americans and Africans.

"Obesity risk in African American women is determined by a diet-by-phenotype interaction Summary  African-American (AA) women are disproportionately burdened by obesity. Our published data have led to the provocative hypothesis that this disparity has physiologic underpinnings. Specifically, AA women are characterized by a high acute insulin secretory response to a glucose challenge, as well as reduced hepatic insulin extraction, which together lead to postprandial circulating insulin concentrations that can be several fold higher than those observed in Caucasian (European-American, EA) women. The lipogenic actions of insulin could favor partitioning of energy to adipose tissue at the expense of ATP (energy) production. In fact, AA women have lower energy requirements than EA women, and are more energetically efficient. High insulin secretion, however, is only one factor that determines insulin action; another major factor is insulin sensitivity. Our data have shown that over time, weight (fat) gain in obesity-prone AA women is higher in those who are more insulin sensitive, whereas “obesity-resistant” (constitutionally lean) AA women have relatively lower insulin sensitivity. Our data also suggest that the lipogenic actions of insulin in AA women are exacerbated by a high-glycemic diet, which promotes insulin secretion. Finally, our data have shown that over time weight (fat) gain in AA women is predicted by the combination of insulin sensitivity and dietary glycemic load. Taken together, these observations suggest that many AA women are predisposed to obesity by their endocrine make-up, and that this predisposition is exacerbated by a high-glycemic diet. A natural corollary of this hypothesis is that for implementation of intentional weight loss, a low- (vs high-) glycemic diet will promote greater loss of body fat, and will enable successful weight loss maintenance by increasing energy expenditure. This corollary is supported by our preliminary data that indicate a 50% greater loss of fat with low- vs high-glycemic diet under controlled conditions in AA women. The project proposed herein will test these hypotheses through a randomized clinical weight loss trial of high- vs low-glycemic diets in obese AA women. The study has both an efficacy phase (controlled feeding during weight loss) to probe physiologic mechanisms (energy expenditure, metabolic efficiency), and an effectiveness phase (6-month free-living follow-up) to test the hypothesis that the low-glycemic diet will be more effective at promoting weight loss maintenance due in part to improved adherence and quality of life, and ease of implementing the diet. This study is innovative in that it proposes to test a specific physiologic mechanism that may underlie propensity to obesity; it includes both efficacy and effectiveness outcomes; it involves both quantitative and qualitative methodology; and it tackles optimization of both weight loss and weight loss maintenance. This study is intended to provide the evidence base necessary to improve the clinical care approach to weight loss. Using a randomized clinical trial intervention study design, we will test the hypothesis that the metabolic phenotype of obese African-American women predisposes them to obesity when they eat a specific type of diet. We predict that women who consume a low glycemic diet will lose more weight and be more successful with maintaining weight loss than women who consome a high glycemic diet, due in part to higher resting and total metabolic rate and lower metabolic efficiency. Results from this study will verify that the high obesity prevalence in African-American women is due to their unique physiology, and will offer a dietary means for preventing and/or reversing obesity not only in this group, but in any individual with similar endocrine characteristics.",Obesity risk in African American women is determined by a diet-by-phenotype interaction,9593960,R01DK115483,"['Adipose tissue ', ' yellow adipose tissue ', ' white adipose tissue ', ' adipose ', ' Fatty Tissue ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Body Composition ', ' Body Weight ', ' Indirect Calorimetry ', ' Respiration Calorimetry ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Diet ', ' dietary ', ' Eating ', ' Food Intake ', ' Energy Metabolism ', ' Energy Expenditure ', ' Exercise stress test ', ' Exercise Test ', ' Fatty acid glycerol esters ', ' Fats ', ' Food ', ' Food or Food Product ', ' Glucose ', ' Dextrose ', ' D-Glucose ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Insulin ', ' Regular Insulin ', ' Novolin R ', ' Humulin R ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' interventions research ', ' interventional study ', ' interventional research ', ' intervention research ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Maintenance ', ' Methodology ', ' Obesity ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' oxidation ', ' Phenotype ', ' Physiology ', ' Production ', ' Publishing ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Research Design ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Rest ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Satiation ', ' satiety ', ' Testing ', ' Thinness ', ' Leanness ', ' Time ', ' Urine ', ' Urine Urinary System ', ' Body Weight decreased ', ' wt-loss ', ' body weight loss ', ' Weight Reduction ', ' Weight Loss ', ' Weight ', ' Caucasians ', ' white race ', ' Occidental ', ' Caucasoid Race ', ' Caucasoid ', ' Caucasian Race ', ' Caucasian ', ' Woman ', ' Measures ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' genetic manipulation ', ' improved ', ' Hepatic ', ' Acute ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' Randomized Clinical Trials ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Predisposition ', ' Individual ', ' European ', ' Low-Fat Diet ', ' Fat-Restricted Diet ', ' Metabolic ', ' Exposure to ', ' Body fat ', ' Pattern ', ' Endocrine ', ' American ', ' Animal Model ', ' model organism ', ' model of animal ', ' Animal Models and Related Studies ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Self-Report ', ' racial difference ', ' race differences ', ' Prevention ', ' Palate ', ' response ', ' insulin sensitivity ', ' insulin secretion ', ' Effectiveness ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Dual-Energy X-Ray Absorptiometry ', ' DXA ', ' DEXA ', ' Adherence ', ' Constitutional ', ' Data ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Monitor ', ' Characteristics ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' obesity treatment ', ' feeding ', ' Outcome ', ' Obesity related disease ', ' Obesity associated disease ', ' Prevalence ', ' prospective ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' resistant ', ' Resistance ', ' obesity risk ', ' clinical care ', ' evidence base ', ' clinical practice ', ' personalized treatment ', ' personalized therapy ', ' personalization of treatment ', ' personalized medicine ', ' race disparity ', ' disparities in race ', ' racial disparity ', ' metabolic rate ', ' metabotype ', ' metabolic phenotype ', ' doubly-labeled water ', ' Total Daily Energy Expenditure ', ' total energy expenditure ', ' ']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,R01,2018,665347,0.09149142548814705
"The OPTIMIZE Study: Optimizing Patient Navigation for Perinatal Care Persistent and worsening racial and ethnic disparities in maternal and infant outcomes in the US are urgent public health concerns. African American (AA) women have about twice the risk of preterm birth and low birthweight compared with non-Hispanic white women and are more likely to suffer from complications of pregnancy and severe maternal morbidity. As these disparities worsen, there has been renewed focus on perinatal care. The perinatal period, those weeks before and after birth, has important implications for a woman's health and that of her child. Unfortunately, the prevailing perinatal standard care model has been stagnant for decades and is not meeting the needs of AA women, especially with consideration to Social Determinants of Health (SDH) and the `fourth trimester' postpartum period proposed by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG). Patient navigation (PN) has demonstrated efficacy in improving consistency of care and addressing SDH among AA women. However, traditional PN models are economically challenging to scale and sustain, suggesting that a PN paradigm shift is needed – one that minimizes the need for in-person navigators and places greater focus on clinic and systems level care improvement that integrates local and federally program support addressing SDH. Building on our decade of work in PN in women's health and care coordination checklists, we propose to develop a learning health care delivery approach to PN centered around an OPTIMIZE integrated and comprehensive perinatal care checklist. OPTIMIZE is highly aligned with ACOG endorsement of checklists for enhancing processes of care and teamwork. Through a Hybrid type 1 cluster randomized effectiveness-implementation trial, we will compare the effectiveness of the OPTIMIZE intervention relative to standard care in improving patient receipt of integrated and comprehensive perinatal care (prenatal content, postpartum content, and SDH content) tailored to a woman's individual needs, while evaluating intervention implementation. N=600 AA women in their 1st or 2nd trimester of pregnancy will be recruited from 20 clinics affiliated with two community health center networks that provide the majority of perinatal care for AA women in Chicago. Clinics will be randomized 1:1 to standard care (control) or standard care plus OPTIMIZE checklist with PN support (intervention) starting from the initial prenatal visit and through 12-weeks postpartum. The OPTIMIZE checklist will scale the reach of navigators by facilitating coordination and integration of efforts across perinatal care domains and integrating a SDH orientation to perinatal care. The checklist, tailored to the workflow within each clinic, will contain prenatal, postpartum, and SDH content for each patient. The primary outcome is patient receipt of perinatal care components in these 3 content areas collected by medical records review. Secondary outcomes include depressive symptoms, breastfeeding, vaccine (Tdap, influenza, HPV) and contraception uptake. The Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research will guide our mixed-methods approach to evaluate intervention implementation and identify implementation facilitators and barriers. PROJECT NARRATIVE African American women and their infants experience profound perinatal health disparities in the US, and these are even more striking in Chicago. We hypothesize that an integrated and comprehensive perinatal care checklist with patient navigation support may help address these disparities, in particular by increasing patient receipt of prenatal care content, postpartum care content, and local and community resources to address social and economic issues. We propose to test this hypothesis by conducting a pragmatic, randomized trial in community health centers to evaluate the effectiveness and implementation of the checklist strategy.",The OPTIMIZE Study: Optimizing Patient Navigation for Perinatal Care,9839026,R01MD014068,"['Anxiety ', ' Attention ', ' Bandage ', ' Birth ', ' Parturition ', ' Breast Feeding ', ' Breastfeeding ', ' Breastfed ', ' Breast fed ', ' Chicago ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Communities ', ' health services delivery ', ' Healthcare Delivery ', ' health care delivery ', ' Economics ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health workforce ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Health Personnel ', ' Hybrids ', ' Infant ', ' low birthweight ', ' low birth weight infant human ', ' low birth weight ', ' Low Birth Weight Infant ', ' wart virus ', ' Infectious Human Wart Virus ', ' Human Papilloma Virus ', ' HPV ', ' Human Papillomavirus ', ' influenza infection ', ' flu infection ', ' Grippe ', ' Influenza ', ' Interview ', ' Learning ', ' Medical Records ', ' Methods ', ' Persons ', ' Patients ', ' pregnancy-related complications ', ' complications during pregnancy ', ' Pregnancy Complications ', ' First Trimester ', ' Early Placental Phase ', ' 1st trimester ', ' First Pregnancy Trimester ', ' Second Trimester ', ' Midtrimester ', ' 2nd trimester ', ' Second Pregnancy Trimester ', ' Pregnancy Trimesters ', ' prenatal visit ', ' prenatal checkup ', ' prenatal appointment ', ' pregnancy care ', ' Prenatal care ', ' Prospective Studies ', ' Public Health ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Testing ', ' Vaccines ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Female Health ', "" Women's Health "", ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' depressive ', ' depression symptom ', ' Emotional Depression ', ' depressive symptoms ', ' Satellite Centers ', ' Community Health Centers ', ' Neighborhood Health Center ', ' post-partum ', ' Postpartum ', ' Postpartum Period ', ' Caring ', ' preterm delivery ', ' premature delivery ', ' premature childbirth ', ' Preterm Birth ', ' Prematurely delivering ', ' Premature Birth ', ' Guidelines ', ' Perinatal ', ' Peripartum ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Evaluation ', ' Postpartum Depression ', ' Postnatal Depression ', ' Post-Partum Depression ', ' Post-Natal Depression ', ' Individual ', ' Perinatal Care ', ' uptake ', ' programs ', ' Frequencies ', ' Scanning ', ' Clinic ', ' System ', ' Services ', ' experience ', ' prenatal ', ' unborn ', ' Contraceptive methods ', ' Inhibition of Fertilization ', ' Fertility Control ', ' Contraception ', ' social ', ' Depression screen ', ' depression screening ', ' multilevel analysis ', ' multilevel modeling ', ' multilevel model ', ' multi-level model ', ' multi-level analysis ', ' methods to study multiple-level influences ', ' Modeling ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Provider ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Low income ', ' Address ', ' Adherence ', ' Age-Years ', ' Data ', ' Effectiveness of Interventions ', ' Human Papilloma Virus Vaccine ', ' Human papillomavirus Vaccine ', ' HPV Vaccine ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists ', ' ACOG ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' Nonhispanic ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Process ', ' informant ', ' implementation trial ', ' implementation research ', ' perinatal health ', ' infant outcome ', ' compare effectiveness ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' group intervention ', ' primary outcome ', ' secondary outcome ', ' standard care ', ' standard treatment ', ' pragmatic trial ', ' social health determinants ', ' randomized trial ', ' Randomization trial ', ' arm ', ' maternal morbidity ', ' perinatal outcomes ', ' postpartum contraception ', ' postpartum contraceptive ', ' post-partum contraceptive ', ' post-partum contraception ', ' postpartum care ', ' post-partum care ', ' recruit ', ' care coordination ', ' coordinating care ', ' treatment arm ', ' intervention arm ', ' perinatal period ', ' perinatal phase ', ' ']",NIMHD,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,R01,2019,617852,0.031884509955337675
"Precision Interception of Aggressive Prostate Cancer in African American Men Abstract Precision Interception of Aggressive Prostate Cancer in African American Men Prostatic adenocarcinoma (PCa) is the most frequently diagnosed non-cutaneous malignancy and a leading cause of male cancer death. African American (AA) men die from PCa at a rate more than double that of men of any other race or ethnicity. The causes of this disparity are multifactorial and certainly include unequal access to screening and treatment. Biological differences in the tumors of AA and non-AA men have also been reported that may reflect underlying tumor differences that may also affect prognosis and treatment choice. Our ability to predict and monitor PCa progression and make better treatment choices in AA men is critical to reducing dispari- ties in PCa among AA men. To address these issues, we propose a “precision interception” approach designed to impede cancer progres- sion at early stages and avoid development of lethal disease in AA PCa cases. Precision interception approach- es use knowledge of molecular signatures and other clinical and epidemiological data to interrupt PCa before it is lethal to the patient. Thus, our proposal will focus on newly diagnosed or recurrent AA PCa patients, with the goal to develop and implement tools that can “intercept” the development of castrate-resistant or metastatic PCa and death from PCa in AA men. These approaches can thereby reduce PCa-specific disparities in mortality ex- perienced by AA men.  We will use the “Men of African Descent and Carcinoma of the Prostate” (MADCaP) network that has substan- tial resources to address disparities in PCa in AA men. The team assembled here has previously collaborated to develop translational research that is led by established basic and clinical experts who have worked together to develop each concept. The result is a novel inter-disciplinary collaboration with the potential to maximize clinical impact on PCa disparities in AA men. An Administration Core and Biosample and Biomarker Core support the projects. The projects and cores integrate community engagement activities, and the Dana Farber Harvard Can- cer Center SPORE in Prostate Cancer, which itself has substantial resources for preclinical and clinical transla- tion. These resources are complemented by the MADCaP Implementation Network (MADCaP-IN) that includes community and inner city clinics that see a substantial proportion of AA PCa cases. The MADCaP-IN will serve as the centers for research participant accrual as well as centers for the implementation of current and future clinical research. We also include a Dvelopmental Research Pilot program that will focus on implementation and dissemination of our research to have maximal impact on communities. Our proposed translational research should have substantial translational/clinical impact, improve management of and outcomes, and reduce PCa disparities in AA men with PCa. PROJECT 1 NARRATIVE This P20 grant will develop knowledge and infrastructure required to address prostate cancer disparities, particularly those that affect African American men.

"Genetic underpinnings of cardiorenal risk in Africans and African Americans ABSTRACT Hypertension (HTN) has earlier onset and takes on a more severe form in African Americans (AAs) as compared to other U.S. populations, which translates to higher rates of cardiovascular disease (CVD) endpoints including stroke and end stage renal disease. The rates of related comorbidities including type 2 diabetes (T2D) and chronic kidney disease (CKD) are also higher in AAs. These remarkable disparities equate to important consequences for the health of AA communities. Emerging data suggest genetic markers originating in Africa incur disease risk in this population. Prior genetic association studies of HTN, T2D, and CKD have been undertaken in AAs. However, the ancestral genetic variation coverage and sample sizes that have been achieved in genetic studies of European Ancestry populations have not yet been achieved for African ancestry populations. Additionally, a direct comparison of risk alleles between AA and African populations has yet to be made. To address these important research gaps, we propose a study that substantially expands the number of AAs with relevant phenotype and genotype data and dramatically improves the coverage of African specific genetic variation in a large number of AAs belonging to existing cardiovascular epidemiology cohorts. We propose genotyping 8000 AAs from the REasons for Geographic and Racial Differences in Stroke (REGARDS) study and 2000 West Africans from the Human Health and Heredity in Africa (H3A) Kidney Network, newly bringing these 10,000 participants into genetic studies. We will combine these data with existing genotype data from 2000 H3A participants and recently generated high-coverage whole genome sequence (WGS) data on ~6500 AAs, with relevant phenotype data, from the NHLBI’s Trans- Omics for Precision Medicine (TOPMed) program. The TOPMed WGS data will be further used to impute sequence variants into REGARDS, H3A and the ~15,000 previously genotyped AA participants from other NHLBI cohorts. We will use these unprecedented resources to conduct the most comprehensive study of cardiorenal traits (blood pressure, renal function, fasting glucose) in AAs to date. We will follow up our top variant-association findings in an independent replication sample of 11,000 AAs with relevant data. Finally, we will test whether variants associated with these risk factors are also associated with CVD outcomes. Our proposed study, including a total of ~40,500 AAs and 4000 West Africans, will provide us an unprecedented opportunity to evaluate the role of genetic variation, and in particular African-derived genetic variation, in the increased susceptibility to CVD and renal disease in AAs. ! PROJECT NARRATIVE African Americans are overburdened by hypertension and related comorbidities, representing a major area of racial health disparity, with African Americans having higher risk and worse outcomes.

"A new approach to controlling chlamydia transmission in young people Abstract Chlamydia trachomatis (Ct) is the most commonly reported sexually transmitted infection in the U.S., is a major cause of infertility, pelvic inflammatory disease and ectopic pregnancy among women and has been associated with increased HIV acquisition. Because women experience the most severe sequelae, the focus of Ct prevention in the U.S. has been on screening sexually active women < 25 years old. Though men are reservoirs of the infection, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have not recommended targeting men due to lack of evidence for this approach. This research will fill this gap. African American (AA) women are 7.5 times more likely to be infected with Ct than whites, thus AA are the focus of this research. We hypothesize that screening AA men is essential to curbing the high rates of Ct among young AA women and that a bundled approach will by synergistic. Our community-based pilot program, called “Check it,” is a pilot- tested male screening program which targeted AA men aged 15-25. At the core of this intervention is male Ct screening, but it is also bundled with other evidence-based and best practices for Ct control including: venue- based sampling (VBS), social network peer referral, modest monetary incentives (MMI), screening of target men, rescreening of target men found to be Ct positive with text reminders (Text-RS) , expedited treatment for index men (EIT) and for the partners (EPT), and Wed-based education (Web-Ed). The goal of this study is to examine the effectiveness of a pilot-tested, bundled Ct prevention program focusing on screening young AA men for the prevention of Ct among young AA women: Aim 1. To determine the impact of Check it on women's Ct rates – This aim has a formative phase and an intervention phase. In the formative phase, the pilot Check it is developed and manualized. In the intervention, Check it is implemented and evaluated. We hypothesize that, post-intervention, Ct rates among AA women in the intervention community will be significantly lower compared to rates in the control communities, and that Check it will result in high rates of index/partner treatment and rescreening. Aim 2. To model the potential impact and optimal coverage needed - Using inputs from this study and the literature, a deterministic population-based epidemiological model will be used to model the number of cases averted by Check it and to determine the potential impact at different intensities of the intervention. Aim 3. To determine the cost effectiveness of Check it - Time motion studies will be conducted and used as inputs for the cost-benefit/effectiveness analysis of the Check it Program in order to distinguish study from program costs. If Check it is found to be effective as hypothesized, we will conduct future translational research to disseminate the program. This research has the potential for practical application by improving reproductive health and high impact by removing disparities in the control of Ct among AA men. . Public Health Significance Rates of Chlamydia trachomatis (Ct), a major cause of reproductive morbidity and potential facilitator of HIV transmission, are 7 times higher among African American (AA) women compared to white women constituting an alarming health disparity. The present approach of screening women only is not working and screening men, the reservoirs of infection, should be considered. The goal of this research is to test the effectiveness (measured, potential and cost) and to translate “Check it”, which is a pilot-tested, bundled seek, test and treat intervention targeting young African American men to reduce infections in young AA women.  ",A new approach to controlling chlamydia transmission in young people,9696392,R01HD086794,"['Affect ', ' Aftercare ', ' post treatment ', ' After-Treatment ', ' After Care ', ' Awareness ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' CDC ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' Charge ', ' bedsonia ', ' Miyagawanella ', ' Chlamydia ', ' Rickettsia trachomae ', ' C. trachomatis ', ' C trachomatis ', ' Chlamydia trachomatis ', ' Communities ', ' Community Pharmacy ', ' cost benefit effectiveness ', ' cost benefit economics ', ' Cost-Benefit Analysis ', ' cost effectiveness ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Future ', ' Geography ', ' Goals ', ' Hair ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' Incentives ', ' indexing ', ' Infection ', ' infertile ', ' fertility loss ', ' fertility cessation ', ' Difficulty conceiving ', ' Cannot achieve a pregnancy ', ' Infertility ', ' Literature ', ' male ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Persons ', ' extrauterine pregnancy ', ' Ectopic Pregnancy ', ' Public Health ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' sex partner ', ' Sexual Partners ', ' Venereal Infections ', ' Venereal Disorders ', ' Venereal Diseases ', ' Sexually Transmitted Infection ', ' Sexually Transmitted Disorder ', ' Sexually Transmitted Diseases ', ' Target Populations ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Time and Motion Studies ', ' Translating ', ' Transportation ', ' Urine Urinary System ', ' Urine ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Social Network ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Phase ', ' Trust ', ' sexually active ', ' Pelvic Inflammatory Disease ', ' pelvic inflammatory syndrome ', ' Fostering ', ' Logistics ', ' Reproductive Health ', ' uptake ', ' Community Networks ', ' programs ', ' Clinic ', ' experience ', ' Structure ', ' Participant ', ' Prevention program ', ' peer ', ' Prevention ', ' Reporting ', ' medical examination ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' social stigma ', ' stigma ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Legal ', ' Educational Materials ', ' High Prevalence ', ' Translational Research ', ' translation research ', ' Translational Science ', ' transmission process ', ' Transmission ', ' Text ', ' Behavioral ', ' post intervention ', ' cost ', ' community intervention ', ' epidemiological model ', ' novel strategies ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel approaches ', ' new approaches ', ' cost effective ', ' aged ', ' man ', "" man's "", ' practical application ', ' application in practice ', ' community organizations ', ' effectiveness measure ', ' evidence base ', ' population based ', ' financial incentive ', ' monetary incentive ', ' financial reward ', ' young man ', ' adolescent men ', ' adolescent man ', ' screening ', ' peer networks ', ' reproductive morbidity ', ' program costs ', ' screening program ', ' routine screening ', ' annual screening ', ' screening guidelines ', ' screening recommendations ', ' recommended screening ', ' ']",NICHD,TULANE UNIVERSITY OF LOUISIANA,R01,2019,574738,0.11128796825787918
"Glucocorticoid signaling, taxane resistance, and prostate cancer mortality disparity African American (AA) men develop highly aggressive prostate tumors and are twice as likely to die of this malignancy than men from other racial backgrounds. Advanced prostate cancer (PCa) is usually treated with androgen deprivation therapy and chemotherapy with taxane drugs. Unfortunately, death occurs once the cancer becomes metastatic and resistant to therapy. Recent studies demonstrate that glucocorticoid receptor (GR) signaling confers resistance to taxane chemotherapy; however, the underlying mechanisms have not been clearly established or studied in the context of health disparities. Glucocorticoids are concurrently administered to PCa patients to mitigate the side effects of therapy, but recent evidence suggests that they may also accelerate disease progression. This poses a serious problem for AA men, who have chronically elevated levels of endogenous glucocorticoids and amplified glucocorticoid signaling compared to European American (EA) men. These observations implicate glucocorticoid signaling as a potential contributor to PCa mortality disparities, and suggest that targeting GR may attenuate therapy resistance in PCa and reduce these disparities. The proposed studies are aimed at mechanistically linking elevated GR signaling with resistance to taxane chemotherapy in PCa, and targeting GR to reverse this resistance. Currently, there is a fundamental lack in our understanding of the impact of GR-induced chemotherapy resistance in the context of racial disparities in prostate cancer mortality. This is caused by critical barriers in the field that include lack of studies linking GR signaling to PCa therapy resistance in the context of health disparities, and limited understanding of molecular mechanisms underlying GR-induced chemotherapy resistance. This proposal addresses these critical barriers by exploring the novel overall hypothesis that GR signaling is enhanced in AA prostate tumors and promotes chemotherapy resistance by upregulating stress survival genes. The hypothesis is supported by preliminary data suggesting that GR signaling robustly induces the expression of the chemoresistance- associated proteins LEDGF/p75 and Clusterin in AA-derived cell lines. We will evaluate our overall hypothesis through two specific aims: Aim 1. Test the hypothesis that GR directly induces chemoresistance in PCa cells by upregulating stress survival proteins. This will be explored in mechanistic studies using AA and EA cellular and xenograft models of PCa. Aim 2. Test the hypothesis that GR signaling is elevated in AA men with PCa, leading to increased expression and circulation of stress survival proteins. This will be explored by examining the expression of GR in prostate tumor tissues from AA and EA patients, as well as the circulating levels of LEDGF/p75 and Clusterin in AA and EA men with and without PCa. These exploratory and innovative studies use a mechanistic approach to establish the role of GR signaling in promoting chemotherapy resistance in PCa in the context of health disparities. The results from these studies will identify new targets for therapies designed to attenuate GR driven chemoresistance in PCa, resulting in reduction of these disparities. Narrative Prostate Cancer mortality disparities are having a major impact in the U.S. by disproportionally affecting the African American male population. The proposed studies use mechanistic approaches to establish the contribution of glucocorticoid receptor signaling to chemotherapy resistance in advanced prostate cancer in the context of the racial disparities in mortality associated with this malignancy. The results from these studies will identify potential targets for novel therapeutic strategies that could be designed to attenuate glucocorticoid receptor-driven chemoresistance, resulting in reduction of these disparities.","Glucocorticoid signaling, taxane resistance, and prostate cancer mortality disparity",9727241,R21CA226654,"['Acceleration ', ' Affect ', ' Aging ', ' Blood Circulation ', ' Circulation ', ' Bloodstream ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' cultured cell line ', ' Strains Cell Lines ', ' CellLine ', ' Cell Line ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cells ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' diabetes ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Genes ', ' Glucocorticoids ', ' stress protein ', ' Heat shock proteins ', ' In Vitro ', ' male ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' mortality ', ' Patients ', ' Pharmacology ', ' pilot study ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' Prostatic Neoplasia ', ' Prostate Tumor ', ' Prostate Neoplasms ', ' Prostatic Neoplasms ', ' Proteins ', ' Androgen Receptor ', ' Glucocorticoid Receptor ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Stress ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Upregulation ', ' Up-Regulation ', ' testosterone-repressed prostate message-2 protein ', ' ionizing radiation-induced protein-8 ', ' complement-associated protein SP-40,40 protein ', ' complement lysis inhibitor ', ' clusterin ', ' apolipoprotein J ', ' apoJ protein ', ' XIP8 protein ', ' X-ray-inducible protein 8 ', ' TRPM2 ', ' TRPM-2 protein ', ' SP 40,40 protein ', ' SGP2 ', ' SGP-2 protein ', ' MAC393 antigen ', ' sulfated glycoprotein 2 ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Link ', ' taxane ', ' Serum ', ' Blood Serum ', ' European ', ' Disease Progression ', ' Genetic ', ' Attenuated ', ' Malignant neoplasm of prostate ', ' Prostatic Cancer ', ' Prostate Cancer ', ' Prostate CA ', ' Malignant prostatic tumor ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Prostate ', ' Life ', ' Event ', ' Tumor Tissue ', ' American ', ' advanced disease ', ' advanced illness ', ' novel ', ' Bypass ', ' transcriptional coactivator p75 ', ' p75 transcription factor ', ' p75 ', ' Modeling ', ' glucocorticoid-induced orphan receptor ', ' receptor GPR83 ', ' glucocorticoid-induced receptor ', ' GIR receptor ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Pre-Clinical Model ', ' Preclinical Models ', ' Receptor Signaling ', ' Cancer Patient ', ' Tissue Microarray ', ' Tissue Chip ', ' Tissue Arrays ', ' Xenograft Model ', ' Molecular ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' therapy resistant ', ' treatment resistance ', ' therapeutic resistance ', ' resistant to therapy ', ' resistance to therapy ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Population ', ' Prostate Cancer therapy ', ' prostate cancer treatment ', ' Prostate CA therapy ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' disparity in cancer ', ' cancer disparity ', ' Resistance ', ' resistant ', ' Cell model ', ' Cellular model ', ' chemotherapy ', ' therapy design ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' tumor ', ' new therapeutic target ', ' novel therapy target ', ' novel therapeutic target ', ' novel pharmacotherapy target ', ' novel druggable target ', ' novel drug target ', ' new therapy target ', ' new pharmacotherapy target ', ' new druggable target ', ' new drug target ', ' transcriptome sequencing ', ' RNAseq ', ' RNA sequencing ', ' RNA Seq ', ' prostate cancer cell ', ' prostate tumor cell ', ' prostate cancer model ', ' prostate tumor model ', ' racial disparity ', ' race disparity ', ' disparities in race ', ' prostate cancer cell line ', ' disparity reduction ', ' reduce disparity ', ' mortality disparity ', ' disparities in mortality ', ' liquid biopsy ', ' androgen deprivation therapy ', ' androgen deprivation treatment ', ' androgen ablation therapy ', ' side effect ', ' ']",NCI,LOMA LINDA UNIVERSITY,R21,2019,171825,-0.0765619821049586
"Evaluation of molecular determinants of racial disparity in triple-negative breast cancer PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a very aggressive subtype with limited therapeutic options. Intriguingly, women of African American (AA) origin have much higher TNBC-related mortality rates compared to European American (EA) women. This difference is evident even after adjusting for socioeconomic status and access to care, indicating a biological basis. TNBC tumors in AA women exhibit higher rate of growth and metastasis in comparison to TNBC in EA women. There is an urgent need to understand the molecular mechanisms involved in aggressive progression and increased metastatic potential of AA-TNBC. In our preliminary studies, we observed that AA-TNBC cells have higher invasion and migration potential in comparison to EA-TNBC cells showing inherently aggressive nature of AA-TNBC. In a preliminary screen, we found that a large percentage of AA-TNBC tumors exhibit loss-of-tumor suppressor Liver Kinase B1 (LKB1) in comparison to EA-TNBC tumors. Our preliminary microarray studies also found that LKB1-loss in AA-TNBC results in activation of oncoproteins- YAP and TAZ. Our data suggest that with inherent loss of LKB1, AA-TNBC gain `an oncogenic input' in the form of activated YAP-TAZ signaling. Using in vitro studies, clinical AA-TNBC and EA-TNBC samples and patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models, we will test our hypothesis that inherent LKB1-loss in AA-TNBC results in activation of oncogenic YAP-TAZ signaling leading to aggressive progression and increased metastatic potential of AA-TNBC. Our novel findings also suggest that AA-TNBC tumors may be vulnerable to therapeutic strategies directed at YAP-TAZ inhibition. Based on our strong preliminary data, we will investigate how loss of LKB1 in AA-TNBC might lead to acquisition of higher YAP-TAZ, and drive growth and metastasis of AA-TNBC cells. We will also analyze AA-TNBC and EA-TNBC tumors to establish LKB1-loss and elevated YAP-TAZ as biomarkers of aggressive progression of AA-TNBC. We will utilize these biological insights to test and propose safe and effective therapeutic strategies to target AA-TNBC. Using patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models, we propose to investigate whether AA-TNBCs are particularly susceptible to YAP-TAZ inhibition strategies and whether currently clinically available drugs (screened from a drug library) can be repurposed to target YAP-TAZ in AA-TNBC. Secondly, we plan to examine whether Honokiol, a natural compound from Magnolia grandiflora, (selected from a screen of known bioactive compounds) and its novel analogs have the potential to inhibit YAP-TAZ in AA-TNBC. Our studies will provide new understanding how loss-of-LKB1 and gain-of-YAP-TAZ in AA-TNBC form a relentless axis that drives AA-TNBC. These studies will provide novel insight into molecular mechanisms underlying racial disparity in TNBC and provide a novel set of biomarkers and potential drug-targets to develop novel ways to reduce the disparity in clinical outcome of AA and EA TNBC patients. Project Narrative Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) in African American (AA) women is more aggressive than TNBC in European American (EA); 5-year relative survival for AA-TNBC is only 14% in comparison to 36% for EA- TNBC therefore it is imperative to understand the underlying molecular mechanisms leading to this racial disparity. Using in vitro studies, clinical AA-TNBC and EA-TNBC samples and patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models, we will test our hypothesis that inherent LKB1-loss in AA-TNBC tumors results in activation of oncoprotein- YAP-TAZ leading to ‘oncogene addiction’ and aggressive tumor progression. These studies will provide novel insight into molecular mechanisms underlying racial disparity in TNBC and provide a novel set of biomarkers and potential drug-targets to develop novel ways to reduce

"Racial Disparity in Bladder Cancer and Identification of Altered Metabolism in African American Compare to European Bladder Cancer Project Summary/Abstract It has known that bladder cancer (BCa) mortality is higher in African American patients. Disparity exists between African-American (AA) and European-American (EA), in the clinical outcome of BCa. The long-term objective of our research plan is to reduce the disproportionate effects of bladder cancer (BCa) on African American. A guiding principle of our methodology is that alterations in mitochondrial metabolites exist between African American and European American BCa and that these differences can explain, in part, BCa health disparity. In this application, we propose to use the technique of metabolomic profiling to uncover these underlying differences. To date, a metabolomic analyses aimed at understanding of bladder cancer health disparity has not been reported. We have recently published the first study describing metabolic alterations associated with bladder cancer. In preliminary studies, we have profiled the metabolome of BCa from AA and EA patients and identified a distinct AA race-specific expression pattern in mitochondrial metabolites and lipids. In this proposal, we will i) characterize the mitochondrial associated metabolites in AA and EA BCa, ii) verify the D-2HG and associated enzymes (GLS, ADHFE1, and IDH1/2) in BCa patients and establish a therapeutically targeted deregulation pathway for glutamine metabolism in AA BCa iii) assess the levels of lyso PC and PC and the function of their metabolizing enzymes PLA1A and LRAT in AA BCa. The successful completion of the proposed studies will have a significant impact in the field of Bladder cancer health disparity and metabolism. Importantly, findings from our study have the potential to reveal racially exclusive metabolic markers and therapeutic targets for BCa. Taken together, the information gleaned from this proposal could rapidly revolutionize current diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutic approaches by revealing the biological underpinnings of bladder cancer health disparity. Project Narrative This proposal expects to develop a panel of mitochondrial metabolic markers in tissues and urine.

"The Impact of the Intrauterine and Early Childhood Environments on Neurocognitive and Metabolic Development in African American Youth: Focus on the Gut-Brain Axis PROJECT ABSTRACT  Environmental exposures during the critical prenatal and early childhood periods can result in lifelong health consequences. Mechanisms underlying these exposure-health relationships are complex, with exogenous exposures (such as chemical toxicants, infectious agents, diet) and endogenous processes (such as gene expression, inflammation and oxidative stress) activating metabolic pathways that lead to adverse health outcomes. Both adverse exposures and their health consequences disproportionately impact African American (AA) women and children, highlighting that health disparities begin in utero and are amplified postnatally. Among outcomes disproportionately experienced by AA children are preterm birth, neurodevelopmental deficits, and obesity – all linked to environmental exposures, yet poorly understood due to their etiologic complexity. Our team is currently investigating preterm birth and neurodevelopment through 18-months in relation to pre- and postnatal exposures to environmental toxicants and biopsychosocial risk factors in cohorts of pregnant AA women (R01NR014800, R01MD009064) and their infants (R01MD009746) and via our P50 Children's Center (P50ES026071) in collaboration with the Emory HERCULES Exposome Research Center (P30 ES019776).  Through ECHO, we propose to elucidate exposures and risk pathways that contribute to neurodevelopmental deficits and obesity in preschool aged AA children by: (1) Assembling an Atlanta ECHO cohort of ~440 AA socioeconomically diverse mother-child pairs by combining extant cohorts for whom the prenatal, perinatal, and early childhood environments are, or will be, characterized; (2) Completing the analysis and synthesis of data from the Atlanta ECHO cohort to characterize mother-child pairs in terms of prenatal and early childhood exposures (toxicants, stressors and neuroendocrine-immune activation, nutritional and metabolic status, microbiome and infections, bonding and interaction); epigenetic and metabolomic profiles; and perinatal outcomes (gestational age, size-for-gestation); (3) Testing cohort-specific hypotheses related to prenatal and early childhood exposures and neurodevelopmental outcomes and obesity in AA children at 2, 3, 4, and 5 years of age; (4) Participating in ECHO-wide consortium studies to identify risk and protective factors that moderate associations between environmental exposures, typical growth and development, and adverse child health outcomes. Our cohort's participation in the ECHO consortium will contribute to a biopsychosocial understanding of within- and between-race risk for adverse child health outcomes, providing insight into risk and protective factors relevant to AA families. The proposed research is consistent with frameworks for eliminating racial disparities, which recognize the need to study risks within-race as a vital first step, and is congruent with the National Institute of Minority Health and Health Disparities goal of promoting understanding of the biological mechanisms involved in conditions that disproportionately affect health disparity populations. PROJECT NARRATIVE Both adverse environmental exposures and their health consequences disproportionately impact African American (AA) women and children, highlighting that health disparities begin in utero and are amplified postnatally. AA children are more likely to experience preterm birth, neurodevelopmental deficits, and obesity – all linked to environmental exposures, yet poorly understood due to their etiologic complexity. Our goal is to use a sociodemographically diverse Atlanta ECHO cohort of AA mother-child pairs to study the mechanistic pathways through which early life exogenous and endogenous exposures contribute to neurodevelopmental deficits and obesity in preschool aged AA children in order to guide future prevention and intervention efforts.",The Impact of the Intrauterine and Early Childhood Environments

"The Role of Inflammation in the Racial Disparities in Ovarian Cancer Survival ABSTRACT This application will provide the candidate, Dr. Peres, with the necessary career development and research experiences to propel her career as an independent molecular cancer epidemiologist. Dr. Peres’ long-term career goal is to integrate the fields of cancer epidemiology and molecular biology to disentangle the independent and joint effects of molecular and environmental risk factors on cancer etiology and prognosis, with a special emphasis on how these factors influence health disparities. Epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) is the deadliest gynecologic malignancy in the U.S. and African American (AA) women have a much poorer prognosis in comparison to women of European ancestry (EA). The contributing factors to this survival disparity are relatively unknown, and research in this area is in its infancy due to the small numbers of AA women in existing epidemiologic studies on EOC. Given the suggested link between chronic inflammation and EOC etiology and prognosis coupled with the observed differences in biomarkers of inflammation by race, we posit that differences in inflammation may be contributing to the EOC survival gap in AA women. The proposed research will capitalize on two existing population-based case-control studies, the African American Cancer Epidemiology Study (AACES) and the North Carolina Ovarian Cancer Study (NCOCS), to evaluate how the independent and joint effects of systemic and local inflammation in the tumor microenvironment influences EOC prognosis among AA women and whether differences in these inflammatory biomarkers are contributing to the racial survival disparity in EOC. Leukocyte cell type and distribution will be used as markers of systemic and local inflammation. Circulating leukocytes will be obtained from the complete blood cell count at diagnosis and a peripheral blood sample obtained after diagnosis. Leukocyte proportions will be inferred from peripheral blood DNA methylation data (Illumina MethylationEPIC BeadChip) using cell mixture deconvolution methods. To measure local inflammation, we will use immunohistochemistry to obtain counts of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (FOXP3, CD3, CD8) and neutrophils (CD66b) within the primary tumor and measure the Klintrup score, a general marker of overall inflammation with the tumor and within each leukocyte cell type. Lastly, we will evaluate whether inflammatory-related exposures (e.g., obesity, analgesic medication use, genital body powder exposure) contribute to systemic and/or local inflammation, and whether these biomarkers are mediators of the relationship between inflammatory-related exposures and EOC survival. In order to achieve the proposed research objectives, Dr. Peres will obtain additional knowledge in cancer epigenetics, molecular biology and bioinformatics through her training and career development activities as well as the mentoring provided by her interdisciplinary advisory committee. The proposed research will improve our understanding of the contributing factors to poor EOC survival among AA women and will likely have a considerable impact on our over-arching goal of reducing the existing racial survival disparity in EOC. PROJECT NARRATIVE Ovarian cancer is the fifth leading cause of cancer deaths among U.S. women. African American women experience the worst ovarian cancer survival, yet the causes of this racial survival disparity are not fully understood. We propose to evaluate how systemic and local inflammation, as well as their interplay, influences ovarian cancer prognosis among African American women and whether differences in these inflammatory markers are contributing to the racial survival disparity in ovarian cancer. This study will improve our overall understanding of ovarian cancer prognosis in African American women, to which little is known, as well as provide valuable data that can inform the applicability of

"Prostate Cancer Susceptibility Gene Identification in Chromosome 5 Candidate Region There are well documented, marked racial disparities in prostate cancer (PCa) incidence and mortality in the United States between African American (AA) and European American (EA) men. These disparities cannot be fully explained by differences in screening or treatment differences by race, and other environmental and biological risk factors have not been well characterized. We hypothesize that racial differences in the distribution of genetic risk factors may contribute to the observed disparities. We recently identified a region on chromosome 5q35 that is associated with PCa in AA men. Preliminary analyses in this region have suggested two loci involved in chromatin regulation, and several genes including COL23A1, TSPAN17, and GRM6. These are genes that have not been well characterized in the literature, however hints of their role in PCa can be found within previous expression studies. Here, we propose to examine the region on chromosome 5q35 in greater depth, using both gene mapping and gene function analyses. In Aim 1, we will perform fine mapping in this region in a much larger set of AA men (2241 cases, 1808 controls) from multiple existing data sources to identify candidate susceptibility loci. We will then perform validation analyses in an independent set of 600 AA cases and 1650 controls and in a second independent sample of 700 cases and 700 controls from the NCI Ghana Prostate Study. Results will be combined across studies using meta-analysis. Aim 2 will explore the functional significance of the top candidate genes identified in our prior work and in Aim 1, including COL23A1 and TSPAN17, using banked tissue samples (Aim 2.A) and cell lines (Aim 2.B). For Aim 2.A, Expression of mRNA will be assessed in 112 fresh frozen PCa samples selected to represent EA men, AA men, high Gleason grade (GG, >4+3) and low GG (<3+4) equally. Protein expression will be assessed using IHC in paraffin embedded PCa samples, using the same race/grade sampling method. For Aim 2.B, multiple cell lines representing a range of PCa aggressiveness and both EA and AA origin will be used to evaluate protein expression and biological function of these proteins. Protein expression will be determined using immunoblot analysis. If clinical data suggest the candidate gene is overexpressed in PCa, we will knock it down, and if expression is lost in PCa we will overexpress it. We will perform cell growth, transformation, migration and invasion assays to determine if altering gene expression will regulate cellular function. We will also perform cell counting assays to measure cell growth over an eight day period. Soft agar and clonogenic assays will be used to assay transformation. Boyden chamber assays will be used to assess changes in migration and invasion. Study results will provide insight into genetic risk factors for PCa that might help explain racial disparities in incidence and mortality and thereby provide biological targets for reducing these disparities. The co-PIs have successfully collaborated on a similar project examining a different region on chromosome 7q31. This study will provide insight into genetic risk factors for prostate cancer through a thorough interrogation of a susceptibility region of the genome on 5q35 previously identified in a sample of African American men. These genes may help explain racial disparities in incidence and mortality. Understanding genes involved in PCa carcinogenesis and progression in African American men will provide biological targets for reducing these disparities.",Prostate Cancer Susceptibility Gene Identification in Chromosome 5 Candidate Region,9716610,R21CA220311,"['Affect ', ' Agar ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Cell Number ', ' Cell Count ', ' Cellular Growth ', ' Cellular Expansion ', ' cell growth ', ' cultured cell line ', ' Strains Cell Lines ', ' CellLine ', ' Cell Line ', ' Subcellular Process ', ' Cellular Process ', ' Cellular Physiology ', ' Cellular Function ', ' Cell Process ', ' Cell Function ', ' Cell physiology ', ' Chromatin ', ' genetic mapping ', ' Total Human and Non-Human Gene Mapping ', ' Linkage Mapping ', ' Gene Mapping Genetics ', ' Gene Mapping ', ' Gene Localization ', ' Chromosome Mapping ', ' Chromosomes ', ' Chromosome 5 ', ' Chromosomes, Human, Pair 5 ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Data Sources ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' DNA ', ' Freezing ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Genes ', ' Genome ', ' Gold Coast ', ' Ghana ', ' Incidence ', ' Literature ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Methods ', ' mortality ', ' Prostatic Gland ', ' Prostate Gland ', ' Prostate ', ' Publishing ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Risk Factors ', ' mRNA ', ' Messenger RNA ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Tissue Collection ', ' Tissue Banks ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Tissues ', ' Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' United States ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Paraffin Embedding ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' base ', ' Blood specimen ', ' Blood Sample ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Biological ', ' Predisposition ', ' Susceptibility ', ' insight ', ' African ', ' European ', ' Databases ', ' data base ', ' Data Bases ', ' Biological Process ', ' Biological Function ', ' gene function ', ' Gleason Grade for Prostate Cancer ', ' Gleason-SC ', ' Gleason Sum ', ' Gleason Score for Prostate Cancer ', ' Gleason Score ', ' Gleason Grade ', ' Malignant neoplasm of prostate ', ' Prostatic Cancer ', ' Prostate Cancer ', ' Prostate CA ', ' Malignant prostatic tumor ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Prostate ', ' Source ', ' American ', ' carcinogenesis ', ' Cancer Induction ', ' Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction ', ' reverse transcriptase PCR ', ' RTPCR ', ' RT-PCR ', ' racial difference ', ' race differences ', ' genetic risk factor ', ' inherited factor ', ' Regulation ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' case control ', ' Genomics ', ' Cancer-Predisposing Gene ', ' Cancer Susceptibility Gene ', ' Meta-Analysis ', ' Data Pooling ', ' Clinical Trial Overviews ', ' cell bank ', ' protein expression ', ' Tissue Sample ', ' Candidate Disease Gene ', ' Candidate Gene ', ' Data ', ' Data Element ', ' Immunoblot Analysis ', ' Regulatory Element ', ' mRNA Expression ', ' Chromatin Structure ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Validation ', ' Characteristics ', ' follow-up ', ' followup ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' active followup ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' protein function ', ' deep sequencing ', ' genome wide association study ', ' whole genome association study ', ' whole genome association studies ', ' whole genome association analysis ', ' genomewide association study ', ' genomewide association studies ', ' genomewide association scan ', ' genome wide association studies ', ' genome wide association scan ', ' genome wide association ', ' GWAS ', ' GWA study ', ' cost ', ' Population ', ' migration ', ' Susceptibility Gene ', ' susceptibility variant ', ' susceptibility locus ', ' susceptibility allele ', ' predisposing gene ', ' Predisposition gene ', ' overexpression ', ' overexpress ', ' risk variant ', ' risk locus ', ' risk loci ', ' risk genotype ', ' risk gene ', ' risk allele ', ' Risk-associated variant ', ' screening ', ' racial disparity ', ' race disparity ', ' disparities in race ', ' prostate cancer cell line ', ' targeted sequencing ', ' admixture mapping ', ' disparity reduction ', ' reduce disparity ', ' prostate cancer risk ', ' ']",NCI,WAYNE STATE UNIVERSITY,R21,2019,193759,-0.02572341348689715
"The Role of The Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System, ARMC5, and Neprilysin in Glucose Metabolism among African Americans PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Joshua J. Joseph, MD, is an Assistant Professor in the Division of Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism at The Ohio State University. Dr. Joseph seeks a Mentored Patient- Oriented Research Career Development Award in order to obtain the skills, knowledge, and mentored research experience that are essential for a career as a clinician scientist in the field of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) prevention. This proposal is aimed at determining the role of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) in glucose metabolism and the development of T2DM among African Americans (AAs). AAs are 1.7 times as likely to develop T2DM in the US and are twice as likely to die from T2DM compared to non-Hispanic whites. Thus, this represents an area of critical need. The objectives of this proposal are to determine the role of the RAAS, endothelin-1, ARMC5 (armadillo repeat containing 5) and RAAS antagonism in glucose metabolism and the development of diabetes. The specific aims of this research proposal are: (1) to determine the associations of aldosterone and endothelin-1, individually and combined, with HOMA-insulin resistance, HOMA-β cell function, fasting plasma glucose and incident T2DM among AAs without T2DM at baseline in the Jackson Heart Study (JHS); (2) to determine a) the cross-sectional associations of predicted damaging ARMC5 mutations with plasma aldosterone, plasma renin activity, fasting glucose, and prevalent T2DM and b) the longitudinal association with incident T2DM among AAs in the JHS; (3) to determine the impact of RAAS antagonism or RAAS and neprilysin antagonism vs. placebo with changes in glucose metabolism over 6 months assessed via glucose clamp studies among AAs. For Aim 1, we propose predictive epidemiological analyses in the JHS, an observational investigation of cardiovascular disease among AAs, to determine the association of a combination of aldosterone and endothelin-1 with glucose metabolism, prevalent and incident T2DM. For Aim 2, we propose genetic analyses in the JHS, to determine the association of ARMC5 genetic variants with components of glucose metabolism, prevalent and incident T2DM. For Aim 3, we propose a 26- week clinical trial to test the effect of RAAS antagonism on β-cell function and insulin resistance in AAs with impaired glucose tolerance. The goals during the award period include developing expertise in the design, performance, analysis and presentation of clinical research through mentored research, didactic coursework, and formal training in clinical investigation of glucose metabolism, clinical trial methodology, genetic, genomic and other –omic analytic techniques and predictive/causal modeling. Long-term career goals include developing a career as an independent investigator focused on finding new approaches for preventing and treating T2DM, particularly among historically understudied populations in biomedical research. The proposed research aims to provide new insights into the contribution of the RAAS to changes in glucose metabolism in the development of T2DM.

"Analysis of Racial Disparities in HCC by Systems Metabolomics ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a significant health problem in the United States. Compared to European Americans (EA), the incidence of HCC is higher in African Americans (AA) and is associated with more advanced tumor stage at diagnosis and lower survival rates. It has been reported that the sensitivity of α- fetoprotein (AFP) for the diagnosis of HCC in African Americans with hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is lower than that of patients of all other racial groups combined. We previously performed preliminary investigation into racial disparities through metabolomics profiling of sera from HCC cases and patients with liver cirrhosis by using both liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Through stratified analysis of the LC/GC-MS data, we identified different candidates that distinguish HCC cases from the cirrhotic controls among AA and EA. This application builds on these promising preliminary results to find and validate race-specific metabolites as biomarkers for HCC. This will be accomplished by targeted analysis of metabolites in liver tissues and sera from HCC cases and patients with liver cirrhosis representing AA and EA. Metabolites that differentiate HCC cases from cirrhotic controls in a race-specific manner will be selected by statistical and network-based methods. Then, a systems-oriented approach that combines these metabolites with other candidate biomarkers (genes, glycans, and proteins) will be utilized for the selection of key signaling pathways perturbed in HCC. Following validation of the candidates via independent samples from HCC cases, patients with liver cirrhosis, and healthy subjects, we will elucidate their functional roles through both in vitro and in vivo experiments. Successful completion of this research will enable us to identify HCC biomarkers and perturbed pathways that are race-specific as well as those that are shared by AA and EA. These findings will contribute not only to a greater understanding of racial disparities in HCC but also to improving diagnosis of HCC through race-specific biomarkers. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Currently used biomarkers for detecting hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in high-risk cirrhotic patients lack the desired sensitivity and specificity, particularly in African American patients. The goal of this project is to find and validate race-specific biomarkers for HCC and identify perturbed intercellular signaling pathways in HCC. If successful, the study will (1) contribute to a greater understanding of racial disparities in HCC, (2) enable accurate detection of HCC by using race as a factor, and (3) give insights into the mechanisms underlying the behavior of potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets.",Analysis of Racial Disparities in HCC by Systems Metabolomics,9730389,U01CA185188,"['alpha-Fetoproteins ', ' α-Fetoproteins ', ' Fetuins ', ' Alpha-Fetoglobulin ', ' Alpha-1-Fetoprotein ', ' Behavior ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' cultured cell line ', ' Strains Cell Lines ', ' CellLine ', ' Cell Line ', ' neoplastic transformation ', ' Neoplastic Cell Transformation ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cells ', ' vapor phase chromatography ', ' Gas Chromatography ', ' Clinical Markers ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Enzyme Gene ', ' Enzymes ', ' Genes ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' non-A, non-B hepatitis ', ' non A, non B hepatitis ', ' hepatitis non A non B ', ' hep C ', ' Hepatitus C ', ' Hepatitis, Viral, Non-A, Non-B, Parenterally-Transmitted ', ' Hepatitis C virus infection ', ' HCV infection ', ' Hepatitis C ', ' liver carcinoma ', ' Liver Cells Carcinoma ', ' Hepatoma ', ' Hepatocellular cancer ', ' Hepatocellular Carcinoma ', ' Hepatocarcinoma ', ' Primary carcinoma of the liver cells ', ' University Hospitals ', ' In Vitro ', ' Incidence ', ' hepatic organ system ', ' hepatic body system ', ' Liver ', ' Hepatic Cirrhosis ', ' Liver Cirrhosis ', ' mass fragmentometry ', ' ion trap mass spectrometry ', ' Mass-Gas Chromatography Spectrum Analysis ', ' Mass-Gas Chromatography Spectrometry ', ' Mass Fragmentographies ', ' Gas-Liquid-Mass Spectrometry Chromatography ', ' GCMS ', ' GC MS ', ' Mass Fragmentography ', ' Methods ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Glycans ', ' Polysaccharides ', ' Proteins ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Research ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Sensitivity and Specificity ', ' Signal Pathway ', ' Mass Spectrum Analyses ', ' Mass Spectrum ', ' Mass Spectroscopy ', ' Mass Spectrometry ', ' Mass Photometry/Spectrum Analysis ', ' Mass Spectrum Analysis ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Survival Rate ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Tissues ', ' United States ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Biological ', ' Biochemical ', ' Chemicals ', ' Hepatocyte ', ' Liver Cells ', ' Hepatic Parenchymal Cell ', ' Hepatic Cells ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' European ', ' Patient Recruitments ', ' participant recruitment ', ' Investigation ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' Xenograft procedure ', ' xeno-transplantation ', ' xeno-transplant ', ' Xenotransplantation ', ' Xenograft ', ' Heterologous Transplantation ', ' Heterograft ', ' American ', ' Cell Proliferation ', ' Cellular Proliferation ', ' Cell Multiplication ', ' Cell Growth in Number ', ' Performance ', ' Participant ', ' ethnic difference ', ' ethnicity difference ', ' Reporting ', ' Gene Proteins ', ' Protein Gene Products ', ' Pathway Analysis ', ' Network Analysis ', ' Sampling ', ' Proteomics ', ' liquid chromatography mass spectrometry ', ' LC/MS ', ' Metabolic Pathway ', ' T-Stage ', ' Tumor stage ', ' metabonomics ', ' metabolism measurement ', ' metabolomics ', ' AFP gene ', ' HPAFP ', ' FETA ', ' AFP ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Stage at Diagnosis ', ' in vivo ', ' Validation ', ' Preparation ', ' Cirrhosis ', ' cirrhotic ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' predictive modeling ', ' prognostic model ', ' prediction model ', ' computer based prediction ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' transcriptomics ', ' Network-based ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' healthy volunteer ', ' therapeutic target ', ' network models ', ' high risk ', ' public health relevance ', ' population based ', ' candidate marker ', ' candidate biomarker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' cancer initiation ', ' candidate validation ', ' racial disparity ', ' race disparity ', ' disparities in race ', ' potential biomarker ', ' potential biological marker ', ' multiple omics ', ' multiomics ', ' specific biomarkers ', ' ethnic diversity ', ' ethnically diverse ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' recruit ', ' biomarker validation ', ' marker validation ', ' Multiomic Data ', ' multiple omic data ', ' ']",NCI,GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY,U01,2019,248238,0.0776127873449452
"HSET as a racial disparity biomarker for TNBC patients ABSTRACT! African ancestry is a risk factor for worse outcomes in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). Nevertheless, prognostic tools and treatment regimens are no different for African American (AA) than European American (EA) TNBC patients. Personalizing medicine for AA TNBC patients has been hindered by the fact that this population is highly admixed, so self-reported race often does not accurately reflect African genetic ancestry. There is also a dearth of studies that have analyzed tumor biomarkers and clinical outcomes using ancestry- genotyped TNBC specimens. Furthermore, few preclinical TNBC studies consider race in experimental design, and AA TNBC patients are markedly underrepresented in clinical trials. A critical barrier to progress in improving outcomes for AA TNBC patients is a lack of prognostic tools and treatment modalities that have been precisely tailored to this patient population. The broad, long-range goal of this project is to enable development of precision medicine for AA TNBC patients by advancing knowledge of the utility of nuclear HSET (nHSET) as a prognostic biomarker for AA TNBCs as well as the molecular mechanisms of racial disparities in TNBC aggressiveness and how they can be targeted. Our lab has uncovered that HSET more strongly promotes proliferation and migration of AA than EA TNBC cell lines. In addition, nHSET independently predicts poor outcomes in AA but not EA TNBCs, but this must be validated after accounting for percent African genetic ancestry in multivariable survival models and in native African TNBCs. Our proposed project has three aims. First, the proportion of African genetic ancestry will be determined for a large cohort of TNBC patient samples acquired from US, and Nigeria and we will determine if nHSET can serve as a racial disparity biomarker for the stratification of TNBCs after adjusting for their percent African genetic ancestry. Second, since HSET and MYH9 are nuclear binding partners that may assist in chromatin modification to amplify oncogenic Wnt/β-catenin signaling and MYC expression (which we have found is enriched in AA compared with EA TNBCs), we will characterize racial differences in the HSET-MYH9-MYC axis in TNBCs using patient-derived samples and correlate these racial distinctions to differences in genomic stability in TNBCs. We will employ multi-colored lenti- CRISPR-Cas9 system for knocking out key genes in this axis in AA/EA cell lines to test if the HSET-MYH9-MYC axis drives tumor aggressiveness more strongly in AA than in EA TNBCs. In Aim 3, the value of a promising commercially available HSET inhibitor will be tested in xenograft models of AA and EA TNBC patient-derived cells. Thus, this study will test the hypothesis that nHSET is a novel therapeutically actionable biomarker with greater value for AA than EA TNBC patients that drives TNBC progression and chemoresistance more strongly in AA than EA TNBC patients. The impact of this project will be to advance knowledge of prognostic biomarkers, molecular mechanisms of disease aggressiveness, and effective treatment regimens for AA TNBC patients. ! Project Narrative! The proposed research aims to customize treatment and thereby improve clinical outcomes for African American (AA) patients with an aggressive type of breast cancer to which they are predisposed called triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). This project will advance knowledge about how to customize treatment for AA TNBC patients by validating whether a novel protein biomarker, nuclear HSET, can better predict risk of poor clinical outcomes in AA than European American (EA) TNBC patients after accounting for factors that could confound analyses (like African genetic ancestry); how nuclear HSET may drive more aggressive tumor biology in TNBCs from AAs than EAs; and the potential clinical benefit of targeting nuclear HSET as an adjuvant to chemotherapy in AA and EA TNBCs.",HSET as a racial disparity biomarker for TNBC

"Smartphone-Delivered, Diabetes-Modified Behavioral Activation Treatment (Smartphone DM-BAT) in AAs With T2DM The proposed K24 renewal application is designed to support the career and research trajectory of the candidate by providing protected time to conduct patient-oriented research on interventions to reduce complications and deaths from diabetes in ethnic minority groups and mentor the next generation of women and minority clinical investigators in health disparities research. In the first 5 years of the current K24 grant, the candidate has trained 40 mentees including: 7 faculty, 2 post-docs, 2 doctoral students, 1 fellow, and 17 medical students. He has 147 abstracts/presentations and 156 peer-reviewed publications with mentees. In addition, in the past 5 years, he submitted 27 grants with mentees of which 10 were funded. The specific aims of the proposed K24 renewal application will be accomplished by completing the following three objectives: Mentoring Objective: To increase the pool of clinical researchers who can conduct patient-oriented research and successfully compete for peer-reviewed grants, as well as mentor the next generation of women and minority clinical investigators, who are engaged in the national effort to reduce and eliminate health care disparities. This will be accomplished by mentoring 2 women/minority investigators each year for 5 years. Career Development Objective: To obtain additional training in leadership, health economics, and health informatics that would greatly enhance the candidate's research capability and make him a more effective mentor to trainees in clinical research. This will be accomplished by completing 4 courses a year in leadership, health economics, and health informatics Research Objective: The primary objective is to test the efficacy of the Smartphone DM-BAT intervention comprised of smartphone-delivered, diabetes-modified behavioral activation treatment (education, skills training and behavior activation), home monitoring with feedback (FORA home telemonitoring system) and care delivered by nurse educators in improving HbA1c levels in AAs with poorly controlled T2DM. The secondary objectives are to test the efficacy of the Smartphone DM-BAT intervention in improving BP control and quality of life in AAs with poorly controlled T2DM. Exploratory analyses will examine the role of process (information, motivation, self-efficacy, depression) and behavioral measures (diet, exercise and medication adherence) as mediators of metabolic control. Mentorship is an important component of career advancement in academic medicine. Several studies have established that lack of mentoring is a reason for poor career advancement and attrition, particularly among women and minority faculty. The candidate who has a track record of mentoring women and minority faculty would benefit from the protected time for mentoring afforded by the proposed K24 renewal award, while allowing continued research to eliminate disparities in diabetes. The proposed K24 renewal application is designed to support the career and research trajectory of the candidate by providing protected time to conduct patient-oriented research on interventions to decrease morbidity/mortality from diabetes in ethnic minorities and mentor the next generation of women and minority clinical investigators in health disparities research.","Smartphone-Delivered, Diabetes-Modified Behavioral Activation Treatment (Smartphone DM-BAT) in AAs With T2DM",9753208,K24DK093699,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Affect ', ' Award ', ' Behavior ', ' Blood Glucose ', ' Blood Sugar ', ' Blood Pressure Monitors ', ' Continuous Sphygmomanometers ', ' career transition ', ' career advancement ', ' Career Mobility ', ' Clinical Investigator ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Cues ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' diabetes ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' type two diabetes ', ' type II DM ', ' type 2 DM ', ' maturity onset diabetes ', ' ketosis resistant diabetes ', ' adult onset diabetes ', ' Type II diabetes ', ' Type II Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Type 2 diabetes ', ' Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus ', ' T2DM ', ' T2D ', ' T2 DM ', ' Stable Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Slow-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Noninsulin Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Noninsulin Dependent Diabetes ', ' Non-Insulin Dependent Diabetes ', ' NIDDM ', ' Maturity-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Ketosis-Resistant Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Adult-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Faculty ', ' Nursing Staff Development Specialist ', ' Nursing Staff Developer ', ' Nurse Educator ', ' Clinical Nurse Educator ', ' Clinical Faculty ', ' Nursing Faculty ', ' Feedback ', ' Grant ', ' hemoglobin A1c ', ' Hemoglobin A(1) ', ' HbA1c ', ' HbA1 ', ' Hb A1c ', ' Hb A1a+b ', ' Hb A1 ', ' Glycohemoglobin A ', ' Glycosylated hemoglobin A ', ' NAS/IOM ', ' Institute of Medicine ', ' Institute of Medicine (U.S.) ', ' Leadership ', ' Literature ', ' Medicine ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Moods ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity -

"Defining the Role of Management Factors in Outcome Disparity in Pediatric T1D Abstract Type 1 diabetes (T1D), one of the most prevalent incurable diseases of childhood, is associated with serious risk of morbidity and mortality due to the development of micro- and macrovascular complications. Complications can be prevented by treatment that achieves physiological or near physiological levels of glucose. Despite innovations in management over the past three decades, pediatric patients of African ancestry (AA) have persistently higher HbA1c than patients of white, European ancestry (EA). Higher HbA1c in AA patients is associated with both higher acute and chronic morbidity and mortality compared to EA patients. Thus, racial disparity in glycemic outcome and the development of complications is a major unresolved failure of current clinical pediatric diabetes treatment. Multiple factors contribute to high-risk levels of mean blood glucose (MBG) in pediatric AA patients compared to EA. AA patients have less access to insulin pumps, perform glucose testing less often, have less contact with diabetes management staff, and may have difficulty relating to management staff due to cultural and socioeconomic differences. Greater occurrence of hypoglycemia is another obstacle to achieving optimal glucose control. These considerations have led us to hypothesize that an intervention targeting this group of major management obstacles will sustainably reduce MBG to levels comparable to EA patients without increased hypoglycemia. In order to test this hypothesis, we will first (Aim 1) conduct focus groups with high- risk AA patients and their families to pre-test our intervention approach and receive feedback from them about how best to implement the program, allowing us to more specifically tailor the intervention to address their perceived barriers. This information will help guide the design of a new tailored intervention (Aim 2) for these patients. In Aim 2, we will demonstrate the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of safely reducing high-risk, complication-producing levels of MBG among AA patients with T1D in a randomized pilot study using innovative hybrid closed-loop pump technology combined with a customized culturally sensitive program of enhanced patient support. This approach will intervene simultaneously with multiple obstacles previously known and currently identified by participants that confront high-risk patients and interfere with optimal management. We have the benefit of an experienced and interdisciplinary investigative team with a track record of research productivity in this area. We have a large, well-characterized, diabetes clinic population. Our patients and families have enthusiastically participated in many clinical research projects in the past.

"Aberrant Splice Variants as Potential Precision Biomarkers for Aggressive Prostate Cancers in African American Patients PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Prostate cancer (PCa) is now the most frequently diagnosed cancer and the second most common cause of cancer deaths in men in United States. Notably, African Americans (AAs) exhibited 1.6-fold higher incidence and 2.4-fold higher mortality rates compared to European Americans (EAs). Despite multiple socioeconomic factors postulated to explain the observed PCa disparities, higher recurrence and mortality rates remained even after adjustment of socioeconomic status in AAs, suggesting that intrinsic biological differences account for, at least, part of PCa disparities. Our previous genomic studies have revealed that intrinsic genomic differences do exist between AA and EA PCa. These genetic elements, including population-specific and -enriched microRNAs, mRNAs and alternative splicing variants, have been identified and were hypothesized to contribute to the differential PCa properties between AA and EA. In the pilot study, our preliminary results revealed ~2,500 differential splicing (DS) events occurring in AA and EA PCa. Among these DS genes, >70% of the genes were functionally linked to cancer diseases. These results lead to our hypothesis that aberrant mRNA splicing may play a critical but largely unknown role for driving the PCa disparities. Towards this hypothesis, we have performed RT-PCR validations and functional analyses of AA-enriched splice variants (such as PIK3CD, FGFR3, TSC2 and RASGRP2 splice variants) in PCa samples. Our preliminary results confirmed that these AA-enriched variants were highly expressed in AA PCa and contributed to more aggressive cancer phenotypes. In this proposal, we will focus on investigating the expression profiles of PIK3CD long and short splice variants (PIK3CD-L and PIK3CD-S) in a panel of PCa and other solid/hematologic tumor cell lines, and elucidating functional impacts of these splice variants in PCa aggressiveness and drug resistance. Guided by strong preliminary data, we propose to pursue three Specific Aims to character molecular functions of the PIK3CD splice variants underlying PCa aggressiveness: 1) Validate the expression profiles of PIK3CD splice variants in PCa specimens and cell lines derived from AA and EA patients; 2) Determine the functional roles of PIK3CD-S expression in disease aggressiveness and drug resistance in PCa and evaluate the feasibility of PIK3CD- S/PIK3CD-L ratios as potential biomarker; and 3) Screen for the effective therapeutic molecules (small molecule inhibitors, siRNAs and/or splice switching oligos) to reduce the cancer phenotypes in PIK3CD-S overexpressing cells. Collectively, our proposed research will broadly contribute to the field of cancer health disparities by characterizing the molecular signatures of aberrant splice variants in cancers (including PCa and other solid/hematologic tumors), and deciphering the molecular mechanisms of aberrant splicing underlying PCa aggressiveness (i.e. enhanced cell proliferation and invasion) and drug resistance. This proposal will allow us to further design for splice variant- specific siRNAs and screen for SMIs that can effectively inhibit the aggressive form of splice variants in PCa. These findings and efforts may facilitate the development of potential biomarkers and therapeutic strategy to treat aggressive PCa. Finally, the success of this SC1 proposal will set a strong foundation for the PI and his research team to further pursue a NIH competitive grant (i.e. R01 or R21) for future clinically-related studies. PROJECT NARRITIVE Emerging evidence suggests that aberrant mRNA splicing paly critical role in development and progression of diseases including cancers. Our proposed studies aim to understand the alternative splicing landscapes of African American and European American prostate cancers, and elucidate the functional roles of aberrant mRNA splicing in promoting prostate cancer disparities between these two populations. This research will have potential to further develop novel biomarker and/or therapeutic targets to treat the aggressive prostate cancers.",Aberrant Splice Variants as Potential Precision Biomarkers

"Functional Consequences of Racially Associated Ephrin Alterations on the Prostate Tumor Microenvironment Project Summary Prostate cancer (PCa) incidence and mortality remain significantly higher in African American (AA) men compared to Caucasians (CA). Although socioeconomic factors may contribute to such differences, recent studies suggest that biological factors could potentially explain racial disparities (RD) in PCa. A few high- penetrance genes (HPG) have been found to predispose to high risk of PCa in AA men. These include EphB2 mutations. EphB2 is a tyrosine kinase (RTK) receptor that binds to the Ephrin ligand and initiates bidirectional signals that affect both receptor (forward signaling) and Ephrin-expressing cells (reverse signaling). Our preliminary observations suggest a potential supportive role of Ephrin signaling activation within stromal cells in the tumor microenvironment (TME) due to the pathogenicity of these EphB2 genetic alterations. However the functional consequences of EphB2 alterations on prostate cancer cell biology have not been experimentally validated. To better understand the intrinsic mechanism(s) responsible for these pathogenic effects we hypothesize that EphB2 alterations commonly seen in AA men may induce aberrant “forward signaling” reducing its tumor suppressor function in cancer cells and abnormal “reverse signaling” increasing the activation of stromal in the TME, overall resulting in support for PCa progression. This proposal seeks to understand the downstream molecular effectors of disrupted Eph-Ephrin signaling in AA men in both tissue compartments (epithelium and stroma) on PCa progression. The long-term goal is to identify novel targetable molecules within the cancer and/or stromal compartment that can be used to improve diagnosis and treatment of patients at high-risk of developing aggressive PCa disease in AA men. Three complementary areas will be investigated: 1. Determine the functional effects of racial EphB2 alterations on PCa progression. We will study the functional consequence of common EphB2 alterations seen in AA men with PCa, on proliferation and motility of PCa cells in vitro and in vivo. The role of EphB2 in PCa cell biology is unknown. 2. Determine the role of Ephrin reverse signaling on CAF activation in the TME of AA men. We observed increased expression of EphB2 ligands in the TME of AA compared to CA men suggesting a dysfunctional regulation of Ephrin-reverse signaling. In addition we observed that prostate stromal cell from AA patients with PCa induce increased proliferation and motility of PCa cell lines in vitro and in vivo. 3. Evaluate the utility of targeting the Eph-Ephrin signaling to inhibit PCa progression. It has been shown in experimental models that normalizing Eph-Ephrin signaling can reduce colon cancer progression. The utility in PCa has not been previously studied. Using an in vivo PCa model, we will assess the feasibility of targeting Eph-Ephrin signaling frequently altered in AA men to inhibit PCa tumorigenesis. Narrative The molecular mechanisms responsible for the higher incidence of developing early and more aggressive prostate cancer (PCa) in African American (AA) men are still unknown. We aim to investigate the functional consequences of common genetic alterations affecting the tumor microenvironment (TME) associated with increased risk. In addition, we will evaluate the clinical utility with emphasis on developing potential new therapies.",Functional Consequences of Racially Associated Ephrin Alterations on the Prostate Tumor

Risa will conduct research in concordance of the P20 parent grant aims. Aim 1. To investigate whether XIAP drives organoid formation and growth in AA IBC tumor organoid models. Aim 2. To establish that XIAP modulates anti-cancer drug efficacy in AA IBC tumor organoid models. Project Narrative One in eight women will develop invasive breast cancer in their lifetime, and aggressive, treatment resistant breast cancers have poor survival outcomes. Inflammatory Breast Cancer (IBC) is one of the most aggressive breast cancer subtypes and the most lethal, and disproportionately affects African American (AA) women who exhibit higher rates of rapid tumor growth, treatment resistance, and poor survival. A growing body of evidence suggests that the potent anti-apoptotic X-linked Inhibitor of Apoptosis Protein (XIAP) is linked to breast tumor progression and therapeutic resistance. The proposed project will investigate the mechanistic role of XIAP in tumor growth and treatment resistance in AA women using highly innovative 3D IBC tumor organoid models, high content imaging, and high throughput drug screening techniques. The proposed work will address the urgent need to interrogate the molecular mechanisms driving the more aggressive IBC biology and treatment resistance in AA women, thereby identifying the link of this aggressive tumor phenotype to modifiable IBC risk factors, and targets that can be modulated for therapeutic benefits.",Investigation of the role of X-Linked Inhibitor of Apoptosis Protein in African American IBC-derived,9830728,P20CA202925,"['Affect ', ' Antineoplastic Agents ', ' anticancer drug ', ' anticancer agent ', ' anti-cancer drug ', ' Tumor-Specific Treatment Agents ', ' Neoplastic Disease Chemotherapeutic Agents ', ' Cancer Drug ', ' Antineoplastics ', ' Antineoplastic Drugs ', ' Anti-Cancer Agents ', ' Automobile Driving ', ' driving ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' Communities ', ' Environment ', ' Environmental Health Science ', ' Environmental Health ', ' Exhibits ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Growth ', ' Mentors ', ' Chicanos ', ' Chicanas ', ' Mexican Americans ', ' Organoids ', ' Parents ', ' Pathology ', ' Phenotype ', ' Research ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Schools ', ' school of medicine ', ' medical college ', ' medical schools ', ' Science ', ' Societies ', ' Universities ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' environmental toxicology ', ' ecological toxicology ', ' tumor progression ', ' neoplastic progression ', ' neoplasm progression ', ' cancer progression ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' Funding ', ' Native Americans ', ' Therapeutic ', ' programs ', ' Investigation ', ' Techniques ', ' 3-Dimensional ', ' 3D ', ' 3-D ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' surgery ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' drug efficacy ', ' tumor growth ', ' cohort ', ' member ', ' Modeling ', ' cancer therapy ', ' anticancer therapy ', ' anti-cancer therapy ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Treatment ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Therapy ', ' Cancer Treatment ', ' x-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein ', ' Address ', ' Mammary Neoplasms ', ' mammary tumor ', ' Mammary Cancer ', ' Breast Tumors ', ' Breast Neoplasms ', ' Breast Cancer Risk Factor ', ' breast cancer risk ', ' Doctor of Philosophy ', ' PhD ', ' Ph.D. ', ' Research Training ', ' Apoptotic ', ' Cancer Biology ', ' Cancer Center Planning Grant ', ' P20 Grant ', ' Molecular ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' therapy resistant ', ' treatment resistance ', ' therapeutic resistance ', ' resistant to therapy ', ' resistance to therapy ', ' anticancer research ', ' cancer research ', ' anti-cancer research ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' Resistance ', ' resistant ', ' tumor ', ' parent grant ', ' inflammatory breast cancer ', ' doctoral student ', ' PhD. student ', ' PhD student ', ' Ph.D. student ', ' Ph.D student ', ' Ph.

"Hypertensive Medication Adherence in Young African American Women Project Abstract Uncontrolled hypertension [HTN] due to poor blood pressure [BP] medication adherence in young and early middle age African American [AA] women is a leading contributor for the sustained hypertension disparities in the US. AA women in the US 20-44 years of age, have the highest prevalence of Hypertension [HTN] when compared to White women of the same age group. Uncontrolled HTN is a significant risk factor for stroke, heart failure, kidney disease, and early mortality, especially in this at-risk group. Barriers prohibiting BP medication adherence have been well characterized across the AA population except in young AA women who bear an unequal and different burden of stressors than older AA women. However, important underlying factors including HTN illness perceptions/representations, unique psychosocial factors including resilient coping, and their influence on good BP medication adherence have not been sufficiently studied among this vulnerable group. Evidence indicating that AAs acquire HTN at younger ages, are less adherent, and are more resistant to treatment compared to other ethnic groups provides a compelling impetus to identify positive and modifiable factors that contribute to BP medication adherence. The specific aims of this cross-sectional dissertation study are to examine the relationships among sociodemographic & clinical profiles, HTN illness perceptions, and BP medication adherence; and examine the relationships between psychosocial factors, resilient coping style, and BP medication adherence when controlling for sociodemographic factors in a sample of young hypertensive AA women. An exploratory aim will examine the relationship of resilient coping as a potential moderator of high or low adverse stress exposure and its effect on BP medication adherence to elicit understanding of variability in BP medication adherence among this subgroup of hypertensive women. A total of 110 AA women diagnosed with HTN, 18-45 years of age, will be recruited through an ongoing community health heart screening project which is targeting AA women diagnosed with HTN, at-risk for HTN, and other cardiovascular disease risk factors in a large southern urban setting. Descriptive, bivariate correlation, and logistic regression will be used for statistical analysis of the aims. Completion of the proposed study is the first step towards understanding the impact of modifiable factors such as HTN illness perceptions and resilient coping, and their impact on BP medication adherence in this vulnerable population. This study will provide important data to inform development and testing of effective and targeted interventions to reduce HTN disparities while improving health outcomes in a population predisposed to adverse cardiovascular events. Project Narrative Young and early middle age adult AA women represent a growing group of ethnic minority women diagnosed with hypertension in the United States.

"Exploring factors related to racial disparities in ovarian cancer incidence and survival: the OCWAA consortium PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT    Invasive epithelial ovarian cancer accounts for 5% of malignancies and, while it is the eighth most common  cancer in US women, it is the fifth leading cause of cancer deaths. Many of the established and suspected risk  factors for ovarian cancer show racial differences in the prevalence and/or timing of exposures. Racial  differences in incidence and survival are likely due to a combination of factors, including differences in the  prevalence of risk factors, treatment received, prevalence of comorbidities, and socioeconomic characteristics.  The newly-­formed consortium, Ovarian Cancer in Women of African Ancestry (OCWAA), brings together  investigators experienced in studying the epidemiology of ovarian cancer and dedicated to understanding  racial differences in risk and outcomes in ovarian cancer. The OCWAA consortium includes an ongoing  population-­based case-­control study in African American (AA) women, three completed population-­based  case-­control studies that include both AA and white cases and controls and two unique cohort studies with  large numbers of AA participants. To address racial differences in incidence and survival, we will  comprehensively examine reproductive and lifestyle exposures which differ in prevalence and/or timing  between AA and white women, access to care, treatment and socioeconomic factors, and determine whether  they explain racial disparities. We propose to harmonize risk factor, clinical and outcome data from the  participating studies in the OCWAA consortium in order to accomplish the study goals and carry out race-­ specific analyses of incidence and survival. We will use traditional methods to calculate population attributable  risk percent (PAR%) for associated risk factors.  We will use a novel and exploratory approach, a Markov  state-­transition microsimulation model, to estimate the extent to which racial differences in patterns of  exposure to known risk factors explain racial differences in ovarian cancer age-­specific incidence and use this  same method to estimate the extent to which racial differences in patterns of exposure, treatment, and  prognostic factors explain racial differences in ovarian cancer survival. The proposed study will be the largest  of its kind and the first to be adequately powered to evaluate epidemiologic and clinical factors affecting  incidence and survival of ovarian cancer in AA women. The infrastructure generated by this application will  enable OCWAA to create a base on which to support future scientific proposals.      PROJECT NARRATIVE    African American women have lower incidence of ovarian cancer but much worse survival than white women.  While access to appropriate treatment is likely a major contributor, it does not completely explain differences in  survival by race. We propose to harmonize data from six existing epidemiologic studies to examine differences  in risk factor exposures that may explain risk differences in incidence, and to examine risk and prognostic  factors to evaluate their contribution to disparities in survival.    ",Exploring factors

"MIC-1 and its functional partners in prostate cancer racial disparity ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Prostate cancer (PCa) is the most common non-cutaneous malignancy in the United States males and is the second leading cause of cancer deaths in men. In this regard, epidemiologic data have also provided evidence of racial disparity, including younger age, higher incidence and aggressiveness of PCa at diagnosis and inferior survival rates of African Americans (AA) relative to Caucasian patients in the Unites States. The explanation for these differences is still unknown. On the other hand, our recent results combined with prior studies have revealed that MIC-1 and its functional partners EGFR and CXCR4 were more frequent in AA compared to Caucasian PCa patients. Importantly, recent reports have revealed that EGFR and CXCR4 mediate Docetaxel resistance in PCa cells. Therefore, the central hypothesis of this proposal is that the up- regulation of MIC-1 signaling cascade may cooperate with EGFR and CXCR4 oncogenic pathways for the acquisition of a more aggressive behavior, survival and therapeutic resistance of PCa cells and contribute to the racial disparity between AA versus Caucasian patients. The overall objective is to establish the signaling elements modulated by MIC-1/transforming growth factor-ß receptors (TGF-ßRs) and their functional cross- talks with EGFR and CXCR4 cascades in tumor and tumor-associated stromal cells during prostate carcinogenesis and bone metastases that contribute to the ethnic disparity in AA vs. Caucasian patients. The therapeutic benefit to targeting MIC-1 cascade and its functional partners for reversing the chemoresistance of PC cells will also be investigated using PCa cell models and human PCa tissues from AA and Caucasian men. To test this hypothesis, three specific aims were proposed. Aim I will establish the involvement of MIC-1, EGFR and CXCR4 in racial disparity by performing immunohistochemical analyses of their expression on a large panel of benign and malignant tissues and DNA microarrays with PC cell lines relevant to AA and Caucasian men. Aim II will delineate molecular mechanisms of MIC-1 and its signaling cross-talks with EGFR and CXCR4 cascades involved in the growth, invasion and alterations of metabolic pathways using in vitro PCa cell models relevant to AA and Caucasian PCa patients. Aim III will determine the therapeutic benefit to target MIC-1 cascade for improving the anti-carcinogenic effects of docetaxel using in vitro and in vivo PCa cell models. Finally, we also demonstrate the molecular mechanism associated with Docetaxel resistance and its relationship with MIC-1 in PCa cells relevant to AA and Caucasian patients. Taken together, these studies will delineate the functional interplay between MIC-1 and its interacting partners EGFR and CXCR4 and their potential role in disease aggressiveness and therapy resistance to better understand their involvement in the racial disparity between AA and Caucasian patients. The overall outcome of this application will reveal the clinical interest to use combination of MIC-1, EGFR and CXCR4 as molecular biomarkers for an earlier and accurate diagnosis, response to therapy and impact on therapeutic intervention of AA and Caucasian patients. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The research project aims to establish the role of MIC-1 and its interacting partners EGFR and CXCR4 in prostate cancer (PCa) pathogenesis, aggressiveness and their involvement in the racial disparity between African American (AA) and Caucasian men. The studies will delineate the signaling elements modulated by MIC-1 and its functional partners EGFR and CXCR4 that contribute to PCa progression, bone metastases, chemoresistance and interethnic disparity using a large panel of prostatic tissue specimens and PCa cell lines relevant to PCa and bone metastases derived from AA and Caucasian patients. Further, the autocrine/paracrine role of MIC-1 in PCa will be established using recombinant human MIC-1 protein using stromal and tumor cells. The benefit of down-regulating MIC-1 for reversing Docetaxel resistance will be determined using in vitro and in vivo PCa cell models. Finally, we also demonstrate the mechanism associated with Docetaxel resistance and its relationship with MIC-1 in PCa cells.",MIC-1 and its functional partners in prostate cancer racial disparity,9683866,U01CA185148,"['Age ', ' ages ', ' Aggressive behavior ', ' Aggression ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Surgical Castration ', ' Castration ', ' cultured cell line ', ' Strains Cell Lines ', ' CellLine ', ' Cell Line ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cells ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Elements ', ' Geography ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Growth ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' In Vitro ', ' Incidence ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Light ', ' male ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' mortality ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Prognosis ', ' outcome forecast ', ' Proteins ', ' proto-oncogene protein c-erbB-1 ', ' erbBl ', ' erbB-1 Proto-Oncogene Protein ', ' erbB-1 ', ' c-erbB-1 Protein ', ' c-erbB-1 ', ' Urogastrone Receptor ', ' Transforming Growth Factor alpha Receptor ', ' TGF-alpha Receptor ', ' HER1 ', ' Epidermal Growth Factor-Urogastrone Receptors ', ' Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinase ', ' Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor Kinase ', ' ERBB Protein ', ' EGFR ', ' EGF Receptor ', ' Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Metastatic to ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Survival Rate ', ' Testing ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Tissues ', ' Transforming Growth Factor-Beta Family Gene ', ' TGFβ ', ' TGFbeta ', ' TGF-β ', ' TGF-beta ', ' TGF B ', ' Platelet Transforming Growth Factor ', ' Milk Growth Factor ', ' Bone-Derived Transforming Growth Factor ', ' Transforming Growth Factor beta ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' Upregulation ', ' Up-Regulation ', ' white race ', ' Occidental ', ' Caucasoid Race ', ' Caucasoid ', ' Caucasian Race ', ' Caucasian ', ' Caucasians ', ' Transforming Growth Factor β Receptors ', ' TGF-β Receptors ', ' TGF-beta Receptors ', ' Transforming Growth Factor beta Receptors ', ' oriental ', ' Asians ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' Mediating ', ' Metastatic Neoplasm to the Bone ', ' bone neoplasm secondary ', ' Skeletal metastasis ', ' Secondary malignant neoplasm of bone ', ' Secondary malignancy of bone ', ' Secondary cancer of bone ', ' Osseous metastasis ', ' Metastatic malignant neoplasm to bone ', ' Metastatic Tumor to the Bone ', ' Metastatic Cancer to the Bone ', ' Metastasis to bone ', ' Bony metastasis ', ' Bone cancer metastatic ', ' Bone Metastasis ', ' Stromal Cells ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Benign ', ' Clinical ', ' Malignant -

"A nutrition-based approach to reduce heart disease risk among overweight African Americans: Use of soul food plant-based or omnivorous diets to address cardiovascular disease African Americans (AAs) are disproportionately affected by cardiovascular disease (CVD), having the highest death rates from CVD as compared with other racial/ethnic groups. In addition, AAs have the highest rates of obesity as compared to whites and Hispanics. People following plant-based dietary approaches, particularly vegan or vegetarian diets, have lower risks of CVD and lower body weights than omnivores. Vegan and vegetarian diets have been used effectively for weight loss and maintenance and for reversing CVD. Although intervention trials have shown a significant weight-loss and cholesterol-lowering effect of adoption of plant-based diets, t o date, most of these large randomized trials have had limited participation from AA participants. AAs tend to lose less weight during behavioral interventions than their white counterparts. In addition, most research has shown that AAs are more likely to discontinue participation in behavioral dietary interventions. This combination of higher attrition and lower weight loss may be due to a failure to address issues that are culturally relevant to the AA population. Our recent 6-month trial examined the use of a vegan diet as compared to 4 other plant-based dietary approaches (vegetarian, pesco-vegetarian, semi-vegetarian, or omnivorous). Weight loss among AAs in the vegan diet was significantly greater (-8.5±3.3%, n=3) than AAs randomized to diet approaches that will be similar to the omnivorous approach in our proposed study (semi- vegetarian/omnivorous groups, 1.4±1.8%, n=3). Of the 12 AA participants who began the study, only one did not complete the study (8% attrition rate) compared to 12 out of the 49 white participants (24% attrition). In total, these results point to the potential of an entirely plant-based dietary intervention to overcome two barriers encountered in previous studies aiming to improve dietary intake and weight loss among overweight AAs for CVD prevention: low weight loss results and high attrition rates.  The goal of this proposed study is to apply these findings in a CVD prevention intervention specifically for AAs living in the southeast U.S. We have developed a partnership with the owners of two soul food restaurants in Columbia, SC (one vegan, the other traditional).These restaurants, which focus on southern cuisine, are owned and operated by local AA families, and will assist with developing culturally-appropriate recipes for our intervention. W e will conduct a two-year dietary trial among overweight AA adults (N=130) randomized to follow one of two diets both emphasizing southern food culture and low-glycemic index and low-fat foods: Vegan or Omnivorous (omni) diet. This study will compare the impact of these diet patterns on changes in CVD risk factors, including LDL cholesterol and blood pressure, and body weight. If this intervention proves to be successful at reducing weight and CVD risk factors among AAs, it has the potential to be disseminated through a variety of locations throughout the US, including restaurants, federally qualified health clinics, churches, or neighborhood community centers. Our proposed project will examine the effect of adopting two different dietary patterns (vegan and omnivorous), which focus on southern cuisine, on both cardiovascular disease risk factors and weight loss among overweight African American adults. Our proposed research study will use a randomized design to examine the effects of adopting these two dietary patterns on cardiovascular disease risk factors and weight loss. We will partner with two local community restaurants to help inform intervention and recipe development.",A nutrition-based approach to reduce heart disease risk among overweight African Americans: Use of soul food plant-based or omnivorous diets to address cardiovascular disease,9694726,R01HL135220,"['Adoption ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Affect ', ' Behavior ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' behavior intervention ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Blood Pressure ', ' Body Weight ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cholesterol ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Communities ', ' dietary ', ' Diet ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Family ', ' Fats ', ' Fatty acid glycerol esters ', ' Food or Food Product ', ' Food ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' heart disorder ', ' Cardiac Disorders ', ' Cardiac Diseases ', ' Heart Diseases ', ' beta-Lipoprotein Cholesterol ', ' Low Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol ', ' LDL Cholesterol ', ' LDL Cholesterol Lipoproteins ', ' Maintenance ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' nutrition ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Obesity ', ' Plants ', ' Food Plants ', ' Edible Plants ', ' Research ', ' Restaurants ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Southeast US ', ' Southeast U.S. ', ' Southeastern United States ', ' taste response ', ' taste processing ', ' gustatory response ', ' gustatory processing ', ' gustatory perception ', ' Taste ', ' Gustation ', ' Taste Perception ', ' Testing ', ' wt-loss ', ' body weight loss ', ' Weight Reduction ', ' Weight Loss ', ' Body Weight decreased ', ' Weight ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Hispanics ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Death Rate ', ' Ensure ', ' Failure ', ' African ', ' satisfaction ', ' Dietary Intervention ', ' diet intervention ', ' Nutritional Interventions ', ' Nutrition Interventions ', ' Letters ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Vegetarian diet ', ' Vegetarianism ', ' cooking ', ' Vegan Diet ', ' veganism ', ' vegan ', ' Adopted ', ' Clinic ', ' Pattern ', ' Location ', ' Overweight ', ' Over weight ', ' Church ', ' cardiovascular disorder prevention ', ' cardiovascular disease prevention ', ' cardiac disease prevention ', ' CVD prevention ', ' cohort ', ' Recipe ', ' Participant ', ' research study ', ' Intervention Trial ', ' Interventional trial ', ' cardiovascular risk factor ', ' cardiovascular risk ', ' Sampling ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Meta-Analysis ', ' Data Pooling ', ' Clinical Trial Overviews ', ' heart disease risk ', ' heart disorder risk ', ' cardiac disorder risk ', ' cardiac disease risk ', ' cardiovascular disorder risk ', ' cardiovascular disease risk ', ' Glycemic Index ', ' Glycemic Index Number ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Dietary intake ', ' Address ', ' Dietary Practices ', ' dietary pattern ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Preventative intervention ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Behavioral ', ' weight maintenance ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' randomized trial ', ' Randomization trial ', ' dietary approach ', ' community center ', ' ']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA AT COLUMBIA,R01,2019,933969,0.027728288462345874
"A Follow-up Study for Causes of Cancer in Black Women African-American (AA) women have a higher incidence of many cancers (e.g., colon, pancreas) and higher cancer mortality (e.g., breast, colon, pancreas) relative to other American women, and many of these differences are unexplained. The Black Women's Health Study (BWHS), the largest follow-up study of AA women, was begun in 1995 to provide relevant information on these racial disparities. 59,000 AA women ages 21-69 from 17 states enrolled by completing health questionnaires. The BWHS has successfully followed them for cancer through biennial questionnaires and linkage to 24 cancer registries in the states in which >95% of participants live. Data have been collected on numerous potential risk factors (e.g, medical, reproductive, lifestyle, psychosocial, socioeconomic, air pollution). Cancer diagnoses are validated by hospital and cancer registry pathology data. A DNA/oral microbiome biorepository contains saliva-mouthwash samples from 26,800 participants. Blood sample collection, in progress, has obtained blood samples from 9,300 participants to date (14,000+ expected) . Breast tumor tissue has been collected for 750 incident breast cancers. The study has identified 5,631 incident cancers to date, including 2,651 breast cancers. The study has published extensively on nongenetic and genetic risk factors for breast cancer and other cancers. Because participants were young at baseline (median age = 38), accrual of less common cancers was slow. Participants have now reached ages of high cancer incidence, meaning that sufficient numbers will be accrued for informative assessment. This infrastructure proposal has 3 aims: (1) continue and enhance follow-up and data collection in the BWHS, adding information (including Medicare data) on cancer treatments and outcomes (2) manage and enhance biologic sample collection by adding additional samples to the saliva/mouthwash and blood repositories, collecting tumor tissue for all solid cancers in addition to breast cancer, collecting full-field digital prediagnostic mammograms, and genotyping with a genome-wide array all incident cancer cases for which we have a DNA sample (~2,800) together with an equal number of controls with DNA; (3) share the data in consortial projects. Continuation of the BWHS is a high priority because: a) 89% of participants are still cancer-free due to the young age at baseline; b) follow-up has been successful and unbiased ; c) the BWHS can assess the effects of exposures (e.g., class 2 and class 3 obesity, premature birth, experiences of racism) that are less prevalent in other populations; d) increasingly large numbers are needed to study scientific questions and BWHS genetic, nongenetic, and biospecimen data will contribute to numerous consortia to study a range of cancers; e) the BWHS has a record of high productivity; f) further work is needed to understand numerous racial disparities in cancer incidence and survival. In sum, continuation of the BWHS will contribute appreciably to knowledge about cancer etiology and survival in an underserved population; the biolospecimen and mammogram repositories will contribute greatly to that effort, as will participation in consortial studies. Incidence and mortality rates of many cancers continue to be disproportionately high among AA women. The Black Women's Health Study, a follow-up study of 59,000 AA women, has contributed important information on risk factors for cancer and has obtained blood samples from over 9,300 participants to date and saliva samples (source of DNA and oral microbiome) from 26,800. Continued follow-up, addition of tumor tissue samples, digital images from screening mammograms, and genome-wide SNP data from cancer cases, and participation of the BWHS in collaborative studies, will produce valuable information that can lead to more effective prevention and treatment measures for cancer in AA women.",A Follow-up Study for Causes of Cancer in Black Women,9785392,U01CA164974,"['Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Air Pollution ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Breast ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Censuses ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Colon ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Collection ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' DNA ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Endometrium ', ' Followup Studies ', ' Follow-Up Studies ', ' Genotype ', ' Health ', ' health insurance for disabled ', ' Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Disabled Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Aged and Disabled, Title 18 ', ' Medicare ', ' Level of Health ', ' Health Status ', ' Hospitals ', ' Incidence ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Income ', ' renal ', ' Kidney Urinary System ', ' Kidney ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Lifestyle ', ' Life Style ', ' pulmonary ', ' Lung Respiratory System ', ' Lung ', ' mammographic exams ', ' mammographic examinations ', ' Mammogram ', ' Mammography ', ' Medical Records ', ' mortality ', ' Mouthwash ', ' Persons ', ' Newsletter ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Obesity ', ' web based ', ' online computer ', ' On-Line Systems ', ' Online Systems ', ' Ovary ', ' Pancreatic ', ' Pancreas ', ' Pathology ', ' Productivity ', ' Publishing ', ' Questionnaires ', ' Rectum ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Saliva ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Female Health ', "" Women's Health "", ' Treatment outcome ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' Non-respondent ', ' Nonrespondent ', ' preterm delivery ', ' premature delivery ', ' premature childbirth ', ' Preterm Birth ', ' Prematurely delivering ', ' Premature Birth ', ' Blood specimen ', ' Blood Sample ', ' sample collection ', ' specimen collection ', ' Solid ', ' Biological ', ' Medical ', ' racism ', ' Link ', ' Sample Size ', ' Funding ', ' Solid Neoplasm ', ' Solid Tumor ', ' Knowledge ', ' Source ', ' System ', ' Tumor Tissue ', ' psychosocial ', ' American ', ' digital imaging ', ' computer imaging ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' cohort ', ' Manuscripts ', ' Participant ', ' Prevention ', ' reproductive ', ' neoplasm registry ', ' cancer registry ', ' genetic risk factor ', ' inherited factor ', ' Sampling ', ' repository ', ' cancer therapy ', ' anticancer therapy ', ' anti-cancer therapy ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Treatment ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Therapy ', ' Cancer Treatment ', ' cancer diagnosis ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Tissue Sample ', ' Pancreatic Lymphoma ', ' pancreas lymphoma ', ' Address ', ' Mammary Neoplasms ', ' mammary tumor ', ' Mammary Cancer ', ' Breast Tumors ', ' Breast Neoplasms ', ' Breast Cancer Risk Factor ', ' breast cancer risk ', ' Data ', ' Multiple Cancer Sites ', ' Sum ', ' Cancer Etiology ', ' Cancer Cause ', ' Collection ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Non-Malignant ', ' nonmalignant ', ' Tissue Microarray ', ' Tissue Chip ', ' Tissue Arrays ', ' Preparation ', ' follow-up ', ' followup ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' active followup ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' socioeconomics ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socio-economically ', ' socio-economic ', ' web site ', ' website ', ' oral microbiome ', ' cost ', ' digital ', ' Underserved Population ', ' underserved people ', ' under served population ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' disparity in cancer ', ' cancer disparity ', ' genome-wide ', ' genomewide ', ' genome scale ', ' non-genetic ', ' nongenetic ', ' biobank ', ' biorepository ', ' data sharing ', ' screening ', ' racial disparity ', ' race disparity ', ' disparities in race ', ' Genetic study ', ' Breast Cancer Patient ', ' Breast Tumor Patient ', ' cancer survival ', ' Facebook ', ' Infrastructure ', ' ']",NCI,BOSTON UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CAMPUS,U01,2019,3520185,-0.04888732288836776
"Glucocorticoid signaling, taxane resistance, and prostate cancer mortality disparity African American (AA) men develop highly aggressive prostate tumors and are twice as likely to die of this malignancy than men from other racial backgrounds. Advanced prostate cancer (PCa) is usually treated with androgen deprivation therapy and chemotherapy with taxane drugs. Unfortunately, death occurs once the cancer becomes metastatic and resistant to therapy. Recent studies demonstrate that glucocorticoid receptor (GR) signaling confers resistance to taxane chemotherapy; however, the underlying mechanisms have not been clearly established or studied in the context of health disparities. Glucocorticoids are concurrently administered to PCa patients to mitigate the side effects of therapy, but recent evidence suggests that they may also accelerate disease progression. This poses a serious problem for AA men, who have chronically elevated levels of endogenous glucocorticoids and amplified glucocorticoid signaling compared to European American (EA) men. These observations implicate glucocorticoid signaling as a potential contributor to PCa mortality disparities, and suggest that targeting GR may attenuate therapy resistance in PCa and reduce these disparities. The proposed studies are aimed at mechanistically linking elevated GR signaling with resistance to taxane chemotherapy in PCa, and targeting GR to reverse this resistance. Currently, there is a fundamental lack in our understanding of the impact of GR-induced chemotherapy resistance in the context of racial disparities in prostate cancer mortality. This is caused by critical barriers in the field that include lack of studies linking GR signaling to PCa therapy resistance in the context of health disparities, and limited understanding of molecular mechanisms underlying GR-induced chemotherapy resistance. This proposal addresses these critical barriers by exploring the novel overall hypothesis that GR signaling is enhanced in AA prostate tumors and promotes chemotherapy resistance by upregulating stress survival genes. The hypothesis is supported by preliminary data suggesting that GR signaling robustly induces the expression of the chemoresistance- associated proteins LEDGF/p75 and Clusterin in AA-derived cell lines. We will evaluate our overall hypothesis through two specific aims: Aim 1. Test the hypothesis that GR directly induces chemoresistance in PCa cells by upregulating stress survival proteins. This will be explored in mechanistic studies using AA and EA cellular and xenograft models of PCa. Aim 2. Test the hypothesis that GR signaling is elevated in AA men with PCa, leading to increased expression and circulation of stress survival proteins. This will be explored by examining the expression of GR in prostate tumor tissues from AA and EA patients, as well as the circulating levels of LEDGF/p75 and Clusterin in AA and EA men with and without PCa. These exploratory and innovative studies use a mechanistic approach to establish the role of GR signaling in promoting chemotherapy resistance in PCa in the context of health disparities. The results from these studies will identify new targets for therapies designed to attenuate GR driven chemoresistance in PCa, resulting in reduction of these disparities. Narrative Prostate Cancer mortality disparities are having a major impact in the U.S. by disproportionally affecting the African American male population. The proposed studies use mechanistic approaches to establish the contribution of glucocorticoid receptor signaling to chemotherapy resistance in advanced prostate cancer in the context of the racial disparities in mortality associated with this malignancy. The results from these studies will identify potential targets for novel therapeutic strategies that could be designed to attenuate glucocorticoid receptor-driven chemoresistance, resulting in reduction of these disparities.","Glucocorticoid signaling, taxane resistance, and prostate cancer mortality disparity",9976193,R21CA226654,"['Acceleration ', ' Affect ', ' Aging ', ' Blood Circulation ', ' Circulation ', ' Bloodstream ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' cultured cell line ', ' Strains Cell Lines ', ' CellLine ', ' Cell Line ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cells ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' diabetes ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Genes ', ' Glucocorticoids ', ' stress protein ', ' Heat shock proteins ', ' In Vitro ', ' male ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' mortality ', ' Patients ', ' Pharmacology ', ' pilot study ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' Prostatic Neoplasia ', ' Prostate Tumor ', ' Prostate Neoplasms ', ' Prostatic Neoplasms ', ' Proteins ', ' Androgen Receptor ', ' Glucocorticoid Receptor ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Stress ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Upregulation ', ' Up-Regulation ', ' testosterone-repressed prostate message-2 protein ', ' ionizing radiation-induced protein-8 ', ' complement-associated protein SP-40,40 protein ', ' complement lysis inhibitor ', ' clusterin ', ' apolipoprotein J ', ' apoJ protein ', ' XIP8 protein ', ' X-ray-inducible protein 8 ', ' TRPM2 ', ' TRPM-2 protein ', ' SP 40,40 protein ', ' SGP2 ', ' SGP-2 protein ', ' MAC393 antigen ', ' sulfated glycoprotein 2 ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Link ', ' taxane ', ' Serum ', ' Blood Serum ', ' European ', ' Disease Progression ', ' Genetic ', ' Attenuated ', ' Malignant neoplasm of prostate ', ' Prostatic Cancer ', ' Prostate Cancer ', ' Prostate CA ', ' Malignant prostatic tumor ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Prostate ', ' Life ', ' Event ', ' Tumor Tissue ', ' American ', ' advanced disease ', ' advanced illness ', ' novel ', ' Bypass ', ' transcriptional coactivator p75 ', ' p75 transcription factor ', ' p75 ', ' Modeling ', ' glucocorticoid-induced orphan receptor ', ' receptor GPR83 ', ' glucocorticoid-induced receptor ', ' GIR receptor ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Pre-Clinical Model ', ' Preclinical Models ', ' Receptor Signaling ', ' Cancer Patient ', ' Tissue Microarray ', ' Tissue Chip ', ' Tissue Arrays ', ' Xenograft Model ', ' Molecular ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' therapy resistant ', ' treatment resistance ', ' therapeutic resistance ', ' resistant to therapy ', ' resistance to therapy ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Population ', ' Prostate Cancer therapy ', ' prostate cancer treatment ', ' Prostate CA therapy ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' disparity in cancer ', ' cancer disparity ', ' Resistance ', ' resistant ', ' Cell model ', ' Cellular model ', ' chemotherapy ', ' therapy design ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' tumor ', ' new therapeutic target ', ' novel therapy target ', ' novel therapeutic target ', ' novel pharmacotherapy target ', ' novel druggable target ', ' novel drug target ', ' new therapy target ', ' new pharmacotherapy target ', ' new druggable target ', ' new drug target ', ' transcriptome sequencing ', ' RNAseq ', ' RNA sequencing ', ' RNA Seq ', ' prostate cancer cell ', ' prostate tumor cell ', ' prostate cancer model ', ' prostate tumor model ', ' racial disparity ', ' race disparity ', ' disparities in race ', ' prostate cancer cell line ', ' disparity reduction ', ' reduce disparity ', ' mortality disparity ', ' disparities in mortality ', ' liquid biopsy ', ' androgen deprivation therapy ', ' androgen deprivation treatment ', ' androgen ablation therapy ', ' side effect ', ' ']",NCI,LOMA LINDA UNIVERSITY,R21,2019,61166,-0.0765619821049586
"Developing a Tailored, Theoretically-Driven Smartphone Physical Activity Intervention for African American Women PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Candidate. The Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award (K23) will enable me to acquire the focused training necessary to become an independent and leading investigator in technology- based physical activity interventions among African American women and reduce their risks for many chronic diseases. To date, I have gained exceptional training experiences in behavior change theories, research methods, multiculturalism, and diversity across different adult populations. This foundation facilitates the next steps of my proposed training, namely, developing expertise on the central factors related to regular physical activity engagement among African American (AA) women, and the skills necessary for the development, implementation, and evaluation of smartphone app technology prevention and intervention research. The proposed training and research will prepare me to take a leadership role in technology-enhanced interventions targeting PA disparities.  Proposed Research. Only 36% of African American (AA) women meet the national recommendation of 150 minutes per week of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity. Consequently, this group is disproportionally impacted by many associated disease conditions, including type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Research on physical activity disparity in this group indicates a triadic and reciprocal interaction between individual characteristics, social norms, and environmental factors. Smartphone application technology (e.g. apps) has been recommended as an innovative and low-burden platform to enhance theoretically driven approaches to promoting PA among AA women. This technology facilitates the development of effective, and scalable approaches delivered in real time and that can reach people in their daily environments. Moreover, this platform supports the development of innovative social networks for social support. Further, a counseling session intervention that helps AA women to develop an initial, individualized plan for PA before starting a PA program may help to increase levels of motivation for physical activity. This K-award applicant proposes an individually tailored, culturally relevant and smartphone delivered PA program including short text messages adapted from an effective internet-delivered intervention. The app program will contain activity monitoring features, educational videos, information on alternative and nearby environments, and a peer-to-peer chatroom to increase social support for PA behaviors in AA women compared to general wellness text messaging control condition. PROJECT NARRATIVE African American (AA) women are overwhelmingly physically inactive and suffer disproportionately from associated health conditions, including type II diabetes, coronary heart disease, and obesity. Smartphone applications technology provides a substantial opportunity to deliver evidenced-based behavioral interventions tailored for AA women and help to promote adherence to physical activity.","Developing a Tailored, Theoretically-Driven Smartphone Physical Activity Intervention for African American Women",9805486,K23MD014164,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+

"GeNYC: Genomic Implementation Research in the Diverse Settings and Populations of New York City The promise of genomic medicine implementation transforming healthcare and improving health will not be realized until discoveries become relevant to and available for use by diverse populations and the clinicians who care for them. Our GeNYC team is prepared to help medical genomics become an innovative, collaborative discipline with inclusiveness, health and health equity at its core. We have decades of experience engaging diverse stakeholders- researchers, patients, clinicians, advocates and entrepreneurs- to conduct chronic disease prevention and control clinical trials in our large health system and network of safety net clinics. In our 16 trials recently mean completed or underway, 80% included primary care or community sites, with a 732 participants/study, 69% were African ancestry (AA) or Latino, 17% refused, and we retained 84%. We chose toharness this expertise to conduct genomic implementation research. At the heart of our team is a Genomics Stakeholder Board. Together, we conducted GUARDD, a multi-site pragmatic clinical trial (PCT) to study effects and challenges of incorporating genetic risk information into primary care. We tested AA adults with hypertension, without diabetes or chronic kidney disease (CKD) for APOL1 high-risk variants nearly exclusive to AAs, that increase kidney failure risk 10-fold. We recruited 2052 AA adults from 15 community and academic primary care practices in NYC, trained lay staff who returned APOL1 results to patients and alerted clinicians of results through clinical decision support in electronic health records (EHRs). Our co-primary outcome, systolic blood pressure (SBP) at 3m (retention rate 93%) reduced by 6mmHg in those told they had high-risk APOL1 genotypes vs. 3mmHg if told they were low-risk (p=0.008).  We are now prepared and committed to join IGNITE II and conduct genomic implementation PCTs in diverse settings and populations. We brought a transdisciplinary team together for this purpose, and to study the impact of APO1 risk information on a broader phenotype of AA patients, including those with CKD, who have even higher risk for kidney failure and are often undiagnosed by primary care providers. We aim to: (1) Serve as an enhanced diversity site for IGNITE2, facilitating recruitment and retention of patients into genomic implementation PCTs; and (2) Conduct GUARDD-US, a network-wide PCT expanding GUARDD to AA patients without and with CKD and to other IGNITE sites with different patient and provider populations. We will randomize patients to APOL1 testing vs. waitlist control, and evaluate impact on SBP, renal diagnosis, cost effectiveness and psycho-behavioral outcomes, so results can inform decisions by clinicians, policymakers and payers. If successful, GeNYC may provide a robust framework for future endeavors to implement genomic medicine in diverse clinical practices, validate APOL1 risk-informed management of hypertensive AA patients at high risk of kidney failure, contribute to important efforts to eliminate racial, ethnic and ancestral disparities in health, and show that vulnerable populations can be the first to benefit from genomic discoveries. Our stakeholder-engaged team is experienced in conducting clinical trials in diverse populations, including one with >2000 African ancestry patients with high genetic risk for CKD.

"Feasibility of the Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction Intervention for Black Women Living with HIV Project Summary/Abstract The overall objective of this Mentored Research Scientist Career Development Award is to support and develop Dr. Chapman Lambert’s transition to an independent investigator in mind and body research with a focus on developing, integrating, and testing mind and body strategies to improve clinical, psychological, and physical outcomes among African American (AA) women living with HIV (WLWH). HIV viral load (VL) suppression among AA WLWH are suboptimal when compared to women of other racial and ethnic backgrounds. Two essential self- care behaviors for people living with HIV (PLWH) to achieve and sustain HIV VL suppression ad improve health outcomes and survival are adherence to antiretroviral therapy and scheduled medical visits. Medical visit adherence is suboptimal among women in general, but VL suppression rates among AA WLWH are suboptimal with AA WLWH being nearly 3 times more likely than White WLWH not to achieve viral suppression. One important factor associated with adherence behaviors is stressful life events including traumatic life events. Thus, there is a critical need to develop culturally appropriate interventions aimed reducing stress and improving adherence behaviors and VL suppression. Mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR), developed by Jon Kabat-Zinn, has the potential to reduced stress through self-regulation of attention and awareness to stressful events. MBSR has demonstrated efficacy in improving stress management, psychological distress, physical and psychological symptoms, quality of life, and coping as well as ART adherence in predominately white and male patient populations. We propose to culturally adapt the MSBR intervention for AA WLWH to reduce stress and enhance HIV self-care behaviors and VL suppression, which has the potential to attenuate prominent racial and gender disparities experienced by AA WLWH in the US. Specifically, we aim to 1) culturally adapt the MBSR intervention for AA WLWH using ADAPT-ITT; 2) pre-pilot the adapted intervention via an open non-randomized pilot study to further refine the culturally adapted intervention; and 3) conduct a 2-armed pilot test of the behavioral intervention compared to standard of care to assess the feasibility and acceptability the adapted MBSR intervention for AA WLWH. Findings from this study will provide an important first step in establishing my program of research as an independent investigator in stress-related morbidity and HIV treatment adherence. In addition, findings maybe applicable for other chronic conditions and marginalized populations living with and without HIV. Project Narrative African American (AA) women living with HIV (WLWH)are at higher risk for experiencing stressful life events which can lead to deleterious health outcomes. Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) offers a complementary and integrative approach for reducing stress as a mechanism for improving HIV treatment adherence behaviors, HIV viral load suppression and survival. The objective of this study is to culturally adapt an existing MBSR intervention to meet the needs of AA WLWH, and assess the feasibility and acceptability of the adapted intervention among the target population.",Feasibility of the Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction Intervention for Black Women Living with HIV,9844220,K23AT010567,"['Accounting ', ' Attention ', ' Awareness ', ' Behavior ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' behavior intervention ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Communities ', ' Critiques ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' Epidemic ', ' Female ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Group Interviews ', ' Health ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' Interview ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' male ', ' Manuals ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methods ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' mortality ', ' Out-patients ', ' Outpatients ', ' pilot study ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' Publishing ', ' QOL ', ' Quality of life ', ' Research ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Research Design ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' personal care ', ' Self Care ', ' Self Regulation ', ' Informal Social Control ', ' Stress ', ' Stressful Event ', ' Suggestion ', ' Target Populations ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Gender ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' Research Methods ', ' Research Methodology ', ' Schedule ', ' Caring ', ' stress buffering ', ' stress management ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' psychologic ', ' psychological ', ' Survivors ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Failure ', ' Logistics ', ' satisfaction ', ' Attenuated ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Viral Load result ', ' Viral Load ', ' Viral Burden ', ' Scientist ', ' Event ', ' Clinic ', ' Health behavior outcomes ', ' Viral ', ' Visit ', ' experience ', ' Participant ', ' behavior test ', ' behavioral test ', ' Reporting ', ' psychological distress ', ' Sampling ', ' career development ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' HIV diagnosis ', ' therapy adherence ', ' Length ', ' Adherence ', ' Data ', ' Mind-Body Method ', ' mind/body method ', ' mind-body research ', ' Mind/Body Research ', ' Mind Research ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' K-Series Research Career Programs ', ' Research Career Program ', ' K-Awards ', ' Career Development Programs K-Series ', ' Career Development Awards and Programs ', ' Career Development Awards ', ' Conduct Clinical Trials ', ' Process ', ' symptom management ', ' manage symptom ', ' antiretroviral therapy ', ' antiretroviral treatment ', ' anti-retroviral treatment ', ' anti-retroviral therapy ', ' Interpersonal Violence ', ' data integration ', ' Treatment Efficacy ', ' therapy efficacy ', ' therapeutically effective ', ' therapeutic efficacy ', ' intervention efficacy ', ' efficacy trial ', ' Outcome ', ' coping ', ' Population ', ' Mind ', ' Trauma ', ' mindfulness-based stress reduction ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' therapy development ', ' treatment development ', ' intervention development ', ' develop therapy ', ' high risk ', ' patient population ', ' standard of care ', ' treatment as usual ', ' usual care ', ' treatment adherence ', ' data format ', ' arm ', ' racial disparity ', ' race disparity ', ' disparities in race ', ' Breast Cancer survivor ', ' gender disparity ', ' psychological symptom ', ' physical symptom ', ' recruit ', ' care providers ', ' primary care provider ', ' stress reduction ', ' visit adherence ', ' behavioral adherence ', ' behavior adherence ', ' adherence rate ', ' ']",NCCIH,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,K23,2019,136419,0.059138923237935355
"Depletion of pancreatic lipid improves beta-cell function in early type 2 diabetes The decline in first-phase insulin secretion is a key event in the etiology of type 2 diabetes (T2D). Although the cause of beta-cell failure is not clear, “lipotoxicity” has been proposed. Bariatric surgery and very-low calorie diets in patients with T2D induce disease remission, characterized by a return of first-phase insulin secretion and a depletion of pancreas lipid. However, these are extreme approaches to treating T2D, and non-invasive, sustainable, yet equally effective, treatments are needed. We have shown in individuals at risk for T2D that an intervention with a weight-maintaining low-glycemic (LG) diet selectively depletes visceral adipose tissue and ectopic lipid in muscle while preserving thigh subcutaneous adipose and lean body mass. This observation suggests that such diets are able to “remodel” body composition by re-partitioning energy away from metabolically harmful lipid stores. Participants on the LG diet also demonstrated improved insulin sensitivity and a dramatic (9-fold) increase in first-phase insulin secretion. Thus, we hypothesize that a weight-maintaining LG diet will selectively deplete ectopic adipose tissue, including pancreatic lipid, and will permit recovery of beta-cell function in individuals with T2D. Rescue of beta-cell function may be particularly important in African-Americans (AA), who as a group demonstrate a high prevalence of T2D, for reasons that cannot be explained by lifestyle. AA are likely to be vulnerable to beta-cell failure due to inherently high beta-cell responsiveness (demonstrable in healthy young children). Further, it has been shown that pancreas lipid is a determinant of prediabetes specifically in AA. Thus, we hypothesize that an LG diet will be particularly beneficial to beta-cell function and glycemic control among AA. To test these hypotheses, we will conduct a randomized clinical trial to examine the impact a weight-maintaining LG diet vs a Control diet (ADA/USDA) with all food provided on changes in pancreatic lipid by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and first-phase insulin secretion by hyperglycemic clamp and oral meal test in AA and European-American (EA) individuals with early T2D (<5 yr since diagnosis). The study will be powered to examine race-specific effects (race x diet interaction). This proposal responds to PA-17-021, “Addressing Health Disparities in NIDDK Diseases.” The results from this study could change clinical care guidelines to incorporate an LG diet, which may reduce the disproportionate burden of T2D and its complications experienced by AA. Type 2 diabetes develops because the pancreas is no longer able to secrete enough insulin to control blood sugar. Patients with type 2 diabetes have more fat in their pancreas than healthy individuals, and if pancreas fat is reduced, insulin secretion returns. In this study, we will determine if a low sugar diet can reduce pancreas fat and improve insulin secretion and glucose control in patients with type 2 diabetes.",Depletion of pancreatic lipid improves beta-cell function in early type 2 diabetes,9664616,R01DK116726,"['Adipose tissue ', ' yellow adipose tissue ', ' white adipose tissue ', ' adipose ', ' Fatty Tissue ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Blood Glucose ', ' Blood Sugar ', ' Body Composition ', ' Subcellular Process ', ' Cellular Process ', ' Cellular Physiology ', ' Cellular Function ', ' Cell Process ', ' Cell Function ', ' Cell physiology ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' type two diabetes ', ' type II DM ', ' type 2 DM ', ' maturity onset diabetes ', ' ketosis resistant diabetes ', ' adult onset diabetes ', ' Type II diabetes ', ' Type II Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Type 2 diabetes ', ' Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus ', ' T2DM ', ' T2D ', ' T2 DM ', ' Stable Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Slow-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Noninsulin Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Noninsulin Dependent Diabetes ', ' Non-Insulin Dependent Diabetes ', ' NIDDM ', ' Maturity-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Ketosis-Resistant Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Adult-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Diagnosis ', ' dietary ', ' Diet ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' drug treatment ', ' Drug Therapy ', ' Pharmacotherapy ', ' Fats ', ' Fatty acid glycerol esters ', ' Food or Food Product ', ' Food ', ' hyperglycemic ', ' Hyperglycemia ', ' Regular Insulin ', ' Novolin R ', ' Humulin R ', ' Insulin ', ' insulin resistant ', ' Insulin Resistance ', ' Lifestyle ', ' Life Style ', ' Lipids ', ' lifespan ', ' life span ', ' Length of Life ', ' Longevity ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' MRI ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MR Imaging ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' muscular ', ' Muscle Tissue ', ' Muscle ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Obesity ', ' Pancreatic ', ' Pancreas ', ' Patients ', ' QOL ', ' Quality of life ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Testing ', ' Thigh ', ' Thigh structure ', ' Weight ', ' Euglycemic Clamping ', ' Glucose Clamp ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' Guidelines ', ' improved ', ' Phase ', ' Randomized Clinical Trials ', ' disability ', ' Failure ', ' Individual ', ' Recovery ', ' European ', ' sugar ', ' Populations at Risk ', ' Disease Progression ', ' Fat-Restricted Diet ', ' Low-Fat Diet ', ' Metabolic ', ' tool ', ' Prediabetes syndrome ', ' prediabetic ', ' pre-diabetic ', ' pre-diabetes ', ' Prediabetic State ', ' Prediabetes ', ' Calories ', ' Event ', ' Oral ', ' Visceral ', ' subcutaneous ', ' restoration ', ' Closure by clamp ', ' Clampings ', ' Disease remission ', ' Remission ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' cell injury ', ' cell damage ', ' Cellular injury ', ' Participant ', ' ethnic difference ', ' ethnicity difference ', ' response ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' insulin sensitivity ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' βCell ', ' β-cells ', ' β-cell ', ' Insulin Secreting Cell ', ' Insulin Cell ', ' Beta Cell ', ' insulin secretion ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' disease causation ', ' causation ', ' Causality ', ' Etiology ', ' Address ', ' bariatric surgery ', ' weight loss surgery ', ' stomach stapling ', ' obesity surgery ', ' implantable gastric stimulation banding ', ' gastric bypass surgery ', ' gastric banding ', ' Symptoms ', ' High Prevalence ', ' National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases ', ' NIDDK ', ' Characteristics ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' weight maintenance ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' glycemic control ', ' blood glucose regulation ', ' glucose regulation ', ' glucose homeostasis ', ' glucose control ', ' Prevalence ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' non-diabetic ', ' nondiabetic ', ' clinical care ', ' patient population ', ' treatment response ', ' therapeutic response ', ' response to treatment ', ' effective therapy ', ' effective treatment ', ' lean body mass ', ' preservation ', ' ']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,R01,2019,532756,0.042192509624213295
"Food Allergy Outcomes Related to White and African American Racial Differences (FORWARD) PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Background: Food allergy (FA) is a potentially life-threatening condition that affects an estimated 8% of children in the United States. Although differences between African American (AA) and White children in the prevalence and severity of other atopic conditions such as asthma and eczema have been well described, little is known about such differences in FA. The limited existing literature indicates that AA children may have worse clinical outcomes, including rates of FA-related fatal anaphylaxis and FA-related emergency department (ED) visits, than their White peers. Phenotypic and endotypic differences, including rates of sensitization and co-morbidities, between AA and White children are beginning to be examined. Data on racial differences in FA management practices are incomplete; preliminary data suggest that AA families spend significantly less on allergen-free foods and FA medications than do White families. Families caring for children with FA experience significant impairments in psychosocial outcomes, including FA-related quality of life (FAQoL); however, these data come primarily from White, privately insured families, and little is known about psychosocial outcomes in AA families. Two recent reviews concluded that existing studies examining racial disparities in FA are far too methodologically limited to draw definitive conclusions, primarily due to reliance on self-report of FA diagnosis and cross-sectional designs. Specific Aims and Methods: Our goal is to prospectively study a cohort of 600 AA and White children (0-12 years) with FA in order to: 1) Determine variability in clinical FA outcomes between AA and White patients via bimonthly remote assessments, biannual clinic visits, and medical chart review over a two-year period; 2) Examine phenotypic and endotypic differences between AA and White children with FA using specific laboratory specimen collection techniques and assays; 3) Identify differences between AA and White children in FA management practices by parent report (e.g. allergen avoidance and epinephrine carriage); and 4) Determine differences between AA and White children in psychosocial FA-related outcomes (e.g., FA-related quality of life, bullying, anxiety, and worry) via the above survey methods. Hypotheses and Expected Results: We hypothesize that compared to White children, AA children will: have higher rates of food-allergic reactions and FA-related healthcare utilization; demonstrate unique FA phenotypes and endotypes; have poorer knowledge of FA management and worse adherence to preventative behaviors; have limited access to medications and allergen-free foods; and report better quality of life. Significance and Effects on Other Research: Confirming and further characterizing differences between AA and White children with FA will provide the data required to develop clinical guidelines, optimize treatment, and build health policies that meet the needs of both AA and White children. Project Narrative Childhood food allergy is a serious health condition affecting 8% of children in the US.

"Analysis of Racial Disparities in HCC by Systems Metabolomics ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a significant health problem in the United States. Compared to European Americans (EA), the incidence of HCC is higher in African Americans (AA) and is associated with more advanced tumor stage at diagnosis and lower survival rates. It has been reported that the sensitivity of α- fetoprotein (AFP) for the diagnosis of HCC in African Americans with hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is lower than that of patients of all other racial groups combined. We previously performed preliminary investigation into racial disparities through metabolomics profiling of sera from HCC cases and patients with liver cirrhosis by using both liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Through stratified analysis of the LC/GC-MS data, we identified different candidates that distinguish HCC cases from the cirrhotic controls among AA and EA. This application builds on these promising preliminary results to find and validate race-specific metabolites as biomarkers for HCC. This will be accomplished by targeted analysis of metabolites in liver tissues and sera from HCC cases and patients with liver cirrhosis representing AA and EA. Metabolites that differentiate HCC cases from cirrhotic controls in a race-specific manner will be selected by statistical and network-based methods. Then, a systems-oriented approach that combines these metabolites with other candidate biomarkers (genes, glycans, and proteins) will be utilized for the selection of key signaling pathways perturbed in HCC. Following validation of the candidates via independent samples from HCC cases, patients with liver cirrhosis, and healthy subjects, we will elucidate their functional roles through both in vitro and in vivo experiments. Successful completion of this research will enable us to identify HCC biomarkers and perturbed pathways that are race-specific as well as those that are shared by AA and EA. These findings will contribute not only to a greater understanding of racial disparities in HCC but also to improving diagnosis of HCC through race-specific biomarkers. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Currently used biomarkers for detecting hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in high-risk cirrhotic patients lack the desired sensitivity and specificity, particularly in African American patients. The goal of this project is to find and validate race-specific biomarkers for HCC and identify perturbed intercellular signaling pathways in HCC. If successful, the study will (1) contribute to a greater understanding of racial disparities in HCC, (2) enable accurate detection of HCC by using race as a factor, and (3) give insights into the mechanisms underlying the behavior of potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets.",Analysis of Racial Disparities in HCC by Systems Metabolomics,9830163,U01CA185188,"['alpha-Fetoproteins ', ' α-Fetoproteins ', ' Fetuins ', ' Alpha-Fetoglobulin ', ' Alpha-1-Fetoprotein ', ' Behavior ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' cultured cell line ', ' Strains Cell Lines ', ' CellLine ', ' Cell Line ', ' neoplastic transformation ', ' Neoplastic Cell Transformation ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cells ', ' vapor phase chromatography ', ' Gas Chromatography ', ' Clinical Markers ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Enzyme Gene ', ' Enzymes ', ' Genes ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' non-A, non-B hepatitis ', ' non A, non B hepatitis ', ' hepatitis non A non B ', ' hep C ', ' Hepatitus C ', ' Hepatitis, Viral, Non-A, Non-B, Parenterally-Transmitted ', ' Hepatitis C virus infection ', ' HCV infection ', ' Hepatitis C ', ' liver carcinoma ', ' Liver Cells Carcinoma ', ' Hepatoma ', ' Hepatocellular cancer ', ' Hepatocellular Carcinoma ', ' Hepatocarcinoma ', ' Primary carcinoma of the liver cells ', ' University Hospitals ', ' In Vitro ', ' Incidence ', ' hepatic organ system ', ' hepatic body system ', ' Liver ', ' Hepatic Cirrhosis ', ' Liver Cirrhosis ', ' mass fragmentometry ', ' ion trap mass spectrometry ', ' Mass-Gas Chromatography Spectrum Analysis ', ' Mass-Gas Chromatography Spectrometry ', ' Mass Fragmentographies ', ' Gas-Liquid-Mass Spectrometry Chromatography ', ' GCMS ', ' GC MS ', ' Mass Fragmentography ', ' Methods ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Glycans ', ' Polysaccharides ', ' Proteins ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Research ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Sensitivity and Specificity ', ' Signal Pathway ', ' Mass Spectrum Analyses ', ' Mass Spectrum ', ' Mass Spectroscopy ', ' Mass Spectrometry ', ' Mass Photometry/Spectrum Analysis ', ' Mass Spectrum Analysis ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Survival Rate ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Tissues ', ' United States ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Biological ', ' Biochemical ', ' Chemicals ', ' Hepatocyte ', ' Liver Cells ', ' Hepatic Parenchymal Cell ', ' Hepatic Cells ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' European ', ' Patient Recruitments ', ' participant recruitment ', ' Investigation ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' Xenograft procedure ', ' xeno-transplantation ', ' xeno-transplant ', ' Xenotransplantation ', ' Xenograft ', ' Heterologous Transplantation ', ' Heterograft ', ' American ', ' Cell Proliferation ', ' Cellular Proliferation ', ' Cell Multiplication ', ' Cell Growth in Number ', ' Performance ', ' Participant ', ' ethnic difference ', ' ethnicity difference ', ' Reporting ', ' Gene Proteins ', ' Protein Gene Products ', ' Pathway Analysis ', ' Network Analysis ', ' Sampling ', ' Proteomics ', ' liquid chromatography mass spectrometry ', ' LC/MS ', ' Metabolic Pathway ', ' T-Stage ', ' Tumor stage ', ' metabonomics ', ' metabolism measurement ', ' metabolomics ', ' AFP gene ', ' HPAFP ', ' FETA ', ' AFP ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Stage at Diagnosis ', ' in vivo ', ' Validation ', ' Preparation ', ' Cirrhosis ', ' cirrhotic ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' predictive modeling ', ' prognostic model ', ' prediction model ', ' computer based prediction ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' transcriptomics ', ' Network-based ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' healthy volunteer ', ' therapeutic target ', ' network models ', ' high risk ', ' public health relevance ', ' population based ', ' candidate marker ', ' candidate biomarker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' cancer initiation ', ' candidate validation ', ' racial disparity ', ' race disparity ', ' disparities in race ', ' potential biomarker ', ' potential biological marker ', ' multiple omics ', ' multiomics ', ' specific biomarkers ', ' ethnic diversity ', ' ethnically diverse ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' recruit ', ' biomarker validation ', ' marker validation ', ' Multiomic Data ', ' multiple omic data ', ' ']",NCI,GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY,U01,2019,61751,0.0776127873449452
"GeNYC: Genomic Implementation Research in the Diverse Settings and Populations of New York City The promise of genomic medicine implementation transforming healthcare and improving health will not be realized until discoveries become relevant to and available for use by diverse populations and the clinicians who care for them. Our GeNYC team is prepared to help medical genomics become an innovative, collaborative discipline with inclusiveness, health and health equity at its core. We have decades of experience engaging diverse stakeholders- researchers, patients, clinicians, advocates and entrepreneurs- to conduct chronic disease prevention and control clinical trials in our large health system and network of safety net clinics. In our 16 trials recently mean completed or underway, 80% included primary care or community sites, with a 732 participants/study, 69% were African ancestry (AA) or Latino, 17% refused, and we retained 84%. We chose toharness this expertise to conduct genomic implementation research. At the heart of our team is a Genomics Stakeholder Board. Together, we conducted GUARDD, a multi-site pragmatic clinical trial (PCT) to study effects and challenges of incorporating genetic risk information into primary care. We tested AA adults with hypertension, without diabetes or chronic kidney disease (CKD) for APOL1 high-risk variants nearly exclusive to AAs, that increase kidney failure risk 10-fold. We recruited 2052 AA adults from 15 community and academic primary care practices in NYC, trained lay staff who returned APOL1 results to patients and alerted clinicians of results through clinical decision support in electronic health records (EHRs). Our co-primary outcome, systolic blood pressure (SBP) at 3m (retention rate 93%) reduced by 6mmHg in those told they had high-risk APOL1 genotypes vs. 3mmHg if told they were low-risk (p=0.008).  We are now prepared and committed to join IGNITE II and conduct genomic implementation PCTs in diverse settings and populations. We brought a transdisciplinary team together for this purpose, and to study the impact of APO1 risk information on a broader phenotype of AA patients, including those with CKD, who have even higher risk for kidney failure and are often undiagnosed by primary care providers. We aim to: (1) Serve as an enhanced diversity site for IGNITE2, facilitating recruitment and retention of patients into genomic implementation PCTs; and (2) Conduct GUARDD-US, a network-wide PCT expanding GUARDD to AA patients without and with CKD and to other IGNITE sites with different patient and provider populations. We will randomize patients to APOL1 testing vs. waitlist control, and evaluate impact on SBP, renal diagnosis, cost effectiveness and psycho-behavioral outcomes, so results can inform decisions by clinicians, policymakers and payers. If successful, GeNYC may provide a robust framework for future endeavors to implement genomic medicine in diverse clinical practices, validate APOL1 risk-informed management of hypertensive AA patients at high risk of kidney failure, contribute to important efforts to eliminate racial, ethnic and ancestral disparities in health, and show that vulnerable populations can be the first to benefit from genomic discoveries. Our stakeholder-engaged team is experienced in conducting clinical trials in diverse populations, including one with >2000 African ancestry patients with high genetic risk for CKD.

"Obesity risk in African American women is determined by a diet-by-phenotype interaction Summary  African-American (AA) women are disproportionately burdened by obesity. Our published data have led to the provocative hypothesis that this disparity has physiologic underpinnings. Specifically, AA women are characterized by a high acute insulin secretory response to a glucose challenge, as well as reduced hepatic insulin extraction, which together lead to postprandial circulating insulin concentrations that can be several fold higher than those observed in Caucasian (European-American, EA) women. The lipogenic actions of insulin could favor partitioning of energy to adipose tissue at the expense of ATP (energy) production. In fact, AA women have lower energy requirements than EA women, and are more energetically efficient. High insulin secretion, however, is only one factor that determines insulin action; another major factor is insulin sensitivity. Our data have shown that over time, weight (fat) gain in obesity-prone AA women is higher in those who are more insulin sensitive, whereas “obesity-resistant” (constitutionally lean) AA women have relatively lower insulin sensitivity. Our data also suggest that the lipogenic actions of insulin in AA women are exacerbated by a high-glycemic diet, which promotes insulin secretion. Finally, our data have shown that over time weight (fat) gain in AA women is predicted by the combination of insulin sensitivity and dietary glycemic load. Taken together, these observations suggest that many AA women are predisposed to obesity by their endocrine make-up, and that this predisposition is exacerbated by a high-glycemic diet. A natural corollary of this hypothesis is that for implementation of intentional weight loss, a low- (vs high-) glycemic diet will promote greater loss of body fat, and will enable successful weight loss maintenance by increasing energy expenditure. This corollary is supported by our preliminary data that indicate a 50% greater loss of fat with low- vs high-glycemic diet under controlled conditions in AA women. The project proposed herein will test these hypotheses through a randomized clinical weight loss trial of high- vs low-glycemic diets in obese AA women. The study has both an efficacy phase (controlled feeding during weight loss) to probe physiologic mechanisms (energy expenditure, metabolic efficiency), and an effectiveness phase (6-month free-living follow-up) to test the hypothesis that the low-glycemic diet will be more effective at promoting weight loss maintenance due in part to improved adherence and quality of life, and ease of implementing the diet. This study is innovative in that it proposes to test a specific physiologic mechanism that may underlie propensity to obesity; it includes both efficacy and effectiveness outcomes; it involves both quantitative and qualitative methodology; and it tackles optimization of both weight loss and weight loss maintenance. This study is intended to provide the evidence base necessary to improve the clinical care approach to weight loss. Using a randomized clinical trial intervention study design, we will test the hypothesis that the metabolic phenotype of obese African-American women predisposes them to obesity when they eat a specific type of diet. We predict that women who consume a low glycemic diet will lose more weight and be more successful with maintaining weight loss than women who consome a high glycemic diet, due in part to higher resting and total metabolic rate and lower metabolic efficiency. Results from this study will verify that the high obesity prevalence in African-American women is due to their unique physiology, and will offer a dietary means for preventing and/or reversing obesity not only in this group, but in any individual with similar endocrine characteristics.",Obesity risk in African American women is determined by a diet-by-phenotype interaction,9769722,R01DK115483,"['Adipose tissue ', ' yellow adipose tissue ', ' white adipose tissue ', ' adipose ', ' Fatty Tissue ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Body Composition ', ' Body Weight ', ' Indirect Calorimetry ', ' Respiration Calorimetry ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' dietary ', ' Diet ', ' Food Intake ', ' Eating ', ' Energy Expenditure ', ' Energy Metabolism ', ' Exercise Test ', ' Exercise stress test ', ' Fats ', ' Fatty acid glycerol esters ', ' Food or Food Product ', ' Food ', ' Dextrose ', ' D-Glucose ', ' Glucose ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Regular Insulin ', ' Novolin R ', ' Humulin R ', ' Insulin ', ' interventions research ', ' interventional study ', ' interventional research ', ' intervention research ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Maintenance ', ' Methodology ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Obesity ', ' oxidation ', ' Phenotype ', ' Physiology ', ' Production ', ' Publishing ', ' QOL ', ' Quality of life ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Research Design ', ' Rest ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' satiety ', ' Satiation ', ' Testing ', ' Leanness ', ' Thinness ', ' Time ', ' Urine Urinary System ', ' Urine ', ' wt-loss ', ' body weight loss ', ' Weight Reduction ', ' Weight Loss ', ' Body Weight decreased ', ' Weight ', ' white race ', ' Occidental ', ' Caucasoid Race ', ' Caucasoid ', ' Caucasian Race ', ' Caucasian ', ' Caucasians ', ' Woman ', ' Measures ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' genetic manipulation ', ' improved ', ' Hepatic ', ' Acute ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Randomized Clinical Trials ', ' Predisposition ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Individual ', ' European ', ' Fat-Restricted Diet ', ' Low-Fat Diet ', ' Metabolic ', ' Exposure to ', ' Body fat ', ' Pattern ', ' Endocrine ', ' American ', ' Animal Model ', ' model organism ', ' model of animal ', ' Animal Models and Related Studies ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Self-Report ', ' racial difference ', ' race differences ', ' Prevention ', ' Palate ', ' response ', ' insulin sensitivity ', ' insulin secretion ', ' Effectiveness ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Dual-Energy X-Ray Absorptiometry ', ' DXA ', ' DEXA ', ' Adherence ', ' Constitutional ', ' Data ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Monitor ', ' Characteristics ', ' follow-up ', ' followup ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' active followup ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' obesity treatment ', ' feeding ', ' Outcome ', ' Obesity associated disease ', ' Obesity related disease ', ' Prevalence ', ' prospective ', ' Consumption ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' Resistance ', ' resistant ', ' obesity risk ', ' risk of obesity ', ' risk for obesity ', ' clinical care ', ' evidence base ', ' clinical practice ', ' personalized medicine ', ' personalized treatment ', ' personalized therapy ', ' personalization of treatment ', ' racial disparity ', ' race disparity ', ' disparities in race ', ' metabolic rate ', ' metabolic phenotype ', ' metabotype ', ' doubly-labeled water ', ' total energy expenditure ', ' Total Daily Energy Expenditure ', ' preservation ', ' ']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,R01,2019,655991,0.09149142548814705
"MicroRNAs in African American Prostate Cancer ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Prostate cancer (PCa) is the most common cancer in men in the United States, which disproportionately affects African Americans (AA) with higher incidence, advanced disease and worse prognosis. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are non-coding RNAs that represent universal gene regulatory mechanism exerting its effect primarily by binding to 3'UTR of target and affect cell survival, proliferation, cancer initiation, development and metastasis. We recently reported differential expression of miRNAs in PCa tissues and body fluids. In this proposal, we present preliminary data on selected two miRNAs that are downregulated in age/disease matched African American (AA) when compared with Caucasian (CA) PCa tissues. We present preliminary data on modulation cancer cell growth, migration, anoikis, angiogenesis and modulation of EMT signaling. We have preliminarily identified several miRNA targets that may explain miRNA mechanisms in PCa progression. We report miRNA modulation of JNK1-Sp1 signaling which is known to modulate angiogenesis and metastasis. We hypothesize that differential loss of selected microRNAs in AA PCa deregulates an intricate signaling network, leading to aggressive phenotype. Further these miRNAs could be used as biomarkers to distinguish between indolent vs. aggressive disease (predominant in AAs) and serve as novel therapeutic targets. The specific aims of this proposal are: (1) to study the clinical significance of microRNAs and their targets in age/race matched PCa tissues and their adjacent benign regions and disease staged PCa TMAs; (2) to validate miRNA targets and delineate signaling mechanisms by generating miRNA gene deletions in AA and CA prostate cells by genome editing using [Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR associated (CAS) nuclease Cas9); (3) Investigate the role of microRNAs in experimental prostate carcinogenesis in vitro and in vivo by studying their gain and loss of function in AA and CA prostate cancer cells and in vivo by examining the effects on tumor growth and metastasis in an orthotopic mouse model. Recognizing miRNAs as basis of PCa pathogenesis, disparity and understanding their biological implications will significantly impact diagnosis and treatment development for aggressive PCa common in African American men. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposal will characterize selected microRNAs that are downregulated in African American (AA) prostate cancer (PCa) tissues when compared with Caucasian (CA) PCa. Their characterization will provide basic mechanistic insights into their role in prostate carcinogenesis, as biomarker and therapeutic targets.

"Daily Experiences among Black and White Dementia Caregivers: Implications for Well-being and Cardiovascular Health African Americans (AAs) are 2 to 3 more times more likely have Alzheimer’s disease and related dementia (ADRD) compared to European Americans (EAs), placing high burden on AA families. AA ADRD caregivers tend to report better mental health but worse physical health than EA ADRD caregivers. Caregiving predicts increased risk of hypertension and coronary heart disease (CHD), which are more common among AAs than EAs. Studies of daily experiences provide crucial information regarding the mechanisms by which caregiving experience is linked with health, yet little is known about race differences in daily positive and negative experiences among ADRD caregivers or their links with daily well-being and cardiovascular health. In response to PAR-18- 027 Research on Informal and Formal Caregiving for Alzheimer's Disease, the present study seeks to understand the dynamic associations between daily experiences, well-being, and cardiovascular health among AA and EA ADRD caregivers. We will collect detailed self-report and cardiovascular data with two components: 1) a baseline interview, and 2) a daily study which incorporates a 5-day, 6-times a day, ecological momentary assessments (EMAs) of self-reported exposure and reactivity (psychological and behavioral) to negative and positive events, as well two ambulatory monitoring devices to assess cardiovascular reactivity (heart rate, heart rate variability, and blood pressure). The persons living with dementia (PLWDs) will also wear a monitor to assess heart rate, and heart rate variability. The sample will include 150 EA and 150 AA caregivers (70% women; 30% men) in the Detroit metropolitan area (recruited via area agencies and community organizations) who co-reside with and provide unpaid caregiving for a PLWD. The study addresses three aims: 1) Compare daily positive and negative care-related and noncare experiences among AA and EA caregivers, 2) Examine links among daily experiences (positive and negative care- related and noncare experiences), daily self-reported well-being, and daily cardiovascular health among AA and EA caregivers and the PLWD, and 3) Identify AA and AE caregivers who are more or less resilient to daily care-related and non-care stress. Identifying racial disparities in daily experiences that shape mental and physical health will inform targeted interventions to maintain caregivers’ well-being and enhance their ability to provide quality care. African Americans (AAs) are 2 to 3 more times more likely have Alzheimer’s disease or related dementia (ADRD) compared to European Americans (EAs), placing high burden on AA families. The present study seeks to understand the dynamic associations between daily experiences, well-being and cardiovascular health among AA and EA caregivers of individuals with ADRD. Understanding the biological and social mechanisms by which race is linked with the cardiovascular system is key for potentially reducing racial disparities in hypertension and hypertension related mortality among ADRD caregivers.",Daily Experiences among Black and White Dementia Caregivers: Implications for Well-being and Cardiovascular Health,9710996,R01AG063200,"[""Alzheimer's Disease "", ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Alzheimers Dementia ', "" Alzheimer's "", ' Alzheimer syndrome ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Behavior ', ' Blood Pressure ', ' Buffers ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' circulatory system ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' coronary disorder ', ' atherosclerotic heart disease ', ' Coronary Disease ', ' Coronary heart disease ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Discrimination ', ' Food Intake ', ' Eating ', ' Family ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' Cardiac Chronotropism ', ' Heart Rate ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' high blood pressure ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Hypertension ', ' Interview ', ' Literature ', ' longterm care ', ' extended care ', ' Long-Term Care ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' mortality ', ' Persons ', ' wellbeing ', ' well-being ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Research ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Smoking ', ' Software ', ' Computer software ', ' Stress ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Woman ', ' Care Givers ', ' Caregivers ', ' falls ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' Family Care Giver ', ' Family Caregiver ', ' Caring ', ' Social Network ', ' base ', ' Area ', ' Biological ', ' psychologic ', ' psychological ', ' Link ', ' disability ', ' Individual ', ' health care service utilization ', ' healthcare utilization ', ' healthcare service utilization ', ' healthcare service use ', ' health care service use ', ' Health Care Utilization ', ' European ', ' Ambulatory Monitoring ', ' Outpatient Monitoring ', ' Shapes ', ' Knowledge ', ' Well in self ', ' sense of wellbeing ', ' self wellness ', ' psychological wellness ', ' psychological wellbeing ', ' mental wellbeing ', ' mental well-being ', ' emotional wellbeing ', ' Sense of well-being ', ' Psychological Well Being ', ' Normal psyche ', ' Normal mental state ', ' Normal mental condition ', ' Feels well ', ' Emotional well being ', ' Hour ', ' Event ', ' Dementia ', ' Amentia ', ' physical conditioning ', ' physical health ', ' psychosocial ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' monitoring device ', ' metropolitan ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Self-Report ', ' racial difference ', ' race differences ', ' vigilance ', ' Reporting ', ' emotional distress ', ' feeling upset ', ' feeling distress ', ' social ', ' Emotional ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Quality of Care ', ' QOC ', ' response ', ' theories ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Car Phone ', ' Mobile Phones ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Monitor ', ' Behavioral ', ' caregiving ', ' care giving ', ' cost ', ' resilience ', ' Outcome ', ' coping ', ' Individual Differences ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' community organizations ', ' heart rate variability ', ' stress reactivity ', ' racial disparity ', ' race disparity ', ' disparities in race ', ' cardiovascular health ', ' Ecological momentary assessment ', ' Caregiver well-being ', ' caregiver wellbeing ', ' care giver wellbeing ', ' care giver well-being ', ' informal caregiving ', ' Informal care giving ', ' Dementia caregivers ', ' dementia care giver ', ' Formal caregiving ', ' Formal care giving ', ' mortality disparity ', ' disparities in mortality ', ' physical symptom ', ' recruit ', "" Alzheimer's disease related dementia "", ' Alzheimer related dementia ', ' ADRD ', ' ']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2019,779559,0.05445914148808108
"Vitamin D Deficiency Leads to Increased Intra-Prostatic Androgens  in African American Men PROJECT SUMMARY This proposal is built around our hypothesis that intra-prostatic androgens may be the link between two undisputable disparities in African American (AA) men; vitamin D deficiency and prostate cancer (PCa). We propose that the molecular response of prostate tissues to low vitamin D status leads to increased intracellular import of not only vitamin D, but also androgens. Megalin is the endocytic membrane receptor that imports globulin-bound vitamin D and androgens. We observed that in AA men only, the expression of prostatic megalin increased with vitamin D deficiency and increased with the percentage of West African Ancestry. We propose that long term vitamin D deficiency in AA men leads to a compensatory increase in megalin to maintain tissue levels when the serum is deficient. In turn, high megalin would also import more androgens, thus driving hormonal carcinogenesis.  Hypothesis: Low vitamin D status in African American men drives increased androgen import into the prostate via the membrane endocytic receptor megalin. The objective is to both determine clinical significance and to delve into the mechanisms that regulate of hormone import.  Specific Aim 1: To determine the relationship between intra-prostatic concentrations of androgens with vitamin D status in African American men. The effect of vitamin D deficiency on the serum and intra- prostatic distribution of androgens will be examined using an existing patient cohort.  Specific Aim 2: To delineate the role of megalin-mediated endocytic transport in determining intracellular levels of androgens and vitamin D in human primary prostatic cells from African-American men. The results of Aim 1 will define the relationships between the hormones through correlative data. Whereas the experiments in Aim 2 will demonstrate that megalin is the mechanism of endocytic import for hormones using an in vitro model.  Significance: This proposal addresses a knowledge gap with clear clinical implications for AA men. Although the disparity in vitamin D deficiency in AA is not disputable, the significance remains controversial given that AA men do not have altered bone health, which is a classical symptom of vitamin D deficiency. As well, the disparity in PCa in AA is not disputable and there are likely multiple biological contributors including socioeconomic status in many cases. Our findings may have wide implications to the clinical concern and management of vitamin D deficiency in AA men. Moreover, a proven link between vitamin D deficiency and hormone import may extend to other hormonal cancers. For example, megalin is also present in breast cancer and there is pronounced breast cancer disparity for African American women. PROJECT NARRATIVE This proposal is based on the two irrefutable disparities of prostate cancer and vitamin D deficiency in African American men. Although vitamin D deficiency has been linked to an increase in prostate cancer aggressiveness and mortality, there are no supplementation or deficiency guidelines for cancer prevention and other non-calcemic roles of vitamin D. The goal of this project is determine if vitamin D deficiency leads to higher levels of androgen in the prostate, which may be the link between vitamin D and prostate cancer disparities in African American men.",Vitamin D Deficiency Leads to Increased Intra-Prostatic Androgens  in African American Men,9733164,R21CA231610,"['Androgens ', ' Therapeutic Androgen ', ' Androgenic Compounds ', ' Androgenic Agents ', ' Automobile Driving ', ' driving ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Blood Circulation ', ' Circulation ', ' Bloodstream ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cells ', ' Diffusion ', ' Endocytosis ', ' Epithelium Part ', ' Epithelium ', ' Serum Globulins ', ' Globulins ', ' Goals ', ' Therapeutic Hormone ', ' Endocrine Gland Secretion ', ' Hormones ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' renal ', ' Kidney Urinary System ', ' Kidney ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Light ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' mortality ', ' Patients ', ' Prostatic Gland ', ' Prostate Gland ', ' Prostate ', ' Proteins ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Testosterone-Estradiol Binding Globulin ', ' Sex Steroid-Binding Protein ', ' Sex Hormone-Binding Globulin ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Tissues ', ' VIT D ', ' Vitamin D ', ' Vitamin D Deficiency ', ' Vitamin D-Binding Globulin ', ' Transcalciferin ', ' Group-Specific Component Globulin ', ' Gc Globulin ', ' Calciferol-Binding Protein ', ' Vitamin D-Binding Protein ', ' Woman ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' Mediating ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' Area ', ' Benign ', ' Clinical ', ' Biological ', ' Link ', ' Serum ', ' Blood Serum ', ' African ', ' cancer prevention ', ' LDL-Receptor Related Protein 2 ', ' gp 330 ', ' Renal Glycoprotein GP330 ', ' Nephritis Antigen GP 330 ', ' Megalin ', ' Low-Density Lipoprotein Receptor-Related Protein-2 ', ' LRP-2 Receptor ', ' LRP-2 ', ' Heymann Nephritis Antigen GP330 ', "" Heyman's Nephritis Antigen GP330 "", ' Glycoprotein 330 ', ' GP330 Antigen ', ' Specimen ', ' Research Specimen ', ' Malignant neoplasm of prostate ', ' Prostatic Cancer ', ' Prostate Cancer ', ' Prostate CA ', ' Malignant prostatic tumor ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Prostate ', ' Knowledge ', ' Hormonal ', ' Membrane ', ' membrane structure ', ' receptor ', ' Receptor Protein ', ' cohort ', ' response ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' Binding ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Hormonal Carcinogenesis ', ' Supplementation ', ' in vitro Model ', ' Molecular ', ' Prostatic ', ' bone health ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' disparity in cancer ', ' cancer disparity ', ' clinically significant ', ' clinical significance ', ' Hormone use ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' prostate cancer risk ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT CHICAGO,R21,2019,168673,-0.07195306511236385
"Improving primary care providers ability to communicate about patients experiences of racism to improve cardiovascular health: a feasibilitystudy PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT African Americans (AAs) have the highest age-adjusted death rates from major cardiovascular diseases of all racial groups. Many race-related factors contribute to AAs' high rates of CVD. For example, exposure to interpersonal and structural racism contributes to chronic stress, negative emotional states, and poor health behaviors, which, in turn, lead to adverse cardiovascular outcomes. AAs with racially discordant providers experience poorer interpersonal processes of care (less shared decision-making and psychosocial talk) and report lower levels of trust than AAs with same race providers. The candidate's long-term hypothesis is: inviting AA patients to discuss their experiences of racism visit will strengthen the therapeutic relationship and thereby improve AAs' cardiovascular outcomes. Drawing on social cognitive theory and contact theory, the candidate proposes to develop and test a feasible and acceptable method for health care providers to communicate about racism with AA patients. We focus on US born, non-Hispanic, AA patients, because they have the worst cardiovascular health outcomes, and, as a group, longstanding exposure to racism. For providers, we focus on White residents because (1) most health care providers are White; (2) the literature shows that race-discordant relationships have poorer interpersonal processes of care; (3) residents are actively building their communication skills and responsiveness to diverse populations, and (4) residents may have less entrenched behaviors than practicing physicians. In Aim 1, the candidate will conduct focus groups with AA patients and White residents training in Internal Medicine, Med-Peds, and Family Medicine to identify attitudes about and barriers to discussing racism. Then, in Aim 2, the candidate will develop an intervention to communicate about racism that improves residents' self-efficacy and outcome expectancies, prior to pilot testing the intervention in Aim 3. A community advisory board will advise the candidate throughout the research process. The candidate's long-term career goal is to become an independent investigator who reduces racial disparities by developing innovative evidence-based interventions to address the multiple mechanisms through which racism adversely affects health. The career development plan includes training in advanced qualitative and quantitative methods, community engaged research and concept mapping, communication about racism, implementation science, and clinical research. The candidate has an exceptional team of mentors and advisors who are distinguished scholars in the aforementioned areas. The candidate is well-positioned to conduct this research, which will transition her to independence as an investigator and lay the foundation for a large-scale randomized trial. She has access to a rich academic environment, which includes a department with a strong record of publications and extramural funding, an excellent School of Public Health, a Clinical and Translational Science Institute that invests in junior faculty, and a state-of-the art Simulation Center. PROJECT NARRATIVE This study focuses on the well-established, but under-addressed, relationship between racism and health via the patient-provider therapeutic relationship. This project will increase health care providers' knowledge of racism as a health risk factor and equip them with the language, tools, and skills that they need to support their African American patients. By demonstrating a willingness to discuss racism, health care providers may be able to improve the therapeutic relationship with African American patients, which will ultimately improve cardiovascular outcomes.",Improving primary care providers ability to communicate about patients experiences of racism to improve cardiovascular health: a feasibilitystudy,9743573,K23HL143146,"['Affect ', ' Age ', '

"Consequences and mechanism of aberrant splicing in African American prostate cancer disparities Summary There are striking population (race) disparities in prostate cancer (PCa) risk and survival outcome borne out of current health statistics. This is particularly evident between African American (AA) patients and their European American (EA) counterparts, where AAs exhibit a 1.5 to 2 fold higher risk of PCa incidence and mortality. We demonstrate that differential alternative RNA splicing takes place for oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes in PCa specimens of AA compared to EA patients. The differential splicing events result in the enrichment and in many instances generation of AA-specific splice variants not observed in EA cancers. We have cloned the AA and EA splice variant cDNAs for both phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase catalytic subunit delta (PIK3CD) and fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3), and ectopically introduced the clones individually into PCa cell lines. Compared to the EA variant-expressing lines, the AA variant-expressing lines are more oncogenic in in vitro cell proliferation and invasion assays, and exhibit greater tumor growth/metastasis and resistance to small molecule targeted therapy in xenograft mouse models. These findings may explain, in part, the observed cancer health disparities in the AA population relative to other racial groups. The mechanism responsible for the formation of AA-specific or -enriched mRNA splice variants are hypothesized to be due to the dysregulated expression of 6 key splicing factor s in AA PCa specimens. We refer to this dysregulation and associated production of AA-specific splice variants as an “AA splicing factor code in PCa disparities.” Notwithstanding these developments, a number of questions remain unresolved. First, what is the mechanism(s) of dysregulated expression of the 6 splicing factors? Second, can the production of AA-specific splice variants via exon skipping be directly attributed to the 6 dysregulated splicing factors? Lastly, how do the encoded proteins of the AA-specific short variants of PIK3CD and FGFR3 mediate a more oncogenic phenotype in PCa cells? The objectives of this application are to address these questions, and to provide a mechanistic framework of population-related differences in alternative RNA splicing, which is anticipated to facilitate future identification of druggable targets (e.g. splicing factors and/or resulting splice variant proteins) of AA tumor phenotype and disparities. Narrative African American (AA) prostate cancers express unique mRNA variants not found in European American (EA) cancers, which we hypothesize are responsible in part for the more aggressive nature of the disease and poorer prognosis in the AA population. Our underlying premise is that multiple key RNA splicing factors are uniquely dysregulated in AA prostate cancer, leading to the formation of these AA-specific mRNA variants that encode more oncogenic versions of signal transducing proteins. Our study is expected to identify the molecular mechanism(s) driving dysregulated splicing factor expression, define the cis-acting RNA sequence elements essential for the production of the AA-specific mRNA variants, and characterize protein isoform function encoded by the AA-specific variants, which may serve as future treatment options in cancer health disparities.",Consequences and

"The FAITH! Trial:  A mHealth Intervention to Improve Cardiovascular Health Among African-Americans PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Cardiovascular disease (CVD) afflicts nearly 50% of all African-American (AA) adults, and they are 30% more likely to die from CVD than the overall US population. Compared to non-Hispanic whites, AAs are 82% less likely to meet the ideal levels for 5 or more of the cardiovascular (CV) health components that comprise the American Heart Association (AHA) Life's Simple 7 (LS7). LS7 is an evidenced-based metric of 7 health- promoting behaviors and biological risk factors that improves CV outcomes: physical activity, diet, smoking, body mass index, blood pressure, total cholesterol, and glucose. AAs have poorer health status than whites in every LS7 component except total cholesterol. Mobile health (mHealth) lifestyle interventions through digital communication and devices are promising ways to improve CV health and outcomes among AAs; however, there is a paucity of effective, culturally relevant, evidenced-based interventions available. The major goal of our project is to apply a community-based participatory research approach to rigorously refine and test the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of our existing CV health/wellness digital application (app) prototype to improve CV health among AAs. The refined app will focus on promoting the LS7 framework with incorporation of user-individualized and interpersonal features. We hypothesize that our behavioral theory-informed, app- based, intervention will be feasible and improve CV health among AAs in faith communities from baseline to 6- months post-intervention. This R21 proposal aligns with the NIMHD's focus on “impacting the health determinants that contribute to poor health outcomes and to health disparity conditions”. Building on our longstanding partnership with local AA churches and preliminary work, we propose two aims. Aim 1 will refine our app to promote LS7 with inclusion of user-individualized and interpersonal features. We will use a formative research process and qualitative methods to refine the app within a focus group series with 15 AA adult community members. Primary outcomes are app usability and user satisfaction. Aim 2 will assess the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of the refined app for promoting LS7 among AA adults in faith communities by conducting a cluster randomized controlled trial of 200 AA adults. Primary outcomes are change in LS7 score from baseline to 6-months post- intervention and app engagement/usability. Secondary outcomes include the following psychosocial measures: self-efficacy, self-regulation, social support, religiosity/spirituality, optimism and perceived stress. An established community steering committee will provide input for all activities. Our project is innovative as our mHealth lifestyle intervention integrates behavioral theory-informed and empirically-supported components to influence LS7 among AAs. If successful, our results can pave the way for use of evidence-based mHealth tools to increase prevalence of ideal CV health among AAs and other underserved populations. PROJECT NARRATIVE African-Americans (AAs) are more likely to die from cardiovascular disease than the overall US population and have significantly poorer cardiovascular (CV) health than whites as defined by the American Heart Association Life's Simple 7 (AHA LS7). Our proposed study aims to refine and test the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of a culturally relevant mobile health (mHealth) intervention (a CV health and wellness digital application) to promote the AHA LS7 among AAs within faith communities.

"Changes in Weight and Physical Function for Older African American Women in National, Peer-Led, Community-Based Weight Loss Program 2. ABSTRACT Older African American (AA) women have the highest prevalence of both obesity and frailty. In academic, expert- led interventions, obese, frail, older individuals both lost weight and improved their physical function. However, because of high personnel costs and nonexistent nationwide infrastructure, large-scale implementation of these interventions is impractical. The long-term goals are to eliminate the health disparities of obesity and frailty in older AA women. This proposal’s overall objective is to determine the effects of a low-cost, community-based, peer-led weight loss program with a national infrastructure on obesity, physical function, and healthcare utilization in older AA women. To treat obesity and frailty in older AA women, it is critical to test a weight loss intervention that 1) has preliminary evidence of benefit; 2) is acceptable to older AA women; 3) is affordable; and 4) can be broadly disseminated. Take Off Pounds Sensibly (TOPS) is a national, nonprofit, community-based, peer-led weight loss program that meets these criteria. First, the applicant’s retrospective database analyses of TOPS showed two important results: 1) Participants who renew their annual membership lose and maintain significant weight loss (SWL) for up to 7 years; and 2) Compared to their younger counterparts, older women are more likely to achieve SWL. Second, the applicant started three TOPS chapters for older AA women in a successful pilot study. Though the study ended in 2012, one of the chapters is still active almost 6 years later. Third, TOPS is affordable; it only costs $92 annually. Finally, TOPS has a nationwide infrastructure with chapters in all 50 states. Since obese, frail, older individuals in academic, expert-led weight loss interventions can improve their physical function, the central hypothesis is that a low cost, community-based, peer-led weight loss program with a national infrastructure can provide SWL, improved physical function, and lower healthcare utilization for AA women, an underserved, vulnerable population. The rationale for the proposed research is that TOPS and academic, expert-led weight loss interventions share components critical to successful weight loss; therefore, TOPS can deliver similar outcomes. The central hypothesis will be tested by pursuing the following aims in obese, frail, older AA women: Determine the effect of TOPS on 1) weight change and cardiovascular disease risk factors; 2) physical function and quality of life; and 3) healthcare utilization. This project is innovative because it uses a “community to academia” approach to treat the health disparities; our study population focuses on older AA women with decreased physical function; our outcomes focus on weight, physical function, and healthcare utilization; and our unique study settings. The proposed research is significant because determining the real- world effectiveness of the TOPS program and its impact on weight, physical function, and healthcare utilization in AA women can have a widespread impact on the older population at large. Thus, it has the potential to reduce adverse geriatric outcomes among all older individuals. 3. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research is relevant to public health because if a low-cost, community-based weight loss program with a national infrastructure is effective at both weight loss and improving physical function among elderly individuals with decreased physical function, it has the potential to reduce adverse geriatric outcomes. The proposed research is relevant to the part of the NIH mission that pertains to enhancing health and reducing illness and disability.","Changes in Weight and Physical Function for Older African American Women in National, Peer-Led, Community-Based Weight Loss Program",9660477,R01AG058725,"['Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' behavior intervention ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Blood Pressure ', ' Body Weight Changes ', ' Weight Change ', ' Cachexia ', ' Cachectic ', ' Communities ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' dietary ', ' Diet ', ' foot ', ' Goals ', ' Hand ', ' Health ', ' hemoglobin A1c ', ' Hemoglobin A(1) ', ' HbA1c ', ' HbA1 ', ' Hb A1c ', ' Hb A1a+b ', ' Hb A1 ', ' Glycohemoglobin A ', ' Glycosylated hemoglobin A ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' Hospital Admission ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Information Networks ', ' Inpatients ', ' Static Exercise ', ' Muscle-Setting Exercise ', ' Isometrics ', ' Isometric Exercise ', ' Lipids ', ' Mission ', ' Moods ', ' mortality ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Obesity ', ' Out-patients ', ' Outpatients ', ' pilot study ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' Public Health ', ' Public Housing ', ' QOL ', ' Quality of life ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Research ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Testing ', ' waitlist ', ' Waiting Lists ', ' wt-loss ', ' body weight loss ', ' Weight Reduction ', ' Weight Loss ', ' Body Weight decreased ', ' Weight ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' frail older adult ', ' Frail Seniors ', ' Frail Older Adults ', ' Frail Elders ', ' Frail Elderly ', ' Measures ', ' Walking ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' falls ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' Outcome Measure ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Ensure ', ' Evaluation ', ' grasp ', ' Grips ', ' Physical activity ', ' disability ', ' Individual ', ' health care service utilization ', ' healthcare utilization ', ' healthcare service utilization ', ' healthcare service use ', ' health care service use ', ' Health Care Utilization ', ' Databases ', ' data base ', ' Data Bases ', ' satisfaction ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Attenuated ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' frailty ', ' waist circumference ', ' Physical Function ', ' meetings ', ' human old age (65+) ', ' aged ≥65 ', ' aged 65 and greater ', ' age 65 and older ', ' age 65 and greater ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' 65+ years old ', ' Structure ', ' Participant ', ' peer ', ' member ', ' epidemiology study ', ' epidemiologic investigation ', ' Epidemiology Research ', ' Epidemiological Studies ', ' Epidemiologic Studies ', ' Epidemiologic Research ', ' Human Resources ', ' personnel ', ' Manpower ', ' behavior influence ', ' behavioral influence ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Weight maintenance regimen ', ' weight management ', ' weight control ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' vulnerable group ', ' cardiovascular disorder risk ', ' cardiovascular disease risk ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Address ', ' Academia ', ' High Prevalence ', ' National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases ', ' NIDDK ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Older Population ', ' Characteristics ', ' cost ', ' Underserved Population ', ' underserved people ', ' under served population ', ' Outcome ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' weight loss intervention ', ' older women ', ' clinically significant ', ' clinical significance ', ' Evidence based program ', ' therapy development ', ' treatment development ', ' intervention development ', ' develop therapy ', ' community setting ', ' adverse outcome ', ' adverse consequence ', ' arm ', ' Emergency department visit ', ' Emergency room visit ', ' Emergency care visit ', ' ER visit ', ' ED visit ', ' Physical Performance ', ' study population ', ' physical therapist ', ' physiotherapist ', ' Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index ', ' high risk population ', ' high risk group ', ' recruit ', ' weight loss program ', ' weight loss programming ', ' treatment arm ', ' intervention arm ', ' Infrastructure ', ' perceived stress ', ' ']",NIA,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,552512,0.043784622685226815
"Reducing Emergency Diabetes Care for Older African Americans African Americans (AAs) with diabetes (DM) seek emergency department (ED) care twice as often as Whites. About 40% of AAs with DM have an ED visit each year, and 24% use the ED as their usual place of care (vs. 13% of Whites). The reasons for these racial disparities in ED use are complex, but the scientific premise of the proposed randomized controlled trial (RCT) is that poor access to primary care and poor DM self-care lead to high ED use in AAs with DM. A culturally relevant intervention that mitigates these factors may reduce the need for ED use in this high risk population. This RCT will compare the efficacy of COPDE (COmmunity Care to Prevent Diabetes Emergencies) vs. Enhanced Usual Care (EUC) to reduce DM-related ED visits and/or hospitalizations over 12 months (primary outcome) in 230 AAs with DM, 50 years and older, after an ED visit. COPDE is a collaborative intervention of Primary Care Physicians, (PCPs), a DM nurse educator, and Community Health Workers (CHWs) that extends from the ED into the community. The CHWs will: 1) deliver in-home DM education to increase participants’ knowledge and skills to manage DM; 2) use DM-specific Behavioral Activation to reinforce DM self-care; and 3) facilitate telehealth visits with PCPs and a DM nurse educator to increase access to care. The control treatment, EUC, is usual medical care that is enhanced with DM self-care education. EUC matches COPDE in treatment intensity (i.e., number and duration of in-home visits) and delivery of DM self-care education, but does not include COPDE’s other active elements (i.e., Behavioral Activation and telehealth). The treatment comparison will identify COPDE’s specific efficacy over and above EUC. We hypothesize that COPDE will halve the rate of incident DM-related ED visits and/or hospitalizations relative to EUC. The three secondary outcomes are: 1) subjective perceptions of access to care; 2) receipt of DM Quality Metrics (i.e., objective indicators of realized access to care); and 3) DM self-care. A mediation analysis will determine if changes in one or more of these variables explain COPDE’s efficacy. Exploratory Aims will: 1) determine if COPDE reduces “all cause” ED visits/hospitalizations; 2) determine if Community Need Index scores (which reflect the extent of economic and structural barriers to care), literacy, age, and/or sex moderate treatment effects; 3) determine if COPDE improves glycemic control, impacts DM- related health beliefs, reduces depression, and/or improves quality-of-life; 4) identify COPDE treatment features that confer cultural relevance; and 5) estimate COPDE’s costs and net financial benefits. This RCT is significant because rates of ED use among AAs with DM are rapidly rising, and new ways to treat this high risk population are needed. This RCT is innovative because: 1) it tests the first ED-to-community intervention designed to reduce the need for ED use in AAs with DM, and 2) it determines if participants who reside in high- need as well as low-need communities equally benefit. If successful, COPDE will meet Healthy People 2020’s twin goals of reducing the personal and societal costs of DM and achieve health equity for all Americans. This research aims to reduce the need for emergency room visits in African Americans with diabetes by improving access to care and ability to manage diabetes.

"African American Families Fighting Parental Cancer Together ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  In 2015, an estimated 340,000 parents of school age children will be newly diagnosed with cancer in the U.S. Parental cancer causes significant emotional distress in both diagnosed parents and children. African American (AA) adults experience a disproportionate burden of solid tumor cancers (e.g., breast, prostate, lung, and colon) which puts AA adolescents, a vulnerable population to begin with, at high risk for parental cancer related distress. Treatments have been somewhat successful for younger school age children (ages 7-12) of cancer patients but most treatment studies have included white middle class samples. Differences in attitudes, daily functioning and levels of distress among different ethnic and racial groups are well-documented, yet few culturally sensitive family intervention programs have been developed for AA families coping with cancer. Building on the PI's previous studies with AA families coping with parental cancer, we propose to conduct a randomized control trial to address this gap. We will of a culturally sensitive family-based intervention that targets the parent child relationship in AA families coping with the impact of solid tumor parental cancer. We will randomize 172 AA families coping with parental cancer to either Families Fighting Cancer Together (FFCT) or to parent psycho-education (TAU). Both manualized treatments include 5 bi-monthly sessions over 10 weeks. Subjects will be African American parents diagnosed for the first time in the past 12 months with Stage I, II, or III solid tumor cancers with at least one child between the ages of 12 and 18 living at home. Patients will be recruited from 3 large inner city cancer centers where there is an estimated 500 eligible low to middle income AA cancer patients a year. Family assessments will be done at baseline, post-treatment (10 weeks), 6-month, and 12-month follow-up. The proposed R01 research has the following aims: Aim 1: Compare the efficacy of FFCT to TAU in reducing depressive symptoms (CDI) and anxiety (RCMAS) in AA adolescents at post-treatment and long term outcome (6 and 12-month follow-up). Aim 2: Compare the efficacy of FFCT to TAU in reducing parental stress (PCQ: impact of illness on child/concerns about parenting) in AA parents at post-treatment and long term outcome (6 and 12-month follow-up). Exploratory Aims: 1. Explore whether moderators identified in Caucasian samples have a similar impact on treatment in AA samples. Specifically, we will examine: a) perceived level of group support, b) gender and age of adolescent, c) parent's marital status, d) SES, and e) stage of parent's cancer on the impact of treatment. 2. Explore whether changes in parent-child attachment and communication mediate the association between treatment and depressive symptoms (CDI) and anxiety (RCMAS) at 6 and12-month follow-up. Treatments to help adolescents cope with the impact of parental cancer are urgently needed, particularly those designed to reach low-income AA populations. Developing effective and transportable family-based interventions for this population could improve developmental adjustment to this significant life stressor at a critical point in the livesof adolescents. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  This project directly addresses cancer health disparities, which is relevant to NCI's mission.

"Smart Walk: A Smartphone Physical Activity Program for African American Women ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Project Summary/Abstract National data show that 82% of African American (AA) women are overweight or obese, and 57% are obese. The health risks associated with the high prevalence of overweight and obesity among AA women is concerning, as these risks contribute to subsequent chronicities including cardiovascular disease (CVD) and type 2 diabetes (T2D). Physical activity (PA) is an established mechanism to manage weight and to improve myriad cardiometabolic disease risk factors. However, despite these benefits, only 36% of AA women meet the national PA guidelines. The low PA levels among AA women coupled with the high prevalence of overweight/obesity and other chronic disease conditions indicate the need for effective strategies to promote sustained high PA in this high-risk population. Technology-based platforms (i.e. Smartphone applications, Internet, social media) represent potential channels to deliver PA interventions to AA women. However, few researchers have explored these platforms to deliver culturally relevant PA interventions to AA women. This represents a missed opportunity given the established success of technology-delivered behavior change interventions and data suggesting that AA women use Internet, social media, and Smartphones at equal or greater rates than other race/ethnic groups. Over the past 5 years, the applicant of this proposed work has focused on filling this gap in the published research through the development and evaluation of technology-based approaches to increase PA among AA women. Trained as a behavioral scientist, his graduate and postdoctoral training has been focused in the social and psychological sciences, with a particular emphasis on the development and evaluation of theory- driven, culturally relevant technology-based PA interventions for AA women. The research and training proposed in the current application will extend and refine the candidate's PA and health disparities research trajectory through : 1) focused training in the physiological and biochemical mechanisms underpinning cardiometabolic disease risk factors responsive to PA intervention, and 2) evaluation of the effects of a culturall relevant Smartphone-delivered PA program (Smart Walk) to improve (baseline to 6 months) and maintain (7 months to 12 months) higher PA levels among AA women and improve cardiometabolic disease risk factors. The candidate has identified a supportive and stimulating research environment at Arizona State University to pursue the proposed research. Under the mentorship and Drs. Barbara Ainsworth, Colleen Keller, Glenn Gaesser, and Sonia Vega-Lopez, he will gain the necessary skills to establish himself as an independent behavioral and health disparities research scientist. In the K99 portion of the grant award, the applicant will gan explicit training in the physiological and biochemical mechanisms underpinning cardiometabolic disease risk factors responsive to PA intervention through didactic coursework and hands-on clinical laboratory experience. Training in this research area will complement his already strong social science background by allowing him to gain a deeper understanding of the physiological mechanisms associated with the health-enhancing benefits of PA. In the R00 phase of the grant award, the applicant will deploy the training acquired during the K99 phase and build logically upon his previous health disparities research trajectory by implementing a 12-month technology-based PA randomized controlled trial to evaluate the effects of a culturally relevant Smartphone-delivered PA intervention to improve (baseline to 6 months) and maintain (7 months to 12 months) high PA levels and reduce cardiometabolic disease risk among obese AA women. Seventy-six obese AA women will receive either a culturally relevant, Social Cognitive Theory-based PA promotion program delivered using a Smartphone application or a wellness contact control condition. PA, fitness, and cardiometabolic disease risk factors will be evaluated. Potential physiological mechanisms through which PA may impact cardiometabolic disease risk factors will also be explored. The proposed research and training activities support the immediate and long-term career goals of the applicant. The applicant's immediate career goal is to enhance his theory based PA research to include salient mechanisms that underpin PA effects on health (i.e. inflammation), towards the prevention and treatment of cardiometabolic disease risk factors among AA women. His long-term career goals are to: a) establish an independent, externally-funded program of research focused on the identification of effective strategies to promote sustained PA among racial/ethnic minorities, and 2) reduce the disproportionate burden of the cardiometabolic diseases among high-risk minority populations. The training and research activities proposed in the current K99/R00 application will assist the candidate in achieving these career goals, and advance PA and health disparities science. Project Narrative The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effects of a culturally relevant Smartphone-delivered physical activity intervention to improve and maintain high physical activity levels and reduce cardiometabolic disease risk among obese African American women. In a 12-month randomized controlled trial, 76 sedentary and obese African American women will receive either a culturally relevant, Social Cognitive Theory-based physical activity intervention delivered using a Smartphone application or a wellness contact control condition. Primary study outcomes include changes in physical activity and feasibility and acceptability of the Smartphone- delivered program; secondary outcomes include cardiorespiratory fitness, cardiometabolic disease risk factors, and potential physiological mechanisms through which physical activity may impact cardiometabolic disease risk factors.",Smart Walk: A Smartphone Physical

"Underutilization of Hospice in Older African Americans Project Summary/Abstract Hospice is underutilized, especially among African Americans (AA). Despite the documented benefits of hospice, less than 2 million people utilize hospice services annually. Underuse disparities are extreme across race and ethnicity as White Americans comprise 85% of all hospice enrollees. AAs account for only 8% of hospice enrollees but are more likely to die from the top three hospice diagnoses (i.e. cancer, heart disease and dementia) than White Americans. Even when AAs enroll in hospice, they spend less time in hospice than White patients, averaging fewer than seven days in hospice care. Notably, AA hospice enrollees report a higher degree of satisfaction with end of life care when hospice is involved, as compared to AAs who are not enrolled in hospice care. There are several potential barriers that may prevent AAs from enrolling in hospice care including lack of knowledge of hospice care, mistrust in healthcare, perceived discrimination, health literacy. AAs routinely report less knowledge of hospice than White Americans, and the information that AA know about hospice often comes from non-medical professionals and is inaccurate. Some AA have persistent mistrust in healthcare due to events such as the Tuskegee Syphilis Experiments and many AA perceive discrimination when accessing healthcare. Data shows that health literacy is a stronger predictor of hospice use than race and older AAs are more likely to possess low health literacy. The driving hypothesis of this research is that by providing clear and accurate information to older AAs will help address the underutilization of hospice by clarifying misperceptions, building trust, and overcoming literacy barriers. Patient decision aids (PtDAs) are an evidence-based approach to improve patient agency in medical decision making. Research shows that AA report a desire for more agency and autonomy in decision-making yet the use of PtDAs is understudied in AA communities. This proposal offers a unique opportunity to address many of the potential barriers that may prevent older AAs from enrolling in hospice, while simultaneously expanding the literature of SDM specific to older AAs. The goals of this proposal are to evaluate if the relationships between health literacy and hospice knowledge, attitudes, and beliefs is mediated by mistrust in healthcare and perceived discrimination among AAs aged 65 or older (Aim1) and to evaluate the effect of the hospice PtDA on changing hospice knowledge and attitudes and beliefs about hospice in AA aged 65 and older (Aim 2). Project Narrative Hospice is underutilized in African Americans. There are several potential reasons hospice is underutilized in African Americans including health literacy, lack of knowledge, mistrust in healthcare and perceived discrimination.

"Slow wave sleep (SWS) and the effect of African ancestry on amyloid burden, a longitudinal study 7. PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT:  African-Americans (AAs) have an increased prevalence of Alzheimer's disease (AD) compared to whites, which traditionally has been associated to the presence of vascular disease. However, a recent community- based study of non-demented elderly, as well as our preliminary data, suggest that AAs have higher amyloid burden after adjusting for vascular risk factors, which points to the presence of additional genetic or physiological differences on AD-risk by race. The purpose of this study is to test whether poor slow wave sleep (SWS) is one of these factors. Sleep disturbances vary between AAs and non-Hispanic whites. AAs take longer to fall asleep, have shorter sleep duration, lower sleep efficiency and, more characteristically, less SWS duration when compared to whites. Relatedly, amyloid positive healthy elderly, as well as those with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD, experience more sleep fragmentation and more decreased SWS and REM sleep duration than their healthy counterparts. This suggests: i) that disturbed sleep contributes to AD- neurodegeneration (or that sleep is particularly sensitive to amyloid deposition); and, ii) that race-related sleep differences might contribute to the reported increases in amyloid burden in AAs. The study has two goals: first, to confirm that black race is associated in vivo with longitudinal increases in amyloid-PET uptake and cognitive decline; second, to demostrate that poor SWS at baseline is associated with these increases after controling for the cardiovascular morbidity that is shared between sleep disturbances and dementia and might confound these associations. In consultation with community stakeholders, we will recruit 150 cognitively normal AA elderly (ages 55-75 years) and 60 whites balanced by age, sex, BMI, education and other socio- demographic variables and from the same Brooklyn neighborhoods. Visit one will include a full clinical evaluation, neuropsychological tests and clinical labs. Participants will later undergo home monitoring for OSA for two nights followed by 5 days of actigraphy. Subjects with normal sleep breathing will be invited to perform 2 nights of nocturnal polysomnography (NPSG) followed by a second final visit in which amyloid load and cerebrovascular morbidity will be analyzed by 11C-PiB PET-MR. All subjects will be invited to repeat both visits after 30 months. This study has the potential to identify clinical predictors of amyloid burden in cognitively normal AA elderly and would be an important step towards the prevention of dementia in the black community as well as the reduction of health inequities. 8. PROJECT NARRATIVE:  Recent evidence suggests that older African-Americans (AAs) are at a higher risk of developing amyloid deposition independently of vascular disease, which would partially account for the increased prevalence of dementia among AAs. In this proposal, we will extend our prior work in this population to test whether poor slow wave sleep (SWS), which is more common among AAs when compared to whites, is one of the factors that explains these associations. This study has the potential to identify clinical (and treatable) predictors of amyloid burden in cognitively normal AA elderly and would be an important step towards the prevention of dementia in the black community as well as the reduction of health inequities.","Slow wave sleep (SWS) and the effect of African ancestry on amyloid burden, a longitudinal study",9772968,R01AG056531,"['Age ', ' ages ', ' Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Alzheimers Dementia ', "" Alzheimer's "", ' Alzheimer syndrome ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Amyloid ', ' Amyloid Substance ', ' Apnea ', ' Breathing ', ' inspiration ', ' Respiratory Inspiration ', ' Respiratory Aspiration ', ' Behavior ', ' Black race ', ' Blood Vessels ', ' vascular ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' circulatory system ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Cognition ', ' Communities ', ' Consultations ', ' Amyloid deposition ', ' Diffusion ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' geographic site ', ' Geographical Location ', ' Geographic Region ', ' Geographic Area ', ' Geographic Locations ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Income ', ' indexing ', ' longterm study ', ' long-term study ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' Memory ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity -

"Maintenance and Enhancement of the Atlanta African American Maternal-Child Cohort: Exposome Profiling via High-resolution Metabolomics and Integration of Microbiome-Metabolome-Epigenome Data PROJECT ABSTRACT Environmental exposures during the critical prenatal and early childhood periods can result in lifelong health consequences. Mechanisms underlying these exposure-health relationships are complex, with exogenous exposures (such as chemical toxicants) affecting endogenous processes (such as gene regulation and metabolism), which perturb metabolic pathways that lead to adverse health outcomes. Both adverse exposures and their health consequences disproportionately impact African American (AA) women and children, highlighting that health disparities begin in utero and are amplified postnatally. Among outcomes disproportionately experienced by AA children are preterm birth, neurodevelopmental deficits, and obesity – all linked to environmental exposures, yet poorly understood due to etiologic complexity. Our team is currently investigating preterm birth and neurodevelopment through 18-months in relation to pre- and postnatal exposures to environmental toxicants and biopsychosocial risk factors in cohorts of pregnant AA women (R01NR014800, R01MD009064) and their infants (R01MD009746) and via our P50 Children's Environmental Health Center (P50ES026071) in collaboration with the Emory HERCULES Exposome Research Center (P30 ES019776). We are also evaluating child obesity and neurodevelopment at 2-5 years of age under the Environmental Child Health Outcomes (ECHO) program (UG3OD023318). Through this R24 mechanism, we propose to: (1) Continue to enroll AA women at 8-14 wks' gestation, collect data at three time points during pregnancy, and engage delivered mother-child dyads in on-going postnatal follow-up studies to allow continued investigation of relationships between prenatal and early childhood exposures to chemical and non- chemical stressors and child health outcomes (Cohort Maintenance Aim); (2) Evaluate the performance of high-resolution mass spectrometry coupled with gas chromatography (GC-HRMS) for quantifying persistent organic pollutants (POPs) microliter serum volumes by comparing measured POP concentrations to those measured using conventional targeted analytic chemistry approaches in the same cohort (Resource Infrastructure – Exposure Characterization Aim); and (3) Adapt tools for multi-omic data integration to enable the display, visualization, and integration of comprehensive exposure assessment and biological effect data – to include chemical toxicant concentrations and metabolomic (KEGG pathway), epigenomic (gene methylation and expression), and microbiome data – and the analysis of associations with pregnancy and birth outcomes within our cohort and across cohort collaborations (Resource Infrastructure - Data Preparation Aim). Through this work, we expect to advance environmental health science around the assessment of chemical mixtures (with a focus on POPs) and their adverse preclinical (metabolic and epigenetic) health effects in our own high disparity population of pregnant women and newborns and to support other cohorts and cross-cohort collaborations involving the use of high-dimensional multi-omic data. PROJECT NARRATIVE By maintaining the Atlanta African American (AA) Maternal-Child Cohort and expanding its omic infrastructure to incorporate high-resolution mass spectrometry coupled with gas chromatography (GC-HRMS) and software tools to integrate multi-omic data, the proposed work will advance environmental health science around the assessment of chemical mixtures (with a focus on persistent organic pollutants [POPs]) and their preclinical health effects, including perturbation of metabolome, epigenome, and microbiome profiles. This work will maximize exposomic profiling within our own high disparity population of pregnant AA women and newborns, and will facilitate such approaches in other cohorts and cross-cohort

"Vitamin D Deficiency Leads to Increased Intra-Prostatic Androgens  in African American Men PROJECT SUMMARY This proposal is built around our hypothesis that intra-prostatic androgens may be the link between two undisputable disparities in African American (AA) men; vitamin D deficiency and prostate cancer (PCa). We propose that the molecular response of prostate tissues to low vitamin D status leads to increased intracellular import of not only vitamin D, but also androgens. Megalin is the endocytic membrane receptor that imports globulin-bound vitamin D and androgens. We observed that in AA men only, the expression of prostatic megalin increased with vitamin D deficiency and increased with the percentage of West African Ancestry. We propose that long term vitamin D deficiency in AA men leads to a compensatory increase in megalin to maintain tissue levels when the serum is deficient. In turn, high megalin would also import more androgens, thus driving hormonal carcinogenesis.  Hypothesis: Low vitamin D status in African American men drives increased androgen import into the prostate via the membrane endocytic receptor megalin. The objective is to both determine clinical significance and to delve into the mechanisms that regulate of hormone import.  Specific Aim 1: To determine the relationship between intra-prostatic concentrations of androgens with vitamin D status in African American men. The effect of vitamin D deficiency on the serum and intra- prostatic distribution of androgens will be examined using an existing patient cohort.  Specific Aim 2: To delineate the role of megalin-mediated endocytic transport in determining intracellular levels of androgens and vitamin D in human primary prostatic cells from African-American men. The results of Aim 1 will define the relationships between the hormones through correlative data. Whereas the experiments in Aim 2 will demonstrate that megalin is the mechanism of endocytic import for hormones using an in vitro model.  Significance: This proposal addresses a knowledge gap with clear clinical implications for AA men. Although the disparity in vitamin D deficiency in AA is not disputable, the significance remains controversial given that AA men do not have altered bone health, which is a classical symptom of vitamin D deficiency. As well, the disparity in PCa in AA is not disputable and there are likely multiple biological contributors including socioeconomic status in many cases. Our findings may have wide implications to the clinical concern and management of vitamin D deficiency in AA men. Moreover, a proven link between vitamin D deficiency and hormone import may extend to other hormonal cancers. For example, megalin is also present in breast cancer and there is pronounced breast cancer disparity for African American women. PROJECT NARRATIVE This proposal is based on the two irrefutable disparities of prostate cancer and vitamin D deficiency in African American men. Although vitamin D deficiency has been linked to an increase in prostate cancer aggressiveness and mortality, there are no supplementation or deficiency guidelines for cancer prevention and other non-calcemic roles of vitamin D. The goal of this project is determine if vitamin D deficiency leads to higher levels of androgen in the prostate, which may be the link between vitamin D and prostate cancer disparities in African American men.",Vitamin D Deficiency Leads to Increased Intra-Prostatic Androgens  in African American Men,9906481,R21CA231610,"['Androgens ', ' Therapeutic Androgen ', ' Androgenic Compounds ', ' Androgenic Agents ', ' Automobile Driving ', ' driving ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Blood Circulation ', ' Circulation ', ' Bloodstream ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cells ', ' Diffusion ', ' Endocytosis ', ' Epithelium Part ', ' Epithelium ', ' Serum Globulins ', ' Globulins ', ' Goals ', ' Therapeutic Hormone ', ' Endocrine Gland Secretion ', ' Hormones ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' renal ', ' Kidney Urinary System ', ' Kidney ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Light ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' mortality ', ' Patients ', ' Prostatic Gland ', ' Prostate Gland ', ' Prostate ', ' Proteins ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Testosterone-Estradiol Binding Globulin ', ' Sex Steroid-Binding Protein ', ' Sex Hormone-Binding Globulin ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Tissues ', ' VIT D ', ' Vitamin D ', ' Vitamin D Deficiency ', ' Vitamin D-Binding Globulin ', ' Transcalciferin ', ' Group-Specific Component Globulin ', ' Gc Globulin ', ' Calciferol-Binding Protein ', ' Vitamin D-Binding Protein ', ' Woman ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' Mediating ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' Area ', ' Benign ', ' Clinical ', ' Biological ', ' Link ', ' Serum ', ' Blood Serum ', ' African ', ' cancer prevention ', ' LDL-Receptor Related Protein 2 ', ' gp 330 ', ' Renal Glycoprotein GP330 ', ' Nephritis Antigen GP 330 ', ' Megalin ', ' Low-Density Lipoprotein Receptor-Related Protein-2 ', ' LRP-2 Receptor ', ' LRP-2 ', ' Heymann Nephritis Antigen GP330 ', "" Heyman's Nephritis Antigen GP330 "", ' Glycoprotein 330 ', ' GP330 Antigen ', ' Specimen ', ' Research Specimen ', ' Malignant neoplasm of prostate ', ' Prostatic Cancer ', ' Prostate Cancer ', ' Prostate CA ', ' Malignant prostatic tumor ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Prostate ', ' Knowledge ', ' Hormonal ', ' Membrane ', ' membrane structure ', ' receptor ', ' Receptor Protein ', ' cohort ', ' response ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' Binding ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Hormonal Carcinogenesis ', ' Supplementation ', ' in vitro Model ', ' Molecular ', ' Prostatic ', ' bone health ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' disparity in cancer ', ' cancer disparity ', ' clinically significant ', ' clinical significance ', ' Hormone use ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' prostate cancer risk ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT CHICAGO,R21,2019,62617,-0.07195306511236385
"EPHA6 as a novel candidate driver gene in colon cancer ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our long-term objective is to elucidate the etiologic factors contributing to disparate colon cancer (CRC) outcomes in African Americans (AA), who continue to exhibit the highest CRC incidence and mortality rates in the U.S, even after accounting for socioeconomic and access to care factors. We recently reported the first comprehensive molecular characterization of AA CRCs, identifying a 15 gene-set as preferentially mutated in AA as compared to Caucasian CRCs. On a broader scale, it is likely that these ethnicity-associated differences in CRC mutational landscapes may have potential to impact on broader disparities in cancer behaviors. In particular, our study identified the, accounting for ~6% of AA vs. 0% of Caucasians CRC cases. EPHA6 belongs to a broader family of ephrin receptor tyrosine kinases that function as oncogenes or tumor suppressors depending on the cancer type. Intriguingly, our study was the first to implicate EPHA6 in CRCs, with the finding of recurrent mutations in this gene selectively in AA CRCs, suggesting a provocative ethnicity-associated difference in routes of colon carcinogenesis. Accordingly, the specific goals of the current proposal are: (AIM 1) To characterize EPHA6 signaling and determine the functional consequences of EPHA6 mutations identified in AA CRCs. We will use in-depth phospho-proteomics and gene expression profiling approaches in AA CRC cell lines engineered to express wild-type (WT) or mutant versions of EPHA6 to characterize EPHA6 signaling and to determine the molecular consequences of EPHA6 mutations. Furthermore, we will compare the phenotypic effects of WT vs. mutant EPHA6 on tumor growth characteristics, using in vitro and xenograft models; (AIM 2) To determine if loss of EPHA6 enhances susceptibility to colon cancer. We will use EPHA6 null mice to determine if loss of EPHA6 induces colon tumorigenesis in chemical carcinogen and Apc Min models of colon cancer. As a complementary approach to Aim 1, we will further dissect and refine EPHA6 signaling pathway, in vivo, using proteomics and gene profiling in EPHA6 WT vs. null mouse colons; (AIM 3) To determine the generality of EPHA6 mutations, and their association with clinically-relevant histopathological features. The AA CRC cases used in our initial study were derived exclusively from Northeast Ohio. Given the history of differing patterns of mass internal migration of AAs within U.S, we will re-sequence EPHA6 in AA CRC cases from Southwestern Texas, to test if EPHA6 is common CRC mutational target in geographically distinct AA populations. Furthermore, given that all of the EPHA6-mutant CRCs identified in our initial study arose in proximal colon, we will re-sequence EPHA6 in a fresh set of AA CRCs from Northeast Ohio to determine if EPHA6-mutant CRC cases define a distinct, morphologically recognizable, subset of CRCs. Success in these studies will uncover new mechanisms underlying colon tumorigenesis and may identify new therapeutic targets for CRC, in addition to having broad epidemiological implications in elucidating the etiologic factors potentially contributing to aggressive colon cancer phenotypes in African Americans. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: African Americans are more likely to be diagnosed with and to die as a result of colon cancer than any other ethnic group in the United States. Identifying the mechanisms involved in colon tumor progression in African Americans is therefore critical for elucidating the etiologic factors contributing to outcome disparities in African Americans. Our proposed studies are designed to delineate the molecular mechanisms associated with colon cancer progression in African Americans with an overarching goal of guiding clinical management for this deadly disease in this population.",EPHA6 as a novel candidate driver gene in colon cancer,9656933,R01CA204549,"['Accounting ', ' Alleles ', ' Allelomorphs ', ' Azoxymethane ', ' Diazene, dimethyl-,

"The role of resilience in addressing racial disparities in adverse HIV-related outcomes Project Summary/Abstract  In the United States (U.S.), African Americans/Blacks (AAs) are the racial/ethnic group most adversely impacted by the HIV epidemic. As such, one of the goals of the White House National HIV/AIDS Strategy is to permanently reduce long-standing health disparities in HIV disease. Lower HIV clinic attendance and suboptimal antiretroviral therapy (ART) use (i.e., initiation, modification, and adherence) by AAs are likely the main mediators of continually worse HIV virologic responses among AAs compared to Caucasians. However, despite the development and implementation of interventions targeting many known individual-level risk and protective factors for clinic attendance and ART use, substantial racial disparities remain. Persistent disparities may be due, in part, to the adverse conditions that characterize the high risk neighborhood environments (e.g., socioeconomic deprivation and violence) in which HIV+ AAs disproportionately reside. However, despite such adversities some AAs demonstrate resilience (i.e., displaying positive behaviors/outcomes despite adversity) which may be critical to reducing persistent racial disparities. Compared to the risk environment, individual, interpersonal, and neighborhood resilience represent novel and more malleable intervention targets for reducing persistent disparities. Unfortunately, resilience remains understudied in the HIV literature, perhaps due to the absence of a reliable and valid resilience measure for HIV+ adults that captures all resilience components. The objective of the proposed research is to develop a reliable and valid measure of individual, interpersonal, and neighborhood resilience; to document its psychometric properties; and to assess longitudinally whether higher resilience facilitates positive HIV outcomes among HIV+ AAs by the level of the risk environment. Data on HIV+ AAs enrolled in the UNC CFAR HIV Clinical Cohort and the UAB 1917 Clinic Cohort will be used for the proposed study. Specifically, this study aims to (1) use advanced concept mapping, which is a mixed methods approach, to generate items that capture all components of resilience; (2) perform psychometric testing of concept mapping items to create a reliable and valid resilience measure that includes all components of resilience; (3a) examine whether resilience and non-resilience individual-level factors (e.g., alcohol/drug use, mental illness, and health insurance) are prospectively associated with HIV outcomes (e.g., clinic attendance, ART adherence, and virologic suppression) by the level of the neighborhood risk environment; and (3b) assess for interactions between resilience and non-resilience individual-level factors by the level of the risk environment. This study responds to the critical need to develop a multi-component resilience measure for HIV+ adults and to establish whether resilience facilitates positive HIV outcomes among HIV+ AAs. Our important findings may lead to the development and implementation of novel multilevel resilience-related interventions to reduce persistent racial disparities in HIV disease. Project Narrative  This innovative project will determine whether resilience facilitates positive HIV outcomes among HIV+ African American/Black (AA) adults in the United States (U.S.) by the level of the neighborhood risk environment. Completing this work will provide critical evidence about the relationship between resilience and HIV outcomes among HIV+ AAs from two longitudinal HIV clinic cohort studies. Such critical evidence is necessary to justify the investment of limited resources into developing interventions targeted at enhancing resilience among AAs to (a) reduce persistent HIV racial disparities in the U.S. and (b) help achieve the goals of the White House National HIV/AIDS Strategy.",The role of resilience in addressing racial disparities in adverse HIV-related outcomes,9716405,R01MH112386,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Alcohols ', ' Alcohol Chemical Class ', ' Behavior ', ' Mental disorders ', ' psychological disorder ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Buffers ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Environment ', ' Epidemic ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Family ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' HTLV-III Seropositivity ', ' HTLV-III Seroconversion ', ' HIV antibody positive ', ' HIV Seroconversion ', ' HIV Positivity ', ' HIV Positive ', ' Anti-HIV Positivity ', ' HIV Seropositivity ', ' health insurance plan ', ' Health Insurance ', ' Investments ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Literature ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Methods ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' mortality ', ' Persons ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Psychometrics ', ' Research ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Testing ', ' United States ', ' violent behavior ', ' violent ', ' Violence ', ' virology ', ' white race ', ' Occidental ', ' Caucasoid Race ', ' Caucasoid ', ' Caucasian Race ', ' Caucasian ', ' Caucasians ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' Mediating ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Failure ', ' Individual ', ' Drug usage ', ' drug use ', ' Research Priority ', ' Clinic ', ' experience ', ' cohort ', ' novel ', ' AIDS/HIV problem ', ' HIV/AIDS problem ', ' HIV/AIDS ', ' AIDS/HIV ', ' Sampling ', ' Property ', ' response ', ' deprivation ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' therapy adherence ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Address ', ' Adherence ', ' Data ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Modification ', ' socioeconomics ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socio-economically ', ' socio-economic ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' antiretroviral therapy ', ' antiretroviral treatment ', ' anti-retroviral treatment ', ' anti-retroviral therapy ', ' resilience ', ' Outcome ', ' Prevalence ', ' prospective ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' high risk ', ' racial disparity ', ' race disparity ', ' disparities in race ', ' behavioral outcome ', ' behavior outcome ', ' concept mapping ', ' concept maps ', ' protective factors ', ' ']",NIMH,BROWN UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,675085,0.0633305176792059
"Race-related alternative splicing: novel targets in prostate cancer African American (AA) men exhibit 1.6-fold higher incidence and 2.4-fold higher mortality rates from prostate cancer (PCa) compared to white men. Although much of this disparity remains after controlling for factors related to social determinants of health, very few studies have used this population-based difference to identify molecular mechanisms of tumor aggressiveness. The proposed work addresses the urgent need to interrogate the molecular mechanisms driving the more aggressive PCa biology in AA men across the PCa progression continuum and to modulate such mechanisms for therapeutic application.  Our data from evaluating PCa biopsy tissue from AA and white patients has led to the discovery of alternative splicing as a novel molecular mechanism underlying more aggressive PCa in AA men. Preliminary analysis has indicated that several of these race-related alternative splicing events track with increased growth and more aggressive invasion characteristics of PCa in AA men. Additional preliminary work has demonstrated our capability to generate the first significant collection of PCa patient-derived explants and the first establishment of PCa patient-derived explants from AA patients.  We aim to extend our preliminary findings by 1) determining the pattern and frequency of candidate race- related splice variants across the PCa progression continuum, from localized PCa of varying degrees of aggressiveness to metastatic castration-resistant PCa, and defining the relationship between these variants and PCa cell biology, 2) assessing the effects of expression of particular race-related splice variants on mechanistic and functional biology in population-specific PCa cell lines and developing tools to pharmacologically modulate race-related oncogenic splice variants for therapeutic application using AA and white PCa cell lines and AA and white PCa patient-derived explants generated for this study and 3) defining the biological significance of cis- acting splicing elements and/or trans-acting splicing factors to driving the alternative splicing events specific to AA PCa.  The rationale for and impact of this study are that it will further our understanding of the molecular mechanisms driving PCa disparities and aid in development of novel precision biomarkers for prostate tumor aggressiveness and/or therapeutic agents against aggressive PCa. Such precision medicine interventions will reduce PCa disparities for AAs and will likely have impact on a subset of patients of all races with aggressive PCa. New AA and white PCa bio-specimens, AA and white PCa patient-derived explants and derivative cell lines and splicing-related materials and methods and tools resulting from the proposed work will be available to the nationwide cohort of scientists conducting research on PCa disparities. African American men are two times more likely to be diagnosed with prostate cancer than white men and are three times more likely to die from prostate cancer than white men. Our proposed work focuses on understanding the biological differences between African American and white prostate cancer and how to modulate these differences to treat aggressive prostate cancer. Ultimately, this will reduce the disproportionate burden from prostate cancer among African Americans and improve clinical outcomes for men of all races with aggressive prostate cancer.",Race-related alternative splicing: novel targets in prostate cancer,9693698,R01CA220314,"['Affect ', ' Alternative Splicing ', ' Alternative RNA Splicing ', ' Alternate Splicing ', ' Automobile Driving ', ' driving ', ' Biology ', ' Biopsy ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Surgical Castration ', ' Castration ', ' cultured cell line ', ' Strains Cell Lines ', ' CellLine ', ' Cell Line ', ' Chromatin ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Elements ', ' Exhibits ', ' Exons ', ' Gene Splicing ', ' Spliced Genes ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Growth ', ' treatment access ', ' service availability ', ' health services availability ', ' health service access ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' accessibility to health services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Access to Care ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' Hormone Receptor ', ' Incidence ', ' Inflammation ', ' Maintenance ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Methods ', ' mortality ', ' oligos ', ' Oligo ', ' Oligonucleotides ', ' Patients ', ' Pharmacology ', ' Prostatic Neoplasia ', ' Prostate Tumor ', ' Prostate Neoplasms ', ' Prostatic Neoplasms ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Research ', ' Splicing ', ' RNA Splicing ', ' Metastatic to ', ' Signal Pathway ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Tissues ', ' Work ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Biological ', ' Malignant neoplasm of lung ', ' lung cancer ', ' Pulmonary malignant Neoplasm ', ' Pulmonary Cancer ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Lung ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Therapeutic Agents ', ' Genetic ', ' Reporter ', ' tool ', ' Malignant neoplasm of liver ', ' malignant liver tumor ', ' liver cancer ', ' Hepatic Cancer ', ' Specimen ', ' Research Specimen ', ' Malignant neoplasm of prostate ', ' Prostatic Cancer ', ' Prostate Cancer ', ' Prostate CA ', ' Malignant prostatic tumor ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Prostate ', ' Cellular biology ', ' cell biology ', ' Scientist ', ' Frequencies ', ' Event ', ' Pattern ', ' cohort ', ' expectation ', ' novel ', ' Prevention ', ' Modeling ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Small Interfering RNA ', ' siRNA ', ' Short interfering RNA ', ' Disease Resistance ', ' resistant to disease ', ' resistant disease ', ' resistance to disease ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Oncogenesis ', ' tumorigenesis ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Cancer Biology ', ' Cancer Patient ', ' Collection ', ' Computer Analysis ', ' computer analyses ', ' computational analysis ', ' computational analyses ', ' Characteristics ', ' Molecular ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' pre-clinical ', ' preclinical ', ' novel strategies ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel approaches ', ' new approaches ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' disparity in cancer ', ' cancer disparity ', ' Oncogenic ', ' tumor ', ' overexpression ', ' overexpress ', ' population based ', ' effective therapy ', ' effective treatment ', ' Biological Markers ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' social health determinants ', ' prostate cancer cell ', ' prostate tumor cell ', ' screening ', ' castration resistant prostate cancer ', ' Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats ', ' CRISPR/Cas system ', ' CRISPR ', ' precision medicine ', ' precision-based medicine ', ' prostate cancer cell line ', ' differential expression ', ' transcriptional differences ', ' differentially expressed ', ' patient subsets ', ' patient subtypes ', ' patient subpopulations ', ' patient subgroups ', ' racial diversity ', ' racially diverse ', ' prostate cancer progression ', ' ']",NCI,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,337090,-0.04939491538058413
"The Role of The Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System, ARMC5, and Neprilysin in Glucose Metabolism among African Americans PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Joshua J. Joseph, MD, is an Assistant Professor in the Division of Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism at The Ohio State University. Dr. Joseph seeks a Mentored Patient- Oriented Research Career Development Award in order to obtain the skills, knowledge, and mentored research experience that are essential for a career as a clinician scientist in the field of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) prevention. This proposal is aimed at determining the role of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) in glucose metabolism and the development of T2DM among African Americans (AAs). AAs are 1.7 times as likely to develop T2DM in the US and are twice as likely to die from T2DM compared to non-Hispanic whites. Thus, this represents an area of critical need. The objectives of this proposal are to determine the role of the RAAS, endothelin-1, ARMC5 (armadillo repeat containing 5) and RAAS antagonism in glucose metabolism and the development of diabetes. The specific aims of this research proposal are: (1) to determine the associations of aldosterone and endothelin-1, individually and combined, with HOMA-insulin resistance, HOMA-β cell function, fasting plasma glucose and incident T2DM among AAs without T2DM at baseline in the Jackson Heart Study (JHS); (2) to determine a) the cross-sectional associations of predicted damaging ARMC5 mutations with plasma aldosterone, plasma renin activity, fasting glucose, and prevalent T2DM and b) the longitudinal association with incident T2DM among AAs in the JHS; (3) to determine the impact of RAAS antagonism or RAAS and neprilysin antagonism vs. placebo with changes in glucose metabolism over 6 months assessed via glucose clamp studies among AAs. For Aim 1, we propose predictive epidemiological analyses in the JHS, an observational investigation of cardiovascular disease among AAs, to determine the association of a combination of aldosterone and endothelin-1 with glucose metabolism, prevalent and incident T2DM. For Aim 2, we propose genetic analyses in the JHS, to determine the association of ARMC5 genetic variants with components of glucose metabolism, prevalent and incident T2DM. For Aim 3, we propose a 26- week clinical trial to test the effect of RAAS antagonism on β-cell function and insulin resistance in AAs with impaired glucose tolerance. The goals during the award period include developing expertise in the design, performance, analysis and presentation of clinical research through mentored research, didactic coursework, and formal training in clinical investigation of glucose metabolism, clinical trial methodology, genetic, genomic and other –omic analytic techniques and predictive/causal modeling. Long-term career goals include developing a career as an independent investigator focused on finding new approaches for preventing and treating T2DM, particularly among historically understudied populations in biomedical research. The proposed research aims to provide new insights into the contribution of the RAAS to changes in glucose metabolism in the development of T2DM. This work will lay the foundation to develop novel therapeutic targets for T2DM. PROJECT NARRATIVE African Americans have a higher prevalence, incidence and mortality from type 2 diabetes mellitus compared to non-Hispanic whites.

"Evaluation of molecular determinants of racial disparity in triple-negative breast cancer PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a very aggressive subtype with limited therapeutic options. Intriguingly, women of African American (AA) origin have much higher TNBC-related mortality rates compared to European American (EA) women. This difference is evident even after adjusting for socioeconomic status and access to care, indicating a biological basis. TNBC tumors in AA women exhibit higher rate of growth and metastasis in comparison to TNBC in EA women. There is an urgent need to understand the molecular mechanisms involved in aggressive progression and increased metastatic potential of AA-TNBC. In our preliminary studies, we observed that AA-TNBC cells have higher invasion and migration potential in comparison to EA-TNBC cells showing inherently aggressive nature of AA-TNBC. In a preliminary screen, we found that a large percentage of AA-TNBC tumors exhibit loss-of-tumor suppressor Liver Kinase B1 (LKB1) in comparison to EA-TNBC tumors. Our preliminary microarray studies also found that LKB1-loss in AA-TNBC results in activation of oncoproteins- YAP and TAZ. Our data suggest that with inherent loss of LKB1, AA-TNBC gain `an oncogenic input' in the form of activated YAP-TAZ signaling. Using in vitro studies, clinical AA-TNBC and EA-TNBC samples and patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models, we will test our hypothesis that inherent LKB1-loss in AA-TNBC results in activation of oncogenic YAP-TAZ signaling leading to aggressive progression and increased metastatic potential of AA-TNBC. Our novel findings also suggest that AA-TNBC tumors may be vulnerable to therapeutic strategies directed at YAP-TAZ inhibition. Based on our strong preliminary data, we will investigate how loss of LKB1 in AA-TNBC might lead to acquisition of higher YAP-TAZ, and drive growth and metastasis of AA-TNBC cells. We will also analyze AA-TNBC and EA-TNBC tumors to establish LKB1-loss and elevated YAP-TAZ as biomarkers of aggressive progression of AA-TNBC. We will utilize these biological insights to test and propose safe and effective therapeutic strategies to target AA-TNBC. Using patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models, we propose to investigate whether AA-TNBCs are particularly susceptible to YAP-TAZ inhibition strategies and whether currently clinically available drugs (screened from a drug library) can be repurposed to target YAP-TAZ in AA-TNBC. Secondly, we plan to examine whether Honokiol, a natural compound from Magnolia grandiflora, (selected from a screen of known bioactive compounds) and its novel analogs have the potential to inhibit YAP-TAZ in AA-TNBC. Our studies will provide new understanding how loss-of-LKB1 and gain-of-YAP-TAZ in AA-TNBC form a relentless axis that drives AA-TNBC. These studies will provide novel insight into molecular mechanisms underlying racial disparity in TNBC and provide a novel set of biomarkers and potential drug-targets to develop novel ways to reduce the disparity in clinical outcome of AA and EA TNBC patients. Project Narrative Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) in African American (AA) women is more aggressive than TNBC in European American (EA); 5-year relative survival for AA-TNBC is only 14% in comparison to 36% for EA- TNBC therefore it is imperative to understand the underlying molecular mechanisms leading to this racial disparity. Using in vitro studies, clinical AA-TNBC and EA-TNBC samples and patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models, we will test our hypothesis that inherent LKB1-loss in AA-TNBC tumors results in activation of oncoprotein- YAP-TAZ leading to ‘oncogene addiction’ and aggressive tumor progression. These studies will provide novel insight into molecular mechanisms underlying racial disparity in TNBC and provide a novel set of biomarkers and potential drug-targets to develop novel ways to reduce

"The Role of Inflammation in the Racial Disparities in Ovarian Cancer Survival ABSTRACT This application will provide the candidate, Dr. Peres, with the necessary career development and research experiences to propel her career as an independent molecular cancer epidemiologist. Dr. Peres’ long-term career goal is to integrate the fields of cancer epidemiology and molecular biology to disentangle the independent and joint effects of molecular and environmental risk factors on cancer etiology and prognosis, with a special emphasis on how these factors influence health disparities. Epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) is the deadliest gynecologic malignancy in the U.S. and African American (AA) women have a much poorer prognosis in comparison to women of European ancestry (EA). The contributing factors to this survival disparity are relatively unknown, and research in this area is in its infancy due to the small numbers of AA women in existing epidemiologic studies on EOC. Given the suggested link between chronic inflammation and EOC etiology and prognosis coupled with the observed differences in biomarkers of inflammation by race, we posit that differences in inflammation may be contributing to the EOC survival gap in AA women. The proposed research will capitalize on two existing population-based case-control studies, the African American Cancer Epidemiology Study (AACES) and the North Carolina Ovarian Cancer Study (NCOCS), to evaluate how the independent and joint effects of systemic and local inflammation in the tumor microenvironment influences EOC prognosis among AA women and whether differences in these inflammatory biomarkers are contributing to the racial survival disparity in EOC. Leukocyte cell type and distribution will be used as markers of systemic and local inflammation. Circulating leukocytes will be obtained from the complete blood cell count at diagnosis and a peripheral blood sample obtained after diagnosis. Leukocyte proportions will be inferred from peripheral blood DNA methylation data (Illumina MethylationEPIC BeadChip) using cell mixture deconvolution methods. To measure local inflammation, we will use immunohistochemistry to obtain counts of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (FOXP3, CD3, CD8) and neutrophils (CD66b) within the primary tumor and measure the Klintrup score, a general marker of overall inflammation with the tumor and within each leukocyte cell type. Lastly, we will evaluate whether inflammatory-related exposures (e.g., obesity, analgesic medication use, genital body powder exposure) contribute to systemic and/or local inflammation, and whether these biomarkers are mediators of the relationship between inflammatory-related exposures and EOC survival. In order to achieve the proposed research objectives, Dr. Peres will obtain additional knowledge in cancer epigenetics, molecular biology and bioinformatics through her training and career development activities as well as the mentoring provided by her interdisciplinary advisory committee. The proposed research will improve our understanding of the contributing factors to poor EOC survival among AA women and will likely have a considerable impact on our over-arching goal of reducing the existing racial survival disparity in EOC. PROJECT NARRATIVE Ovarian cancer is the fifth leading cause of cancer deaths among U.S. women. African American women experience the worst ovarian cancer survival, yet the causes of this racial survival disparity are not fully understood. We propose to evaluate how systemic and local inflammation, as well as their interplay, influences ovarian cancer prognosis among African American women and whether differences in these inflammatory markers are contributing to the racial survival disparity in ovarian cancer. This study will improve our overall understanding of ovarian cancer prognosis in African American women, to which little is known, as well as provide valuable data that can inform the applicability of

"EPHA6 as a novel candidate driver gene in colon cancer ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our long-term objective is to elucidate the etiologic factors contributing to disparate colon cancer (CRC) outcomes in African Americans (AA), who continue to exhibit the highest CRC incidence and mortality rates in the U.S, even after accounting for socioeconomic and access to care factors. We recently reported the first comprehensive molecular characterization of AA CRCs, identifying a 15 gene-set as preferentially mutated in AA as compared to Caucasian CRCs. On a broader scale, it is likely that these ethnicity-associated differences in CRC mutational landscapes may have potential to impact on broader disparities in cancer behaviors. In particular, our study identified the, accounting for ~6% of AA vs. 0% of Caucasians CRC cases. EPHA6 belongs to a broader family of ephrin receptor tyrosine kinases that function as oncogenes or tumor suppressors depending on the cancer type. Intriguingly, our study was the first to implicate EPHA6 in CRCs, with the finding of recurrent mutations in this gene selectively in AA CRCs, suggesting a provocative ethnicity-associated difference in routes of colon carcinogenesis. Accordingly, the specific goals of the current proposal are: (AIM 1) To characterize EPHA6 signaling and determine the functional consequences of EPHA6 mutations identified in AA CRCs. We will use in-depth phospho-proteomics and gene expression profiling approaches in AA CRC cell lines engineered to express wild-type (WT) or mutant versions of EPHA6 to characterize EPHA6 signaling and to determine the molecular consequences of EPHA6 mutations. Furthermore, we will compare the phenotypic effects of WT vs. mutant EPHA6 on tumor growth characteristics, using in vitro and xenograft models; (AIM 2) To determine if loss of EPHA6 enhances susceptibility to colon cancer. We will use EPHA6 null mice to determine if loss of EPHA6 induces colon tumorigenesis in chemical carcinogen and Apc Min models of colon cancer. As a complementary approach to Aim 1, we will further dissect and refine EPHA6 signaling pathway, in vivo, using proteomics and gene profiling in EPHA6 WT vs. null mouse colons; (AIM 3) To determine the generality of EPHA6 mutations, and their association with clinically-relevant histopathological features. The AA CRC cases used in our initial study were derived exclusively from Northeast Ohio. Given the history of differing patterns of mass internal migration of AAs within U.S, we will re-sequence EPHA6 in AA CRC cases from Southwestern Texas, to test if EPHA6 is common CRC mutational target in geographically distinct AA populations. Furthermore, given that all of the EPHA6-mutant CRCs identified in our initial study arose in proximal colon, we will re-sequence EPHA6 in a fresh set of AA CRCs from Northeast Ohio to determine if EPHA6-mutant CRC cases define a distinct, morphologically recognizable, subset of CRCs. Success in these studies will uncover new mechanisms underlying colon tumorigenesis and may identify new therapeutic targets for CRC, in addition to having broad epidemiological implications in elucidating the etiologic factors potentially contributing to aggressive colon cancer phenotypes in African Americans. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: African Americans are more likely to be diagnosed with and to die as a result of colon cancer than any other ethnic group in the United States. Identifying the mechanisms involved in colon tumor progression in African Americans is therefore critical for elucidating the etiologic factors contributing to outcome disparities in African Americans. Our proposed studies are designed to delineate the molecular mechanisms associated with colon cancer progression in African Americans with an overarching goal of guiding clinical management for this deadly disease in this population.",EPHA6 as a novel candidate driver gene in colon cancer,9879720,R01CA204549,"['Accounting ', ' Alleles ', ' Allelomorphs ', ' Azoxymethane ', ' Diazene, dimethyl-,

"Slow wave sleep (SWS) and the effect of African ancestry on amyloid burden, a longitudinal study 7. PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT:  African-Americans (AAs) have an increased prevalence of Alzheimer's disease (AD) compared to whites, which traditionally has been associated to the presence of vascular disease. However, a recent community- based study of non-demented elderly, as well as our preliminary data, suggest that AAs have higher amyloid burden after adjusting for vascular risk factors, which points to the presence of additional genetic or physiological differences on AD-risk by race. The purpose of this study is to test whether poor slow wave sleep (SWS) is one of these factors. Sleep disturbances vary between AAs and non-Hispanic whites. AAs take longer to fall asleep, have shorter sleep duration, lower sleep efficiency and, more characteristically, less SWS duration when compared to whites. Relatedly, amyloid positive healthy elderly, as well as those with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD, experience more sleep fragmentation and more decreased SWS and REM sleep duration than their healthy counterparts. This suggests: i) that disturbed sleep contributes to AD- neurodegeneration (or that sleep is particularly sensitive to amyloid deposition); and, ii) that race-related sleep differences might contribute to the reported increases in amyloid burden in AAs. The study has two goals: first, to confirm that black race is associated in vivo with longitudinal increases in amyloid-PET uptake and cognitive decline; second, to demostrate that poor SWS at baseline is associated with these increases after controling for the cardiovascular morbidity that is shared between sleep disturbances and dementia and might confound these associations. In consultation with community stakeholders, we will recruit 150 cognitively normal AA elderly (ages 55-75 years) and 60 whites balanced by age, sex, BMI, education and other socio- demographic variables and from the same Brooklyn neighborhoods. Visit one will include a full clinical evaluation, neuropsychological tests and clinical labs. Participants will later undergo home monitoring for OSA for two nights followed by 5 days of actigraphy. Subjects with normal sleep breathing will be invited to perform 2 nights of nocturnal polysomnography (NPSG) followed by a second final visit in which amyloid load and cerebrovascular morbidity will be analyzed by 11C-PiB PET-MR. All subjects will be invited to repeat both visits after 30 months. This study has the potential to identify clinical predictors of amyloid burden in cognitively normal AA elderly and would be an important step towards the prevention of dementia in the black community as well as the reduction of health inequities. 8. PROJECT NARRATIVE:  Recent evidence suggests that older African-Americans (AAs) are at a higher risk of developing amyloid deposition independently of vascular disease, which would partially account for the increased prevalence of dementia among AAs. In this proposal, we will extend our prior work in this population to test whether poor slow wave sleep (SWS), which is more common among AAs when compared to whites, is one of the factors that explains these associations. This study has the potential to identify clinical (and treatable) predictors of amyloid burden in cognitively normal AA elderly and would be an important step towards the prevention of dementia in the black community as well as the reduction of health inequities.","Slow wave sleep (SWS) and the effect of African ancestry on amyloid burden, a longitudinal study",9936352,R01AG056531,"['Age ', ' ages ', ' Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' AD dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer syndrome ', "" Alzheimer's "", "" Alzheimer's disease dementia "", ' Alzheimers Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Amyloid ', ' Amyloid Substance ', ' Apnea ', ' Breathing ', ' Respiratory Aspiration ', ' Respiratory Inspiration ', ' inspiration ', ' Autopsy ', ' necropsy ', ' postmortem ', ' Behavior ', ' Black race ', ' Blood Vessels ', ' vascular ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' circulatory system ', ' Cognition ', ' Communities ', ' Consultations ', ' Amyloid deposition ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Diffusion ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Geographic Locations ', ' Geographic Area ', ' Geographic Region ', ' Geographical Location ', ' geographic site ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Hypertension ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' high blood pressure ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Economical Income ', ' indexing ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' longitudinal outcome studies ', ' longterm study ', ' Memory ', ' Morbidity -

"Maintenance and Enhancement of the Atlanta African American Maternal-Child Cohort: Exposome Profiling via High-resolution Metabolomics and Integration of Microbiome-Metabolome-Epigenome Data PROJECT ABSTRACT Environmental exposures during the critical prenatal and early childhood periods can result in lifelong health consequences. Mechanisms underlying these exposure-health relationships are complex, with exogenous exposures (such as chemical toxicants) affecting endogenous processes (such as gene regulation and metabolism), which perturb metabolic pathways that lead to adverse health outcomes. Both adverse exposures and their health consequences disproportionately impact African American (AA) women and children, highlighting that health disparities begin in utero and are amplified postnatally. Among outcomes disproportionately experienced by AA children are preterm birth, neurodevelopmental deficits, and obesity – all linked to environmental exposures, yet poorly understood due to etiologic complexity. Our team is currently investigating preterm birth and neurodevelopment through 18-months in relation to pre- and postnatal exposures to environmental toxicants and biopsychosocial risk factors in cohorts of pregnant AA women (R01NR014800, R01MD009064) and their infants (R01MD009746) and via our P50 Children's Environmental Health Center (P50ES026071) in collaboration with the Emory HERCULES Exposome Research Center (P30 ES019776). We are also evaluating child obesity and neurodevelopment at 2-5 years of age under the Environmental Child Health Outcomes (ECHO) program (UG3OD023318). Through this R24 mechanism, we propose to: (1) Continue to enroll AA women at 8-14 wks' gestation, collect data at three time points during pregnancy, and engage delivered mother-child dyads in on-going postnatal follow-up studies to allow continued investigation of relationships between prenatal and early childhood exposures to chemical and non- chemical stressors and child health outcomes (Cohort Maintenance Aim); (2) Evaluate the performance of high-resolution mass spectrometry coupled with gas chromatography (GC-HRMS) for quantifying persistent organic pollutants (POPs) microliter serum volumes by comparing measured POP concentrations to those measured using conventional targeted analytic chemistry approaches in the same cohort (Resource Infrastructure – Exposure Characterization Aim); and (3) Adapt tools for multi-omic data integration to enable the display, visualization, and integration of comprehensive exposure assessment and biological effect data – to include chemical toxicant concentrations and metabolomic (KEGG pathway), epigenomic (gene methylation and expression), and microbiome data – and the analysis of associations with pregnancy and birth outcomes within our cohort and across cohort collaborations (Resource Infrastructure - Data Preparation Aim). Through this work, we expect to advance environmental health science around the assessment of chemical mixtures (with a focus on POPs) and their adverse preclinical (metabolic and epigenetic) health effects in our own high disparity population of pregnant women and newborns and to support other cohorts and cross-cohort collaborations involving the use of high-dimensional multi-omic data. PROJECT NARRATIVE By maintaining the Atlanta African American (AA) Maternal-Child Cohort and expanding its omic infrastructure to incorporate high-resolution mass spectrometry coupled with gas chromatography (GC-HRMS) and software tools to integrate multi-omic data, the proposed work will advance environmental health science around the assessment of chemical mixtures (with a focus on persistent organic pollutants [POPs]) and their preclinical health effects, including perturbation of metabolome, epigenome, and microbiome profiles. This work will maximize exposomic profiling within our own high disparity population of pregnant AA women and newborns, and will facilitate such approaches in other cohorts and cross-cohort

"Race-related alternative splicing: novel targets in prostate cancer African American (AA) men exhibit 1.6-fold higher incidence and 2.4-fold higher mortality rates from prostate cancer (PCa) compared to white men. Although much of this disparity remains after controlling for factors related to social determinants of health, very few studies have used this population-based difference to identify molecular mechanisms of tumor aggressiveness. The proposed work addresses the urgent need to interrogate the molecular mechanisms driving the more aggressive PCa biology in AA men across the PCa progression continuum and to modulate such mechanisms for therapeutic application.  Our data from evaluating PCa biopsy tissue from AA and white patients has led to the discovery of alternative splicing as a novel molecular mechanism underlying more aggressive PCa in AA men. Preliminary analysis has indicated that several of these race-related alternative splicing events track with increased growth and more aggressive invasion characteristics of PCa in AA men. Additional preliminary work has demonstrated our capability to generate the first significant collection of PCa patient-derived explants and the first establishment of PCa patient-derived explants from AA patients.  We aim to extend our preliminary findings by 1) determining the pattern and frequency of candidate race- related splice variants across the PCa progression continuum, from localized PCa of varying degrees of aggressiveness to metastatic castration-resistant PCa, and defining the relationship between these variants and PCa cell biology, 2) assessing the effects of expression of particular race-related splice variants on mechanistic and functional biology in population-specific PCa cell lines and developing tools to pharmacologically modulate race-related oncogenic splice variants for therapeutic application using AA and white PCa cell lines and AA and white PCa patient-derived explants generated for this study and 3) defining the biological significance of cis- acting splicing elements and/or trans-acting splicing factors to driving the alternative splicing events specific to AA PCa.  The rationale for and impact of this study are that it will further our understanding of the molecular mechanisms driving PCa disparities and aid in development of novel precision biomarkers for prostate tumor aggressiveness and/or therapeutic agents against aggressive PCa. Such precision medicine interventions will reduce PCa disparities for AAs and will likely have impact on a subset of patients of all races with aggressive PCa. New AA and white PCa bio-specimens, AA and white PCa patient-derived explants and derivative cell lines and splicing-related materials and methods and tools resulting from the proposed work will be available to the nationwide cohort of scientists conducting research on PCa disparities. African American men are two times more likely to be diagnosed with prostate cancer than white men and are three times more likely to die from prostate cancer than white men. Our proposed work focuses on understanding the biological differences between African American and white prostate cancer and how to modulate these differences to treat aggressive prostate cancer. Ultimately, this will reduce the disproportionate burden from prostate cancer among African Americans and improve clinical outcomes for men of all races with aggressive prostate cancer.",Race-related alternative splicing: novel targets in prostate cancer,9925752,R01CA220314,"['Affect ', ' Alternative Splicing ', ' Alternate Splicing ', ' Alternative RNA Splicing ', ' Automobile Driving ', ' driving ', ' Biology ', ' Biopsy ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Castration ', ' Surgical Castration ', ' Cell Line ', ' CellLine ', ' Strains Cell Lines ', ' cultured cell line ', ' Chromatin ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Elements ', ' Exhibits ', ' Exons ', ' Spliced Genes ', ' Gene Splicing ', ' Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' Access to Care ', ' access to health services ', ' access to services ', ' access to treatment ', ' accessibility to health services ', ' availability of services ', ' care access ', ' health service access ', ' health services availability ', ' service availability ', ' treatment access ', ' Hormone Receptor ', ' Incidence ', ' Inflammation ', ' Maintenance ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Methods ', ' mortality ', ' Oligonucleotides ', ' Oligo ', ' oligos ', ' Patients ', ' Pharmacology ', ' Prostatic Neoplasms ', ' Prostate Neoplasms ', ' Prostate Tumor ', ' Prostatic Neoplasia ', ' Race ', ' Racial Group ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Research ', ' RNA Splicing ', ' Splicing ', ' Metastatic to ', ' Signal Pathway ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Work ', ' Afro American ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Black Populations ', ' black American ', ' African American ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Biological ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Lung ', ' Pulmonary Cancer ', ' Pulmonary malignant Neoplasm ', ' lung cancer ', ' Malignant neoplasm of lung ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Therapeutic Agents ', ' Genetic ', ' Reporter ', ' tool ', ' Hepatic Cancer ', ' liver cancer ', ' malignant liver tumor ', ' Malignant neoplasm of liver ', ' Research Specimen ', ' Specimen ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Prostate ', ' Malignant prostatic tumor ', ' Prostate CA ', ' Prostate Cancer ', ' Prostatic Cancer ', ' Malignant neoplasm of prostate ', ' cell biology ', ' Cellular biology ', ' Scientist ', ' Frequencies ', ' Event ', ' Pattern ', ' cohort ', ' expectation ', ' novel ', ' Prevention ', ' Modeling ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Short interfering RNA ', ' siRNA ', ' Small Interfering RNA ', ' resistance to disease ', ' resistant disease ', ' resistant to disease ', ' Disease Resistance ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Oncogenesis ', ' tumorigenesis ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Cancer Biology ', ' Cancer Patient ', ' Collection ', ' computational analyses ', ' computational analysis ', ' computer analyses ', ' Computer Analysis ', ' Characteristics ', ' Molecular ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' preclinical ', ' pre-clinical ', ' new approaches ', ' novel approaches ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel strategies ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' cancer disparity ', ' disparity in cancer ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' Oncogenic ', ' tumor ', ' overexpress ', ' overexpression ', ' population based ', ' effective treatment ', ' effective therapy ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' social health determinants ', ' prostate tumor cell ', ' prostate cancer cell ', ' screening ', ' castrate resistant PCa ', ' castrate resistant prostate cancer ', ' castration resistant PCa ', ' castration resistant prostate cancer ', ' CRISPR ', ' CRISPR/Cas system ', ' Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats ', ' precision-based medicine ', ' precision medicine ', ' prostate cancer cell line ', ' differentially expressed ', ' transcriptional differences ', ' differential expression ', ' patient subgroups ', ' patient subpopulations ', ' patient subtypes ', ' patient subsets ', ' racially diverse ', ' racial diversity ', ' prostate cancer progression ', ' ']",NCI,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,347517,-0.04939491538058413
"Food Allergy Outcomes Related to White and African American Racial Differences (FORWARD) PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Background: Food allergy (FA) is a potentially life-threatening condition that affects an estimated 8% of children in the United States. Although differences between African American (AA) and White children in the prevalence and severity of other atopic conditions such as asthma and eczema have been well described, little is known about such differences in FA. The limited existing literature indicates that AA children may have worse clinical outcomes, including rates of FA-related fatal anaphylaxis and FA-related emergency department (ED) visits, than their White peers. Phenotypic and endotypic differences, including rates of sensitization and co-morbidities, between AA and White children are beginning to be examined. Data on racial differences in FA management practices are incomplete; preliminary data suggest that AA families spend significantly less on allergen-free foods and FA medications than do White families. Families caring for children with FA experience significant impairments in psychosocial outcomes, including FA-related quality of life (FAQoL); however, these data come primarily from White, privately insured families, and little is known about psychosocial outcomes in AA families. Two recent reviews concluded that existing studies examining racial disparities in FA are far too methodologically limited to draw definitive conclusions, primarily due to reliance on self-report of FA diagnosis and cross-sectional designs. Specific Aims and Methods: Our goal is to prospectively study a cohort of 600 AA and White children (0-12 years) with FA in order to: 1) Determine variability in clinical FA outcomes between AA and White patients via bimonthly remote assessments, biannual clinic visits, and medical chart review over a two-year period; 2) Examine phenotypic and endotypic differences between AA and White children with FA using specific laboratory specimen collection techniques and assays; 3) Identify differences between AA and White children in FA management practices by parent report (e.g. allergen avoidance and epinephrine carriage); and 4) Determine differences between AA and White children in psychosocial FA-related outcomes (e.g., FA-related quality of life, bullying, anxiety, and worry) via the above survey methods. Hypotheses and Expected Results: We hypothesize that compared to White children, AA children will: have higher rates of food-allergic reactions and FA-related healthcare utilization; demonstrate unique FA phenotypes and endotypes; have poorer knowledge of FA management and worse adherence to preventative behaviors; have limited access to medications and allergen-free foods; and report better quality of life. Significance and Effects on Other Research: Confirming and further characterizing differences between AA and White children with FA will provide the data required to develop clinical guidelines, optimize treatment, and build health policies that meet the needs of both AA and White children. Project Narrative Childhood food allergy is a serious health condition affecting 8% of children in the US.

"Accelerating Excellence in Translational Science (AXIS) - Administrative Supplement SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Underserved and under-resourced African American (AA) communities face two major COVID-19 related challenges during this pandemic. One major challenge, at the community level, is the increased risk of outbreaks of COVID-19 at faith-based gatherings. The second major challenge is the negative impact of this pandemic on the management of chronic conditions, particularly older adults with co-morbidities and underlying conditions. AA older adults, specifically those managing comorbidities and social isolation, are one of the most vulnerable groups susceptible to COVID-19 infection and have the most severe and critical consequences of this pandemic. AA older adults with co-morbidities, who heavily rely on county-based safety- net facilities, have had to change their patterns of seeking required medical care to manage their chronic conditions, including delaying, reducing, or stopping visits to primary and specialty providers, or to a pharmacy to obtain medication and treatment. Reduced routine access to health care providers and prescribed medications, coupled with risky health behaviors during the pandemic, may substantially exasperate existing disparities in healthcare utilization, non-adherence to management of chronic conditions, unhealthy lifestyles, and poorer health outcomes among underserved AA older adults. This multilevel, multidisciplinary, theoretically-based, culturally sensitive, community participatory intervention addresses these challenges in two phases. In Phase One, we collaborate with 10 AA church leaders on implementing Federal and State (California) public health guidelines for churches for reducing COVID-19 risk in predominantly AA churches in South Los Angeles, potentially impacting over 3,000 parishioners. In addition, we collaborate with 10 AA churches to train 30 church-based AA young adults as health advisors to master information about COVID-19 and its impact on the daily life of underserved AAs, particularly, older adults with underlying multimorbidity or social isolation. In Phase Two, we recruit 265 AA older parishioners to receive a telehealth-based culturally and spiritually sensitive intervention that provides health coaching and support. The goal of this phase is to mitigate the negative impact of COVID-19 on the management of chronic health conditions, and to reduce healthcare avoidance behaviors and psychological distress caused by the pandemic. This study builds sustainability for the AA community with the training of 30 AA church-based health advisors who will be a valuable community resource as they can continue to provide coaching and support after the intervention. Through collaboration with AA church leaders in South Los Angeles, we ensure that AA ministerial leaders are at the forefront of our efforts to assist in the development of a healthy community. This intervention seeks to help one of the most vulnerable populations impacted by COVID-19 and is strongly endorsed by the California Black Health Network. NARRATIVE African American adults, specifically those managing chronic disease and social isolation, are one of the most vulnerable groups susceptible to COVID-19. This intervention involves a multi-disciplinary and culturally sensitive approach to address two major COVID-19 related challenges in this population. First, this program collaborates with predominantly African American churches to implement Federal and State guidelines aimed at preventing outbreaks of COVID-19 at faith-based gatherings.

"Optimization of Blood Levels of 25(OH)-vitamin D in African Americans Optimization of 25(OH) vitamin D levels in African Americans Public Health Issue: Low circulating levels of 25(OH) vitamin D (VD) have been correlated with many adverse health conditions and health disparities in African Americans (AA). Supraphysiological high-dose VD supplementation is required to eliminate the differences observed in the levels of circulating 25(OH)VD in AA and white subjects. However, recent studies have questioned the therapeutic effects of high-dose VD supplementation. Rationale: Glutathione (GSH) is a major physiological antioxidant. Recent studies report that low levels of GSH are linked to 25(OH)VD deficiencies in both animal and human studies. Animal studies using ZDF rats and a mouse model of 25(OH)VD deficiency have shown that, compared to supplementation with VD-alone, co-supplementation with VD (cholecalciferol) + L-cysteine (LC, a GSH precursor) led to an improvement in GSH status that resulted in significant increases in circulating levels of 25(OH)VD and reduced oxidative stress, TNF-α, and insulin resistance (IR). Approach: AA have reduced levels of glutathione (GSH), as well as a high incidence of insulin resistance (IR) and inflammatory disorders. This R33 application presents our design for a randomized, double-blind, placebo- controlled clinical trial to test the hypothesis that supplementation with VD in combination with L-cysteine (a GSH precursor) is more successful at optimizing the statuses of 25(OH)VD and GSH [biological signatures] and simultaneously decreasing TNF-α and IR [functional or clinical outcomes], suggesting a better therapeutic approach compared with supplementation with VD alone in AA subjects. Impact on Public Health: The successful completion of this R33 clinical trial will have a significant impact on the design of future efficacy clinical trials examining co-supplementation using a GSH precursor coupled with lower VD doses to reduce 25(OH)VD deficiency/inadequacy, inflammation, and IR biomarkers. The development of a safe, low-cost dietary supplement that can improve 25-hydroxy vitamin D status and reduce insulin resistance and inflammation would provide significant benefits in the treatment of pre-diabetes and health disparities, including chronic pain, in the African American population. This application, which is highly responsive to PAR-18-828, will replicate previous human studies and examine the outcome of biological signatures by combining the natural product L-cysteine with VD to optimize its supplementation and efficacy. NARRATIVE SUMMARY/RELEVANCE  Two-thirds of our population is at risk for 25-hydroxy vitamin D deficiency and its associated health hazards, according to the National Center for Health Statistics. This has led to widespread vitamin D supplementation by the public. However, supraphysiological supplementation of vitamin D is needed to achieve normal circulating 25-hydroxy VD levels, and some subjects respond poorly to supplementation or experience side effects.  The African-American (AA) population has been reported to have a higher incidence of 25-hydroxy VD deficiency as well as clinical pain. This study will investigate whether the combined use of the nutrients VD and L-cysteine exerts measurable and beneficial effects on 25-hydroxy vitamin D levels and insulin resistance biomarkers. The translation and validation of our novel hypothesis could have a tremendous impact on medical practice, leading to the novel recommendation that supplementation that combines the use of vitamin D and a GSH precursor is superior to the current practice of supplementation with high-dose vitamin D alone.  The long-term goal is to discover new approaches to ensure adequate 25(OH)VD status and to prevent the adverse effects of vitamin D deficiency on health conditions in the African-American

"Developing a Tailored, Theoretically-Driven Smartphone Physical Activity Intervention for African American Women PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Candidate. The Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award (K23) will enable me to acquire the focused training necessary to become an independent and leading investigator in technology- based physical activity interventions among African American women and reduce their risks for many chronic diseases. To date, I have gained exceptional training experiences in behavior change theories, research methods, multiculturalism, and diversity across different adult populations. This foundation facilitates the next steps of my proposed training, namely, developing expertise on the central factors related to regular physical activity engagement among African American (AA) women, and the skills necessary for the development, implementation, and evaluation of smartphone app technology prevention and intervention research. The proposed training and research will prepare me to take a leadership role in technology-enhanced interventions targeting PA disparities.  Proposed Research. Only 36% of African American (AA) women meet the national recommendation of 150 minutes per week of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity. Consequently, this group is disproportionally impacted by many associated disease conditions, including type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Research on physical activity disparity in this group indicates a triadic and reciprocal interaction between individual characteristics, social norms, and environmental factors. Smartphone application technology (e.g. apps) has been recommended as an innovative and low-burden platform to enhance theoretically driven approaches to promoting PA among AA women. This technology facilitates the development of effective, and scalable approaches delivered in real time and that can reach people in their daily environments. Moreover, this platform supports the development of innovative social networks for social support. Further, a counseling session intervention that helps AA women to develop an initial, individualized plan for PA before starting a PA program may help to increase levels of motivation for physical activity. This K-award applicant proposes an individually tailored, culturally relevant and smartphone delivered PA program including short text messages adapted from an effective internet-delivered intervention. The app program will contain activity monitoring features, educational videos, information on alternative and nearby environments, and a peer-to-peer chatroom to increase social support for PA behaviors in AA women compared to general wellness text messaging control condition. PROJECT NARRATIVE African American (AA) women are overwhelmingly physically inactive and suffer disproportionately from associated health conditions, including type II diabetes, coronary heart disease, and obesity. Smartphone applications technology provides a substantial opportunity to deliver evidenced-based behavioral interventions tailored for AA women and help to promote adherence to physical

"Genetic underpinnings of cardiorenal risk in Africans and African Americans ABSTRACT Hypertension (HTN) has earlier onset and takes on a more severe form in African Americans (AAs) as compared to other U.S. populations, which translates to higher rates of cardiovascular disease (CVD) endpoints including stroke and end stage renal disease. The rates of related comorbidities including type 2 diabetes (T2D) and chronic kidney disease (CKD) are also higher in AAs. These remarkable disparities equate to important consequences for the health of AA communities. Emerging data suggest genetic markers originating in Africa incur disease risk in this population. Prior genetic association studies of HTN, T2D, and CKD have been undertaken in AAs. However, the ancestral genetic variation coverage and sample sizes that have been achieved in genetic studies of European Ancestry populations have not yet been achieved for African ancestry populations. Additionally, a direct comparison of risk alleles between AA and African populations has yet to be made. To address these important research gaps, we propose a study that substantially expands the number of AAs with relevant phenotype and genotype data and dramatically improves the coverage of African specific genetic variation in a large number of AAs belonging to existing cardiovascular epidemiology cohorts. We propose genotyping 8000 AAs from the REasons for Geographic and Racial Differences in Stroke (REGARDS) study and 2000 West Africans from the Human Health and Heredity in Africa (H3A) Kidney Network, newly bringing these 10,000 participants into genetic studies. We will combine these data with existing genotype data from 2000 H3A participants and recently generated high-coverage whole genome sequence (WGS) data on ~6500 AAs, with relevant phenotype data, from the NHLBI’s Trans- Omics for Precision Medicine (TOPMed) program. The TOPMed WGS data will be further used to impute sequence variants into REGARDS, H3A and the ~15,000 previously genotyped AA participants from other NHLBI cohorts. We will use these unprecedented resources to conduct the most comprehensive study of cardiorenal traits (blood pressure, renal function, fasting glucose) in AAs to date. We will follow up our top variant-association findings in an independent replication sample of 11,000 AAs with relevant data. Finally, we will test whether variants associated with these risk factors are also associated with CVD outcomes. Our proposed study, including a total of ~40,500 AAs and 4000 West Africans, will provide us an unprecedented opportunity to evaluate the role of genetic variation, and in particular African-derived genetic variation, in the increased susceptibility to CVD and renal disease in AAs. ! PROJECT NARRATIVE African Americans are overburdened by hypertension and related comorbidities, representing a major area of racial health disparity, with African Americans having higher risk and worse outcomes. The proposed work will identify novel genetic risk factors for various cardiorenal measures in African Americans and Africans.

"Elucidating Lung Cancer Etiology Among Asian American Female Never Smokers Abstract Lung cancer in never smokers (LCINS) is a disease and disparity that disproportionately affects Asian American (AA) females. In contrast to declining incidence trends seen among most racial/ethnic groups, incidence of lung cancer, especially adenocarcinoma, has been increasing in most AA ethnic groups. The majority of AA females, upwards of nearly 90% among Chinese, diagnosed with lung cancer have never smoked. There is very little known of the contributing risk factors to the high and increasing incidence rates of LCINS among AA females, particularly as risk factors identified in studies in Asia may have limited significance among AA populations. Moreover, there is limited understanding of the relationships between the mutational signatures of tumors among this population and their associated risk factors. Such information will improve our understanding of the underlying potential mechanistic pathways. Thus, the overall objective of this study is to identify the attributable risk of known, putative, and suspected risk factors for lung cancer among AA female never smokers. Recognizing that currently there are no U.S. datasets nor existing cohorts with data for evaluating putative and suspected risk factors that may be most relevant to this population, we propose a robust, population-based case-control study, leveraging early-case ascertainment methods from cancer registries and tested state-of-the-science approaches for unbiased control ascertainment. With high- quality, multilevel data collected from an estimated 600 female AA never-smoker lung cancer cases and 600 ethnicity and age frequency-matched controls, we aim to: Aim 1a. Identify risk factors for LCINS among AA females, with attention to differences by histology and EGFR (epidermal growth factor receptor) status (determined using whole exome sequencing [WES]), and focusing on multi-level factors including: a) genetic ancestry; b) individual- level exposures, including putative and suspected risk factors; and c) contextual-level risk factors including indoor and ambient air pollutants and the social environment, with consideration of nativity and years in the U.S. versus Asia; Aim 1b. Determine the independent and joint contributions of multi-level risk factors to LCINS among AA females by calculating the attributable risk for each risk factor, individually and in total; Aim 2a. Characterize the mutational landscape of LCINS among AA females, through WES of paired tumor-normal tissue samples to define somatic mutation profiles, mutational signatures, and EGFR status of LCINS AA females; and Aim 2b. Identify multi- level risk factors associated with the major mutational tumor features. All aims will assess potential differences by EGFR status. The proposed research will involve the assembly of the largest population-based lung cancer case- control dataset, with associated genetic and tumor genomic data, for never-smoking AA women. It will provide a first- ever opportunity to evaluate detailed multilevel factors contributing to the lung cancer disparity in distinct AA ethnic groups. A clear understanding of the etiologic factors underlying the high and increasing lung cancer risk among AA never-smoker females is necessary for designing the appropriate prevention strategies to reduce their high burden of disease. Project Narrative Asian American women have remarkably high rates of lung cancer, despite that the great majority of them do not smoke; this is a health inequity that has not received the attention that it deserves.

"Depletion of pancreatic lipid improves beta-cell function in early type 2 diabetes The decline in first-phase insulin secretion is a key event in the etiology of type 2 diabetes (T2D). Although the cause of beta-cell failure is not clear, “lipotoxicity” has been proposed. Bariatric surgery and very-low calorie diets in patients with T2D induce disease remission, characterized by a return of first-phase insulin secretion and a depletion of pancreas lipid. However, these are extreme approaches to treating T2D, and non-invasive, sustainable, yet equally effective, treatments are needed. We have shown in individuals at risk for T2D that an intervention with a weight-maintaining low-glycemic (LG) diet selectively depletes visceral adipose tissue and ectopic lipid in muscle while preserving thigh subcutaneous adipose and lean body mass. This observation suggests that such diets are able to “remodel” body composition by re-partitioning energy away from metabolically harmful lipid stores. Participants on the LG diet also demonstrated improved insulin sensitivity and a dramatic (9-fold) increase in first-phase insulin secretion. Thus, we hypothesize that a weight-maintaining LG diet will selectively deplete ectopic adipose tissue, including pancreatic lipid, and will permit recovery of beta-cell function in individuals with T2D. Rescue of beta-cell function may be particularly important in African-Americans (AA), who as a group demonstrate a high prevalence of T2D, for reasons that cannot be explained by lifestyle. AA are likely to be vulnerable to beta-cell failure due to inherently high beta-cell responsiveness (demonstrable in healthy young children). Further, it has been shown that pancreas lipid is a determinant of prediabetes specifically in AA. Thus, we hypothesize that an LG diet will be particularly beneficial to beta-cell function and glycemic control among AA. To test these hypotheses, we will conduct a randomized clinical trial to examine the impact a weight-maintaining LG diet vs a Control diet (ADA/USDA) with all food provided on changes in pancreatic lipid by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and first-phase insulin secretion by hyperglycemic clamp and oral meal test in AA and European-American (EA) individuals with early T2D (<5 yr since diagnosis). The study will be powered to examine race-specific effects (race x diet interaction). This proposal responds to PA-17-021, “Addressing Health Disparities in NIDDK Diseases.” The results from this study could change clinical care guidelines to incorporate an LG diet, which may reduce the disproportionate burden of T2D and its complications experienced by AA. Type 2 diabetes develops because the pancreas is no longer able to secrete enough insulin to control blood sugar. Patients with type 2 diabetes have more fat in their pancreas than healthy individuals, and if pancreas fat is reduced, insulin secretion returns. In this study, we will determine if a low sugar diet can reduce pancreas fat and improve insulin secretion and glucose control in patients with type 2 diabetes.",Depletion of pancreatic lipid improves beta-cell function in early type 2 diabetes,9902431,R01DK116726,"['Adipose tissue ', ' Fatty Tissue ', ' adipose ', ' white adipose tissue ', ' yellow adipose tissue ', ' Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Blood Glucose ', ' Blood Sugar ', ' Body Composition ', ' Cell physiology ', ' Cell Function ', ' Cell Process ', ' Cellular Function ', ' Cellular Physiology ', ' Cellular Process ', ' Subcellular Process ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' children ', "" childrens' "", ' youngster ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Adult-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Ketosis-Resistant Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Maturity-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' NIDDM ', ' Non-Insulin Dependent Diabetes ', ' Noninsulin Dependent Diabetes ', ' Noninsulin Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Slow-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Stable Diabetes Mellitus ', ' T2 DM ', ' T2D ', ' T2DM ', ' Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Type 2 diabetes ', ' Type II Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Type II diabetes ', ' adult onset diabetes ', ' ketosis resistant diabetes ', ' maturity onset diabetes ', ' type 2 DM ', ' type II DM ', ' type two diabetes ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Diet ', ' dietary ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Pharmacotherapy ', ' Drug Therapy ', ' drug treatment ', ' Fatty acid glycerol esters ', ' Fats ', ' Food ', ' Food or Food Product ', ' Hyperglycemia ', ' hyperglycemic ', ' Insulin ', ' Humulin R ', ' Novolin R ', ' Regular Insulin ', ' Insulin Resistance ', ' insulin resistant ', ' Life Style ', ' Lifestyle ', ' Lipids ', ' Longevity ', ' Length of Life ', ' life span ', ' lifespan ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' MR Imaging ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MRI ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Muscle ', ' Muscle Tissue ', ' muscular ', ' Obesity ', ' adiposity ', ' corpulence ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulentia ', ' obese ', ' obese people ', ' obese person ', ' obese population ', ' Pancreas ', ' Pancreatic ', ' Patients ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Race ', ' Racial Group ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Testing ', ' Thigh structure ', ' Thigh ', ' Weight ', ' Glucose Clamp ', ' Euglycemic Clamping ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' Afro American ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Black Populations ', ' black American ', ' African American ', ' Guidelines ', ' improved ', ' Phase ', ' Randomized Clinical Trials ', ' disability ', ' Failure ', ' Individual ', ' Recovery ', ' European ', ' sugar ', ' Populations at Risk ', ' Disease Progression ', ' Low-Fat Diet ', ' Fat-Restricted Diet ', ' Metabolic ', ' tool ', ' Prediabetes ', ' Prediabetic State ', ' pre-diabetes ', ' pre-diabetic ', ' prediabetic ', ' Prediabetes syndrome ', ' Calories ', ' Event ', ' Oral ', ' Visceral ', ' subcutaneous ', ' restoration ', ' Clampings ', ' Closure by clamp ', ' Remission ', ' Disease remission ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' Cellular injury ', ' cell damage ', ' cellular damage ', ' damage to cells ', ' injury to cells ', ' cell injury ', ' Participant ', ' ethnicity difference ', ' ethnic difference ', ' response ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' insulin sensitivity ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Insulin Cell ', ' Insulin Secreting Cell ', ' β-cell ', ' β-cells ', ' βCell ', ' Beta Cell ', ' insulin secretion ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Causality ', ' causation ', ' disease causation ', ' Etiology ', ' Address ', ' gastric banding ', ' gastric bypass surgery ', ' implantable gastric stimulation banding ', ' obesity surgery ', ' stomach stapling ', ' weight loss surgery ', ' bariatric surgery ', ' Symptoms ', ' High Prevalence ', ' NIDDK ', ' National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases ', ' Characteristics ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' weight maintenance ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' glycemic control ', ' glucose control ', ' glucose homeostasis ', ' glucose regulation ', ' blood glucose regulation ', ' Prevalence ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' nondiabetic ', ' non-diabetic ', ' clinical care ', ' patient population ', ' response to treatment ', ' therapeutic response ', ' treatment response ', ' effective treatment ', ' effective therapy ', ' lean body mass ', ' preservation ', ' ']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,R01,2020,532756,0.042192509624213295
"Mitigating the Impact of Implicit Bias on Maternal Morbidity and Mortality for African  American Women Project Summary/Abstract African American (AA) women are 2-4 times more likely to experience pregnancy-related severe morbidity and mortality than are white mothers in the US. Half of pregnancy-related maternal mortality is judged to be preventable, but access to quality care is problematic for AA women. Implicit bias, perceived racism and culturally inappropriate interactions with health care providers have all been linked to a lack of health care utilization. The amplification of AA women's voices and the support of AA women-led solutions are critical to achieving maternal health equity. The work proposed in this 1-yr Administrative Supplement builds on the aims of the Environmental influences on Child Health Outcomes (ECHO) parent grant (UG3/UH3OD023285, Paneth Contact PI), which are to assess environmental exposures during pregnancy and the perinatal period in relation to later child health outcomes. We will enroll AA women from our Detroit ECHO site and work closely with the Atlanta ECHO pregnancy cohort (Dunlop & Brennan, UG3/UH3OD023318), which enrolls US-born Black women. The hypothesis for this study is that eliciting guidance from AA women and their health care providers through the lens of reproductive justice, respectful care, and health equity, can offer critically important information useful in improving AA women's treatment in the health care setting and their utilization and participation in health care, thereby reducing disparities in adverse maternal health outcomes. Through interviews and focus groups with AA mothers, health care providers, and community groups, the aims are to 1) identify facilitators and barriers for mitigating the impact of implicit bias and racism on AA women in the health care setting, based on input from key informants, including both AA women at risk and health care providers; and 2) develop strategies that will optimize utilization and effectiveness of healthcare services for AA mothers. This ECHO-wide study is innovative in eliciting guidance from AA women and their health care providers through the lens of reproductive justice, respectful care, and health equity and it will contribute to better understanding of ECHO's Pre, Peri, and Postnatal health outcomes. It is significant in discovering critically important information for improving AA women's treatment in health care settings that will improve participation in health care, thereby reducing disparities in adverse maternal health outcomes. The result will be the development of a toolkit of specific strategies for mothers to counter negative interactions and obtain patient centered, respectful care. The goal is to empower women by discovering mechanisms women and providers can employ to lessen the impact of unconscious or implicit bias in the health care setting and thus reduce the risk of severe morbidity and mortality. Project Narrative In the US, illness and death around the time of childbirth are much higher in African American women than white women, partly because of bias and racism experienced in the health care setting. In this study, we will ask questions and listen to answers about respectful health care practices from groups of African American mothers and their health care providers. The result will be the development of a toolkit of specific strategies for mothers to counter negative interactions and obtain patient centered, respectful care.",Mitigating the Impact of Implicit Bias on Maternal Morbidity and Mortality for African  American Women,10199204,UH3OD023285,"['Communities ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Environmental Exposure ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Goals ', ' Group Practice ', ' Health ', ' Health Personnel ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' health care worker ', ' health provider ', ' health workforce ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' medical personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' Interview ', ' Justice ', ' Maternal Health ', ' Maternal Health Services ', ' mother health care ', ' mother healthcare ', ' Maternal Mortality ', ' maternal death ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Mothers ', ' Pregnancy ', ' Gestation ', ' Pregnancy Outcome ', ' Risk ', ' Time ', ' Voice ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Afro American ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Black Populations ', ' black American ', ' African American ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' racism ', ' Link ', ' Health Care Utilization ', ' health care service use ', ' healthcare service use ', ' healthcare service utilization ', ' healthcare utilization ', ' health care service utilization ', ' postnatal ', ' experience ', ' cohort ', ' reproductive ', ' QOC ', ' Quality of Care ', ' Provider ', ' child birth ', ' Childbirth ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Administrative Supplement ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' informant ', ' Outcome ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' patient centered ', ' patient oriented ', ' parent grant ', ' lenses ', ' lens ', ' health equity ', ' maternal morbidity ', ' unconscious bias ', ' implicit bias ', ' reduce disparity ', ' disparity reduction ', ' healthcare service ', ' health care service ', ' healthcare settings ', ' health care settings ', ' Child Health ', ' perinatal phase ', ' perinatal period ', ' ']",OD,MICHIGAN STATE UNIVERSITY,UH3,2020,245534,0.13075474043391602
"Racial Disparities Associated with Maternal Exposure to Environmental Endocrine Disrupting Compounds in a Southeastern U.S. Community PROJECT SUMMARY Aims: We propose a prospective cohort study to examine fetal developmental effects from gestational exposure to endocrine disrupting environmental phenols (EPs) and phthalates (PHTs) in African American (AA) and white mothers in a southeastern U.S. obstetrical population. The focus will be on how associations of EPs with fetal developmental outcomes vary by race. We will also explore how co-exposure to both EPs and PHTs influence these associations. Significance: The proposed study will fundamentally advance our understanding of racial disparities in exposure to EPs and how these differences may contribute to reproductive health disparities between AAs and whites. We will also explore the joint effects of gestational co-exposure to a complex mixture of EPs and PHTs on fetal development. This study directly addresses significant gaps in our understanding the impact of highly prevalent EPs and PHTs on fetal development among AAs and lays the foundation for a more definitive future study of the effect of mixed endocrine disrupting exposures on reproductive health disparities. Innovation: The proposed study will be the 1st to leverage a cohort of AA and white mothers and their newborns, to directly assess health disparities in gestational exposure to a mixture of EPs and PHTs with fetal developmental outcomes. It will be one of few studies to assess the impact of mixed gestational exposure to EPs and PHTs and the 1st to capture these data in the southeastern U.S., where disparities in rates of prematurity and low birth weight between AAs and whites is the highest in the U.S. Preliminary Study: This proposal builds upon a prospective cohort study of 8 prevalent urinary PHTs that we previously measured and fetal development among AA and white mothers in Charleston, South Carolina. The results provide strong support for the approach outlined, especially in regard to differential effects by race. Approach: AA (n=152) and white (n=158) mother-infant pairs completed our study between 2011-2014. Participants provided urine and blood specimens during gestation and at delivery, had a detailed mid-gestation fetal ultrasound, completed a study questionnaire about exposure sources and consented to medical records access. We will measure 10 prevalent EPs in archived maternal urine and correlate the concentrations to birth outcomes, newborn anogenital distances and penis dimensions by mid-gestation ultrasound and at delivery. We will explore the impact of co-exposure to EPs and PHTs and how these results vary by race. Successful completion of our project is ensured by the experience of the team, who worked together to complete the previous project, and have the necessary expertise in obstetrics, reproductive endocrinology, analytic chemistry, epidemiology and biostatistical modeling. These data will be used to develop an R01 application to support a more comprehensive and mechanistic future study to address this important biomedical research gap regarding racially disparate developmental effects of fetal exposure to endocrine disrupting compounds. PROJECT NARRATIVE This study evaluates the differential effects of gestational exposure to environmental phenols (EPs) and phthalate diesters (PHTs) on fetal development in pregnant African American (n=152) and white (n=158) mothers in a southeastern U.S. obstetrical population. We will explore the joint effects of co-exposure to a mixture of two highly prevalent and well-described endocrine disrupting compounds (EPs and PHTs). The findings will help to identify modifiable risk factors contributing to ongoing reproductive health disparities between African American and white mothers, and provide preliminary data for an R01 application to support a comprehensive and mechanistic future investigation of environmental pollutant mixtures and reproductive health disparities.",Racial Disparities Associated with Maternal Exposure to Environmental Endocrine Disrupting Compounds in a Southeastern U.S. Community,10056324,R21ES031231,"['Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Archives ', ' Benzophenones ', ' Beverages ', ' Biomedical Research ', ' Biometry ', ' Biometrics ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Birth ', ' Parturition ', ' Analytical Chemistry ', ' Analytic Chemistry ', ' Communities ', ' Confounding Factors (Epidemiology) ', ' Confounding Variables ', ' Epidemiologic Confounding Factor ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Environmental Pollutants ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiologic ', ' epidemiological ', ' Exhibits ', ' Family ', ' Fetal Development ', ' Developing fetus ', ' Food ', ' Food or Food Product ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Gestational Age ', ' Chronologic Fetal Maturity ', ' Fetal Age ', ' Goals ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Economical Income ', ' Infant ', ' Low Birth Weight Infant ', ' low birth weight ', ' low birth weight infant human ', ' low birthweight ', ' Newborn Infant ', ' 0-4 weeks old ', ' Newborns ', ' newborn child ', ' newborn children ', ' Joints ', ' Life Style ', ' Lifestyle ', ' Medical Records ', ' Mothers ', ' Discipline of obstetrics ', ' Obstetrics ', ' Parabens ', ' penis ', ' Phenols ', ' Carbol ', ' Carbolic Acid ', ' Hydroxybenzene ', ' Pregnancy ', ' Gestation ', ' Second Pregnancy Trimester ', ' 2nd trimester ', ' Midtrimester ', ' Second Trimester ', ' Third Pregnancy Trimester ', ' 3rd trimester ', ' Last Trimester ', ' Third Trimester ', ' Pregnant Women ', ' expectant mother ', ' expecting mother ', ' pregnant mothers ', ' Questionnaires ', ' Race ', ' Racial Group ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Research ', ' Risk Factors ', ' South Carolina ', ' Ultrasonography ', ' Echography ', ' Echotomography ', ' Medical Ultrasound ', ' Ultrasonic Imaging ', ' Ultrasonogram ', ' Ultrasound Diagnosis ', ' Ultrasound Medical Imaging ', ' Ultrasound Test ', ' diagnostic ultrasound ', ' sonogram ', ' sonography ', ' sound measurement ', ' ultrasound ', ' ultrasound imaging ', ' ultrasound scanning ', ' Urine ', ' Urine Urinary System ', ' Work ', ' bisphenol A ', ' diphenylolpropane ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', ' Afro American ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Black Populations ', ' black American ', ' African American ', ' phthalates ', ' Prematurely delivering ', ' Preterm Birth ', ' premature childbirth ', ' premature delivery ', ' preterm delivery ', ' Premature Birth ', ' Cord Blood ', ' fetal cord blood ', ' Umbilical Cord Blood ', ' Blood Sample ', ' Blood specimen ', ' Clinical ', ' prematurity ', ' premature ', ' Ensure ', ' Reproductive Health ', ' Maternal Exposure ', ' Collaborations ', ' Exposure to ', ' environmental agent ', ' Investigation ', ' Dimensions ', ' Source ', ' Hormonal ', ' fetal ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' cohort ', ' Participant ', ' Epidemiologic Research ', ' Epidemiologic Studies ', ' Epidemiological Studies ', ' Epidemiology Research ', ' epidemiologic investigation ', ' epidemiology study ', ' Reporting ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Modeling ', ' exposed in utero ', ' fetal exposure ', ' in utero exposure ', ' intra-uterine environmental exposure ', ' intrauterine environmental exposure ', ' prenatally exposed ', ' prenatal exposure ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Complex Mixtures ', ' Address ', ' Consent ', ' Data ', ' Reproductive Endocrinology ', ' Strategic Planning ', ' Clinical Data ', ' sex ', ' urinary ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' in utero ', ' NIEHS ', ' National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences ', ' endocrine disrupting ', ' Endocrine disruption ', ' Endocrine Disrupter ', ' Endocrine Disrupting Chemicals ', ' Endocrine disrupting agent ', ' endocrine disrupting compound ', ' Endocrine Disruptors ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Psychosocial Stress ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' modifiable risk ', ' high risk ', ' pregnant ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' social health determinants ', ' disparities in race ', ' race disparity ', ' racial disparity ', ' personal care products ', ' androgenic ', ' anogenital distance ', ' study population ', ' Prospective cohort study ', ' perceived stress ', ' socio-demographics ', ' sociodemographics ', ' adverse birth outcomes ', ' ']",NIEHS,GEORGE MASON UNIVERSITY,R21,2020,297745,0.07842973613594119
"Precision Interception of Aggressive Prostate Cancer in African American Men Abstract Precision Interception of Aggressive Prostate Cancer in African American Men Prostatic adenocarcinoma (PCa) is the most frequently diagnosed non-cutaneous malignancy and a leading cause of male cancer death. African American (AA) men die from PCa at a rate more than double that of men of any other race or ethnicity. The causes of this disparity are multifactorial and certainly include unequal access to screening and treatment. Biological differences in the tumors of AA and non-AA men have also been reported that may reflect underlying tumor differences that may also affect prognosis and treatment choice. Our ability to predict and monitor PCa progression and make better treatment choices in AA men is critical to reducing dispari- ties in PCa among AA men. To address these issues, we propose a “precision interception” approach designed to impede cancer progres- sion at early stages and avoid development of lethal disease in AA PCa cases. Precision interception approach- es use knowledge of molecular signatures and other clinical and epidemiological data to interrupt PCa before it is lethal to the patient. Thus, our proposal will focus on newly diagnosed or recurrent AA PCa patients, with the goal to develop and implement tools that can “intercept” the development of castrate-resistant or metastatic PCa and death from PCa in AA men. These approaches can thereby reduce PCa-specific disparities in mortality ex- perienced by AA men.  We will use the “Men of African Descent and Carcinoma of the Prostate” (MADCaP) network that has substan- tial resources to address disparities in PCa in AA men. The team assembled here has previously collaborated to develop translational research that is led by established basic and clinical experts who have worked together to develop each concept. The result is a novel inter-disciplinary collaboration with the potential to maximize clinical impact on PCa disparities in AA men. An Administration Core and Biosample and Biomarker Core support the projects. The projects and cores integrate community engagement activities, and the Dana Farber Harvard Can- cer Center SPORE in Prostate Cancer, which itself has substantial resources for preclinical and clinical transla- tion. These resources are complemented by the MADCaP Implementation Network (MADCaP-IN) that includes community and inner city clinics that see a substantial proportion of AA PCa cases. The MADCaP-IN will serve as the centers for research participant accrual as well as centers for the implementation of current and future clinical research. We also include a Dvelopmental Research Pilot program that will focus on implementation and dissemination of our research to have maximal impact on communities. Our proposed translational research should have substantial translational/clinical impact, improve management of and outcomes, and reduce PCa disparities in AA men with PCa.

"Feasibility of the Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction Intervention for Black Women Living with HIV Project Summary/Abstract The overall objective of this Mentored Research Scientist Career Development Award is to support and develop Dr. Chapman Lambert’s transition to an independent investigator in mind and body research with a focus on developing, integrating, and testing mind and body strategies to improve clinical, psychological, and physical outcomes among African American (AA) women living with HIV (WLWH). HIV viral load (VL) suppression among AA WLWH are suboptimal when compared to women of other racial and ethnic backgrounds. Two essential self- care behaviors for people living with HIV (PLWH) to achieve and sustain HIV VL suppression ad improve health outcomes and survival are adherence to antiretroviral therapy and scheduled medical visits. Medical visit adherence is suboptimal among women in general, but VL suppression rates among AA WLWH are suboptimal with AA WLWH being nearly 3 times more likely than White WLWH not to achieve viral suppression. One important factor associated with adherence behaviors is stressful life events including traumatic life events. Thus, there is a critical need to develop culturally appropriate interventions aimed reducing stress and improving adherence behaviors and VL suppression. Mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR), developed by Jon Kabat-Zinn, has the potential to reduced stress through self-regulation of attention and awareness to stressful events. MBSR has demonstrated efficacy in improving stress management, psychological distress, physical and psychological symptoms, quality of life, and coping as well as ART adherence in predominately white and male patient populations. We propose to culturally adapt the MSBR intervention for AA WLWH to reduce stress and enhance HIV self-care behaviors and VL suppression, which has the potential to attenuate prominent racial and gender disparities experienced by AA WLWH in the US. Specifically, we aim to 1) culturally adapt the MBSR intervention for AA WLWH using ADAPT-ITT; 2) pre-pilot the adapted intervention via an open non-randomized pilot study to further refine the culturally adapted intervention; and 3) conduct a 2-armed pilot test of the behavioral intervention compared to standard of care to assess the feasibility and acceptability the adapted MBSR intervention for AA WLWH. Findings from this study will provide an important first step in establishing my program of research as an independent investigator in stress-related morbidity and HIV treatment adherence. In addition, findings maybe applicable for other chronic conditions and marginalized populations living with and without HIV. Project Narrative African American (AA) women living with HIV (WLWH)are at higher risk for experiencing stressful life events which can lead to deleterious health outcomes. Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) offers a complementary and integrative approach for reducing stress as a mechanism for improving HIV treatment adherence behaviors, HIV viral load suppression and survival. The objective of this study is to culturally adapt an existing MBSR intervention to meet the needs of AA WLWH, and assess the feasibility and acceptability of the adapted intervention among the target population.",Feasibility of the Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction Intervention for Black Women Living with HIV,9994222,K23AT010567,"['Accounting ', ' Attention ', ' Awareness ', ' Behavior ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' behavior intervention ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' Communities ', ' Critiques ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Epidemic ', ' Female ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Group Interviews ', ' Health ', ' HIV ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Interview ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' male ', ' Manuals ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methods ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Outpatients ', ' Out-patients ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Publishing ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Research ', ' Research Design ', ' Study Type ', ' study design ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Self Care ', ' personal care ', ' Informal Social Control ', ' Self Regulation ', ' Stress ', ' Stressful Event ', ' Suggestion ', ' Target Populations ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Gender ', ' Afro American ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Black Populations ', ' black American ', ' African American ', ' Research Methods ', ' Research Methodology ', ' Schedule ', ' Caring ', ' stress buffering ', ' stress management ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' psychological ', ' psychologic ', ' Survivors ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Failure ', ' Logistics ', ' satisfaction ', ' Attenuated ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Viral Burden ', ' Viral Load ', ' Viral Load result ', ' Scientist ', ' Event ', ' Clinic ', ' Health behavior outcomes ', ' Viral ', ' Visit ', ' experience ', ' Participant ', ' behavioral test ', ' behavior test ', ' Reporting ', ' psychological distress ', ' Sampling ', ' career development ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' HIV diagnosis ', ' therapy adherence ', ' Length ', ' Adherence ', ' Data ', ' Mind Research ', ' Mind/Body Research ', ' mind-body research ', ' mind/body method ', ' Mind-Body Method ', ' randomisation ', ' randomization ', ' randomly assigned ', ' Randomized ', ' Career Development Awards ', ' Career Development Awards and Programs ', ' Career Development Programs K-Series ', ' K-Awards ', ' Research Career Program ', ' K-Series Research Career Programs ', ' Conduct Clinical Trials ', ' Process ', ' manage symptom ', ' symptom management ', ' anti-retroviral therapy ', ' anti-retroviral treatment ', ' antiretroviral treatment ', ' antiretroviral therapy ', ' Interpersonal Violence ', ' data integration ', ' intervention efficacy ', ' therapeutic efficacy ', ' therapeutically effective ', ' therapy efficacy ', ' Treatment Efficacy ', ' efficacy trial ', ' Outcome ', ' coping ', ' Population ', ' Mind ', ' Trauma ', ' mindfulness-based stress reduction ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' develop therapy ', ' intervention development ', ' treatment development ', ' therapy development ', ' high risk ', ' patient population ', ' standard of care ', ' usual care ', ' treatment as usual ', ' treatment adherence ', ' data format ', ' arm ', ' disparities in race ', ' race disparity ', ' racial disparity ', ' Breast Cancer survivor ', ' gender disparity ', ' psychological symptom ', ' physical symptom ', ' recruit ', ' primary care provider ', ' care providers ', ' stress reduction ', ' visit adherence ', ' behavior adherence ', ' behavioral adherence ', ' adherence rate ', ' compare intervention ', ' comparison intervention ', ' ']",NCCIH,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,K23,2020,136449,0.059138923237935355
"Racial/Ethnic Disparities in Ovarian Cancer Treatment and Survival: An Integrative Approach ABSTRACT  Epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) is the fifth leading cause of cancer deaths in women. Compared to non- Hispanic white (NHW) women, African American (AA) women have much poorer survival after an EOC diagnosis, which, as we have found, may be in part due to AA women being less likely to receive standard-of- care therapy, and more likely to have chemotherapy dose reduction, even within an equal-access healthcare system. However, these factors do not completely explain survival disparities among AAs, and furthermore, little is known about other groups (e.g., Hispanics and Asians/Pacific Islanders (API)), although there is some evidence that Hispanic women also experience worse survival. Moreover, emerging evidence suggests racial differences in molecular subtype distribution. We propose to conduct the first integrative, cells-to-society evaluation of the interplay among multilevel factors on disparities in EOC treatment and survival outcomes.  We will assemble a cohort of ~4,600 EOC cases, including ~280 AA, ~520 Hispanic, ~730 API, and ~2,980 NHW women diagnosed at Kaiser Permanente Northern California (KPNC) between 2000 and 2023. KPNC has longstanding electronic clinical databases, complete pathology specimen storage, long-term retention of members, and substantial variability in sociodemographic, clinical, and neighborhood characteristics among races/ethnicities. We will perform centralized pathology review to classify histotypes by the recent gold standard WHO criteria, and will conduct chart review to capture data that are not available electronically. We will examine determinants of racial/ethnic differences in treatment received, recurrence, and survival (overall and EOC-specific), including neighborhood social stressors through linkage to data on segregation, structural racism, ethnic enclaves, and geographic medical accessibility, health care system and patient-level factors. In 800 women (200 each of NHW, AA, Hispanic, and API) with high grade serous EOC, we will also characterize gene expression subtypes (to date studied almost exclusively in NHW women), to identify whether the relative distribution of aggressive subtypes contributes to the observed survival disparities. We will examine these factors in the context of both self-reported race/ethnicity and genetic ancestry.  Our comprehensive integrative approach to examine the interplay among patient, health care, social contextual, and biological factors will provide unique insights into the persistent racial disparities in EOC survival. The KPNC setting provides the opportunity to examine these factors while minimizing confounding by the known contribution of insurance status, leveraging rich clinical databases to investigate and control for detailed prognostic variables, and avoiding survival bias. For EOC, this proposed study is unprecedented in its transdisciplinary nature, sample size, and multi-ethnic population, and will serve as a unique resource for future research related to multilevel factors to reduce EOC survival disparities. PROJECT NARRATIVE Ovarian cancer is a deadly disease, but survival varies widely by race/ethnicity. We propose to examine whether differences in neighborhood characteristics, patient and clinical factors including receipt of recommended treatments, or molecular features of the tumors can account for these disparities, at least in part. Ovarian cancer is understudied in diverse populations, and the proposed work is one of the largest to search for potentially modifiable factors that can reduce disparities in survival.",Racial/Ethnic

"IBD Gene Mapping by Clinical and Population Subset PROJECT SUMMARY Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) are complex genetic disorders of the gastrointestinal tract, and a major health burden to patients and society. Tremendous progress has been made in dissecting IBD genetic etiology with identification of over 200 IBD loci by genome wide association studies (GWAS) but mainly limited to persons of European ancestry. The IBD Genetics Consortium (IBDGC) was established to facilitate multicenter collaborative studies of 6 Genetics Research Centers (GRCs) organized with a Data Coordinating Center (DCC). Our GRC at Johns Hopkins (JHGRC) has contributed to all IBDGC studies, meeting recruitment objectives and taking roles in IBDGC leadership positions. Our particular focus is on African American (AA) IBD genetics. We performed the first large-scale evaluation of European loci in the AA population, replicating several genes, but also finding unique African-ancestral variants within these loci, as well as identified multiple admixture significant loci. We also published the first AA IBD genome-wide association study (GWAS), a collaborative effort that identified two African-specific gene loci, and replicated multiple additional European loci. We have also explored why some loci with proven risk variants in Europeans and other populations only cause disease in one ancestral population but not others. More research in AA IBD is needed to understand the etiology of IBD in this ancestrally distinct, major American population. In this application we will re-evaluate the AA GWAS by better imputation, evaluate whole genome sequencing data to test low frequency and rare variants, and perform an evaluation for chromosome X variants. We will recruit a large number of AA IBD patients through our own and multiple Satellite Recruitment Centers to power a second AA IBD GWAS, both UC and CD, and meta-analyze with the first to identify more novel loci, identify more African specific risk variants, and replicate known loci for this population and replicate our admixture loci. We will also incorporate diverse data sources to incorporate into our GWAS analyses including RNA-Seq currently being generated on lymophoblastoid cell lines from AA CD cases and controls, and RNA-Seq that we will generate in colonic biopsies from UC cases and controls. We will evaluate chromatin differences and expression of genes in cell types relevant to IBD from European, AA and East Asian ancestries in an effort to better understand locus heterogeneity by ancestry. We will continue to participate in all IBDGC activities to maximize the Impact of IBD genetics research by this cooperative funding mechanism. According to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention, an estimated 1.4 million Americans suffer from Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD), a chronic debilitating disorder with no cure that includes Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. IBD ranks in the top 5 in prevalence for gastrointestinal disorders and represents a significant financial burden to society requiring a lifetime of medical care. This proposed research aims to determine the genetic variations that cause IBD which will aid in developing preventive measures, improving the quality of care with better treatments and educating patients through genetic counseling.",IBD Gene Mapping by Clinical and Population Subset,10001511,U01DK062431,"['Algorithms ', ' Biopsy ', ' Cell Line ', ' CellLine ', ' Strains Cell Lines ', '

"The Impact of the Intrauterine and Early Childhood Environments on Neurocognitive and Metabolic Development in African American Youth: Focus on the Gut-Brain Axis PROJECT ABSTRACT  Environmental exposures during the critical prenatal and early childhood periods can result in lifelong health consequences. Mechanisms underlying these exposure-health relationships are complex, with exogenous exposures (such as chemical toxicants, infectious agents, diet) and endogenous processes (such as gene expression, inflammation and oxidative stress) activating metabolic pathways that lead to adverse health outcomes. Both adverse exposures and their health consequences disproportionately impact African American (AA) women and children, highlighting that health disparities begin in utero and are amplified postnatally. Among outcomes disproportionately experienced by AA children are preterm birth, neurodevelopmental deficits, and obesity – all linked to environmental exposures, yet poorly understood due to their etiologic complexity. Our team is currently investigating preterm birth and neurodevelopment through 18-months in relation to pre- and postnatal exposures to environmental toxicants and biopsychosocial risk factors in cohorts of pregnant AA women (R01NR014800, R01MD009064) and their infants (R01MD009746) and via our P50 Children's Center (P50ES026071) in collaboration with the Emory HERCULES Exposome Research Center (P30 ES019776).  Through ECHO, we propose to elucidate exposures and risk pathways that contribute to neurodevelopmental deficits and obesity in preschool aged AA children by: (1) Assembling an Atlanta ECHO cohort of ~440 AA socioeconomically diverse mother-child pairs by combining extant cohorts for whom the prenatal, perinatal, and early childhood environments are, or will be, characterized; (2) Completing the analysis and synthesis of data from the Atlanta ECHO cohort to characterize mother-child pairs in terms of prenatal and early childhood exposures (toxicants, stressors and neuroendocrine-immune activation, nutritional and metabolic status, microbiome and infections, bonding and interaction); epigenetic and metabolomic profiles; and perinatal outcomes (gestational age, size-for-gestation); (3) Testing cohort-specific hypotheses related to prenatal and early childhood exposures and neurodevelopmental outcomes and obesity in AA children at 2, 3, 4, and 5 years of age; (4) Participating in ECHO-wide consortium studies to identify risk and protective factors that moderate associations between environmental exposures, typical growth and development, and adverse child health outcomes. Our cohort's participation in the ECHO consortium will contribute to a biopsychosocial understanding of within- and between-race risk for adverse child health outcomes, providing insight into risk and protective factors relevant to AA families. The proposed research is consistent with frameworks for eliminating racial disparities, which recognize the need to study risks within-race as a vital first step, and is congruent with the National Institute of Minority Health and Health Disparities goal of promoting understanding of the biological mechanisms involved in conditions that disproportionately affect health disparity populations. PROJECT NARRATIVE Both adverse environmental exposures and their health consequences disproportionately impact African American (AA) women and children, highlighting that health disparities begin in utero and are amplified postnatally. AA children are more likely to experience preterm birth, neurodevelopmental deficits, and obesity – all linked to environmental exposures, yet poorly understood due to their etiologic complexity.

"A nutrition-based approach to reduce heart disease risk among overweight African Americans: Use of soul food plant-based or omnivorous diets to address cardiovascular disease African Americans (AAs) are disproportionately affected by cardiovascular disease (CVD), having the highest death rates from CVD as compared with other racial/ethnic groups. In addition, AAs have the highest rates of obesity as compared to whites and Hispanics. People following plant-based dietary approaches, particularly vegan or vegetarian diets, have lower risks of CVD and lower body weights than omnivores. Vegan and vegetarian diets have been used effectively for weight loss and maintenance and for reversing CVD. Although intervention trials have shown a significant weight-loss and cholesterol-lowering effect of adoption of plant-based diets, t o date, most of these large randomized trials have had limited participation from AA participants. AAs tend to lose less weight during behavioral interventions than their white counterparts. In addition, most research has shown that AAs are more likely to discontinue participation in behavioral dietary interventions. This combination of higher attrition and lower weight loss may be due to a failure to address issues that are culturally relevant to the AA population. Our recent 6-month trial examined the use of a vegan diet as compared to 4 other plant-based dietary approaches (vegetarian, pesco-vegetarian, semi-vegetarian, or omnivorous). Weight loss among AAs in the vegan diet was significantly greater (-8.5±3.3%, n=3) than AAs randomized to diet approaches that will be similar to the omnivorous approach in our proposed study (semi- vegetarian/omnivorous groups, 1.4±1.8%, n=3). Of the 12 AA participants who began the study, only one did not complete the study (8% attrition rate) compared to 12 out of the 49 white participants (24% attrition). In total, these results point to the potential of an entirely plant-based dietary intervention to overcome two barriers encountered in previous studies aiming to improve dietary intake and weight loss among overweight AAs for CVD prevention: low weight loss results and high attrition rates.  The goal of this proposed study is to apply these findings in a CVD prevention intervention specifically for AAs living in the southeast U.S. We have developed a partnership with the owners of two soul food restaurants in Columbia, SC (one vegan, the other traditional).These restaurants, which focus on southern cuisine, are owned and operated by local AA families, and will assist with developing culturally-appropriate recipes for our intervention. W e will conduct a two-year dietary trial among overweight AA adults (N=130) randomized to follow one of two diets both emphasizing southern food culture and low-glycemic index and low-fat foods: Vegan or Omnivorous (omni) diet. This study will compare the impact of these diet patterns on changes in CVD risk factors, including LDL cholesterol and blood pressure, and body weight. If this intervention proves to be successful at reducing weight and CVD risk factors among AAs, it has the potential to be disseminated through a variety of locations throughout the US, including restaurants, federally qualified health clinics, churches, or neighborhood community centers. Our proposed project will examine the effect of adopting two different dietary patterns (vegan and omnivorous), which focus on southern cuisine, on both cardiovascular disease risk factors and weight loss among overweight African American adults.

"The Role of The Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System, ARMC5, and Neprilysin in Glucose Metabolism among African Americans PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Joshua J. Joseph, MD, is an Assistant Professor in the Division of Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism at The Ohio State University. Dr. Joseph seeks a Mentored Patient- Oriented Research Career Development Award in order to obtain the skills, knowledge, and mentored research experience that are essential for a career as a clinician scientist in the field of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) prevention. This proposal is aimed at determining the role of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) in glucose metabolism and the development of T2DM among African Americans (AAs). AAs are 1.7 times as likely to develop T2DM in the US and are twice as likely to die from T2DM compared to non-Hispanic whites. Thus, this represents an area of critical need. The objectives of this proposal are to determine the role of the RAAS, endothelin-1, ARMC5 (armadillo repeat containing 5) and RAAS antagonism in glucose metabolism and the development of diabetes. The specific aims of this research proposal are: (1) to determine the associations of aldosterone and endothelin-1, individually and combined, with HOMA-insulin resistance, HOMA-β cell function, fasting plasma glucose and incident T2DM among AAs without T2DM at baseline in the Jackson Heart Study (JHS); (2) to determine a) the cross-sectional associations of predicted damaging ARMC5 mutations with plasma aldosterone, plasma renin activity, fasting glucose, and prevalent T2DM and b) the longitudinal association with incident T2DM among AAs in the JHS; (3) to determine the impact of RAAS antagonism or RAAS and neprilysin antagonism vs. placebo with changes in glucose metabolism over 6 months assessed via glucose clamp studies among AAs. For Aim 1, we propose predictive epidemiological analyses in the JHS, an observational investigation of cardiovascular disease among AAs, to determine the association of a combination of aldosterone and endothelin-1 with glucose metabolism, prevalent and incident T2DM. For Aim 2, we propose genetic analyses in the JHS, to determine the association of ARMC5 genetic variants with components of glucose metabolism, prevalent and incident T2DM. For Aim 3, we propose a 26- week clinical trial to test the effect of RAAS antagonism on β-cell function and insulin resistance in AAs with impaired glucose tolerance. The goals during the award period include developing expertise in the design, performance, analysis and presentation of clinical research through mentored research, didactic coursework, and formal training in clinical investigation of glucose metabolism, clinical trial methodology, genetic, genomic and other –omic analytic techniques and predictive/causal modeling. Long-term career goals include developing a career as an independent investigator focused on finding new approaches for preventing and treating T2DM, particularly among historically understudied populations in biomedical research. The proposed research aims to provide new insights into the contribution of the RAAS to changes in glucose metabolism in the development of T2DM. This work will lay the foundation to develop novel therapeutic targets for T2DM. PROJECT NARRATIVE African Americans have a higher prevalence, incidence and mortality from type 2 diabetes mellitus compared to non-Hispanic whites. The proposed research aims to investigate the role of the renin-angiotensin- aldosterone system in glucose metabolism and the development of type 2 diabetes among African Americans. This work will inform efforts to find new therapeutic targets for type 2 diabetes prevention to reduce racial/ethnic disparities in type 2 diabetes.","The Role of The Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone

"African Ancestry Genomic Psychiatry Cohort Project Summary  We propose a 5-year renewal of our African Ancestry-Genomic Psychiatry Cohort (AA-GPC) R01- MH104964. AA and other minority populations have been poorly represented in large-scale genomic studies, and yet these populations (i) have the largest disparities in health care and outcomes, and (ii) have the potential to broaden our knowledge of human genetics. In particular, AA genomes have nearly a million more variants per individual and are characterized by shorter haplotype blocks than European ancestry (EA) populations. As a consequence, genetic polymorphisms that are in perfect linkage disequilibrium (LD) in Europeans are broken-up by recombination events in AA genomes, allowing the contributions of smaller genomic intervals comprised of fewer variants to be assessed independently.  Progress to date: During the initial funding period we will have enrolled and assessed ~10,000 new AA participants and have already completed 8,000 AA whole genome sequences (WGS). We recently demonstrated that among the 128 associated SNPs identified in the PGC-2 schizophrenia analysis, 41 increased in significance when combined with data from 10,000 AA-GPC participants, and for 12 of these regions, there was a reduction in the number of SNPs in the associated interval. In addition, this trans-ancestry meta-analysis of PGC-2 schizophrenia and AA-GPC results yielded 10 newly genome-wide significant loci. Similarly, the trans-ancestry meta-analysis results yielded the best polygenic risk score “training” dataset, explaining more variance in individuals of European and African ancestry, than scores based on either ancestry alone.  In Phase 1 of this renewal: we will study genome-wide common variation in our existing AA-GPC and VA-CS#572 combined cohort of 36,322 AA participants. In Phase 2, we will perform an expanded analysis by adding 5,000 new participants ascertained in this project, 27,500 additional controls from the VA, and 34,000 cases and controls from the NeuroGap-Psychosis study (NeuroPsychiatric Genetics in African Populations; PI. Koenen). This meta-analysis will include over 100,000 AA participants, a sample of non-Caucasians with the potential for significant novel discovery.

"African American Families Fighting Parental Cancer Together ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  In 2015, an estimated 340,000 parents of school age children will be newly diagnosed with cancer in the U.S. Parental cancer causes significant emotional distress in both diagnosed parents and children. African American (AA) adults experience a disproportionate burden of solid tumor cancers (e.g., breast, prostate, lung, and colon) which puts AA adolescents, a vulnerable population to begin with, at high risk for parental cancer related distress. Treatments have been somewhat successful for younger school age children (ages 7-12) of cancer patients but most treatment studies have included white middle class samples. Differences in attitudes, daily functioning and levels of distress among different ethnic and racial groups are well-documented, yet few culturally sensitive family intervention programs have been developed for AA families coping with cancer. Building on the PI's previous studies with AA families coping with parental cancer, we propose to conduct a randomized control trial to address this gap. We will of a culturally sensitive family-based intervention that targets the parent child relationship in AA families coping with the impact of solid tumor parental cancer. We will randomize 172 AA families coping with parental cancer to either Families Fighting Cancer Together (FFCT) or to parent psycho-education (TAU). Both manualized treatments include 5 bi-monthly sessions over 10 weeks. Subjects will be African American parents diagnosed for the first time in the past 12 months with Stage I, II, or III solid tumor cancers with at least one child between the ages of 12 and 18 living at home. Patients will be recruited from 3 large inner city cancer centers where there is an estimated 500 eligible low to middle income AA cancer patients a year. Family assessments will be done at baseline, post-treatment (10 weeks), 6-month, and 12-month follow-up. The proposed R01 research has the following aims: Aim 1: Compare the efficacy of FFCT to TAU in reducing depressive symptoms (CDI) and anxiety (RCMAS) in AA adolescents at post-treatment and long term outcome (6 and 12-month follow-up). Aim 2: Compare the efficacy of FFCT to TAU in reducing parental stress (PCQ: impact of illness on child/concerns about parenting) in AA parents at post-treatment and long term outcome (6 and 12-month follow-up). Exploratory Aims: 1. Explore whether moderators identified in Caucasian samples have a similar impact on treatment in AA samples. Specifically, we will examine: a) perceived level of group support, b) gender and age of adolescent, c) parent's marital status, d) SES, and e) stage of parent's cancer on the impact of treatment. 2. Explore whether changes in parent-child attachment and communication mediate the association between treatment and depressive symptoms (CDI) and anxiety (RCMAS) at 6 and12-month follow-up. Treatments to help adolescents cope with the impact of parental cancer are urgently needed, particularly those designed to reach low-income AA populations. Developing effective and transportable family-based interventions for this population could improve developmental adjustment to this significant life stressor at a critical point in the livesof adolescents. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  This project directly addresses cancer health disparities, which is relevant to NCI's mission.

"Racial Disparity in Bladder Cancer and Identification of Altered Metabolism in African American Compare to European Bladder Cancer Project Summary/Abstract It has known that bladder cancer (BCa) mortality is higher in African American patients. Disparity exists between African-American (AA) and European-American (EA), in the clinical outcome of BCa. The long-term objective of our research plan is to reduce the disproportionate effects of bladder cancer (BCa) on African American. A guiding principle of our methodology is that alterations in mitochondrial metabolites exist between African American and European American BCa and that these differences can explain, in part, BCa health disparity. In this application, we propose to use the technique of metabolomic profiling to uncover these underlying differences. To date, a metabolomic analyses aimed at understanding of bladder cancer health disparity has not been reported. We have recently published the first study describing metabolic alterations associated with bladder cancer. In preliminary studies, we have profiled the metabolome of BCa from AA and EA patients and identified a distinct AA race-specific expression pattern in mitochondrial metabolites and lipids. In this proposal, we will i) characterize the mitochondrial associated metabolites in AA and EA BCa, ii) verify the D-2HG and associated enzymes (GLS, ADHFE1, and IDH1/2) in BCa patients and establish a therapeutically targeted deregulation pathway for glutamine metabolism in AA BCa iii) assess the levels of lyso PC and PC and the function of their metabolizing enzymes PLA1A and LRAT in AA BCa. The successful completion of the proposed studies will have a significant impact in the field of Bladder cancer health disparity and metabolism. Importantly, findings from our study have the potential to reveal racially exclusive metabolic markers and therapeutic targets for BCa. Taken together, the information gleaned from this proposal could rapidly revolutionize current diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutic approaches by revealing the biological underpinnings of bladder cancer health disparity. Project Narrative This proposal expects to develop a panel of mitochondrial metabolic markers in tissues and urine. The study is supported by a seminal publication highlighting the ability of the PI to develop urine-based metabolic markers for bladder cancer smoker by: 1. utilizing urine based metabolites as non-invasive biomarkers; and, 2. developing race associated perturbed metabolic pathways specific to bladder cancer that could be further harnessed to develop better treatment strategies or combinatorial therapy with the existing drugs. Overall, this proposal is expected to delineate 2-Hydroxy glutaric acid, glutamine metabolism, and associated mitocondrial metabolites with AA BCa and develop a first-generation panel of metabolic markers in urine of AA BCa patients.",Racial Disparity in Bladder Cancer and Identification of Altered Metabolism in African American Compare to European Bladder Cancer,9928029,R01CA220297,"['Accounting ', ' Acetylation ', ' Acetyltransferase ', ' Alcohol dehydrogenase ', ' Alcohol-NAD+ Oxidoreductase ', ' inhibitor/antagonist ', ' inhibitor ', ' Aspartic Acid ', ' L-Aspartic Acid ', ' Bioenergetics ', ' Biological Factors ', ' Biologic Factor ', ' Malignant neoplasm of urinary bladder ', ' Bladder Cancer ', ' Malignant Bladder Neoplasm ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Bladder ', ' Urinary Bladder Cancer ', ' Urinary Bladder Malignant Tumor ', ' Cystectomy ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Enzymes ', ' Enzyme Gene ', ' Genes ', ' Glioma ', ' Glial Cell Tumors ', ' Glial Neoplasm ', ' Glial Tumor ', ' Neuroglial Neoplasm ', ' Neuroglial Tumor ', ' glial-derived tumor ', ' neuroglia neoplasm ', ' neuroglia tumor ', ' Glutaminase ', ' Breast Cell Glutaminase ', ' EC 3.5.1.2 ', ' GA Protein ', ' L glutamine amidohydrolase ', ' Liver Glutaminase ', ' Glutamine ', ' Gln ', ' L-Glutamine ', ' Q Levoglutamide ', ' Q.

The proposed research includes three aims: 1) develop a prototype faith-based home activity toolkit (Faith-HAT) for AA families living with moderate and severe ADRD; 2) test the feasibility and explore preliminary effectiveness of employing Faith-HAT; and 3) construct a refined toolkit of meaningful faith-based home activities. Georgia State University offers an ideal research environment for the proposed research and training. Study recruitment, retention, and execution will be conducted in collaboration with Emory University Alzheimer’s Disease and Research Center Minority Engagement Core and an Atlanta-based Ministerial Alliance. The proposed research will advance ADRD support by providing AA families with a nonpharmacological intervention and meaningful activities to promote quality of life. This K23 award will give Dr. Epps essential practical experience in the conduct of program development and implementation research, as she will be mentored in developing and implementing a clinical feasibility trial to examine the effect of a home-based religious program on the well-being of AA families affected by ADRD. At the conclusion of this award, the candidate will have obtained the skills, knowledge, and preliminary data to successfully become a full-fledged independent investigator improving the health and well- being of persons with ADRD and their caregivers. Project Narrative Religious practices and activities are essential components of quality of life for African American (AA) older adults living with Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD). Due to the dementia-related health and healthcare disparities that continue to plague minority communities, it is important to investigate ways to support AA adults living with dementia in their home through engagement in activities that are meaningful to them. This study aims to provide AA families with a meaningful home-based religious program that can lessen behavioral symptoms associated with ADRD and improve psychological and physical well-being for family caregivers.",Creating a Faith-Based Toolbox for African Americans Living with Moderate and Severe Dementia,9870428,K23AG065452,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', '

"HSET as a racial disparity biomarker for TNBC patients ABSTRACT! African ancestry is a risk factor for worse outcomes in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). Nevertheless, prognostic tools and treatment regimens are no different for African American (AA) than European American (EA) TNBC patients. Personalizing medicine for AA TNBC patients has been hindered by the fact that this population is highly admixed, so self-reported race often does not accurately reflect African genetic ancestry. There is also a dearth of studies that have analyzed tumor biomarkers and clinical outcomes using ancestry- genotyped TNBC specimens. Furthermore, few preclinical TNBC studies consider race in experimental design, and AA TNBC patients are markedly underrepresented in clinical trials. A critical barrier to progress in improving outcomes for AA TNBC patients is a lack of prognostic tools and treatment modalities that have been precisely tailored to this patient population. The broad, long-range goal of this project is to enable development of precision medicine for AA TNBC patients by advancing knowledge of the utility of nuclear HSET (nHSET) as a prognostic biomarker for AA TNBCs as well as the molecular mechanisms of racial disparities in TNBC aggressiveness and how they can be targeted. Our lab has uncovered that HSET more strongly promotes proliferation and migration of AA than EA TNBC cell lines. In addition, nHSET independently predicts poor outcomes in AA but not EA TNBCs, but this must be validated after accounting for percent African genetic ancestry in multivariable survival models and in native African TNBCs. Our proposed project has three aims. First, the proportion of African genetic ancestry will be determined for a large cohort of TNBC patient samples acquired from US, and Nigeria and we will determine if nHSET can serve as a racial disparity biomarker for the stratification of TNBCs after adjusting for their percent African genetic ancestry. Second, since HSET and MYH9 are nuclear binding partners that may assist in chromatin modification to amplify oncogenic Wnt/β-catenin signaling and MYC expression (which we have found is enriched in AA compared with EA TNBCs), we will characterize racial differences in the HSET-MYH9-MYC axis in TNBCs using patient-derived samples and correlate these racial distinctions to differences in genomic stability in TNBCs. We will employ multi-colored lenti- CRISPR-Cas9 system for knocking out key genes in this axis in AA/EA cell lines to test if the HSET-MYH9-MYC axis drives tumor aggressiveness more strongly in AA than in EA TNBCs. In Aim 3, the value of a promising commercially available HSET inhibitor will be tested in xenograft models of AA and EA TNBC patient-derived cells. Thus, this study will test the hypothesis that nHSET is a novel therapeutically actionable biomarker with greater value for AA than EA TNBC patients that drives TNBC progression and chemoresistance more strongly in AA than EA TNBC patients. The impact of this project will be to advance knowledge of prognostic biomarkers, molecular mechanisms of disease aggressiveness, and effective treatment regimens for AA TNBC patients. ! Project Narrative! The proposed research aims to customize treatment and thereby improve clinical outcomes for African American (AA) patients with an aggressive type of breast cancer to which they are predisposed called triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). This project will advance knowledge about how to customize treatment for AA TNBC patients by validating whether a novel protein biomarker, nuclear HSET, can better predict risk of poor clinical outcomes in AA than European American (EA) TNBC patients after accounting for factors that could confound analyses (like African genetic ancestry); how nuclear HSET may drive more aggressive tumor biology in TNBCs from AAs than EAs; and the potential clinical benefit of targeting nuclear HSET as an adjuvant to chemotherapy in AA and EA TNBCs.",HSET as a racial disparity biomarker for TNBC

"MicroRNAs in African American Prostate Cancer ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Prostate cancer (PCa) is the most common cancer in men in the United States, which disproportionately affects African Americans (AA) with higher incidence, advanced disease and worse prognosis. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are non-coding RNAs that represent universal gene regulatory mechanism exerting its effect primarily by binding to 3'UTR of target and affect cell survival, proliferation, cancer initiation, development and metastasis. We recently reported differential expression of miRNAs in PCa tissues and body fluids. In this proposal, we present preliminary data on selected two miRNAs that are downregulated in age/disease matched African American (AA) when compared with Caucasian (CA) PCa tissues. We present preliminary data on modulation cancer cell growth, migration, anoikis, angiogenesis and modulation of EMT signaling. We have preliminarily identified several miRNA targets that may explain miRNA mechanisms in PCa progression. We report miRNA modulation of JNK1-Sp1 signaling which is known to modulate angiogenesis and metastasis. We hypothesize that differential loss of selected microRNAs in AA PCa deregulates an intricate signaling network, leading to aggressive phenotype. Further these miRNAs could be used as biomarkers to distinguish between indolent vs. aggressive disease (predominant in AAs) and serve as novel therapeutic targets. The specific aims of this proposal are: (1) to study the clinical significance of microRNAs and their targets in age/race matched PCa tissues and their adjacent benign regions and disease staged PCa TMAs; (2) to validate miRNA targets and delineate signaling mechanisms by generating miRNA gene deletions in AA and CA prostate cells by genome editing using [Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR associated (CAS) nuclease Cas9); (3) Investigate the role of microRNAs in experimental prostate carcinogenesis in vitro and in vivo by studying their gain and loss of function in AA and CA prostate cancer cells and in vivo by examining the effects on tumor growth and metastasis in an orthotopic mouse model. Recognizing miRNAs as basis of PCa pathogenesis, disparity and understanding their biological implications will significantly impact diagnosis and treatment development for aggressive PCa common in African American men. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposal will characterize selected microRNAs that are downregulated in African American (AA) prostate cancer (PCa) tissues when compared with Caucasian (CA) PCa. Their characterization will provide basic mechanistic insights into their role in prostate carcinogenesis, as biomarker and therapeutic targets. In the long term, these studies could have significant public health consequences, as involvement of these miRNAs in AA PCa will support their development as molecular targets and biomarkers for early detection, prevention and treatment of aggressive PCa common in AA men.",MicroRNAs in African American Prostate Cancer,9904536,U01CA194730,"['Role ', ' social role ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell

"Consequences and mechanism of aberrant splicing in African American prostate cancer disparities Summary There are striking population (race) disparities in prostate cancer (PCa) risk and survival outcome borne out of current health statistics. This is particularly evident between African American (AA) patients and their European American (EA) counterparts, where AAs exhibit a 1.5 to 2 fold higher risk of PCa incidence and mortality. We demonstrate that differential alternative RNA splicing takes place for oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes in PCa specimens of AA compared to EA patients. The differential splicing events result in the enrichment and in many instances generation of AA-specific splice variants not observed in EA cancers. We have cloned the AA and EA splice variant cDNAs for both phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase catalytic subunit delta (PIK3CD) and fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3), and ectopically introduced the clones individually into PCa cell lines. Compared to the EA variant-expressing lines, the AA variant-expressing lines are more oncogenic in in vitro cell proliferation and invasion assays, and exhibit greater tumor growth/metastasis and resistance to small molecule targeted therapy in xenograft mouse models. These findings may explain, in part, the observed cancer health disparities in the AA population relative to other racial groups. The mechanism responsible for the formation of AA-specific or -enriched mRNA splice variants are hypothesized to be due to the dysregulated expression of 6 key splicing factor s in AA PCa specimens. We refer to this dysregulation and associated production of AA-specific splice variants as an “AA splicing factor code in PCa disparities.” Notwithstanding these developments, a number of questions remain unresolved. First, what is the mechanism(s) of dysregulated expression of the 6 splicing factors? Second, can the production of AA-specific splice variants via exon skipping be directly attributed to the 6 dysregulated splicing factors? Lastly, how do the encoded proteins of the AA-specific short variants of PIK3CD and FGFR3 mediate a more oncogenic phenotype in PCa cells? The objectives of this application are to address these questions, and to provide a mechanistic framework of population-related differences in alternative RNA splicing, which is anticipated to facilitate future identification of druggable targets (e.g. splicing factors and/or resulting splice variant proteins) of AA tumor phenotype and disparities. Narrative African American (AA) prostate cancers express unique mRNA variants not found in European American (EA) cancers, which we hypothesize are responsible in part for the more aggressive nature of the disease and poorer prognosis in the AA population. Our underlying premise is that multiple key RNA splicing factors are uniquely dysregulated in AA prostate cancer, leading to the formation of these AA-specific mRNA variants that encode more oncogenic versions of signal transducing proteins. Our study is expected to identify the molecular mechanism(s) driving dysregulated splicing factor expression, define the cis-acting RNA sequence elements essential for the production of the AA-specific mRNA variants, and characterize protein isoform function encoded by the AA-specific variants, which may serve as future treatment options in cancer health disparities.",Consequences and

"Addressing racial disparities in monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance and progression to multiple myeloma from a prevention perspective PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Multiple myeloma (MM) is a lethal neoplasm and a common hematologic malignancy. MM is uniformly preceded by monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS). Unlike MM, patients with MGUS are asymptomatic. The current management for MGUS is watchful waiting for disease progression. A marked racial disparity in this disease area is long-established with a 2 to 3-fold increased risk in African Americans (AAs) compared to Caucasians. Moreover, obesity is a risk factor for MM independent of race. Obesity is prevalent in U.S. adults, and particularly more prevalent among AAs than Caucasians. As a result, without any intervention, racial disparities in this disease will continue to worsen. Metformin, a widely-used, safe, well- tolerated, and inexpensive medication, induces weight loss and has been found to be more effective in glycemic control in AAs compared to Caucasians. It has also been used in prospective trials for non-diabetes indications and solid tumor malignancies. We therefore hypothesize that metformin use in MGUS patients will prevent MM and reduce MM disparities. This project plans to focus on the precursor condition of MM – MGUS. The findings from the proposed project will inform biological mechanism studies and MGUS/MM prevention trials. The long-term goal is to identify intervention strategies to prevent the progression of MGUS to MM, reduce the overall burden of MM, and reduce MM disparities. We plan to identify whether high body mass index (BMI) and/or significant change in BMI over the life course are risk factors for MGUS by race (Aim 1), utilizing linked databases with nearly lifelong follow-up of BMI and other health measures ,as well as utilizing artificial intelligence, i.e., machine learning approaches, to perform big data analyses. We will then assess racial differences in the M-protein trajectory after MGUS diagnosis in metformin versus non-metformin users in a subgroup of MGUS patients diagnosed with diabetes mellitus (Aim 2.1) and the association of metformin use with the progression of MGUS to MM (Aim 2.2). Last, we will assess racial differences in the M-protein trajectory in the subgroup of MGUS patients without diabetes mellitus (Aim 3). This project is significant in its capability to 1) identify perhaps the only modifiable risk factor (high BMI) to inform interventions to prevent MM; 2) identify a dynamic marker for disease progression by race (M-protein concentration), where these biomarkers can be a surrogate for MM diagnosis in future prevention trials; and 3) reduce MM health disparities by a) identifying race-specific biomarkers for MGUS and MGUS progression, available through clinical encounters (as opposed to expensive genetic testing); and b) exploring metformin use as a chemopreventive measure. It is innovative in its 1) focus on MM prevention rather than treatment and 2) utilization of artificial intelligence to analyze big data. Successful completion of this study will provide evidence for a paradigm shift in current clinical practice of MGUS management and help prevent MM, an incurable and costly disease. More importantly, it will provide evidence to guide interventions to reduce MM disparities. PROJECT NARRATIVE RELEVANCE: Racial disparities in multiple myeloma (MM), a common and incurable malignancy whose management is extremely costly, are long-established. Although MM is preceded by monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) by many years, no established prevention strategies exist and current clinical practice does not treat patients with MGUS; thus, racial disparities for this disease are expected to persist or even worsen due to the disproportionate burden of obesity – a known risk factor for MM – in the African American population. This project plans to study racial differences in risk factors/biomarkers for MGUS and the progression of MGUS to MM to inform future biological mechanism studies and MGUS/MM prevention trials with the goal of reducing MM health disparities.",Addressing racial disparities in monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance and progression to multiple myeloma from a prevention perspective,10055834,R01CA253475,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Health ', ' Incidence ', ' Life Cycle Stages ', ' Life Cycle ', ' life course ', ' Metformin ', ' Dimethylbiguanidine ', ' Dimethylguanylguanidine ', ' N,N-dimethyl-imidodicarbonimidic diamide ', ' Multiple Myeloma ', ' Plasma-Cell Myeloma ', ' myeloma ', ' myelomatosis ', ' Neoplasms ', ' neoplasia ', ' neoplastic growth ', ' Obesity ', ' adiposity ', ' corpulence ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulentia ', ' obese ', ' obese people ', ' obese person ', ' obese population ', ' Patients ', ' Play ', ' Proteins ', ' Race ', ' Racial Group ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Veterans ', ' Body Weight decreased ', ' Weight Loss ', ' Weight Reduction ', ' body weight loss ', ' wt-loss ', ' Caucasians ', ' Caucasian ', ' Caucasian Race ', ' Caucasoid ', ' Caucasoid Race ', ' Occidental ', ' white race ', ' Measures ', ' Afro American ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Black Populations ', ' black American ', ' African American ', ' Disease Costs ', ' Sickness Cost ', ' Cost of Illness ', ' base ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Biological ', ' Link ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Predisposition ', ' Blood Serum ', ' Serum ', ' Individual ', ' diabetic ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Databases ', ' Disease Progression ', ' MGUS ', ' Monoclonal Gammopathy of Undetermined Significance ', ' Monoclonal Gammopathy of Unknown Significance ', ' Monoclonal gammopathy of uncertain significance ', ' Solid Tumor ', ' Solid Neoplasm ', ' Chemoprevention ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Hematologic Cancer ', ' Hematologic Malignancies ', ' Hematological Malignancies ', ' Hematological Neoplasms ', ' Hematological Tumor ', ' Hematopoietic Cancer ', ' Malignant Hematologic Neoplasm ', ' Hematologic Neoplasms ', ' Life ', ' Event ', ' Medicare/Medicaid ', ' Orphan Disease ', ' Rare Disorder ', ' orphan disorder ', ' Rare Diseases ', ' Preventative strategy ', ' Preventive strategy ', ' Prevention strategy ', ' race differences ', ' racial difference ', ' General Public ', ' General Population ', ' Prevention ', ' M protein ', ' multiple myeloma M Protein ', ' Watchful Waiting ', ' Patient observation ', ' carcinogenicity ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' BMI percentile ', ' BMI z-score ', ' Quetelet index ', ' Body mass index ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Department of Defense ', ' Disease Marker ', ' Economic Burden ', ' IARC ', ' International Agency for Research on Cancer ', ' precancerous ', ' premalignant ', ' Subgroup ', ' Chemopreventive ', ' anti-carcinogenic ', ' anticarcinogenic ', ' chemoprevention agent ', ' Chemopreventive Agent ', ' Process ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' follow-up ', ' pre-clinical study ', ' preclinical study ', ' work group ', ' working group ', ' cost ', ' health economics ', ' glycemic control ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' prospective ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' modifiable risk ', ' progression biomarker ', ' progression marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' clinical practice ', ' BigData ', ' Big Data ', ' Prevention trial ', ' disparities in race ', ' race disparity ', ' racial disparity ', ' specific biomarkers ', ' gene testing ', ' gene-based testing ', ' genetic testing ', ' clinical encounter ', ' ']",NCI,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,360281,0.04991138678760939
"Aberrant Splice Variants as Potential Precision Biomarkers for Aggressive Prostate Cancers in African American Patients PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Prostate cancer (PCa) is now the most frequently diagnosed cancer and the second most common cause of cancer deaths in men in United States. Notably, African Americans (AAs) exhibited 1.6-fold higher incidence and 2.4-fold higher mortality rates compared to European Americans (EAs). Despite multiple socioeconomic factors postulated to explain the observed PCa disparities, higher recurrence and mortality rates remained even after adjustment of socioeconomic status in AAs, suggesting that intrinsic biological differences account for, at least, part of PCa disparities. Our previous genomic studies have revealed that intrinsic genomic differences do exist between AA and EA PCa. These genetic elements, including population-specific and -enriched microRNAs, mRNAs and alternative splicing variants, have been identified and were hypothesized to contribute to the differential PCa properties between AA and EA. In the pilot study, our preliminary results revealed ~2,500 differential splicing (DS) events occurring in AA and EA PCa. Among these DS genes, >70% of the genes were functionally linked to cancer diseases. These results lead to our hypothesis that aberrant mRNA splicing may play a critical but largely unknown role for driving the PCa disparities. Towards this hypothesis, we have performed RT-PCR validations and functional analyses of AA-enriched splice variants (such as PIK3CD, FGFR3, TSC2 and RASGRP2 splice variants) in PCa samples. Our preliminary results confirmed that these AA-enriched variants were highly expressed in AA PCa and contributed to more aggressive cancer phenotypes. In this proposal, we will focus on investigating the expression profiles of PIK3CD long and short splice variants (PIK3CD-L and PIK3CD-S) in a panel of PCa and other solid/hematologic tumor cell lines, and elucidating functional impacts of these splice variants in PCa aggressiveness and drug resistance. Guided by strong preliminary data, we propose to pursue three Specific Aims to character molecular functions of the PIK3CD splice variants underlying PCa aggressiveness: 1) Validate the expression profiles of PIK3CD splice variants in PCa specimens and cell lines derived from AA and EA patients; 2) Determine the functional roles of PIK3CD-S expression in disease aggressiveness and drug resistance in PCa and evaluate the feasibility of PIK3CD- S/PIK3CD-L ratios as potential biomarker; and 3) Screen for the effective therapeutic molecules (small molecule inhibitors, siRNAs and/or splice switching oligos) to reduce the cancer phenotypes in PIK3CD-S overexpressing cells. Collectively, our proposed research will broadly contribute to the field of cancer health disparities by characterizing the molecular signatures of aberrant splice variants in cancers (including PCa and other solid/hematologic tumors), and deciphering the molecular mechanisms of aberrant splicing underlying PCa aggressiveness (i.e. enhanced cell proliferation and invasion) and drug resistance. This proposal will allow us to further design for splice variant- specific siRNAs and screen for SMIs that can effectively inhibit the aggressive form of splice variants in PCa. These findings and efforts may facilitate the development of potential biomarkers and therapeutic strategy to treat aggressive PCa. Finally, the success of this SC1 proposal will set a strong foundation for the PI and his research team to further pursue a NIH competitive grant (i.e. R01 or R21) for future clinically-related studies. PROJECT NARRITIVE Emerging evidence suggests that aberrant mRNA splicing paly critical role in development and progression of diseases including cancers. Our proposed studies aim to understand the alternative splicing landscapes of African American and European American prostate cancers, and elucidate the functional roles of aberrant mRNA splicing in promoting prostate cancer disparities between these two populations. This research will have potential to further develop novel biomarker and/or therapeutic targets to treat the aggressive prostate cancers.",Aberrant Splice Variants as Potential Precision Biomarkers

"Changes in Weight and Physical Function for Older African American Women in National, Peer-Led, Community-Based Weight Loss Program 2. ABSTRACT Older African American (AA) women have the highest prevalence of both obesity and frailty. In academic, expert- led interventions, obese, frail, older individuals both lost weight and improved their physical function. However, because of high personnel costs and nonexistent nationwide infrastructure, large-scale implementation of these interventions is impractical. The long-term goals are to eliminate the health disparities of obesity and frailty in older AA women. This proposal’s overall objective is to determine the effects of a low-cost, community-based, peer-led weight loss program with a national infrastructure on obesity, physical function, and healthcare utilization in older AA women. To treat obesity and frailty in older AA women, it is critical to test a weight loss intervention that 1) has preliminary evidence of benefit; 2) is acceptable to older AA women; 3) is affordable; and 4) can be broadly disseminated. Take Off Pounds Sensibly (TOPS) is a national, nonprofit, community-based, peer-led weight loss program that meets these criteria. First, the applicant’s retrospective database analyses of TOPS showed two important results: 1) Participants who renew their annual membership lose and maintain significant weight loss (SWL) for up to 7 years; and 2) Compared to their younger counterparts, older women are more likely to achieve SWL. Second, the applicant started three TOPS chapters for older AA women in a successful pilot study. Though the study ended in 2012, one of the chapters is still active almost 6 years later. Third, TOPS is affordable; it only costs $92 annually. Finally, TOPS has a nationwide infrastructure with chapters in all 50 states. Since obese, frail, older individuals in academic, expert-led weight loss interventions can improve their physical function, the central hypothesis is that a low cost, community-based, peer-led weight loss program with a national infrastructure can provide SWL, improved physical function, and lower healthcare utilization for AA women, an underserved, vulnerable population. The rationale for the proposed research is that TOPS and academic, expert-led weight loss interventions share components critical to successful weight loss; therefore, TOPS can deliver similar outcomes. The central hypothesis will be tested by pursuing the following aims in obese, frail, older AA women: Determine the effect of TOPS on 1) weight change and cardiovascular disease risk factors; 2) physical function and quality of life; and 3) healthcare utilization. This project is innovative because it uses a “community to academia” approach to treat the health disparities; our study population focuses on older AA women with decreased physical function; our outcomes focus on weight, physical function, and healthcare utilization; and our unique study settings. The proposed research is significant because determining the real- world effectiveness of the TOPS program and its impact on weight, physical function, and healthcare utilization in AA women can have a widespread impact on the older population at large. Thus, it has the potential to reduce adverse geriatric outcomes among all older individuals. 3. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research is relevant to public health because if a low-cost, community-based weight loss program with a national infrastructure is effective at both weight loss and improving physical function among elderly individuals with decreased physical function, it has the potential to reduce adverse geriatric outcomes. The proposed research is relevant to the part of the NIH mission that pertains to enhancing health and reducing illness and disability.","Changes in Weight and Physical Function for Older African American Women in National, Peer-Led, Community-Based Weight Loss Program",9856402,R01AG058725,"['Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' behavior intervention ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' Blood Pressure ', ' Body Weight Changes ', ' Weight Change ', ' Cachexia ', ' Cachectic ', ' Communities ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Diet ', ' dietary ', ' foot ', ' Goals ', ' Hand ', ' Health ', ' Glycosylated hemoglobin A ', ' Glycohemoglobin A ', ' Hb A1 ', ' Hb A1a+b ', ' Hb A1c ', ' HbA1 ', ' HbA1c ', ' Hemoglobin A(1) ', ' hemoglobin A1c ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Hospital Admission ', ' Information Networks ', ' Inpatients ', ' Isometric Exercise ', ' Isometrics ', ' Muscle-Setting Exercise ', ' Static Exercise ', ' Lipids ', ' Mission ', ' Moods ', ' mortality ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Obesity ', ' adiposity ', ' corpulence ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulentia ', ' obese ', ' obese people ', ' obese person ', ' obese population ', ' Outpatients ', ' Out-patients ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Public Health ', ' Public Housing ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Race ', ' Racial Group ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Research ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Testing ', ' Waiting Lists ', ' waitlist ', ' Body Weight decreased ', ' Weight Loss ', ' Weight Reduction ', ' body weight loss ', ' wt-loss ', ' Weight ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Frail Elderly ', ' Frail Elders ', ' Frail Older Adults ', ' Frail Seniors ', ' frail older adult ', ' Measures ', ' Walking ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' falls ', ' Afro American ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Black Populations ', ' black American ', ' African American ', ' Outcome Measure ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Ensure ', ' Evaluation ', ' Grips ', ' grasp ', ' Physical activity ', ' disability ', ' Individual ', ' Health Care Utilization ', ' health care service use ', ' healthcare service use ', ' healthcare service utilization ', ' healthcare utilization ', ' health care service utilization ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Databases ', ' satisfaction ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' Attenuated ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' frailty ', ' waist circumference ', ' Physical Function ', ' meetings ', ' 65+ years old ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' age 65 and greater ', ' age 65 and older ', ' aged 65 and greater ', ' aged ≥65 ', ' human old age (65+) ', ' Structure ', ' Participant ', ' peer ', ' member ', ' Epidemiologic Research ', ' Epidemiologic Studies ', ' Epidemiological Studies ', ' Epidemiology Research ', ' epidemiologic investigation ', ' epidemiology study ', ' Manpower ', ' personnel ', ' Human Resources ', ' behavioral influence ', ' behavior influence ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' weight control ', ' weight management ', ' Weight maintenance regimen ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' cardiovascular disease risk ', ' cardiovascular disorder risk ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Address ', ' Academia ', ' High Prevalence ', ' NIDDK ', ' National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases ', ' randomisation ', ' randomization ', ' randomly assigned ', ' Randomized ', ' Older Population ', ' Characteristics ', ' cost ', ' under served population ', ' underserved people ', ' Underserved Population ', ' Outcome ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' weight loss intervention ', ' older women ', ' clinical significance ', ' clinically significant ', ' Evidence based program ', ' develop therapy ', ' intervention development ', ' treatment development ', ' therapy development ', ' community setting ', ' adverse consequence ', ' adverse outcome ', ' arm ', ' ED visit ', ' ER visit ', ' Emergency care visit ', ' Emergency hospital visit ', ' Emergency room visit ', ' Emergency department visit ', ' Physical Performance ', ' study population ', ' physiotherapist ', ' physical therapist ', ' Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index ', ' high risk group ', ' high risk population ', ' recruit ', ' weight loss programming ', ' weight loss program ', ' intervention arm ', ' treatment arm ', ' Infrastructure ', ' perceived stress ', ' ']",NIA,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,534254,0.043784622685226815
"Reducing Emergency Diabetes Care for Older African Americans African Americans (AAs) with diabetes (DM) seek emergency department (ED) care twice as often as Whites. About 40% of AAs with DM have an ED visit each year, and 24% use the ED as their usual place of care (vs. 13% of Whites). The reasons for these racial disparities in ED use are complex, but the scientific premise of the proposed randomized controlled trial (RCT) is that poor access to primary care and poor DM self-care lead to high ED use in AAs with DM. A culturally relevant intervention that mitigates these factors may reduce the need for ED use in this high risk population. This RCT will compare the efficacy of COPDE (COmmunity Care to Prevent Diabetes Emergencies) vs. Enhanced Usual Care (EUC) to reduce DM-related ED visits and/or hospitalizations over 12 months (primary outcome) in 230 AAs with DM, 50 years and older, after an ED visit. COPDE is a collaborative intervention of Primary Care Physicians, (PCPs), a DM nurse educator, and Community Health Workers (CHWs) that extends from the ED into the community. The CHWs will: 1) deliver in-home DM education to increase participants’ knowledge and skills to manage DM; 2) use DM-specific Behavioral Activation to reinforce DM self-care; and 3) facilitate telehealth visits with PCPs and a DM nurse educator to increase access to care. The control treatment, EUC, is usual medical care that is enhanced with DM self-care education. EUC matches COPDE in treatment intensity (i.e., number and duration of in-home visits) and delivery of DM self-care education, but does not include COPDE’s other active elements (i.e., Behavioral Activation and telehealth). The treatment comparison will identify COPDE’s specific efficacy over and above EUC. We hypothesize that COPDE will halve the rate of incident DM-related ED visits and/or hospitalizations relative to EUC. The three secondary outcomes are: 1) subjective perceptions of access to care; 2) receipt of DM Quality Metrics (i.e., objective indicators of realized access to care); and 3) DM self-care. A mediation analysis will determine if changes in one or more of these variables explain COPDE’s efficacy. Exploratory Aims will: 1) determine if COPDE reduces “all cause” ED visits/hospitalizations; 2) determine if Community Need Index scores (which reflect the extent of economic and structural barriers to care), literacy, age, and/or sex moderate treatment effects; 3) determine if COPDE improves glycemic control, impacts DM- related health beliefs, reduces depression, and/or improves quality-of-life; 4) identify COPDE treatment features that confer cultural relevance; and 5) estimate COPDE’s costs and net financial benefits. This RCT is significant because rates of ED use among AAs with DM are rapidly rising, and new ways to treat this high risk population are needed. This RCT is innovative because: 1) it tests the first ED-to-community intervention designed to reduce the need for ED use in AAs with DM, and 2) it determines if participants who reside in high- need as well as low-need communities equally benefit.

"Obesity risk in African American women is determined by a diet-by-phenotype interaction Summary  African-American (AA) women are disproportionately burdened by obesity. Our published data have led to the provocative hypothesis that this disparity has physiologic underpinnings. Specifically, AA women are characterized by a high acute insulin secretory response to a glucose challenge, as well as reduced hepatic insulin extraction, which together lead to postprandial circulating insulin concentrations that can be several fold higher than those observed in Caucasian (European-American, EA) women. The lipogenic actions of insulin could favor partitioning of energy to adipose tissue at the expense of ATP (energy) production. In fact, AA women have lower energy requirements than EA women, and are more energetically efficient. High insulin secretion, however, is only one factor that determines insulin action; another major factor is insulin sensitivity. Our data have shown that over time, weight (fat) gain in obesity-prone AA women is higher in those who are more insulin sensitive, whereas “obesity-resistant” (constitutionally lean) AA women have relatively lower insulin sensitivity. Our data also suggest that the lipogenic actions of insulin in AA women are exacerbated by a high-glycemic diet, which promotes insulin secretion. Finally, our data have shown that over time weight (fat) gain in AA women is predicted by the combination of insulin sensitivity and dietary glycemic load. Taken together, these observations suggest that many AA women are predisposed to obesity by their endocrine make-up, and that this predisposition is exacerbated by a high-glycemic diet. A natural corollary of this hypothesis is that for implementation of intentional weight loss, a low- (vs high-) glycemic diet will promote greater loss of body fat, and will enable successful weight loss maintenance by increasing energy expenditure. This corollary is supported by our preliminary data that indicate a 50% greater loss of fat with low- vs high-glycemic diet under controlled conditions in AA women. The project proposed herein will test these hypotheses through a randomized clinical weight loss trial of high- vs low-glycemic diets in obese AA women. The study has both an efficacy phase (controlled feeding during weight loss) to probe physiologic mechanisms (energy expenditure, metabolic efficiency), and an effectiveness phase (6-month free-living follow-up) to test the hypothesis that the low-glycemic diet will be more effective at promoting weight loss maintenance due in part to improved adherence and quality of life, and ease of implementing the diet. This study is innovative in that it proposes to test a specific physiologic mechanism that may underlie propensity to obesity; it includes both efficacy and effectiveness outcomes; it involves both quantitative and qualitative methodology; and it tackles optimization of both weight loss and weight loss maintenance. This study is intended to provide the evidence base necessary to improve the clinical care approach to weight loss. Using a randomized clinical trial intervention study design, we will test the hypothesis that the metabolic phenotype of obese African-American women predisposes them to obesity when they eat a specific type of diet. We predict that women who consume a low glycemic diet will lose more weight and be more successful with maintaining weight loss than women who consome a high glycemic diet, due in part to higher resting and total metabolic rate and lower metabolic efficiency. Results from this study will verify that the high obesity prevalence in African-American women is due to their unique physiology, and will offer a dietary means for preventing and/or reversing obesity not only in this group, but in any individual with similar endocrine characteristics.",Obesity risk in African American women is determined by a diet-by-phenotype interaction,9914264,R01DK115483,"['Adipose tissue ', ' Fatty Tissue ', ' adipose ', ' white adipose tissue ', ' yellow adipose tissue ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Body Composition ', ' Body Weight ', ' Indirect Calorimetry ', ' Respiration Calorimetry ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Diet ', ' dietary ', ' Eating ', ' Food Intake ', ' Energy Metabolism ', ' Energy Expenditure ', ' Fatty acid glycerol esters ', ' Fats ', ' Food ', ' Food or Food Product ', ' Glucose ', ' D-Glucose ', ' Dextrose ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Insulin ', ' Humulin R ', ' Novolin R ', ' Regular Insulin ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' intervention research ', ' interventional research ', ' interventional study ', ' interventions research ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Maintenance ', ' Methodology ', ' Obesity ', ' adiposity ', ' corpulence ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulentia ', ' obese ', ' obese people ', ' obese person ', ' obese population ', ' oxidation ', ' Phenotype ', ' Physiology ', ' Production ', ' Publishing ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Research Design ', ' Study Type ', ' study design ', ' Rest ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Satiation ', ' satiety ', ' Testing ', ' Thinness ', ' Leanness ', ' Time ', ' Urine ', ' Urine Urinary System ', ' Body Weight decreased ', ' Weight Loss ', ' Weight Reduction ', ' body weight loss ', ' wt-loss ', ' Weight ', ' Caucasians ', ' Caucasian ', ' Caucasian Race ', ' Caucasoid ', ' Caucasoid Race ', ' Occidental ', ' white race ', ' Woman ', ' Measures ', ' Afro American ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Black Populations ', ' black American ', ' African American ', ' gene manipulation ', ' genetically manipulate ', ' genetically perturb ', ' genetic manipulation ', ' improved ', ' Hepatic ', ' Acute ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' Randomized Clinical Trials ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Predisposition ', ' Individual ', ' European ', ' Low-Fat Diet ', ' Fat-Restricted Diet ', ' Metabolic ', ' Exposure to ', ' Body fat ', ' Pattern ', ' Endocrine ', ' American ', ' Animal Models and Related Studies ', ' model of animal ', ' model organism ', ' Animal Model ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' race differences ', ' racial difference ', ' Prevention ', ' Palate ', ' response ', ' insulin sensitivity ', ' insulin secretion ', ' Effectiveness ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' DEXA ', ' DXA ', ' Dual-Energy Xray Absorptiometry ', ' Dual-Energy X-Ray Absorptiometry ', ' Adherence ', ' Constitutional ', ' Data ', ' randomisation ', ' randomization ', ' randomly assigned ', ' Randomized ', ' Monitor ', ' Characteristics ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' follow-up ', ' obesity treatment ', ' feeding ', ' Outcome ', ' Obesity related disease ', ' Obesity associated disease ', ' Prevalence ', ' prospective ', ' Consumption ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' resistant ', ' Resistance ', ' risk for obesity ', ' risk of obesity ', ' obesity risk ', ' clinical care ', ' evidence base ', ' clinical practice ', ' personalization of treatment ', ' personalized therapy ', ' personalized treatment ', ' personalized medicine ', ' disparities in race ', ' race disparity ', ' racial disparity ', ' metabolic rate ', ' metabotype ', ' metabolic phenotype ', ' doubly-labeled water ', ' Total Daily Energy Expenditure ', ' total energy expenditure ', ' preservation ', ' Exercise Test ', ' ']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,R01,2020,648373,0.09149142548814705
"Improving primary care providers ability to communicate about patients experiences of racism to improve cardiovascular health: a feasibilitystudy PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT African Americans (AAs) have the highest age-adjusted death rates from major cardiovascular diseases of all racial groups. Many race-related factors contribute to AAs' high rates of CVD. For example, exposure to interpersonal and structural racism contributes to chronic stress, negative emotional states, and poor health behaviors, which, in turn, lead to adverse cardiovascular outcomes. AAs with racially discordant providers experience poorer interpersonal processes of care (less shared decision-making and psychosocial talk) and report lower levels of trust than AAs with same race providers. The candidate's long-term hypothesis is: inviting AA patients to discuss their experiences of racism visit will strengthen the therapeutic relationship and thereby improve AAs' cardiovascular outcomes. Drawing on social cognitive theory and contact theory, the candidate proposes to develop and test a feasible and acceptable method for health care providers to communicate about racism with AA patients. We focus on US born, non-Hispanic, AA patients, because they have the worst cardiovascular health outcomes, and, as a group, longstanding exposure to racism. For providers, we focus on White residents because (1) most health care providers are White; (2) the literature shows that race-discordant relationships have poorer interpersonal processes of care; (3) residents are actively building their communication skills and responsiveness to diverse populations, and (4) residents may have less entrenched behaviors than practicing physicians. In Aim 1, the candidate will conduct focus groups with AA patients and White residents training in Internal Medicine, Med-Peds, and Family Medicine to identify attitudes about and barriers to discussing racism. Then, in Aim 2, the candidate will develop an intervention to communicate about racism that improves residents' self-efficacy and outcome expectancies, prior to pilot testing the intervention in Aim 3. A community advisory board will advise the candidate throughout the research process. The candidate's long-term career goal is to become an independent investigator who reduces racial disparities by developing innovative evidence-based interventions to address the multiple mechanisms through which racism adversely affects health. The career development plan includes training in advanced qualitative and quantitative methods, community engaged research and concept mapping, communication about racism, implementation science, and clinical research. The candidate has an exceptional team of mentors and advisors who are distinguished scholars in the aforementioned areas. The candidate is well-positioned to conduct this research, which will transition her to independence as an investigator and lay the foundation for a large-scale randomized trial. She has access to a rich academic environment, which includes a department with a strong record of publications and extramural funding, an excellent School of Public Health, a Clinical and Translational Science Institute that invests in junior faculty, and a state-of-the art Simulation Center. PROJECT NARRATIVE This study focuses on the well-established, but under-addressed, relationship between racism and health via the patient-provider therapeutic relationship. This project will increase health care providers' knowledge of racism as a health risk factor and equip them with the language, tools, and skills that they need to support their African American patients. By demonstrating a willingness to discuss racism, health care providers may be able to improve the therapeutic relationship with African American patients, which will ultimately improve cardiovascular outcomes.",Improving primary care providers ability to communicate about patients experiences of racism to improve cardiovascular health: a feasibilitystudy,9914156,K23HL143146,"['Affect ', ' Age ', '

"A new approach to controlling chlamydia transmission in young people Abstract Chlamydia trachomatis (Ct) is the most commonly reported sexually transmitted infection in the U.S., is a major cause of infertility, pelvic inflammatory disease and ectopic pregnancy among women and has been associated with increased HIV acquisition. Because women experience the most severe sequelae, the focus of Ct prevention in the U.S. has been on screening sexually active women < 25 years old. Though men are reservoirs of the infection, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have not recommended targeting men due to lack of evidence for this approach. This research will fill this gap. African American (AA) women are 7.5 times more likely to be infected with Ct than whites, thus AA are the focus of this research. We hypothesize that screening AA men is essential to curbing the high rates of Ct among young AA women and that a bundled approach will by synergistic. Our community-based pilot program, called “Check it,” is a pilot- tested male screening program which targeted AA men aged 15-25. At the core of this intervention is male Ct screening, but it is also bundled with other evidence-based and best practices for Ct control including: venue- based sampling (VBS), social network peer referral, modest monetary incentives (MMI), screening of target men, rescreening of target men found to be Ct positive with text reminders (Text-RS) , expedited treatment for index men (EIT) and for the partners (EPT), and Wed-based education (Web-Ed). The goal of this study is to examine the effectiveness of a pilot-tested, bundled Ct prevention program focusing on screening young AA men for the prevention of Ct among young AA women: Aim 1. To determine the impact of Check it on women's Ct rates – This aim has a formative phase and an intervention phase. In the formative phase, the pilot Check it is developed and manualized. In the intervention, Check it is implemented and evaluated. We hypothesize that, post-intervention, Ct rates among AA women in the intervention community will be significantly lower compared to rates in the control communities, and that Check it will result in high rates of index/partner treatment and rescreening. Aim 2. To model the potential impact and optimal coverage needed - Using inputs from this study and the literature, a deterministic population-based epidemiological model will be used to model the number of cases averted by Check it and to determine the potential impact at different intensities of the intervention. Aim 3. To determine the cost effectiveness of Check it - Time motion studies will be conducted and used as inputs for the cost-benefit/effectiveness analysis of the Check it Program in order to distinguish study from program costs. If Check it is found to be effective as hypothesized, we will conduct future translational research to disseminate the program. This research has the potential for practical application by improving reproductive health and high impact by removing disparities in the control of Ct among AA men. . Public Health Significance Rates of Chlamydia trachomatis (Ct), a major cause of reproductive morbidity and potential facilitator of HIV transmission, are 7 times higher among African American (AA) women compared to white women constituting an alarming health disparity. The present approach of screening women only is not working and screening men, the reservoirs of infection, should be considered. The goal of this research is to test the effectiveness (measured, potential and cost) and to translate “Check it”, which is a pilot-tested, bundled seek, test and treat intervention targeting young African American men to reduce infections in young AA women.  ",A new approach to controlling chlamydia transmission in young people,9936184,R01HD086794,"['Affect ', ' Aftercare ', ' After Care ', ' After-Treatment ', ' post treatment ', ' Awareness ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' CDC ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' Charge ', ' Chlamydia ', ' Miyagawanella ', ' bedsonia ', ' Chlamydia trachomatis ', ' C trachomatis ', ' C. trachomatis ', ' Rickettsia trachomae ', ' Communities ', ' Community Pharmacy ', ' Cost-Benefit Analysis ', ' cost benefit economics ', ' cost benefit effectiveness ', ' cost effectiveness ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Future ', ' Geography ', ' Goals ', ' Hair ', ' HIV ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Incentives ', ' indexing ', ' Infection ', ' Infertility ', ' Cannot achieve a pregnancy ', ' Difficulty conceiving ', ' fertility cessation ', ' fertility loss ', ' infertile ', ' Literature ', ' male ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Persons ', ' Ectopic Pregnancy ', ' extrauterine pregnancy ', ' Public Health ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Sexual Partners ', ' sex partner ', ' Sexually Transmitted Diseases ', ' Sexually Transmitted Disorder ', ' Sexually Transmitted Infection ', ' Venereal Diseases ', ' Venereal Disorders ', ' Venereal Infections ', ' Target Populations ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Time and Motion Studies ', ' Translating ', ' Transportation ', ' Urine ', ' Urine Urinary System ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Afro American ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Black Populations ', ' black American ', ' African American ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Social Network ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Phase ', ' Trust ', ' sexually active ', ' pelvic inflammatory syndrome ', ' Pelvic Inflammatory Disease ', ' Fostering ', ' Logistics ', ' Reproductive Health ', ' uptake ', ' Community Networks ', ' programs ', ' Clinic ', ' experience ', ' Structure ', ' Participant ', ' Prevention program ', ' peer ', ' Prevention ', ' Reporting ', ' medical examination ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' stigma ', ' social stigma ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Legal ', ' Educational Materials ', ' High Prevalence ', ' Translational Science ', ' translation research ', ' Translational Research ', ' Transmission ', ' transmission process ', ' Text ', ' Behavioral ', ' post intervention ', ' cost ', ' community intervention ', ' epidemiological model ', ' new approaches ', ' novel approaches ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel strategies ', ' cost effective ', ' aged ', "" man's "", ' man ', ' application in practice ', ' practical application ', ' community organizations ', ' effectiveness measure ', ' evidence base ', ' population based ', ' financial reward ', ' monetary incentive ', ' financial incentive ', ' adolescent man ', ' adolescent men ', ' young man ', ' screening ', ' peer networks ', ' reproductive morbidity ', ' program costs ', ' screening program ', ' annual screening ', ' routine screening ', ' recommended screening ', ' screening recommendations ', ' screening guidelines ', ' effectiveness testing ', ' ']",NICHD,TULANE UNIVERSITY OF LOUISIANA,R01,2020,562139,0.11128796825787918
"Ovarian Cancer Survival in African-American Women ABSTRACT Although epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) is the fifth-leading cause of cancer death in women in the U.S.—with worse survival in African-American (AA) women than European-American (EA) women—little is known about factors affecting survival among AAs. The causes for this disparity are likely multifactorial and need to be examined from multiple levels, including factors affecting the neighborhood social environment and individual- level factors. We posit that inflammatory exposures may explain some of the disparity in EOC survival among AA women due to important role of inflammation on carcinogenesis and prognosis and the higher levels of inflammatory biomarkers present among AA women. The African American Cancer Epidemiology Study (AACES) is a multi-site epidemiologic study of AA women in diverse geographic regions. Due to comprehensive data collection, pathology assessment and length of follow-up, AACES is uniquely positioned to evaluate factors influencing the survival of EOC in AA women. AACES has enrolled an unprecedented number of AA participants during a previous funding period, making AACES the largest study of ovarian cancer in AA women to date: 595 AA women with invasive EOC and 752 controls. Prior to AACES, no epidemiologic study of ovarian cancer had enrolled more than 150 AA cases and 150 AA controls. The overarching goal of this proposal is to assemble the first cohort study of AA EOC survivors by expanding recruitment to reach a sample size of ~944 cases and continuing follow-up of existing AACES cases. We propose a novel multi-level approach to evaluate the impact of neighborhood, lifestyle factors and biomarkers on survival. We propose the following aims that build on our current infrastructure and accomplishments: 1) investigate the effects of the neighborhood social and physical environment on EOC survival; 2) evaluate the association between individual characteristics and EOC survival; 3) characterize inflammatory tumor markers that may be key treatment targets; and 4) use multi-leveling modeling to integrate the impact of the Aim 1-3 variables. Our multi- disciplinary investigative team has extensive experience in all facets of ovarian cancer research, which ensures comprehensive, synergistic approaches to understanding factors that affect survival in AA women diagnosed with invasive EOC. The critical deficit of information on the epidemiologic and prognostic factors for ovarian cancer survival among AA women is addressed comprehensively in the proposed study. Our study will inform strategies to reduce mortality in AA women with EOC. PROJECT NARRATIVE Epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) represents a high disease burden among African-American (AA) women who have poorer survival compared to European-American women. We identified inflammatory related exposures to be of particular importance in the risk of developing this disease among AA women.

"Disparities in Hypertension Risk Amongst Young Adults: The Role of Epigenetics Project Summary/Abstract  Young African Americans (AAs) are 3X as likely to have a stroke compared to European Americans (EAs). A major challenge for reducing disparities in stroke amongst young AAs is the poor understanding of molecular mechanisms that facilitate early onset hypertension in healthy, asymptomatic AAs. The long-term goal of the candidate is to establish an independent research career focused on understanding the role of social epigenomics in modulating racially disparate outcomes in cerebrovascular diseases. The objective of this application is to systematically investigate social epigenomic mechanisms associated with aberrant arterial stiffness patterns, which precedes the development of hypertension, in asymptomatic blacks vs whites. Given that adverse experiences are known to mediate epigenetic changes in the vasculature, our central hypotheses are that 1) psychosocial stress is associated with differences in cfPWV between AAs and EAs and that 2) altered expression extracellular matrix-specific miRNAs are associated with cfPWV as a function of differences in psychosocial stress. Three specific aims address these interrelated hypotheses. In Aim 1 (Training-Phase I) we will determine the association between psychosocial stress and arterial stiffness in AA and EA college students. Here, we will correlate arterial stiffness, as measured by carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity with childhood and early adulthood psychosocial stress using validated survey tools. In Aim 2 (Transition to Independence, Phase I/II) we will determine the expression patterns of extracellular matrix-relevant plasma and serum proteins in AA and EA subjects using liquid biopsy samples acquired from college students in Aim 1. We will assess protein levels using ELISA and Western blot assays. In Aim 3 (Independent Aim/Phase II) we will use a bioinformatics approach to identify extracellular vesicle and plasma concentrations of extracellular matrix- relevant microRNAs in AAs and EAs study subjects. Upon successful completion of the proposed research and training, we expect to provide insight on molecular mechanisms that drive premature large artery stiffening in young, healthy AAs race individuals. This contribution is expected to be significant because it will provide potential novel therapeutic avenues for the postponement of hypertension onset in AAs that will help alleviate disparities in stroke incidence and mortality. Our research is innovative in that it seeks to shift this paradigm by focusing on the how the biological embedding of adverse environmental exposures (e.g. abuse, racism) impacts premature large artery stiffness and differential expression of relevant epigenetic biomarkers such as microRNAs. Moreover, it utilizes a transdisciplinary approach to address the clinical problem. The proposed studies will provide a platform for Dr. Buie to gain expertise and training in clinical trial design, implementation and analysis. Moreover, she will become proficient in mixed methods (quantitative and qualitative) research and employing bioinformatic and epigenomic principles for addressing health disparities in stroke. PROJECT NARRATIVE Young African American (AAs) are 3X as likely to have stroke compared to European Americans (EAs) yet, strategies to reduce essential hypertension rates in AAs have failed. Emerging evidence suggest that the cumulative exposure to psychosocial stress, triggers changes in the epigenome that lead to hypertension. This study will investigate the temporal relationship between social stressors, preclinical measures of hypertension (e.g. arterial stiffness) and molecular mechanisms of vascular matrix remodeling in

"RACIAL DISPARITY IN THE ENERGY DEPENDENCY OF TRIPLE NEGATIVE BREAST CANCER Abstract: Breast cancer (BC) statistics over the years have repeatedly shown that while BC incidence is higher in Caucasian (CA) women, death due to BC is higher in African American (AA) women. Importantly, AA patients are more likely to be diagnosed of BC at a younger age and have a higher probability of developing aggressive triple negative (TN) BC. AA TNBC is also diagnosed with a more advanced stage of the disease compared to CA women. This project plans to address the differential mitochondrial reprogramming between AA and CA TNBC patients. Considering our previous publication and preliminary data, here we use modulation in the activation of Src oncopathway as a major readout of metabolic reprogramming. We have previously showed that TNBC cells have high energy dependency to fatty acid β-oxidation (FAO) and FAO is an important determinant of Src activation by autophosphorylation at its Y419 site. However, our recent analyses suggest that this dependency is mostly restricted to CA TNBC. AA TNBC cells are not responding to FAO inhibitors as observed with most of the CA TNBC, and FAO inhibitors do not decrease Src autophosphorylation in AA TNBC. Further analysis suggest that, even though Src depends on Krebs cycle (TCA) activity in both AA and CA TNBC cells, the source of acetyl-CoA for TCA is significantly different between these two groups. Thus, this project is planning to address the disparity in energy dependency between AA and CA TNBC tumors. Our preliminary data also suggest that increased Myc, pyruvate carboxylase (PC) and argininosuccinate synthase 1 (ASS1) activities in AA TNBC are critical in their enhanced arginine pathway. We have also proposed a translational aim to understand the role of TCA inhibitors in the therapeutic response of AA TNBC to Src inhibitors. Thus, this project will provide critical information regarding the energy dependency and onco- pathway activation in AA TNBC. The project involves experiments utilizing several AA and CA TNBC cell lines, patient-derived xenografts (PDX) models as well as deidentified BC tissues obtained from AA and CA TNBC patients. This project also involves genomic, proteomic, metabolomic, bioinformatic and clinical approaches including in vivo studies in animal models. Overall, this study will provide an important scientific mechanism behind the racial disparity of energy dependency and regulation of onco-pathways in AA TNBC patients. The outcome can support in the development of race-specific combination therapies for the management of aggressive TNBC. Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) currently shows racial disparity between African American (AA) and Caucasian (CA) population. We discovered critical differences in the energy dependency of AA and CA TNBC. Using multiple OMICS and translational approaches, this project is aim to understand the difference in the energy dependency of AA TNBC compared to CA TNBC and its significance in the regulation of

"Tumor Immune Contexture and Breast Cancer Disparities: A Multi-Disciplinary Study in Women of African and European Ancestry Abstract. Breast cancer rates in American women of African ancestry (AA) continue to rise and the gap in mortality between AAs and women of European ancestry (EA) persists, the reasons for which are largely unknown. Investigating the hypothesis that evolutionary adaptation to endemic infectious diseases in Africa, such as malaria, resulted in more robust immune responses, but potentially more aggressive breast cancers with poorer prognoses, we found striking ancestral differences in distributions of SNPs in immune pathways, and in circulating cytokines and systemic immune response. Extending our research to local immune response in the tumor microenvironment (TME), we found a stronger presence of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) in breast tumors from AAs than in EAs. Because TILs are typically associated with better survival, but AAs have poorer prognosis, in a pilot study, we investigated if various immune cell subtypes in tumor tissues differed in EAs and AAs. We found an important shift in gene expression profiles for TIL composition and the balance of immune responses, including a higher ratio of exhausted CD8 to total CD8 T cells in AAs, which was an independent prognostic factor in survival analysis. These preliminary findings have led us to hypothesize that the robust nature of the immune response in AAs is important for reshaping the biology of breast tumors, ultimately leading to the emergence of a more immune-resistant or refractory malignant phenotype. To address our hypotheses, we will take a multi-pronged approach built upon the established Women’s Circle of Health Study (WCHS) to resume enrollment of EA cases and continue recruitment of AAs, so that we will have ample statistical power to compare and investigate immune profiles in tumors from AA and EA women. We will first profile and compare breast TMEs using transcriptomic profiling in 250 AA vs. 250 EA patients, followed by validation of top markers and spatial characterization using Vectra multiplex immunofluorescence assay in tumors from 1,500 AA vs. 716 EA patients, with consideration of other molecular characteristics that differ between groups. We will examine relationships between immune phenotypes and breast cancer survival, as well as inflammation-related epidemiologic and social factors that may vary between EAs and AAs, or are differentially associated with risk by ER status, to investigate why breast tumor immune response would differ by race. To complement this research, we will employ comprehensive phenotypic and functional assays to determine the inherent response of immune cells from AA vs. EA cancer patients relative to healthy controls. Our study will provide evidence at both immune marker and functional levels that breast tumors from AA women have a stronger immune cell repertoire, but the balance of their TME is shifted towards an unfavorable dysfunctional state. Our findings may inform clinical investigations of immunotherapy focusing on breast cancer in AA women, and may guide the way for immunotherapy to activate exhausted T cells, ensuring that all groups of patients will receive equal benefits from cancer immunotherapy. PROJECT NARRATIVE The goal of this project is to investigate if immune profiles in breast tumors from American women of African ancestry (AA) differ from those in women of European ancestry (EA), are associated with differentially distributed risk factors, and to more aggressive tumors as well as to survival. Results from this study may have important implications for clinical studies of immunotherapy with application to AA women, particularly those with more aggressive tumors.",Tumor Immune Contexture and

"Glucocorticoid signaling, taxane resistance, and prostate cancer mortality disparity African American (AA) men develop highly aggressive prostate tumors and are twice as likely to die of this malignancy than men from other racial backgrounds. Advanced prostate cancer (PCa) is usually treated with androgen deprivation therapy and chemotherapy with taxane drugs. Unfortunately, death occurs once the cancer becomes metastatic and resistant to therapy. Recent studies demonstrate that glucocorticoid receptor (GR) signaling confers resistance to taxane chemotherapy; however, the underlying mechanisms have not been clearly established or studied in the context of health disparities. Glucocorticoids are concurrently administered to PCa patients to mitigate the side effects of therapy, but recent evidence suggests that they may also accelerate disease progression. This poses a serious problem for AA men, who have chronically elevated levels of endogenous glucocorticoids and amplified glucocorticoid signaling compared to European American (EA) men. These observations implicate glucocorticoid signaling as a potential contributor to PCa mortality disparities, and suggest that targeting GR may attenuate therapy resistance in PCa and reduce these disparities. The proposed studies are aimed at mechanistically linking elevated GR signaling with resistance to taxane chemotherapy in PCa, and targeting GR to reverse this resistance. Currently, there is a fundamental lack in our understanding of the impact of GR-induced chemotherapy resistance in the context of racial disparities in prostate cancer mortality. This is caused by critical barriers in the field that include lack of studies linking GR signaling to PCa therapy resistance in the context of health disparities, and limited understanding of molecular mechanisms underlying GR-induced chemotherapy resistance. This proposal addresses these critical barriers by exploring the novel overall hypothesis that GR signaling is enhanced in AA prostate tumors and promotes chemotherapy resistance by upregulating stress survival genes. The hypothesis is supported by preliminary data suggesting that GR signaling robustly induces the expression of the chemoresistance- associated proteins LEDGF/p75 and Clusterin in AA-derived cell lines. We will evaluate our overall hypothesis through two specific aims: Aim 1. Test the hypothesis that GR directly induces chemoresistance in PCa cells by upregulating stress survival proteins. This will be explored in mechanistic studies using AA and EA cellular and xenograft models of PCa. Aim 2. Test the hypothesis that GR signaling is elevated in AA men with PCa, leading to increased expression and circulation of stress survival proteins. This will be explored by examining the expression of GR in prostate tumor tissues from AA and EA patients, as well as the circulating levels of LEDGF/p75 and Clusterin in AA and EA men with and without PCa. These exploratory and innovative studies use a mechanistic approach to establish the role of GR signaling in promoting chemotherapy resistance in PCa in the context of health disparities. The results from these studies will identify new targets for therapies designed to attenuate GR driven chemoresistance in PCa, resulting in reduction of these disparities. Narrative Prostate Cancer mortality disparities are having a major impact in the U.S. by disproportionally affecting the African American male population. The proposed studies use mechanistic approaches to establish the contribution of glucocorticoid receptor signaling to chemotherapy resistance in advanced prostate cancer in the context of the racial disparities in mortality associated with this malignancy. The results from these studies will identify potential targets for novel therapeutic strategies that could be designed to attenuate glucocorticoid receptor-driven chemoresistance, resulting in reduction of these disparities.","Glucocorticoid signaling, taxane resistance, and prostate cancer mortality disparity",9904596,R21CA226654,"['Acceleration ', ' Affect ', ' Aging ', ' Blood Circulation ', ' Bloodstream ', ' Circulation ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cell Line ', ' CellLine ', ' Strains Cell Lines ', ' cultured cell line ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Genes ', ' Glucocorticoids ', ' Heat shock proteins ', ' stress protein ', ' In Vitro ', ' male ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' mortality ', ' Patients ', ' Pharmacology ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Prostatic Neoplasms ', ' Prostate Neoplasms ', ' Prostate Tumor ', ' Prostatic Neoplasia ', ' Proteins ', ' Androgen Receptor ', ' Glucocorticoid Receptor ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Stress ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Up-Regulation ', ' Upregulation ', ' sulfated glycoprotein 2 ', ' MAC393 antigen ', ' SGP-2 protein ', ' SGP2 ', ' SP 40,40 protein ', ' TRPM-2 protein ', ' TRPM2 ', ' X-ray-inducible protein 8 ', ' XIP8 protein ', ' apoJ protein ', ' apolipoprotein J ', ' clusterin ', ' complement lysis inhibitor ', ' complement-associated protein SP-40,40 protein ', ' ionizing radiation-induced protein-8 ', ' testosterone-repressed prostate message-2 protein ', ' Afro American ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Black Populations ', ' black American ', ' African American ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Link ', ' taxane ', ' Blood Serum ', ' Serum ', ' European ', ' Disease Progression ', ' Genetic ', ' Attenuated ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Prostate ', ' Malignant prostatic tumor ', ' Prostate CA ', ' Prostate Cancer ', ' Prostatic Cancer ', ' Malignant neoplasm of prostate ', ' Life ', ' Event ', ' Tumor Tissue ', ' American ', ' advanced illness ', ' advanced disease ', ' novel ', ' Bypass ', ' p75 ', ' p75 transcription factor ', ' transcriptional coactivator p75 ', ' Modeling ', ' GIR receptor ', ' glucocorticoid-induced receptor ', ' receptor GPR83 ', ' glucocorticoid-induced orphan receptor ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Preclinical Models ', ' Pre-Clinical Model ', ' Receptor Signaling ', ' Cancer Patient ', ' Tissue Arrays ', ' Tissue Chip ', ' Tissue Microarray ', ' Xenograft Model ', ' Molecular ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' resistance to therapy ', ' resistant to therapy ', ' therapeutic resistance ', ' treatment resistance ', ' therapy resistant ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Population ', ' Prostate CA therapy ', ' prostate cancer treatment ', ' Prostate Cancer therapy ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' cancer disparity ', ' disparity in cancer ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' resistant ', ' Resistance ', ' Cellular model ', ' Cell model ', ' chemotherapy ', ' intervention design ', ' treatment design ', ' therapy design ', ' tumor ', ' new drug target ', ' new druggable target ', ' new pharmacotherapy target ', ' new therapy target ', ' novel drug target ', ' novel druggable target ', ' novel pharmacotherapy target ', ' novel therapeutic target ', ' novel therapy target ', ' new therapeutic target ', ' RNA Seq ', ' RNA sequencing ', ' RNAseq ', ' transcriptome sequencing ', ' prostate tumor cell ', ' prostate cancer cell ', ' prostate tumor model ', ' prostate cancer model ', ' disparities in race ', ' race disparity ', ' racial disparity ', ' prostate cancer cell line ', ' reduce disparity ', ' disparity reduction ', ' disparities in mortality ', ' mortality disparity ', ' liquid biopsy ', ' androgen ablation therapy ', ' androgen blockade therapy ', ' androgen deprivation treatment ', ' androgen deprivation therapy ', ' side effect ', ' advanced prostate cancer ', ' ']",NCI,LOMA LINDA UNIVERSITY,R21,2020,280306,-0.0765619821049586
"Smartphone-Delivered, Diabetes-Modified Behavioral Activation Treatment (Smartphone DM-BAT) in AAs With T2DM The proposed K24 renewal application is designed to support the career and research trajectory of the candidate by providing protected time to conduct patient-oriented research on interventions to reduce complications and deaths from diabetes in ethnic minority groups and mentor the next generation of women and minority clinical investigators in health disparities research. In the first 5 years of the current K24 grant, the candidate has trained 40 mentees including: 7 faculty, 2 post-docs, 2 doctoral students, 1 fellow, and 17 medical students. He has 147 abstracts/presentations and 156 peer-reviewed publications with mentees. In addition, in the past 5 years, he submitted 27 grants with mentees of which 10 were funded. The specific aims of the proposed K24 renewal application will be accomplished by completing the following three objectives: Mentoring Objective: To increase the pool of clinical researchers who can conduct patient-oriented research and successfully compete for peer-reviewed grants, as well as mentor the next generation of women and minority clinical investigators, who are engaged in the national effort to reduce and eliminate health care disparities. This will be accomplished by mentoring 2 women/minority investigators each year for 5 years. Career Development Objective: To obtain additional training in leadership, health economics, and health informatics that would greatly enhance the candidate's research capability and make him a more effective mentor to trainees in clinical research. This will be accomplished by completing 4 courses a year in leadership, health economics, and health informatics Research Objective: The primary objective is to test the efficacy of the Smartphone DM-BAT intervention comprised of smartphone-delivered, diabetes-modified behavioral activation treatment (education, skills training and behavior activation), home monitoring with feedback (FORA home telemonitoring system) and care delivered by nurse educators in improving HbA1c levels in AAs with poorly controlled T2DM. The secondary objectives are to test the efficacy of the Smartphone DM-BAT intervention in improving BP control and quality of life in AAs with poorly controlled T2DM. Exploratory analyses will examine the role of process (information, motivation, self-efficacy, depression) and behavioral measures (diet, exercise and medication adherence) as mediators of metabolic control. Mentorship is an important component of career advancement in academic medicine. Several studies have established that lack of mentoring is a reason for poor career advancement and attrition, particularly among women and minority faculty. The candidate who has a track record of mentoring women and minority faculty would benefit from the protected time for mentoring afforded by the proposed K24 renewal award, while allowing continued research to eliminate disparities in diabetes. The proposed K24 renewal application is designed to support the career and research trajectory of the candidate by providing protected time to conduct patient-oriented research on interventions to decrease morbidity/mortality from diabetes in ethnic minorities and mentor the next generation of women and minority clinical investigators in health disparities research.","Smartphone-Delivered, Diabetes-Modified Behavioral Activation Treatment (Smartphone DM-BAT) in AAs With T2DM",9980876,K24DK093699,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Affect ', ' Award ', ' Behavior ', ' Blood Glucose ', ' Blood Sugar ', ' Blood Pressure Monitors ', ' Continuous Sphygmomanometers ', ' Career Mobility ', ' career advancement ', ' career transition ', ' Clinical Investigator ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Cues ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Adult-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Ketosis-Resistant Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Maturity-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' NIDDM ', ' Non-Insulin Dependent Diabetes ', ' Noninsulin Dependent Diabetes ', ' Noninsulin Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Slow-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Stable Diabetes Mellitus ', ' T2 DM ', ' T2D ', ' T2DM ', ' Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Type 2 diabetes ', ' Type II Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Type II diabetes ', ' adult onset diabetes ', ' ketosis resistant diabetes ', ' maturity onset diabetes ', ' type 2 DM ', ' type II DM ', ' type two diabetes ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Faculty ', ' Nursing Faculty ', ' Clinical Faculty ', ' Clinical Nurse Educator ', ' Nurse Educator ', ' Nursing Staff Developer ', ' Nursing Staff Development Specialist ', ' Feedback ', ' Grant ', ' Glycosylated hemoglobin A ', ' Glycohemoglobin A ', ' Hb A1 ', ' Hb A1a+b ', ' Hb A1c ', ' HbA1 ', ' HbA1c ', ' Hemoglobin A(1) ', ' hemoglobin A1c ', ' Institute of Medicine (U.S.) ', ' Institute of Medicine ', ' NAS/IOM ', ' Leadership ', ' Literature ', ' Medicine ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Moods ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Motivation ', ' Patients ', ' Peer Review ', ' Productivity ', ' Publications ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Reading ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Rewards ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Medical Students ', ' medical school students ', ' Technology ', ' Psychotherapeutic Processes ', ' Psychiatric Therapeutic Processes ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Walkers ', ' Woman ', ' Afro American ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Black Populations ', ' black American ', ' African American ', ' Case Management ', ' Schedule ', ' Caring ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Peer Review Grants ', ' Training ', ' white American ', ' caucasian American ', ' Discipline ', ' Individual ', ' Funding ', ' Shapes ', ' Home ', ' Home environment ', ' System ', ' behavior change ', ' Postdoc ', ' Research Associate ', ' post-doc ', ' post-doctoral ', ' Postdoctoral Fellow ', ' skills training ', ' reinforced behavior ', ' Education and Training ', ' Training and Education ', ' behavioral measure ', ' behavioral measurement ', ' behavior measurement ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' Structure ', ' BP control ', ' BP homeostasis ', ' BP management ', ' BP regulation ', ' blood pressure control ', ' blood pressure homeostasis ', ' blood pressure management ', ' regulate BP ', ' regulate blood pressure ', ' blood pressure regulation ', ' member ', ' Care Manager ', ' Case Management Nurse ', ' Case Manager ', ' Reporting ', ' career development ', ' behavioral influence ', ' behavior influence ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' patient oriented study ', ' patient oriented research ', ' Cell Phone ', ' Cellular Telephone ', ' iPhone ', ' smart phone ', ' smartphone ', ' Cellular Phone ', ' Health Informatics ', ' consumer informatics ', ' Public Health Informatics ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Institution ', ' Mediator ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Videoconferencing ', ' Data ', ' High Prevalence ', ' Metabolic Control ', ' K24 Award ', ' Mid-Career Clinical Scientist Award (K24) ', ' Cognitive ', ' Underrepresented Ethnic Minority ', ' under-representation of minorities ', ' underrepresentation of minorities ', ' Underrepresented Minority ', ' Monitor ', ' Process ', ' Behavioral ', ' drug adherence ', ' drug compliance ', ' medication adherence ', ' medication compliance ', ' systematic review ', ' website ', ' web site ', ' health economics ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' next generation ', ' Minority ', ' ethnic minority ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' effective intervention ', ' efficacy testing ', ' Secure ', ' Ph D student ', ' Ph D. student ', ' Ph.

"Underutilization of Hospice in Older African Americans Project Summary/Abstract Hospice is underutilized, especially among African Americans (AA). Despite the documented benefits of hospice, less than 2 million people utilize hospice services annually. Underuse disparities are extreme across race and ethnicity as White Americans comprise 85% of all hospice enrollees. AAs account for only 8% of hospice enrollees but are more likely to die from the top three hospice diagnoses (i.e. cancer, heart disease and dementia) than White Americans. Even when AAs enroll in hospice, they spend less time in hospice than White patients, averaging fewer than seven days in hospice care. Notably, AA hospice enrollees report a higher degree of satisfaction with end of life care when hospice is involved, as compared to AAs who are not enrolled in hospice care. There are several potential barriers that may prevent AAs from enrolling in hospice care including lack of knowledge of hospice care, mistrust in healthcare, perceived discrimination, health literacy. AAs routinely report less knowledge of hospice than White Americans, and the information that AA know about hospice often comes from non-medical professionals and is inaccurate. Some AA have persistent mistrust in healthcare due to events such as the Tuskegee Syphilis Experiments and many AA perceive discrimination when accessing healthcare. Data shows that health literacy is a stronger predictor of hospice use than race and older AAs are more likely to possess low health literacy. The driving hypothesis of this research is that by providing clear and accurate information to older AAs will help address the underutilization of hospice by clarifying misperceptions, building trust, and overcoming literacy barriers. Patient decision aids (PtDAs) are an evidence-based approach to improve patient agency in medical decision making. Research shows that AA report a desire for more agency and autonomy in decision-making yet the use of PtDAs is understudied in AA communities. This proposal offers a unique opportunity to address many of the potential barriers that may prevent older AAs from enrolling in hospice, while simultaneously expanding the literature of SDM specific to older AAs. The goals of this proposal are to evaluate if the relationships between health literacy and hospice knowledge, attitudes, and beliefs is mediated by mistrust in healthcare and perceived discrimination among AAs aged 65 or older (Aim1) and to evaluate the effect of the hospice PtDA on changing hospice knowledge and attitudes and beliefs about hospice in AA aged 65 and older (Aim 2). Project Narrative Hospice is underutilized in African Americans. There are several potential reasons hospice is underutilized in African Americans including health literacy, lack of knowledge, mistrust in healthcare and perceived discrimination.

"Defining the Role of Management Factors in Outcome Disparity in Pediatric T1D Abstract Type 1 diabetes (T1D), one of the most prevalent incurable diseases of childhood, is associated with serious risk of morbidity and mortality due to the development of micro- and macrovascular complications. Complications can be prevented by treatment that achieves physiological or near physiological levels of glucose. Despite innovations in management over the past three decades, pediatric patients of African ancestry (AA) have persistently higher HbA1c than patients of white, European ancestry (EA). Higher HbA1c in AA patients is associated with both higher acute and chronic morbidity and mortality compared to EA patients. Thus, racial disparity in glycemic outcome and the development of complications is a major unresolved failure of current clinical pediatric diabetes treatment. Multiple factors contribute to high-risk levels of mean blood glucose (MBG) in pediatric AA patients compared to EA. AA patients have less access to insulin pumps, perform glucose testing less often, have less contact with diabetes management staff, and may have difficulty relating to management staff due to cultural and socioeconomic differences. Greater occurrence of hypoglycemia is another obstacle to achieving optimal glucose control. These considerations have led us to hypothesize that an intervention targeting this group of major management obstacles will sustainably reduce MBG to levels comparable to EA patients without increased hypoglycemia. In order to test this hypothesis, we will first (Aim 1) conduct focus groups with high- risk AA patients and their families to pre-test our intervention approach and receive feedback from them about how best to implement the program, allowing us to more specifically tailor the intervention to address their perceived barriers. This information will help guide the design of a new tailored intervention (Aim 2) for these patients. In Aim 2, we will demonstrate the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of safely reducing high-risk, complication-producing levels of MBG among AA patients with T1D in a randomized pilot study using innovative hybrid closed-loop pump technology combined with a customized culturally sensitive program of enhanced patient support. This approach will intervene simultaneously with multiple obstacles previously known and currently identified by participants that confront high-risk patients and interfere with optimal management. We have the benefit of an experienced and interdisciplinary investigative team with a track record of research productivity in this area. We have a large, well-characterized, diabetes clinic population. Our patients and families have enthusiastically participated in many clinical research projects in the past. We expect that the experience and insights gained from this project will inform the design and implementation of a subsequent larger effectiveness study to improve outcomes for high-risk pediatric patients with T1D. Frequently Used Abbreviations: AA=African ancestry, EA= European ancestry, HbA1c=Hemoglobin A1c, MBG=mean blood glucose, T1D=Type 1 diabetes, HCL=Hybrid closed-loop, CGM=continuous glucose monitoring Narrative Despite clinical treatment advances over the last 30 years, African ancestry (AA) youth with type 1 diabetes have persistently higher HbA1c than patients of European ancestry (EA). The proposed research will determine the feasibility of a novel intervention combining hybrid closed-loop pump technology with customized behavioral management support and enhanced participant contact to safely reduce MBGs and sustain that improvement among high-risk AA patients.",Defining the Role of Management Factors in Outcome Disparity in Pediatric T1D,9989833,R21DK118643,"['Abbreviations ', ' Blood Glucose ', ' Blood Sugar ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' children ', "" childrens' "", ' youngster ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Complication ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Brittle Diabetes Mellitus ', ' IDDM ', ' Juvenile-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Ketosis-Prone Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Sudden-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' T1 DM ', ' T1 diabetes ', ' T1D ', ' T1DM ', ' Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Type 1 diabetes ', ' Type I Diabetes Mellitus ', ' insulin dependent diabetes ', ' juvenile diabetes ', ' juvenile diabetes mellitus ', ' ketosis prone diabetes ', ' type I diabetes ', ' type one diabetes ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Family ', ' Fright ', ' Fear ', ' Feedback ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Glucose ', ' D-Glucose ', ' Dextrose ', ' Goals ', ' Glycosylated hemoglobin A ', ' Glycohemoglobin A ', ' Hb A1 ', ' Hb A1a+b ', ' Hb A1c ', ' HbA1 ', ' HbA1c ', ' Hemoglobin A(1) ', ' hemoglobin A1c ', ' Hybrids ', ' Hyperglycemia ', ' hyperglycemic ', ' Hypoglycemia ', ' hypoglycemic ', ' hypoglycemic episodes ', ' indexing ', ' Insulin ', ' Humulin R ', ' Novolin R ', ' Regular Insulin ', ' Insulin Infusion Systems ', ' insulin pump ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Parents ', ' Patients ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Productivity ', ' Public Health ', ' Race ', ' Racial Group ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Treatment Protocols ', ' Treatment Regimen ', ' Treatment Schedule ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Youth ', ' Custom ', ' Pump ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Acute ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' Failure ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' insight ', ' African ', ' European ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R01 Program ', ' Research Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' programs ', ' Clinic ', ' experience ', ' cognitive defects ', ' Cognitive deficits ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' glucometer ', ' glucose meter ', ' glucose monitor ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Effectiveness ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' Adherence ', ' Data ', ' randomisation ', ' randomization ', ' randomly assigned ', ' Randomized ', ' trial regimen ', ' trial treatment ', ' Clinical Treatment ', ' Collection ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' follow-up ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio-economically ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomics ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' macrovascular complication ', ' macrovascular disease ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' diabetic management ', ' diabetes management ', ' intervention efficacy ', ' therapeutic efficacy ', ' therapeutically effective ', ' therapy efficacy ', ' Treatment Efficacy ', ' Outcome ', ' glucose control ', ' glucose homeostasis ', ' glucose regulation ', ' blood glucose regulation ', ' Population ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' resistant ', ' Resistance ', ' high risk ', ' Regimen ', ' microvascular complications ', ' microvascular disease ', ' small vessel disease ', ' Microvascular Dysfunction ', ' child patients ', ' pediatric patients ', ' disparities in race ', ' race disparity ', ' racial disparity ', ' cognitive development ', ' family support ', ' improved outcome ', ' over-treatment ', ' overtreatment ', ' diabetes during childhood ', ' diabetes in childhood ', ' diabetes in children ', ' pediatric diabetes ', ' Childhood diabetes ', ' health goals ', ' effectiveness testing ', ' ']",NIDDK,CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL (NEW ORLEANS),R21,2020,157330,0.11848034827473501
"The FAITH! Trial:  A mHealth Intervention to Improve Cardiovascular Health Among African-Americans PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Cardiovascular disease (CVD) afflicts nearly 50% of all African-American (AA) adults, and they are 30% more likely to die from CVD than the overall US population. Compared to non-Hispanic whites, AAs are 82% less likely to meet the ideal levels for 5 or more of the cardiovascular (CV) health components that comprise the American Heart Association (AHA) Life's Simple 7 (LS7). LS7 is an evidenced-based metric of 7 health- promoting behaviors and biological risk factors that improves CV outcomes: physical activity, diet, smoking, body mass index, blood pressure, total cholesterol, and glucose. AAs have poorer health status than whites in every LS7 component except total cholesterol. Mobile health (mHealth) lifestyle interventions through digital communication and devices are promising ways to improve CV health and outcomes among AAs; however, there is a paucity of effective, culturally relevant, evidenced-based interventions available. The major goal of our project is to apply a community-based participatory research approach to rigorously refine and test the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of our existing CV health/wellness digital application (app) prototype to improve CV health among AAs. The refined app will focus on promoting the LS7 framework with incorporation of user-individualized and interpersonal features. We hypothesize that our behavioral theory-informed, app- based, intervention will be feasible and improve CV health among AAs in faith communities from baseline to 6- months post-intervention. This R21 proposal aligns with the NIMHD's focus on “impacting the health determinants that contribute to poor health outcomes and to health disparity conditions”. Building on our longstanding partnership with local AA churches and preliminary work, we propose two aims. Aim 1 will refine our app to promote LS7 with inclusion of user-individualized and interpersonal features. We will use a formative research process and qualitative methods to refine the app within a focus group series with 15 AA adult community members. Primary outcomes are app usability and user satisfaction. Aim 2 will assess the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of the refined app for promoting LS7 among AA adults in faith communities by conducting a cluster randomized controlled trial of 200 AA adults. Primary outcomes are change in LS7 score from baseline to 6-months post- intervention and app engagement/usability. Secondary outcomes include the following psychosocial measures: self-efficacy, self-regulation, social support, religiosity/spirituality, optimism and perceived stress. An established community steering committee will provide input for all activities. Our project is innovative as our mHealth lifestyle intervention integrates behavioral theory-informed and empirically-supported components to influence LS7 among AAs. If successful, our results can pave the way for use of evidence-based mHealth tools to increase prevalence of ideal CV health among AAs and other underserved populations. PROJECT NARRATIVE African-Americans (AAs) are more likely to die from cardiovascular disease than the overall US population and have significantly poorer cardiovascular (CV) health than whites as defined by the American Heart Association Life's Simple 7 (AHA LS7). Our proposed study aims to refine and test the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of a culturally relevant mobile health (mHealth) intervention (a CV health and wellness digital application) to promote the AHA LS7 among AAs within faith communities.

"Designing a Plan of Action for Better Access and Quality of Surgery for African-Americans with Gastrointestinal Cancers in the Deep South Current evidence shows that African-Americans (AAs) with gastrointestinal (GI) cancers (colorectal, pancreatic and esophageal cancer) are less likely to undergo surgery, and suggests that those who undergo surgery may be less likely to receive best-evidence surgical care that is timely and minimizes adverse surgical outcomes. An effort to eliminate these racial/ethnic disparities is warranted especially in Alabama (AL) and Mississippi (MS). These two states of the US Deep South have high GI cancer incidence and mortality, and high mortality for AAs in particular, large AA populations, and challenges for access to quality care such as limited affordability and availability. Neither surgical care disparities nor their driving mechanisms have been examined in these states. In addition, lay navigation and Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS) are effective models on which to build a plan to eliminate surgical disparities. At our institution, the implementation of ERAS processes has led to the elimination of surgical disparities in length of stay without compromising surgical outcomes. Our long term objective is to ultimately eliminate disparities in GI cancer surgery care and outcomes by improving access to timely surgery and facilitating the adoption of ERAS in AL and MS. Our aims are to: 1) Identify gaps in surgical care for GI cancers in AL and MS. With a survey of 450 AA and 550 white GI cancer patients, and medical chart abstraction, we will assess differences for AAs and whites in i) receipt of surgery, ii) time from diagnosis to surgery, and iii) exposure to 17 ERAS processes; 2) Examine potential mechanisms of surgical disparities. Combining survey results with those of individual interviews with 48 AA and white patients and with 48 GI cancer care providers in a mixed methods integrated analysis, we will provide a comprehensive assessment of patient, provider, and system level factors that affect access to care mechanisms, i.e., whether surgery care and ERAS processes are acceptable, affordable, available, accessible and accommodating; 3) Assess the feasibility of a combined surgery-focused lay navigation and ERAS intervention in GI cancer. Results from Aims 1 an 2 will guide the development of a surgery-focused navigator program to facilitate access to timely surgery and support patients in the peri- to post- surgery phases. By accomplishing Aims 1-3, we will define: i) future intervention targets for GI cancer patients in AL and MS, i.e., populations and surgery processes; ii) mechanisms to address in order to achieve effective surgical care; and iii) a surgery focused navigation program to optimize the uptake of surgery and implementation of ERAS for AAs. Thus, the expected outcome of this project is a concrete and detailed actionable plan to eliminate surgical disparities in AL and MS. Without this significant new knowledge, progress toward the elimination of disparities in GI cancer surgery is hindered. With this plan, we will be well prepared to achieve our objective and have a high impact on the goals of the National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities (NIMHD) and the National Cancer Institute (NCI) to advance scientific knowledge that will help all people live longer, healthier lives, and eliminate health disparities. This project is relevant to public health because, while surgery is one crucial step to achieve curative intent for patients with gastrointestinal cancers, disparities in access and quality of surgery care exist for African American patients. To address these disparities in two states of the Deep South, we propose to identify gaps in surgical care, examine potential mechanisms that contribute to these gaps, and develop a surgery-focused lay navigation model in combination with Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS) processes to support African American GI cancer patients from the pre to post surgery. The product of this project, i.e., a plan to eliminate surgical disparities in this region, is relevant to the National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities (NIMHD) and the National Cancer Institute (NCI) as reported in PAR- 18-288 on Surgical Disparities Research.",Designing a Plan of Action for Better Access and Quality of Surgery for African-Americans with Gastrointestinal Cancers in the Deep South,9947692,R01MD013858,"['Adoption ', ' Affect ', ' Alabama ', ' Automobile Driving ', ' driving ', ' Ursidae Family ', ' Bears ', ' Ursidae ', ' bear ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Economics ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' Access to Care ', ' access to health services ', ' access to services ', ' access to treatment ', ' accessibility to health services ', ' availability of services ', ' care access ', ' health service access ', ' health services availability ', ' service availability ', ' treatment access ', ' Hospital Records ', ' Incidence ', ' Institutes ', ' Interview ', ' Length of Stay ', ' Number of Days in Hospital ', ' hospital days ', ' hospital length of stay ', ' hospital stay ', ' Methods ', ' Mississippi ', ' mortality ', ' Patients ', ' Postoperative Period ', ' Post-Operative ', ' Postoperative ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Social Environment ', ' social climate ', ' social context ', ' socioenvironment ', ' socioenvironmental ', ' Standardization ', ' Stress ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Universities ', ' County ', ' Afro American ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Black Populations ', ' black American ', ' African American ', ' Research Methods ', ' Research Methodology ', ' Caring ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' Medical ', ' Individual ', ' Recovery ', ' uptake ', ' Exposure to ', ' Malignant Pancreatic Neoplasm ', ' Pancreas Cancer ', ' Pancreatic Cancer ', ' pancreatic malignancy ', ' Malignant neoplasm of pancreas ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Adopted ', ' System ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Surgical ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' surgery ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' Esophageal Cancer ', ' Esophagus Cancer ', ' Malignant Esophageal Neoplasm ', ' Malignant Esophageal Tumor ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Esophagus ', ' oesophageal cancer ', ' Malignant neoplasm of esophagus ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' GI cancers ', ' GI malignancies ', ' GI tract cancers ', ' Gastrointestinal Cancer ', ' Gastrointestinal Tract Cancer ', ' Malignant Gastrointestinal Neoplasm ', ' gastrointestinal malignancies ', ' Malignant neoplasm of gastrointestinal tract ', ' Reporting ', ' Modeling ', ' QOC ', ' Quality of Care ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' cancer surgery ', ' Cancer Treatment ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Therapy ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Treatment ', ' anti-cancer therapy ', ' anticancer therapy ', ' cancer therapy ', ' cancer care ', ' Provider ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Institution ', ' US State ', ' Geographic state ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Improve Access ', ' NCI Organization ', ' National Cancer Institute ', ' Cancer Patient ', ' Perioperative ', ' scientific accomplishments ', ' scientific advances ', ' Scientific Advances and Accomplishments ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Colo-rectal Cancer ', ' Colorectal Cancer ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' minority health ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Deep South ', ' cancer disparity ', ' disparity in cancer ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' prototype ', ' multi-modality ', ' multimodality ', ' effective intervention ', ' reduce disparity ', ' disparity reduction ', ' primary care provider ', ' care providers ', ' health care outcomes ', ' healthcare outcomes ', ' care outcomes ', ' surgical outcome ', ' surgery outcome ', ' post-operative recovery ', ' recovery after surgery ', ' recovery following surgery ', ' postoperative recovery ', ' socio-demographics ', ' sociodemographics ', ' ']",NIMHD,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,R01,2020,631122,0.09873555429280781
"The role of resilience in addressing racial disparities in adverse HIV-related outcomes Project Summary/Abstract  In the United States (U.S.), African Americans/Blacks (AAs) are the racial/ethnic group most adversely impacted by the HIV epidemic. As such, one of the goals of the White House National HIV/AIDS Strategy is to permanently reduce long-standing health disparities in HIV disease. Lower HIV clinic attendance and suboptimal antiretroviral therapy (ART) use (i.e., initiation, modification, and adherence) by AAs are likely the main mediators of continually worse HIV virologic responses among AAs compared to Caucasians. However, despite the development and implementation of interventions targeting many known individual-level risk and protective factors for clinic attendance and ART use, substantial racial disparities remain. Persistent disparities may be due, in part, to the adverse conditions that characterize the high risk neighborhood environments (e.g., socioeconomic deprivation and violence) in which HIV+ AAs disproportionately reside. However, despite such adversities some AAs demonstrate resilience (i.e., displaying positive behaviors/outcomes despite adversity) which may be critical to reducing persistent racial disparities. Compared to the risk environment, individual, interpersonal, and neighborhood resilience represent novel and more malleable intervention targets for reducing persistent disparities. Unfortunately, resilience remains understudied in the HIV literature, perhaps due to the absence of a reliable and valid resilience measure for HIV+ adults that captures all resilience components. The objective of the proposed research is to develop a reliable and valid measure of individual, interpersonal, and neighborhood resilience; to document its psychometric properties; and to assess longitudinally whether higher resilience facilitates positive HIV outcomes among HIV+ AAs by the level of the risk environment. Data on HIV+ AAs enrolled in the UNC CFAR HIV Clinical Cohort and the UAB 1917 Clinic Cohort will be used for the proposed study. Specifically, this study aims to (1) use advanced concept mapping, which is a mixed methods approach, to generate items that capture all components of resilience; (2) perform psychometric testing of concept mapping items to create a reliable and valid resilience measure that includes all components of resilience; (3a) examine whether resilience and non-resilience individual-level factors (e.g., alcohol/drug use, mental illness, and health insurance) are prospectively associated with HIV outcomes (e.g., clinic attendance, ART adherence, and virologic suppression) by the level of the neighborhood risk environment; and (3b) assess for interactions between resilience and non-resilience individual-level factors by the level of the risk environment. This study responds to the critical need to develop a multi-component resilience measure for HIV+ adults and to establish whether resilience facilitates positive HIV outcomes among HIV+ AAs. Our important findings may lead to the development and implementation of novel multilevel resilience-related interventions to reduce persistent racial disparities in HIV disease. Project Narrative  This innovative project will determine whether resilience facilitates positive HIV outcomes among HIV+ African American/Black (AA) adults in the United States (U.S.) by the level of the neighborhood risk environment. Completing this work will provide critical evidence about the relationship between resilience and HIV outcomes among HIV+ AAs from two longitudinal HIV clinic cohort studies. Such critical evidence is necessary to justify the investment of limited resources into developing interventions targeted at enhancing resilience among AAs to (a) reduce persistent HIV racial disparities in the U.S. and (b) help achieve the goals of the White House National HIV/AIDS Strategy.",The role of resilience in addressing racial disparities in adverse HIV-related outcomes,9936346,R01MH112386,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Alcohols ', ' Alcohol Chemical Class ', ' Behavior ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' psychological disorder ', ' Buffers ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Environment ', ' Epidemic ', ' Ethnic group ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Family ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' HIV ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' HIV Seropositivity ', ' Anti-HIV Positivity ', ' HIV Positive ', ' HIV Positivity ', ' HIV Seroconversion ', ' HIV antibody positive ', ' HTLV-III Seroconversion ', ' HTLV-III Seropositivity ', ' Health Insurance ', ' health insurance plan ', ' Investments ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Literature ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Methods ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Persons ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Psychometrics ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Testing ', ' United States ', ' Violence ', ' violent ', ' violent behavior ', ' virology ', ' Caucasians ', ' Caucasian ', ' Caucasian Race ', ' Caucasoid ', ' Caucasoid Race ', ' Occidental ', ' white race ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Afro American ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Black Populations ', ' black American ', ' African American ', ' Mediating ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' Failure ', ' Individual ', ' drug use ', ' Drug usage ', ' Research Priority ', ' Clinic ', ' experience ', ' cohort ', ' novel ', ' AIDS/HIV ', ' HIV/AIDS ', ' HIV/AIDS problem ', ' AIDS/HIV problem ', ' Sampling ', ' Property ', ' response ', ' deprivation ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' therapy adherence ', ' Mediator ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Address ', ' Adherence ', ' Data ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Modification ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio-economically ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomics ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' anti-retroviral therapy ', ' anti-retroviral treatment ', ' antiretroviral treatment ', ' antiretroviral therapy ', ' resilience ', ' Outcome ', ' Prevalence ', ' prospective ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' high risk ', ' disparities in race ', ' race disparity ', ' racial disparity ', ' behavior outcome ', ' behavioral outcome ', ' concept maps ', ' concept mapping ', ' protective factors ', ' ']",NIMH,BROWN UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,559735,0.0633305176792059
"Daily Experiences among Black and White Dementia Caregivers: Implications for Well-being and Cardiovascular Health African Americans (AAs) are 2 to 3 more times more likely have Alzheimer’s disease and related dementia (ADRD) compared to European Americans (EAs), placing high burden on AA families. AA ADRD caregivers tend to report better mental health but worse physical health than EA ADRD caregivers. Caregiving predicts increased risk of hypertension and coronary heart disease (CHD), which are more common among AAs than EAs. Studies of daily experiences provide crucial information regarding the mechanisms by which caregiving experience is linked with health, yet little is known about race differences in daily positive and negative experiences among ADRD caregivers or their links with daily well-being and cardiovascular health. In response to PAR-18- 027 Research on Informal and Formal Caregiving for Alzheimer's Disease, the present study seeks to understand the dynamic associations between daily experiences, well-being, and cardiovascular health among AA and EA ADRD caregivers. We will collect detailed self-report and cardiovascular data with two components: 1) a baseline interview, and 2) a daily study which incorporates a 5-day, 6-times a day, ecological momentary assessments (EMAs) of self-reported exposure and reactivity (psychological and behavioral) to negative and positive events, as well two ambulatory monitoring devices to assess cardiovascular reactivity (heart rate, heart rate variability, and blood pressure). The persons living with dementia (PLWDs) will also wear a monitor to assess heart rate, and heart rate variability. The sample will include 150 EA and 150 AA caregivers (70% women; 30% men) in the Detroit metropolitan area (recruited via area agencies and community organizations) who co-reside with and provide unpaid caregiving for a PLWD. The study addresses three aims: 1) Compare daily positive and negative care-related and noncare experiences among AA and EA caregivers, 2) Examine links among daily experiences (positive and negative care- related and noncare experiences), daily self-reported well-being, and daily cardiovascular health among AA and EA caregivers and the PLWD, and 3) Identify AA and AE caregivers who are more or less resilient to daily care-related and non-care stress. Identifying racial disparities in daily experiences that shape mental and physical health will inform targeted interventions to maintain caregivers’ well-being and enhance their ability to provide quality care. African Americans (AAs) are 2 to 3 more times more likely have Alzheimer’s disease or related dementia (ADRD) compared to European Americans (EAs), placing high burden on AA families. The present study seeks to understand the dynamic associations between daily experiences, well-being and cardiovascular health among AA and EA caregivers of individuals with ADRD. Understanding the biological and social mechanisms by which race is linked with the cardiovascular system is key for potentially reducing racial disparities in hypertension and hypertension related mortality among ADRD caregivers.",Daily Experiences among Black and White Dementia Caregivers: Implications for Well-being and Cardiovascular Health,9956977,R01AG063200,"[""Alzheimer's Disease "", ' AD dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer syndrome ', "" Alzheimer's "", "" Alzheimer's disease dementia "", ' Alzheimers Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Behavior ', ' Blood Pressure ', ' Buffers ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' circulatory system ', ' Coronary heart disease ', ' Coronary Disease ', ' atherosclerotic heart disease ', ' coronary disorder ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Eating ', ' Food Intake ', ' Family ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' Heart Rate ', ' Cardiac Chronotropism ', ' Hypertension ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' high blood pressure ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' Interview ', ' Literature ', ' Long-Term Care ', ' extended care ', ' longterm care ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' mortality ', ' Persons ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' well-being ', ' wellbeing ', ' Race ', ' Racial Group ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Smoking ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Stress ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Woman ', ' Caregivers ', ' Care Givers ', ' falls ', ' Afro American ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Black Populations ', ' black American ', ' African American ', ' Family Care Giver ', ' Family Caregiver ', ' Caring ', ' Social Network ', ' base ', ' Area ', ' Biological ', ' psychological ', ' psychologic ', ' Link ', ' disability ', ' Individual ', ' Health Care Utilization ', ' health care service use ', ' healthcare service use ', ' healthcare service utilization ', ' healthcare utilization ', ' health care service utilization ', ' European ', ' Outpatient Monitoring ', ' Ambulatory Monitoring ', ' Shapes ', ' Knowledge ', ' Emotional well being ', ' Feels well ', ' Normal mental condition ', ' Normal mental state ', ' Normal psyche ', ' Psychological Well Being ', ' Sense of well-being ', ' emotional wellbeing ', ' mental well-being ', ' mental wellbeing ', ' psychological wellbeing ', ' psychological wellness ', ' self wellness ', ' sense of wellbeing ', ' Well in self ', ' Hour ', ' Event ', ' Amentia ', ' Dementia ', ' physical health ', ' physical conditioning ', ' psychosocial ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' monitoring device ', ' metropolitan ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' race differences ', ' racial difference ', ' vigilance ', ' Reporting ', ' feeling distress ', ' feeling upset ', ' emotional distress ', ' social ', ' Emotional ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' QOC ', ' Quality of Care ', ' response ', ' theories ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Mobile Phones ', ' Car Phone ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Monitor ', ' Behavioral ', ' care giving ', ' caregiving ', ' cost ', ' resilience ', ' Outcome ', ' coping ', ' Individual Differences ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' community organizations ', ' heart rate variability ', ' stress reactivity ', ' disparities in race ', ' race disparity ', ' racial disparity ', ' cardiovascular health ', ' Ecological momentary assessment ', ' care giver well-being ', ' care giver wellbeing ', ' caregiver wellbeing ', ' Caregiver well-being ', ' Informal care giving ', ' informal caregiving ', ' dementia care giver ', ' Dementia caregivers ', ' Formal care giving ', ' Formal caregiving ', ' disparities in mortality ', ' mortality disparity ', ' physical symptom ', ' recruit ', ' AD related dementia ', ' ADRD ', ' Alzheimer related dementia ', "" Alzheimer's disease related dementia "", ' social relationships ', ' ']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2020,764935,0.05445914148808108
"The Impact of the Intrauterine and Early Childhood Environments on Neurocognitive and Metabolic Development in African American Youth: Focus on the Gut-Brain Axis Abstract of Funded ECHO Parent Grant (UH3OD023318) Environmental exposures during the critical prenatal and early childhood periods can result in lifelong health consequences. Mechanisms underlying these exposure-health relationships are complex, with exogenous exposures (such as chemical toxicants, infectious agents, diet) and endogenous processes (such as gene expression, inflammation and oxidative stress) activating metabolic pathways that lead to adverse health outcomes. Both adverse exposures and their health consequences disproportionately impact African American (AA) women and children, highlighting that health disparities begin in utero and are amplified postnatally. Among outcomes disproportionately experienced by AA children are preterm birth, neurodevelopmental deficits, and obesity – all linked to environmental exposures, yet poorly understood due to their etiologic complexity. Our team is currently investigating preterm birth and neurodevelopment through 18-months in relation to pre- and postnatal exposures to environmental toxicants and biopsychosocial risk factors in cohorts of pregnant AA women (R01NR014800, R01MD009064) and their infants (R01MD009746) and via our P50 Children's Center (P50ES026071) in collaboration with the Emory HERCULES Exposome Research Center (P30 ES019776). Through ECHO, we propose to elucidate exposures and risk pathways that contribute to neurodevelopmental deficits and obesity in preschool aged AA children by: (1) Assembling an Atlanta ECHO cohort of ~440 AA socioeconomically diverse mother-child pairs by combining extant cohorts for whom the prenatal, perinatal, and early childhood environments are, or will be, characterized; (2) Completing the analysis and synthesis of data from the Atlanta ECHO cohort to characterize mother-child pairs in terms of prenatal and early childhood exposures (toxicants, stressors and neuroendocrine-immune activation, nutritional and metabolic status, microbiome and infections, bonding and interaction); epigenetic and metabolomic profiles; and perinatal outcomes (gestational age, size-for-gestation); (3) Testing cohort-specific hypotheses related to prenatal and early childhood exposures and neurodevelopmental outcomes and obesity in AA children at 2, 3, 4, and 5 years of age; (4) Participating in ECHO-wide consortium studies to identify risk and protective factors that moderate associations between environmental exposures, typical growth and development, and adverse child health outcomes. Our cohort's participation in the ECHO consortium will contribute to a biopsychosocial understanding of within- and between-race risk for adverse child health outcomes, providing insight into risk and protective factors relevant to AA families. The proposed research is consistent with frameworks for eliminating racial disparities, which recognize the need to study risks within-race as a vital first step, and is congruent with the National Institute of Minority Health and Health Disparities goal of promoting understanding of the biological mechanisms involved in conditions that disproportionately affect health disparity populations.

"A nutrition-based approach to reduce heart disease risk among overweight African Americans: Use of soul food plant-based or omnivorous diets to address cardiovascular disease African Americans (AAs) are disproportionately affected by cardiovascular disease (CVD), having the highest death rates from CVD as compared with other racial/ethnic groups. In addition, AAs have the highest rates of obesity as compared to whites and Hispanics. People following plant-based dietary approaches, particularly vegan or vegetarian diets, have lower risks of CVD and lower body weights than omnivores. Vegan and vegetarian diets have been used effectively for weight loss and maintenance and for reversing CVD. Although intervention trials have shown a significant weight-loss and cholesterol-lowering effect of adoption of plant-based diets, t o date, most of these large randomized trials have had limited participation from AA participants. AAs tend to lose less weight during behavioral interventions than their white counterparts. In addition, most research has shown that AAs are more likely to discontinue participation in behavioral dietary interventions. This combination of higher attrition and lower weight loss may be due to a failure to address issues that are culturally relevant to the AA population. Our recent 6-month trial examined the use of a vegan diet as compared to 4 other plant-based dietary approaches (vegetarian, pesco-vegetarian, semi-vegetarian, or omnivorous). Weight loss among AAs in the vegan diet was significantly greater (-8.5±3.3%, n=3) than AAs randomized to diet approaches that will be similar to the omnivorous approach in our proposed study (semi- vegetarian/omnivorous groups, 1.4±1.8%, n=3). Of the 12 AA participants who began the study, only one did not complete the study (8% attrition rate) compared to 12 out of the 49 white participants (24% attrition). In total, these results point to the potential of an entirely plant-based dietary intervention to overcome two barriers encountered in previous studies aiming to improve dietary intake and weight loss among overweight AAs for CVD prevention: low weight loss results and high attrition rates.  The goal of this proposed study is to apply these findings in a CVD prevention intervention specifically for AAs living in the southeast U.S. We have developed a partnership with the owners of two soul food restaurants in Columbia, SC (one vegan, the other traditional).These restaurants, which focus on southern cuisine, are owned and operated by local AA families, and will assist with developing culturally-appropriate recipes for our intervention. W e will conduct a two-year dietary trial among overweight AA adults (N=130) randomized to follow one of two diets both emphasizing southern food culture and low-glycemic index and low-fat foods: Vegan or Omnivorous (omni) diet. This study will compare the impact of these diet patterns on changes in CVD risk factors, including LDL cholesterol and blood pressure, and body weight. If this intervention proves to be successful at reducing weight and CVD risk factors among AAs, it has the potential to be disseminated through a variety of locations throughout the US, including restaurants, federally qualified health clinics, churches, or neighborhood community centers. Our proposed project will examine the effect of adopting two different dietary patterns (vegan and omnivorous), which focus on southern cuisine, on both cardiovascular disease risk factors and weight loss among overweight African American adults. Our proposed research study will use a randomized design to examine the effects of adopting these two dietary patterns on cardiovascular disease risk factors and weight loss. We will partner with two local community restaurants to help inform intervention and recipe development.",A nutrition-based approach to reduce heart disease risk among overweight African Americans: Use of soul food plant-based or omnivorous diets to address cardiovascular disease,10072107,R01HL135220,"['Adoption ', ' Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Affect ', ' Behavior ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' behavior intervention ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' Blood Pressure ', ' Body Weight ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cholesterol ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Communities ', ' Diet ', ' dietary ', ' Ethnic group ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Family ', ' Fatty acid glycerol esters ', ' Fats ', ' Food ', ' Food or Food Product ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Heart Diseases ', ' Cardiac Diseases ', ' Cardiac Disorders ', ' heart disorder ', ' LDL Cholesterol Lipoproteins ', ' LDL Cholesterol ', ' Low Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol ', ' beta-Lipoprotein Cholesterol ', ' Maintenance ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' nutrition ', ' Obesity ', ' adiposity ', ' corpulence ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulentia ', ' obese ', ' obese people ', ' obese person ', ' obese population ', ' Plants ', ' Edible Plants ', ' Food Plants ', ' Research ', ' Restaurants ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Southeastern United States ', ' Southeast U.S. ', ' Southeast US ', ' Taste Perception ', ' Gustation ', ' Taste ', ' gustatory perception ', ' gustatory processing ', ' gustatory response ', ' taste processing ', ' taste response ', ' Testing ', ' Body Weight decreased ', ' Weight Loss ', ' Weight Reduction ', ' body weight loss ', ' wt-loss ', ' Weight ', ' Afro American ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Black Populations ', ' black American ', ' African American ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Latino Population ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' hispanic community ', ' Hispanics ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Death Rate ', ' Ensure ', ' Failure ', ' African ', ' satisfaction ', ' Nutrition Interventions ', ' Nutritional Interventions ', ' diet intervention ', ' Dietary Intervention ', ' Letters ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' Vegetarianism ', ' Vegetarian diet ', ' cooking ', ' vegan ', ' veganism ', ' Vegan Diet ', ' Adopted ', ' Clinic ', ' Pattern ', ' Location ', ' Over weight ', ' Overweight ', ' Church ', ' CVD prevention ', ' cardiac disease prevention ', ' cardiovascular disease prevention ', ' cardiovascular disorder prevention ', ' cohort ', ' Recipe ', ' Participant ', ' research study ', ' Interventional trial ', ' Intervention Trial ', ' cardiovascular risk ', ' cardiovascular risk factor ', ' Sampling ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Meta-Analysis ', ' cardiac disease risk ', ' cardiac disorder risk ', ' heart disorder risk ', ' heart disease risk ', ' cardiovascular disease risk ', ' cardiovascular disorder risk ', ' Glycemic Index Number ', ' Glycemic Index ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Dietary intake ', ' Address ', ' dietary pattern ', ' Dietary Practices ', ' Preventative intervention ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' randomisation ', ' randomization ', ' randomly assigned ', ' Randomized ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' weight maintenance ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Population ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' Randomization trial ', ' randomized trial ', ' dietary approach ', ' community center ', ' ']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA AT COLUMBIA,R01,2020,113370,0.027728288462345874
"The OPTIMIZE Study: Optimizing Patient Navigation for Perinatal Care Persistent and worsening racial and ethnic disparities in maternal and infant outcomes in the US are urgent public health concerns. African American (AA) women have about twice the risk of preterm birth and low birthweight compared with non-Hispanic white women and are more likely to suffer from complications of pregnancy and severe maternal morbidity. As these disparities worsen, there has been renewed focus on perinatal care. The perinatal period, those weeks before and after birth, has important implications for a woman's health and that of her child. Unfortunately, the prevailing perinatal standard care model has been stagnant for decades and is not meeting the needs of AA women, especially with consideration to Social Determinants of Health (SDH) and the `fourth trimester' postpartum period proposed by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG). Patient navigation (PN) has demonstrated efficacy in improving consistency of care and addressing SDH among AA women. However, traditional PN models are economically challenging to scale and sustain, suggesting that a PN paradigm shift is needed – one that minimizes the need for in-person navigators and places greater focus on clinic and systems level care improvement that integrates local and federally program support addressing SDH. Building on our decade of work in PN in women's health and care coordination checklists, we propose to develop a learning health care delivery approach to PN centered around an OPTIMIZE integrated and comprehensive perinatal care checklist. OPTIMIZE is highly aligned with ACOG endorsement of checklists for enhancing processes of care and teamwork. Through a Hybrid type 1 cluster randomized effectiveness-implementation trial, we will compare the effectiveness of the OPTIMIZE intervention relative to standard care in improving patient receipt of integrated and comprehensive perinatal care (prenatal content, postpartum content, and SDH content) tailored to a woman's individual needs, while evaluating intervention implementation. N=600 AA women in their 1st or 2nd trimester of pregnancy will be recruited from 20 clinics affiliated with two community health center networks that provide the majority of perinatal care for AA women in Chicago. Clinics will be randomized 1:1 to standard care (control) or standard care plus OPTIMIZE checklist with PN support (intervention) starting from the initial prenatal visit and through 12-weeks postpartum. The OPTIMIZE checklist will scale the reach of navigators by facilitating coordination and integration of efforts across perinatal care domains and integrating a SDH orientation to perinatal care. The checklist, tailored to the workflow within each clinic, will contain prenatal, postpartum, and SDH content for each patient. The primary outcome is patient receipt of perinatal care components in these 3 content areas collected by medical records review. Secondary outcomes include depressive symptoms, breastfeeding, vaccine (Tdap, influenza, HPV) and contraception uptake. The Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research will guide our mixed-methods approach to evaluate intervention implementation and identify implementation facilitators and barriers. PROJECT NARRATIVE African American women and their infants experience profound perinatal health disparities in the US, and these are even more striking in Chicago. We hypothesize that an integrated and comprehensive perinatal care checklist with patient navigation support may help address these disparities, in particular by increasing patient receipt of prenatal care content, postpartum care content, and local and community resources to address social and economic issues. We propose to test this hypothesis by conducting a pragmatic, randomized trial in community health centers to evaluate the effectiveness and implementation of the checklist strategy.",The OPTIMIZE Study: Optimizing Patient Navigation for Perinatal Care,9990894,R01MD014068,"['Anxiety ', ' Attention ', ' Bandage ', ' Birth ', ' Parturition ', ' Breast Feeding ', ' Breast fed ', ' Breastfed ', ' Breastfeeding ', ' Chicago ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' children ', "" childrens' "", ' youngster ', ' Communities ', ' health care delivery ', ' Healthcare Delivery ', ' health services delivery ', ' Economics ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Health Personnel ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' health care worker ', ' health provider ', ' health workforce ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' medical personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' Hybrids ', ' Infant ', ' Low Birth Weight Infant ', ' low birth weight ', ' low birth weight infant human ', ' low birthweight ', ' Human Papillomavirus ', ' HPV ', ' Human Papilloma Virus ', ' Infectious Human Wart Virus ', ' wart virus ', ' Influenza ', ' Grippe ', ' flu infection ', ' influenza infection ', ' Interview ', ' Learning ', ' Medical Records ', ' Methods ', ' Persons ', ' Patients ', ' Pregnancy Complications ', ' complications during pregnancy ', ' pregnancy-related complications ', ' First Pregnancy Trimester ', ' 1st trimester ', ' Early Placental Phase ', ' First Trimester ', ' Second Pregnancy Trimester ', ' 2nd trimester ', ' Midtrimester ', ' Second Trimester ', ' Pregnancy Trimesters ', ' Prenatal care ', ' pregnancy care ', ' prenatal appointment ', ' prenatal checkup ', ' prenatal visit ', ' Prospective Studies ', ' Public Health ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Testing ', ' Vaccines ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', "" Women's Health "", ' Female Health ', ' Afro American ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Black Populations ', ' black American ', ' African American ', ' Emotional Depression ', ' depression symptom ', ' depressive ', ' depressive symptoms ', ' Community Health Centers ', ' Satellite Centers ', ' Neighborhood Health Center ', ' Postpartum ', ' post-partum ', ' Postpartum Period ', ' Caring ', ' Prematurely delivering ', ' Preterm Birth ', ' premature childbirth ', ' premature delivery ', ' preterm delivery ', ' Premature Birth ', ' Guidelines ', ' Peripartum ', ' Perinatal ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Evaluation ', ' Post-Natal Depression ', ' Post-Partum Depression ', ' Postnatal Depression ', ' Postpartum Depression ', ' Individual ', ' Perinatal Care ', ' uptake ', ' programs ', ' Frequencies ', ' Scanning ', ' Clinic ', ' System ', ' Services ', ' experience ', ' unborn ', ' prenatal ', ' Contraception ', ' Fertility Control ', ' Inhibition of Fertilization ', ' Contraceptive methods ', ' social ', ' depression screening ', ' Depression screen ', ' methods to study multiple-level influences ', ' multi-level analysis ', ' multi-level model ', ' multilevel model ', ' multilevel modeling ', ' multilevel analysis ', ' Modeling ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Provider ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Low income ', ' Address ', ' Adherence ', ' Age-Years ', ' Data ', ' Effectiveness of Interventions ', ' HPV Vaccine ', ' Human papillomavirus Vaccine ', ' Human Papilloma Virus Vaccine ', ' randomisation ', ' randomization ', ' randomly assigned ', ' Randomized ', ' ACOG ', ' American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Nonhispanic ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Process ', ' informant ', ' implementation research ', ' perinatal health ', ' infant outcome ', ' compare effectiveness ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' group intervention ', ' primary outcome ', ' secondary outcome ', ' standard treatment ', ' standard care ', ' pragmatic effectiveness trial ', ' pragmatic trial ', ' social health determinants ', ' Randomization trial ', ' randomized trial ', ' arm ', ' perinatal outcomes ', ' post-partum contraception ', ' post-partum contraceptive ', ' postpartum contraceptive ', ' postpartum contraception ', ' post-partum care ', ' postpartum care ', ' recruit ', ' coordinating care ', ' care coordination ', ' intervention arm ', ' treatment arm ', ' perinatal phase ', ' perinatal period ', ' fourth trimester ', ' maternal outcome ', ' severe maternal morbidity ', ' effectiveness implementation trial ', ' evaluate effectiveness ', ' effectiveness evaluation ', ' ']",NIMHD,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,R01,2020,582072,0.031884509955337675
"Tumor microenvironment at single cell level in black and white NSCLC patients Summary Lung cancer is the number one cancer diagnosis at Wake Forest Baptist Comprehensive Cancer Center (WFBCCC). Our Office of Cancer Health Equity found that African Americans (AAs) in our region have incidence and mortality rates 15.1% and 15.5% higher, respectively, than the already elevated lung cancer rates among AAs in the U.S. Understanding health disparities in our patients, 14% of whom are AA, and identifying targeted therapeutics that can overcome them are among the top priorities of WFBCCC, consistent with the stated mission of NCI as described in PAR-18-655. Clinically, immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) drug treatment can benefit 30% of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. At WFBCCC, AA patients have a relatively better response to ICB compared to Caucasian American (CA) patients, suggesting ICB has the potential to eliminate cancer disparities. To gain insight into this clinical observation we investigated the infiltrating immune tumor microenvironment (TME) between AAs and CAs using the state-of-the-art single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-Seq). Preliminary analysis of 4 CA and 4 AA samples from patients with NSCLC showed marked difference in the immune TME between the two racial groups. Somatic mutations in tumor cells play important roles in immune regulation and the interactions between tumor cells and TME. Specific genetic mutations in the tumor may impact the immune landscape, and consequently associate with cancer disparities. For example, we recently reported a higher TP53 mutation rate and tumor mutation burden in AA cancer patients. In this project, we propose to validate these preliminary observations with data from a larger cohort of lung cancer patients. Specific aim 1 will characterize and contrast the TME landscapes of AA and CA patients with NSCLC. Additional samples from both races will be collected and profiled using the scRNA-Seq technique. Specific aim 2 will generate the mutation profiles of the patient samples with the objective to associate specific mutational events, or patterns of mutations, with the characterized immune TME (SA1) by patient race. Our overarching hypothesis is that an immunosuppressive TME in AA patients with NSCLC has been a contributing factor to racial health disparities, but may be overcome by newer ICB-based immunotherapies. The data and observations from this developmental R21 will be interpreted in the context of the ongoing clinical association studies. This proposal will also produce a valuable scRNA-Seq dataset for the AA minority NSCLC population and be made available to the cancer research field. Altogether, the proposed study has the potential to benefit an underserved patient population and provide a basis for generating hypotheses for future R01 proposals on lung cancer health disparities. Narrative African Americans (AA) continue to face poorer clinical outcomes in lung cancer. Preliminary analysis of lung tumors from AA and Caucasian American (CA) patients treated at our institution indicates differences in immune cell populations in the tumor microenvironment (TME), which may be a consequence of differing tumor mutation status and contribute to treatment disparities. These studies propose to more fully characterize TME distinctions between AA and CA patients with lung cancer that may help predict more effective treatment regimens, especially with regard to new immunotherapies, to improve the survival of a patient population that frequently experiences inferior cancer outcomes.",Tumor microenvironment at single cell level in black and white NSCLC

"One Plus One Can Be Greater than Two: Ecological Momentary Assessment for Black Prostate Cancer Survivors and Partners PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Prostate cancer (PCa) is the most frequently diagnosed cancer among American men. PCa has the largest racial disparities of any cancer in which African Americans (AAs) have the highest PCa burden. Although health behaviors such as physical activity, low sedentary behavior, and healthy eating can reduce morbidity and mortality among PCa survivors, AA cancer survivors do not meet recommended levels of health behaviors and report poorer health behaviors than others. As romantic partners are often reported as a primary source of support for AA PCa survivors, integrating partners into AA PCa survivorship care and broadening the focus of behavioral interventions from the individual (survival) to the survivor-partner dyad may make health behaviors more easily adopted and potentially maintained. Despite the importance and novelty of targeting the survivor- partner dyad as a single unit of care, to date, no evidence exists that dyadic lifestyle interventions are superior to individual-only interventions. We argue that this result is partly due to the fact that these dyadic lifestyle interventions were simply adding partners in the existing individual-only interventions and did not take on a truly dyadic perspective. Before implementing another dyadic lifestyle intervention, micro-level investigations of interactions between survivors and partners is necessary to pinpoint how AA PCa survivors and partners facilitate or hinder each other's HBs in their natural, everyday lives. Dyadic coping indicates that couples respond to stressors as interpersonal units. It includes supportive/unsupportive (e.g., providing practical help, showing disinterest), delegate (e.g., taking on things that the partner normally does), negative (e.g., mutual avoidance), and common dyadic coping (e.g., joint problem solving). Thus, dyadic coping goes beyond the exchange of social support. To date, virtually no studies have tested the impacts of dyadic coping on HBs among AA survivors and partners. The objective of the present study is to fill these gaps using ecological momentary assessment to eventually develop more effective lifestyle interventions for AA PCa survivors and partners. A total of 120 dyads (i.e., 240 individuals) who are AA adult survivors diagnosed with non-metastatic PCa and their romantic partners will be asked to complete four assessments per day for 14 consecutive days on a smartphone. During each assessment, participants will be asked to complete a brief survey regarding their health behaviors, contexts of health behaviors, stress, and dyadic coping. Physical activity and sedentary behavior will be assessed via accelerometer. At completion of this study we expect to achieve the following milestones: 1) candidate dyadic coping as a determinant of behavioral change of both survivors and partners, 2) identify critical time points of intervention delivery, and 3) determine intervention characteristics. The proposed study along with our on-going pilot study of AA PCa survivors and their partners will inform the rigorous development of a theory-based dyadic lifestyle intervention in a vulnerable survivorship population with the ultimate goal to improve overall survival and reduce cancer incidence. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research aims to develop an intervention that promotes health behaviors such as physical activity, low sedentary behavior, and healthy eating among African American prostate cancer survivors and their partners. As engagement in health behaviors can reduce the likelihood of dying from cancer and other disease, enhance quality of life among prostate cancer survivors and decrease the likelihood of developing cancer among their healthy partners, the development of the intervention has a huge potential to improve Americans' health and reduce cancer disparities.",One Plus One Can Be Greater than Two: Ecological Momentary Assessment for Black Prostate Cancer Survivors and Partners,9873258,R21CA245687,"['Adoption ', ' Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' behavior intervention ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Communities ', ' Coping Behavior ', ' Couples ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Diet ', ' dietary ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Environment ', ' Ethnic group ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' Health Promotion ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' promoting health ', ' Health Status ', ' Level of Health ', ' Incidence ', ' Joints ', ' Maintenance ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Persons ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Obesity ', ' adiposity ', ' corpulence ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulentia ', ' obese ', ' obese people ', ' obese person ', ' obese population ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Primary Prevention ', ' Problem Solving ', ' Public Health ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Research ', ' Social Environment ', ' social climate ', ' social context ', ' socioenvironment ', ' socioenvironmental ', ' Social support ', ' social support network ', ' Stress ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' survivorship ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Afro American ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Black Populations ', ' black American ', ' African American ', ' Caring ', ' Married Persons ', ' Spouses ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Phase ', ' Survivors ', ' Physical activity ', ' Individual ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Prostate ', ' Malignant prostatic tumor ', ' Prostate CA ', ' Prostate Cancer ', ' Prostatic Cancer ', ' Malignant neoplasm of prostate ', ' Adopted ', ' Investigation ', ' Home ', ' Home environment ', ' Source ', ' Healthy diet ', ' balanced diet ', ' good diet ', ' psychosocial ', ' American ', ' stressor ', ' Participant ', ' tertiary prevention ', ' member ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' Interventional trial ', ' Intervention Trial ', ' theories ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' cancer diagnosis ', ' Cell Phone ', ' Cellular Telephone ', ' iPhone ', ' smart phone ', ' smartphone ', ' Cellular Phone ', ' Address ', ' Mechanisms of Behavior and Behavior Change ', ' behavior mechanism ', ' Behavioral Mechanisms ', ' Stress and Coping ', ' National Cancer Burden ', ' Cancer Burden ', ' survive cancer ', ' Cancer Survivor ', ' Cancer Survivorship ', ' Non-metastatic ', ' Nonmetastatic ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' virtual ', ' coping ', ' Population ', ' life style intervention ', ' lifestyle intervention ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' cancer disparity ', ' disparity in cancer ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' develop therapy ', ' intervention development ', ' treatment development ', ' therapy development ', ' Sedentary behavior ', ' Sedentary life-style ', ' sedentary lifestyle ', ' disparities in race ', ' race disparity ', ' racial disparity ', ' Ecological momentary assessment ', ' accelerometry ', ' activity monitor ', ' activity tracker ', ' Accelerometer ', ' Healthy Eating ', ' prostate cancer progression ', ' prostate survivors ', ' prostate cancer survivors ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF TX MD ANDERSON CAN CTR,R21,2020,227205,-0.004601965894869272
"Exploring factors related to racial disparities in ovarian cancer incidence and survival: the OCWAA consortium PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT    Invasive epithelial ovarian cancer accounts for 5% of malignancies and, while it is the eighth most common  cancer in US women, it is the fifth leading cause of cancer deaths. Many of the established and suspected risk  factors for ovarian cancer show racial differences in the prevalence and/or timing of exposures. Racial  differences in incidence and survival are likely due to a combination of factors, including differences in the

The newly-­formed consortium, Ovarian Cancer in Women of African Ancestry (OCWAA), brings together  investigators experienced in studying the epidemiology of ovarian cancer and dedicated to understanding

case-­control studies that include both AA and white cases and controls and two unique cohort studies with  large numbers of AA participants. To address racial differences in incidence and survival, we will  comprehensively examine reproductive and lifestyle exposures which differ in prevalence and/or timing

"The Impact of the Intrauterine and Early Childhood Environments on Neurocognitive and Metabolic Development in African American Youth: Focus on the Gut-Brain Axis PARENT PROJECT ABSTRACT  Environmental exposures during the critical prenatal and early childhood periods can result in lifelong health consequences. Mechanisms underlying these exposure-health relationships are complex, with exogenous exposures (such as chemical toxicants, infectious agents, diet) and endogenous processes (such as gene expression, inflammation and oxidative stress) activating metabolic pathways that lead to adverse health outcomes. Both adverse exposures and their health consequences disproportionately impact African American (AA) women and children, highlighting that health disparities begin in utero and are amplified postnatally. Among outcomes disproportionately experienced by AA children are preterm birth, neurodevelopmental deficits, and obesity – all linked to environmental exposures, yet poorly understood due to their etiologic complexity. Our team is currently investigating preterm birth and neurodevelopment through 18-months in relation to pre- and postnatal exposures to environmental toxicants and biopsychosocial risk factors in cohorts of pregnant AA women (R01NR014800, R01MD009064) and their infants (R01MD009746) and via our P50 Children's Center (P50ES026071) in collaboration with the Emory HERCULES Exposome Research Center (P30 ES019776).  Through ECHO, we propose to elucidate exposures and risk pathways that contribute to neurodevelopmental deficits and obesity in preschool aged AA children by: (1) Assembling an Atlanta ECHO cohort of ~440 AA socioeconomically diverse mother-child pairs by combining extant cohorts for whom the prenatal, perinatal, and early childhood environments are, or will be, characterized; (2) Completing the analysis and synthesis of data from the Atlanta ECHO cohort to characterize mother-child pairs in terms of prenatal and early childhood exposures (toxicants, stressors and neuroendocrine-immune activation, nutritional and metabolic status, microbiome and infections, bonding and interaction); epigenetic and metabolomic profiles; and perinatal outcomes (gestational age, size-for-gestation); (3) Testing cohort-specific hypotheses related to prenatal and early childhood exposures and neurodevelopmental outcomes and obesity in AA children at 2, 3, 4, and 5 years of age; (4) Participating in ECHO-wide consortium studies to identify risk and protective factors that moderate associations between environmental exposures, typical growth and development, and adverse child health outcomes. Our cohort's participation in the ECHO consortium will contribute to a biopsychosocial understanding of within- and between-race risk for adverse child health outcomes, providing insight into risk and protective factors relevant to AA families. The proposed research is consistent with frameworks for eliminating racial disparities, which recognize the need to study risks within-race as a vital first step, and is congruent with the National Institute of Minority Health and Health Disparities goal of promoting understanding of the biological mechanisms involved in conditions that disproportionately affect health disparity populations. PROJECT NARRATIVE This proposal from the Atlanta ECHO cohort capitalizes on the opportunity to conduct in-depth qualitative research with Black women in partnership with the Detroit ECHO cohort (which is submitting a parallel application) in order to amplify the voices of and input from Black women to gain valuable, foundational information to address the US maternal health crisis. The Atlanta ECHO cohort will engage with the Center for Black Women's Wellness in the use of qualitative methods (focus groups and interviews) to collect data from ECHO-enrolled Black women and their health care providers to support the development of strategies for nurturing a culture of respectful care for building patient trust and improving patient/provider interactions and communications, in support of US maternal health equity. The sharing of interview guides and data coding schemes across the two ECHO cohorts that prioritize the enrollment of Black families will expand the generalizability of findings to the broader US

We chose toharness this expertise to conduct genomic implementation research. At the heart of our team is a Genomics Stakeholder Board. Together, we conducted GUARDD, a multi-site pragmatic clinical trial (PCT) to study effects and challenges of incorporating genetic risk information into primary care. We tested AA adults with hypertension, without diabetes or chronic kidney disease (CKD) for APOL1 high-risk variants nearly exclusive to AAs, that increase kidney failure risk 10-fold. We recruited 2052 AA adults from 15 community and academic primary care practices in NYC, trained lay staff who returned APOL1 results to patients and alerted clinicians of results through clinical decision support in electronic health records (EHRs). Our co-primary outcome, systolic blood pressure (SBP) at 3m (retention rate 93%) reduced by 6mmHg in those told they had high-risk APOL1 genotypes vs. 3mmHg if told they were low-risk (p=0.008).  We are now prepared and committed to join IGNITE II and conduct genomic implementation PCTs in diverse settings and populations. We brought a transdisciplinary team together for this purpose, and to study the impact of APO1 risk information on a broader phenotype of AA patients, including those with CKD, who have even higher risk for kidney failure and are often undiagnosed by primary care providers. We aim to: (1) Serve as an enhanced diversity site for IGNITE2, facilitating recruitment and retention of patients into genomic implementation PCTs; and (2) Conduct GUARDD-US, a network-wide PCT expanding GUARDD to AA patients without and with CKD and to other IGNITE sites with different patient and provider populations. We will randomize patients to APOL1 testing vs. waitlist control, and evaluate impact on SBP, renal diagnosis, cost effectiveness and psycho-behavioral outcomes, so results can inform decisions by clinicians, policymakers and payers. If successful, GeNYC may provide a robust framework for future endeavors to implement genomic medicine in diverse clinical practices, validate APOL1 risk-informed management of hypertensive AA patients at high risk of kidney failure, contribute to important efforts to eliminate racial, ethnic and ancestral disparities in health, and show that vulnerable populations can be the first to benefit from genomic discoveries. Our stakeholder-engaged team is experienced in conducting clinical trials in diverse populations, including one with >2000 African ancestry patients with high genetic risk for CKD. We aim to implement genomic medicine trials in NYC and study risk-informed disease management in multi-ancestry populations and diverse practices.",GeNYC: Genomic Implementation Research in the Diverse Settings and Populations of New York City,9982391,U01HG010248,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Affect ', ' Attention ', ' Blood Pressure ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Communities ', ' cost effectiveness ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Ethics ', ' ethical ', ' Future ', ' Genotype ', ' Health ', ' Health Policy ', ' health care policy ', ' healthcare policy ', ' Heart ', ' Hypertension ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' high blood pressure ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' Kidney ', ' Kidney Urinary System ', ' renal ', ' Kidney Diseases ', ' Nephropathy ', ' Renal Disease ', ' kidney disorder ', ' renal disorder ', ' Chronic Kidney Failure ', ' Chronic Renal Disease ', ' Chronic Renal Failure ', ' chronic kidney disease ', ' literacy ', ' Medicine ', ' New York City ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Primary Care ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Kidney Failure ', ' Kidney Insufficiency ', ' Renal Failure ', ' Renal Insufficiency ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Risk ', ' Science ', ' Testing ', ' Waiting Lists ', ' waitlist ', ' Work ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Latino ', ' diverse populations ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' population diversity ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' Caring ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Medical ', ' Training ', ' Discipline ', ' African ', ' root ', ' Plant Roots ', ' Shapes ', ' Disorder Management ', ' Disease Management ', ' Clinic ', ' Test Result ', ' meetings ', ' experience ', ' Participant ', ' disease prevention ', ' disorder prevention ', ' Equipoise ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Genomics ', ' disease control ', ' disorder control ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' Provider ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Low income ', ' Address ', ' Health system ', ' Advocate ', ' Educational Materials ', ' randomisation ', ' randomization ', ' randomly assigned ', ' Randomized ', ' Conduct Clinical Trials ', ' Genetic Risk ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Translational Science ', ' translation research ', ' Translational Research ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' follow-up ', ' point of care ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' implementation research ', ' Population ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' safety net ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' implementation science ', ' high risk ', ' clinical care ', ' primary outcome ', ' secondary outcome ', ' clinical practice ', ' health equity ', ' Randomization trial ', ' randomized trial ', ' Risk-associated variant ', ' risk allele ', ' risk gene ', ' risk genotype ', ' risk loci ', ' risk locus ', ' risk variant ', ' genetic counselor ', ' behavior outcome ', ' behavioral outcome ', ' retention strategy ', ' student retention ', ' retention rate ', ' support tools ', ' Genomic medicine ', ' Pragmatic clinical trial ', ' Underrepresented Groups ', ' patient subgroups ', ' patient subpopulations ', ' patient subtypes ', ' patient subsets ', ' APOL-I ', ' APOL1 ', ' APOL1 gene ', ' recruit ', ' primary care provider ', ' care providers ', ' clinical decision support ', ' gene testing ', ' gene-based testing ', ' genetic testing ', ' ']",NHGRI,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,U01,2020,3054210,-0.0008861536128169891
"Increasing Recruitment of underrepresented cancer survivors with awareness enhancing interventions (RUN AWEI) Critical to eliminating cancer health disparities is the ability to engage racial and ethnic minorities in research. Inadequate representation of African Americans (AAs) in research severely limits the opportunity to understand underlying causes of disparate health outcomes between AAs and other race groups and the opportunity to advance knowledge on how to reduce the cancer burden in this vulnerable population. Finding ways to increase recruitment of AA cancer survivors in research is urgent. The question is how. We propose that one mechanism is to increase awareness about research in AA potential participants, a solution supported both by our previous observational study (IMPaCT) in AA cancer survivors, and research by others, in which survivors indicated that having information about clinical trials was important in their decision-making regarding trial participation. However, evidence-based methods to increase awareness in AAs remain largely absent. Unknown is what type of strategy, information, and perspective, is needed. We will test awareness- enhancing interventions (AWEI) that vary in these dimensions among AA cancer survivors for whom disparities in cancer incidence and mortality are widely documented and concerning. We propose a highly innovative and efficient factorial trial design embedded into the recruitment effort for AMPLIFI (P01 CA22997). AMPLIFI will recruit 652 cancer survivors to be randomized to lifestyle interventions. Participants will be from four southeastern states with a high burden of cancer in AAs. During the AMPLIFI recruitment process, 2,000 AA cancer survivors will be randomized to one of 8 AWEI conditions that vary by type of strategy, type of information, and perspective, or to the AMPLIFI basic recruitment strategy (No AWEI). Aims are: 1: Determine the impact of AWEIs on recruitment of AA cancer survivors. We hypothesize that AWEIs will have a significantly higher recruitment yield than the basic AMPLIFI recruitment strategy (H1). In line with IMPaCT, we expect AWEI to have a significant impact doubling the recruitment yield; 2: Identify the AWEI key features that increase recruitment of AA cancer survivors. We will test whether AWEI-navigation vs. AWEI- brochure (type of strategy, H2), study-specific vs general research messages (type of information, H3), and, survivor “voice” vs. not (type of perspective, H4) will result in higher recruitment yield; and 3: Determine the optimal AWEI combination in terms of recruitment yield and cost. We hypothesize that AWEI combination of navigation with study-specific messages and the survivor “voice” will be the most efficacious and may be most cost-effective compared to the other combinations. In summary, building on an important trial that will oversample minorities in underserved US states, our expert team will adopt this innovative and rigorous study design to advance the science of recruitment and have a high impact on representation of AAs in research. The inclusion of diverse participants in research studies is key to ensuring that scientific discoveries benefit the entire population. Achieving adequate representation of minorities however, remains a significant scientific challenge. We are studying whether, compared with standard population-based recruitment approaches, novel interventions to increase awareness about the importance of research among potential participants result in the higher recruitment of African American cancer survivors.",Increasing Recruitment of underrepresented cancer survivors with awareness enhancing interventions (RUN AWEI),9968704,R01CA242737,"['Alabama ', ' Awareness ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Control Groups ', ' Decision Making ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Health ', ' Incidence ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Methods ', ' Mississippi ', ' mortality ', ' North Carolina ', ' Pamphlets ', ' Booklets ', ' Brochures ', ' Race ', ' Racial Group ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Research ', ' Research Design ', ' Study Type ', ' study design ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Science ', ' Target Populations ', ' Tennessee ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Voice ', ' Afro American ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Black Populations ', ' black American ', ' African American ', ' improved ', ' Randomized Clinical Trials ', ' Survivors ', ' Ensure ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Prostate ', ' Malignant prostatic tumor ', ' Prostate CA ', ' Prostate Cancer ', ' Prostatic Cancer ', ' Malignant neoplasm of prostate ', ' Knowledge ', ' Adopted ', ' Dimensions ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' research study ', ' population-based study ', ' population-level study ', ' studies of populations ', ' study of the population ', ' Population Study ', ' Modeling ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' US State ', ' Geographic state ', ' Address ', ' randomisation ', ' randomization ', ' randomly assigned ', ' Randomized ', ' National Cancer Burden ', ' Cancer Burden ', ' Cancer Patient ', ' survive cancer ', ' Cancer Survivor ', ' Cancer Survivorship ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Observation research ', ' Observation study ', ' Observational research ', ' Observational Study ', ' Principal Investigator ', ' Process ', ' Colo-rectal Cancer ', ' Colorectal Cancer ', ' cost ', ' anti-cancer research ', ' cancer research ', ' anticancer research ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' cost effective ', ' Population ', ' life style intervention ', ' lifestyle intervention ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' cancer disparity ', ' disparity in cancer ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' ethnic minority ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' evidence base ', ' population based ', ' disparities in race ', ' race disparity ', ' racial disparity ', ' trial design ', ' racial minority ', ' recruit ', ' effectiveness testing ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF TENNESSEE HEALTH SCI CTR,R01,2020,526197,0.07944373595868058
"Functional Consequences of Racially Associated Ephrin Alterations on the Prostate Tumor Microenvironment Project Summary Prostate cancer (PCa) incidence and mortality remain significantly higher in African American (AA) men compared to Caucasians (CA). Although socioeconomic factors may contribute to such differences, recent studies suggest that biological factors could potentially explain racial disparities (RD) in PCa. A few high- penetrance genes (HPG) have been found to predispose to high risk of PCa in AA men. These include EphB2 mutations. EphB2 is a tyrosine kinase (RTK) receptor that binds to the Ephrin ligand and initiates bidirectional signals that affect both receptor (forward signaling) and Ephrin-expressing cells (reverse signaling). Our preliminary observations suggest a potential supportive role of Ephrin signaling activation within stromal cells in the tumor microenvironment (TME) due to the pathogenicity of these EphB2 genetic alterations. However the functional consequences of EphB2 alterations on prostate cancer cell biology have not been experimentally validated. To better understand the intrinsic mechanism(s) responsible for these pathogenic effects we hypothesize that EphB2 alterations commonly seen in AA men may induce aberrant “forward signaling” reducing its tumor suppressor function in cancer cells and abnormal “reverse signaling” increasing the activation of stromal in the TME, overall resulting in support for PCa progression. This proposal seeks to understand the downstream molecular effectors of disrupted Eph-Ephrin signaling in AA men in both tissue compartments (epithelium and stroma) on PCa progression. The long-term goal is to identify novel targetable molecules within the cancer and/or stromal compartment that can be used to improve diagnosis and treatment of patients at high-risk of developing aggressive PCa disease in AA men. Three complementary areas will be investigated: 1. Determine the functional effects of racial EphB2 alterations on PCa progression. We will study the functional consequence of common EphB2 alterations seen in AA men with PCa, on proliferation and motility of PCa cells in vitro and in vivo. The role of EphB2 in PCa cell biology is unknown. 2. Determine the role of Ephrin reverse signaling on CAF activation in the TME of AA men. We observed increased expression of EphB2 ligands in the TME of AA compared to CA men suggesting a dysfunctional regulation of Ephrin-reverse signaling. In addition we observed that prostate stromal cell from AA patients with PCa induce increased proliferation and motility of PCa cell lines in vitro and in vivo. 3. Evaluate the utility of targeting the Eph-Ephrin signaling to inhibit PCa progression. It has been shown in experimental models that normalizing Eph-Ephrin signaling can reduce colon cancer progression. The utility in PCa has not been previously studied. Using an in vivo PCa model, we will assess the feasibility of targeting Eph-Ephrin signaling frequently altered in AA men to inhibit PCa tumorigenesis. Narrative The molecular mechanisms responsible for the higher incidence of developing early and more aggressive prostate cancer (PCa) in African American (AA) men are still unknown. We aim to investigate the functional consequences of common genetic alterations affecting the tumor microenvironment (TME) associated with increased risk. In addition, we will evaluate the clinical utility with emphasis on developing potential new therapies.",Functional Consequences of Racially Associated Ephrin Alterations on the Prostate Tumor

"Addressing Social Determinants of Health to Improve Diabetes Prevention Program Outcomes Among Underserved African Americans PROJECT SUMMARY African Americans (AAs) are disproportionately burdened by diabetes mellitus (DM) with rates twice as high as Whites (13% vs 7.5%), and increased rates of DM-related complications and comorbidities (e.g. amputations, cardiovascular disease). A key pre-DM risk factor is overweight/obesity. Nearly 70% of AAs are overweight or obese, with higher rates among AAs with low-income. A critical component of national efforts to reduce growing obesity rates and prevent DM is the Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP), a lifestyle intervention proven to reduce or delay DM onset with diet change, exercise, and modest weight loss (5-7%) in a rigorously evaluated national trial. A group-based version of the DPP has been widely disseminated and numerous community-based trials support its efficacy. In spite of these successes, there are significant health disparities in DPP attendance and outcomes and considerable room exists for improving success rates among AAs, a population that tends to experience half the amount of DPP weight loss compared to Whites. We aim to build on our promising pilot studies by tailoring the DPP via a social determinants (SD) of health lens to achieve optimal DPP attendance and clinically meaningful weight loss with pre-DM AAs. This includes tailoring on cultural and socioeconomic SD mechanisms that are associated with improving health outcomes and align with predisposing needs among AAs who are primarily of low-income and live in low-resource AA communities. We propose a randomized controlled trial of 360 pre-DM AA patients from a safety net hospital (SNH) to test a standard DPP (S-DPP) against a culturally tailored DPP (TC-DPP; e.g., tailoring of language, foods, values, religiosity, norms, values) alone and a culturally tailored DPP enhanced to address access and support related economic barriers (TCE-DPP; hybrid group/online/text DPP; community health worker support to improve access to DPP classes, healthy food, exercise, and other community and health resources; and financial incentives) over 12 months. We will: 1) examine effects of TC-DPP and TCE-DDP on percent weight loss and attendance (primary outcomes) and on secondary outcomes (physical activity, completion of physician follow- up visit, hbA1c, and blood pressure) at 6 and 12 months with SNH AAs, 2) evaluate potential mediators/ moderators related to weight loss and attendance among AA SNH patients at 6 and 12 months to determine modifiable facilitators and barriers, and 3) conduct a process evaluation to examine TCE-DPP acceptability, feasibility, and fidelity, and relationships between delivery dose, exposure, costs, and outcomes to identify and improve essential intervention components. Our multidimensional DPP interventions are guided by our past pilots, and based on components that, all together, were used to help drive clinically important outcomes in the original DPP trial – and are certainly needed to achieve similar outcomes with AA primarily of low-income. To our knowledge this is the first study to test multidimensional tailoring via an SD lens to truly impact DPP attendance and outcomes, and has potential to be a feasible, scalable model to reduce DM disparities among at-risk AA. PROJECT NARRATIVE African Americans (AAs) have rates of diabetes mellitus (DM) twice that of Whites and are disproportionately affected by leading risk factors for DM – obesity and low-income. A critical strategy in the battle against DM is the Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP), an evidence-based intervention that significantly delays or prevents Type 2 diabetes through the promotion of diet change, exercise and modest weight loss. However, weight loss from the DPP among AAs is about half that of White participants, and suboptimal AA attendance is a critical contributor. We propose to conduct a study that will address social determinants (SD) that challenge DPP attendance with underserved African Americans from a safety net hospital. We will examine DPP attendance and weight loss with participants randomized to 3 groups: standard DPP, a culturally-tailored DPP to address acceptability, and a culturally-tailored DPP enhanced to address socioeconomic-related barriers to DPP participation. This novel study is the first to tailor the DPP to address SD cultural and socioeconomic barriers that limit DPP attendance and reduce its effectiveness on outcomes. The proposed multidimensional, SD tailored DPP has great potential to be a feasible and scalable model to reduce DM risks among urban, African Americans and ultimately reduce DM disparities.",Addressing Social Determinants of Health to Improve Diabetes Prevention Program Outcomes Among Underserved African Americans,9947267,R01DK124664,"['Affect ', ' Amputation ', ' Behavior ', ' Blood Pressure ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Communities ', ' Community Health Aides ', ' community health worker ', ' comorbidity ', ' co-morbid ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Adult-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Ketosis-Resistant Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Maturity-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' NIDDM ', ' Non-Insulin Dependent Diabetes ', ' Noninsulin Dependent Diabetes ', ' Noninsulin Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Slow-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Stable Diabetes Mellitus ', ' T2 DM ', ' T2D ', ' T2DM ', ' Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Type 2 diabetes ', ' Type II Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Type II diabetes ', ' adult onset diabetes ', ' ketosis resistant diabetes ', ' maturity onset diabetes ', ' type 2 DM ', ' type II DM ', ' type two diabetes ', ' Diet ', ' dietary ', ' Economics ', ' Exercise ', ' Face ', ' faces ', ' facial ', ' Food ', ' Food or Food Product ', ' Health ', ' Health education ', ' Health Instruction ', ' Health Tutoring ', ' Health Resources ', ' Glycosylated hemoglobin A ', ' Glycohemoglobin A ', ' Hb A1 ', ' Hb A1a+b ', ' Hb A1c ', ' HbA1 ', ' HbA1c ', ' Hemoglobin A(1) ', ' hemoglobin A1c ', ' Hospitals ', ' Hybrids ', ' Language ', ' Literature ', ' Persons ', ' Obesity ', ' adiposity ', ' corpulence ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulentia ', ' obese ', ' obese people ', ' obese person ', ' obese population ', ' Office Visits ', ' physician office visit ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Program Acceptability ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Social support ', ' social support network ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Translations ', ' Body Weight decreased ', ' Weight Loss ', ' Weight Reduction ', ' body weight loss ', ' wt-loss ', ' Work ', ' Afro American ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Black Populations ', ' black American ', ' African American ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Evaluation ', ' Physical activity ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' healthy food ', ' Health Food ', ' Prediabetes ', ' Prediabetic State ', ' pre-diabetes ', ' pre-diabetic ', ' prediabetic ', ' Prediabetes syndrome ', ' Over weight ', ' Overweight ', ' Visit ', ' Church ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' intervention program ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Reporting ', ' Modeling ', ' theories ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Effectiveness ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Low income ', ' Mediator ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Address ', ' Dose ', ' Improve Access ', ' randomisation ', ' randomization ', ' randomly assigned ', ' Randomized ', ' Process ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' follow-up ', ' Community Health ', ' Text ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio-economically ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomics ', ' diabetes prevention program ', ' cost ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' life style intervention ', ' lifestyle intervention ', ' safety net ', ' Evidence based intervention ', ' lenses ', ' lens ', ' community setting ', ' primary outcome ', ' secondary outcome ', ' financial reward ', ' monetary incentive ', ' financial incentive ', ' social health determinants ', ' flexible ', ' flexibility ', ' Randomization trial ', ' randomized trial ', ' arm ', ' improved outcome ', ' cost outcomes ', ' weight loss programming ', ' weight loss program ', ' socio-cultural ', ' sociocultural ', ' social culture ', ' sociodeterminant ', ' social determinants ', ' ']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI KANSAS CITY,R01,2020,686578,0.1399340376139478
