"MINORITY HIGH SCHOOL NURSING RESEARCH EXPERIENCE The state of Texas has three broad health objectives for the year 2000: increasing the health life span of Texas citizens, decreasing health disparities among Texas citizens, and achieving access to preventive services for all Texas citizens. The Health Department for the state of Texas note differences in prevention programs needed because of ethnic- specific incidence rates of diseases such as diabetes. Their recommendations for achieving both broad and specific health care objectives include education of special health care provider groups such as nurses and increasing the delivery of health services of all Texas citizens. In the past two decades their has been an increased recognition of the need to develop specialized programs to address the recruitment and retention of minority students and faculty of predominantly while college and university campuses (Brown, 1979; Buckley, 1980; Feldbaum, 1979 Robinson, 1972; Stearns & Marchione, 1989). Attrition rates for minority students in nursing are estimated to be between 15-85% with high rates being associated with a single retention focus on academics and lack of a faculty committed to help such students (Rodgers, 1990).  The Minority High School Nursing Research Experience (MHSNRE) is designed to facilitate the entry of minority students into health sciences careers, including nursing, by providing direct mentoring of these students and their science teachers by active nurse researches.  The Specific aims are to: 1. orient students and high school teachers to the state of nursing science and health promotion research; 2. provide students and teachers direct experience in assisting nurse researchers in conducting health promotion research; 3. provide students and teachers a forum in which to learn about current methods of health promotion research; 4. strengthen relationships between nursing scholars, high school minority students, and high school teachers; and 5. encourage minority high school students to become nurses and nurse researchers.

"TEXAS SOUTHERN UNIVERSITY RESEARCH SCIENTIST AWARD DESCRIPTION (Adapted from the applicant's abstract) Texas Southern               University (TSU), an  historically black university, is legislatively            designated as a special  purpose institution for urban programming. TSU's        mission is to academically  prepare and develop diverse, predominantly           African American students to enter  a dynamic and changing world as              upwardly mobile, productive citizens and to  contribute to academe with          scholarship, research, and outreach programs to the  community. TSU has          a distinguished history of educating and training large  numbers of              African Americans to provide competent and culturally sensitive  health          care to minority communities throughout the city of Houston, the state,          the nation, and the world. Building on thriving academic, research, and          training infrastructures, TSU is uniquely positioned and capable of              producing  competent and competitive health professionals and scientists         to provide  solutions to cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, and pulmonary          diseases that  cause a disproportionate incidence of morbidity and               mortality in the African  American population. The recruitment of an             established research scientist  will help TSU achieve the next level of          biomedical research excellence by  1) expanding and strengthening its            research capabilities, 2) providing  opportunities for structured and            supportive faculty development, 3) improving  the science curriculum, and        4) providing quality biomedical research experiences for its students.                                                                                            Because of its location, reputation, resources, faculty, and improving           research infrastructure, TSU has exceptional potential for training even         larger numbers of health professionals to conduct quality biomedical and         behavioral research through its academic, research, and training                 programs.  Beneficiaries of these efforts include a core group of                talented faculty  investigators who have received training support from          NHLBI and whose research  careers will be enhanced by the proposed               initiative.

"Evaluating Cancer Disparities Among Hispanic Communities  DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant) Health care institutions providing cancer services to a disproportionate number of medically underserved, low income and/or minority populations, whether urban or rural, are often not linked effectively to national cancer research protocols. This application seeks funding to support the planning, development and implementation of radiation oncology clinical research trials in the predominantly Hispanic population of Laredo, Texas. Despite recent advances in cancer care and therapies there is a disproportionate burden borne by this minority population in South Texas. Laredo has a population of 176,576. Ninety-five percent of those residents are Hispanic. It is geographically isolated with no other U.S. cities within a 140-mile radius. Mercy Health Center (MHC), the applicant institution, is a non-profit 325-bed acute care hospital facility. Its sister organization, the Laredo Medical Group (LMG) is the dominant multi-specialty group consisting of 85 Physicians representing 29 specialties. The Sanchez Cancer Center, house date MHC, is a state-of-the-art cancer center with both medical and radiation oncology facilities. Since its doors opened in November 1999, 475 patients have been treated with radiation therapy. Ninety-four percent of these patients were Hispanic. The potential partner institutions selected for collaboration with the applicant institution are University of Texas Health Science Center in San Antonio (UTHSCSA) and its Cancer Therapy and Research Center (CTRC) and M.D. Anderson Cancer Center (MDACC) in Houston, Texas. MHC has a long history of collaboration and partnership with the CTRC, a NCI designated comprehensive Cancer Center comprising of the University of Texas Health Science Center in San Antonio (UTHSCSA) and the San Antonio Cancer Institute (SACI) in San Antonio, Texas. MDACC is also a NCI recognized Comprehensive Cancer Center. The strength of this proposal is that it unites the oncology research Experience of the partner institutions with access provided to the Hispanic cancer patient population through MHC. The Sanchez Cancer Center is well equipped and staffed to carry out any collaborative clinical trials generated through this grant. Tele-conferencing will be used extensively to facilitate collaboration. This Study will meet the requirements for planning, development and implementation of clinical trials in an area with vast need for this type of research. This proposal will yield invaluable data and information on cancer outcomes and treatment strategies to improve cancer morbidity and mortality outcomes in Hispanic populations.

"Creation of an Hispanic Health Research Center in LRGV DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  There are two disabling dimensions to Health Disparities in minorities. The first is that minorities have higher frequencies of many diseases, and the second that they have fewer trained people to research and address those diseases within their own populations. Nowhere in the US does this apply more than to the Lower Rio Grande Valley of South Texas. This proposal addresses both dimensions of health disparity by partnering two institutions in a predominantly (85%) Hispanic border region of South Texas: that is, the, Regional Campus at Brownsville of the University of Texas Houston School of Public Health and The University of Texas at Brownsville/Texas Southmost College. This partnership will also draw on expertise and resources of the University of Texas Houston School of Public Health and the University of Texas Houston Health Science Center. Nowhere in the US is there a center dedicated specifically to research on the health of Hispanic Americans. The purpose of this proposal is to create such a Hispanic Health Research Center within the existing academic institutions of a predominantly Hispanic community, designed to address the disease burdens and the paucity of research capacity in this poor, undereducated and medically underserved Hispanic population. The activities of the Hispanic Health Research Center will encompass research on health disparities in Hispanics, provide a source of data on Hispanic health, develop and evaluate intervention strategies for Hispanic cultures, evolve research collaborations with other Hispanic communities, and build research capacity in South Texas LRGV. We propose to develop nine cores, of which three are research cores with projects addressing specific aspects of the major killers of the Hispanic population of South Texas, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and cancer. The grant will be centered in Brownsville, in the adjacent, newly constructed buildings of the two partnering institutions on their common campus, sharing web and video facilities, library services, laboratories and other resources. The long-term goals are to enhance the ability of individuals from both partnering institutions to apply for research funding, and to create a strong scientific and academic relationship between the two institutions and the collaborating institutions in Houston.

"Project EXPORT: Addressing Environmental Health    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  ""Bridging the Gap: Addressing Environmental Health through Science,"" is presented by the Center for Research on Minority Health (CRMH), the first Congressionally-mandated center outside the nation's capital to address minority health issues. The CRMH, part of The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center (UTMDACC), and Prairie View A & M University are in a unique position to address cancer disparities. (1) We have well-established networks in Houston's highly diverse communities, and 11 of the CRMH's 29 staff members are bilingual in either Spanish, Chinese, or Vietnamese. (2) Our mission and infrastructure were designed for the types of programs that a Project EXPORT center is expected to implement and maintain. (3) We have previous experience using a multi-disciplinary approach that successfully combines the skills of basic and clinical scientists, field epidemiologists, nurses, public health professionals, and community outreach workers with the resources of numerous educational and medical facilities and hearth coalitions. Unlike other centers that are based in schools of public health or similar academic departments, the CRMH has access to numerous clinical and basic research facilities and training grants at UTMDACC and other institutions in and around the Texas Medical Center. Students participating in our programs will receive mentoring and develop professional networks that foster interest in graduate and post-graduate training in health disparities research and related career opportunities in science and medicine. The primary research project will be a molecular epidemiology study of the roles that genetic susceptibility and mutagenicity biomarkers play in assessing exposure risks and synergistic effects of chronic pesticide exposure in children of migrant/seasonal farm workers in Harris County (Houston, Baytown) and Hidalgo County (South Texas). Community outreach and educational efforts will focus on public awareness of environmental factors in cancer and the importance of minorities' participation in clinical trials. We will share resources with the UTMDACC Center for Research on Environmental Diseases (CRED) and other health centers sponsored by the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences to (1) begin educational programs for the kindergarten-12th grade levels promoting healthy eating habits; (2) develop a curriculum for summer training programs for K-12 teachers; and (3) augment the CRED website with translations of its existing materials into Spanish. We will also work with Cancer Information Services and the UTMDACC Office of Public Education to inform the public, health care providers, and potential clinical trial participants about cancer treatment and prevention trials. Our professional training efforts include (1) developing a curriculum that will promote the study of cancer and health disparities in ethnic minorities and the medically underserved and (2) providing experience to minority students seeking a career in environmental nursing. Students will begin training with one of our collaborators at the high school or junior college level and gain access to the resources of our collaborating institutions that offer graduate and post-graduate training. Additionally, the UTMDACC Biostatistics Department will develop a data management system with Prairie View A & M, a historically black university, and will train Prairie View students to maintain and update the system for future research projects. Pilot projects include (1) a study of gene-environment interactions and their relationship to cancer in Latino populations and (2) a health needs assessment of local Asian American populations. These are but a few of the unique features of this application.            ",Project EXPORT: Addressing Environmental Health,6743568,P60MD000503,"['environmental health ', ' clinical research ', ' behavioral /social science research tag ', ' medically underserved population ', ' ']",NIMHD,UNIVERSITY OF TX MD ANDERSON CAN CTR,P60,2003,1089326,0.08003309560756057

"Creation of an Hispanic Health Research Center in LRGV DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Creation of a Hispanic Health Research Center in the Lower Rio Grande Valley. There are two disabling dimensions to Health Disparities in minorities. The first is that minorities have higher frequencies of many diseases, and the second that they have fewer trained people to research and address those diseases within their own populations. Nowhere in the US does this apply more than to the Lower Rio Grande Valley of South Texas. This proposal addresses both dimensions of health disparity by partnering two institutions in a predominantly (85%) Hispanic border region of South Texas: that is, the, Regional Campus at Brownsville of the University of Texas Houston School of Public Health and The University of Texas at Brownsville/Texas Southmost College. This partnership will also draw on expertise and resources of the University of Texas Houston School of Public Health and the University of Texas Houston Health Science Center. Nowhere in the US is there a center dedicated specifically to research on the health of Hispanic Americans. The purpose of this proposal is to create such a Hispanic Health Research Center within the existing academic institutions of a predominantly Hispanic community, designed to address the disease burdens and the paucity of research capacity in this poor, undereducated and medically underserved Hispanic population. The activities of the Hispanic Health Research Center will encompass research on health disparities in Hispanics, provide a source of data on Hispanic health, develop and evaluate intervention strategies for Hispanic cultures, evolve research collaborations with other Hispanic communities, and build research capacity in South Texas LRGV. We propose to develop nine cores, of which three are research cores with projects addressing specific aspects of the major killers of the Hispanic population of South Texas, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and cancer. The grant will be centered in Brownsville, in the adjacent, newly constructed buildings of the two partnering institutions on their common campus, sharing web and video facilities, library services, laboratories and other resources.

"TAMU/PVAMU Collaboration Reducing Health Disparities    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Health disparities have become one of our most pressing public health concerns. Research is needed to help us better understand why health disparities exist and what can be done to reduce and eliminate them. The challenge before us is to develop effective tools, programs, and services that will have an impact on health disparities and provide opportunities for a better quality of life. Less is known about development of effective approaches for health risk reduction among African Americans and Hispanics compared to Whites which represents a clear need for research efforts that can be widely disseminated. The theme of the proposed research in risk reduction is ""Reducing Health Disparities through Health Promotion and Disease Prevention: Reducing Risk across the Lifespan among African Americans and Hispanic Populations."" Despite the existence of a major institution, a Historically Black College and University, a Hispanic Serving Institution, community health clinics, and extensive community based organizations in this region of Texas, no coordinated research efforts exists that address health disparities. The Partnership of Texas A&M University (TAMU) and Prairie View A&M University (PVAMU) is forged to begin to link the TAMU System schools to conduct studies and promote activities that will reduce and eliminate health disparities. Specifically, this proposed project will, as stated in the RFA, ""augment and strengthen institutional infrastructure and capacity to conduct research aimed at addressing and ultimately eliminating health disparities."" The Specific Aims of the overall project are: 1) to develop and organize research collaborations; 2) to link university, health care and community partners; 3) to conduct 2 major studies, as described in this grant application, around the theme of ""Reducing Health Disparities through Health Promotion and Disease Prevention: Reducing Risk across the Lifespan Among African Americans and Hispanic Populations;"" and 5) to maintain four cores (Administrative, Research Development, Career Development, and Community Outreach).         ",TAMU/PVAMU Collaboration Reducing Health Disparities,6743813,R24MD000510,"['health science research ', ' health science research support ', ' African American ', ' Hispanic American ', ' clinical research ', ' health disparity ', ' ']",NIMHD,TEXAS A&M UNIVERSITY,R24,2003,390461,0.07363867398652849

"Creation of an Hispanic Health Research Center in LRGV DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  There are two disabling dimensions to Health Disparities in minorities. The first is that minorities have higher frequencies of many diseases, and the second that they have fewer trained people to research and address those diseases within their own populations. Nowhere in the US does this apply more than to the Lower Rio Grande Valley of South Texas. This proposal addresses both dimensions of health disparity by partnering two institutions in a predominantly (85%) Hispanic border region of South Texas: that is, the, Regional Campus at Brownsville of the University of Texas Houston School of Public Health and The University of Texas at Brownsville/Texas Southmost College. This partnership will also draw on expertise and resources of the University of Texas Houston School of Public Health and the University of Texas Houston Health Science Center. Nowhere in the US is there a center dedicated specifically to research on the health of Hispanic Americans. The purpose of this proposal is to create such a Hispanic Health Research Center within the existing academic institutions of a predominantly Hispanic community, designed to address the disease burdens and the paucity of research capacity in this poor, undereducated and medically underserved Hispanic population. The activities of the Hispanic Health Research Center will encompass research on health disparities in Hispanics, provide a source of data on Hispanic health, develop and evaluate intervention strategies for Hispanic cultures, evolve research collaborations with other Hispanic communities, and build research capacity in South Texas LRGV. We propose to develop nine cores, of which three are research cores with projects addressing specific aspects of the major killers of the Hispanic population of South Texas, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and cancer. The grant will be centered in Brownsville, in the adjacent, newly constructed buildings of the two partnering institutions on their common campus, sharing web and video facilities, library services, laboratories and other resources. The long-term goals are to enhance the ability of individuals from both partnering institutions to apply for research funding, and to create a strong scientific and academic relationship between the two institutions and the collaborating institutions in Houston. The two Hispanic population and the higher educational institutions attempting to serve them in the LRGV fit every ethnic, economic, geographic and scientific criteria of Project EXPORT.

"Evaluating Cancer Disparities Among Hispanic Communities  DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant) Health care institutions providing cancer services to a disproportionate number of medically underserved, low income and/or minority populations, whether urban or rural, are often not linked effectively to national cancer research protocols. This application seeks funding to support the planning, development and implementation of radiation oncology clinical research trials in the predominantly Hispanic population of Laredo, Texas. Despite recent advances in cancer care and therapies there is a disproportionate burden borne by this minority population in South Texas. Laredo has a population of 176,576. Ninety-five percent of those residents are Hispanic. It is geographically isolated with no other U.S. cities within a 140-mile radius. Mercy Health Center (MHC), the applicant institution, is a non-profit 325-bed acute care hospital facility. Its sister organization, the Laredo Medical Group (LMG) is the dominant multi-specialty group consisting of 85 Physicians representing 29 specialties. The Sanchez Cancer Center, house date MHC, is a state-of-the-art cancer center with both medical and radiation oncology facilities. Since its doors opened in November 1999, 475 patients have been treated with radiation therapy. Ninety-four percent of these patients were Hispanic. The potential partner institutions selected for collaboration with the applicant institution are University of Texas Health Science Center in San Antonio (UTHSCSA) and its Cancer Therapy and Research Center (CTRC) and M.D. Anderson Cancer Center (MDACC) in Houston, Texas. MHC has a long history of collaboration and partnership with the CTRC, a NCI designated comprehensive Cancer Center comprising of the University of Texas Health Science Center in San Antonio (UTHSCSA) and the San Antonio Cancer Institute (SACI) in San Antonio, Texas. MDACC is also a NCI recognized Comprehensive Cancer Center. The strength of this proposal is that it unites the oncology research Experience of the partner institutions with access provided to the Hispanic cancer patient population through MHC. The Sanchez Cancer Center is well equipped and staffed to carry out any collaborative clinical trials generated through this grant. Tele-conferencing will be used extensively to facilitate collaboration. This Study will meet the requirements for planning, development and implementation of clinical trials in an area with vast need for this type of research. This proposal will yield invaluable data and information on cancer outcomes and treatment strategies to improve cancer morbidity and mortality outcomes in Hispanic populations.

Ninety-five percent of those residents are Hispanic. It is geographically isolated with no other U.S. cities within a 140-mile radius. Mercy Health Center (MHC), the applicant institution, is a non-profit 325-bed acute care hospital facility. Its sister organization, the Laredo Medical Group (LMG) is the dominant multi-specialty group consisting of 85 Physicians representing 29 specialties. The Sanchez Cancer Center, house date MHC, is a state-of-the-art cancer center with both medical and radiation oncology facilities. Since its doors opened in November 1999, 475 patients have been treated with radiation therapy. Ninety-four percent of these patients were Hispanic. The potential partner institutions selected for collaboration with the applicant institution are University of Texas Health Science Center in San Antonio (UTHSCSA) and its Cancer Therapy and Research Center (CTRC) and M.D. Anderson Cancer Center (MDACC) in Houston, Texas. MHC has a long history of collaboration and partnership with the CTRC, a NCI designated comprehensive Cancer Center comprising of the University of Texas Health Science Center in San Antonio (UTHSCSA) and the San Antonio Cancer Institute (SACI) in San Antonio, Texas. MDACC is also a NCI recognized Comprehensive Cancer Center. The strength of this proposal is that it unites the oncology research Experience of the partner institutions with access provided to the Hispanic cancer patient population through MHC. The Sanchez Cancer Center is well equipped and staffed to carry out any collaborative clinical trials generated through this grant. Tele-conferencing will be used extensively to facilitate collaboration. This Study will meet the requirements for planning, development and implementation of clinical trials in an area with vast need for this type of research. This proposal will yield invaluable data and information on cancer outcomes and treatment strategies to improve cancer morbidity and mortality outcomes in Hispanic populations.

"Developing Biomedical Research Infrastructure at UTB/TSC    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The partnership of the University of Texas at Brownsville and Texas Southmost College (UTB/TSC) has produced a rapidly-growing institution that serves over 11,000 predominately Hispanic students (93%) from the impoverished southern Texas region of the Lower Rio Grande Valley (LRGV).  Strategies dedicated to foster the development of research opportunities are being pursued to better serve this student population.  As a result, UTB/TSC is making the transition from an exclusively teaching to a research/teaching institution.  UTB/TSC has agreed to create centers of excellence to develop competitive research programs in areas relevant to its mission.  To this aim, the Center for Biomedical Studies (CBS) was created in 2003 with the mission of promoting biomedical research initiatives and facilitating intra- and inter-institutional collaborations among scientists.  The long-term goal of the CBS is to reduce minority health disparities by fostering research programs relevant to the community, offering new career opportunities to minority students, and supporting diverse outreach activities.  Although biomedical scientists of the CBS have successfully obtained federal funding, existing resources and research infrastructure are limited and insufficient to support present and projected growth.  The specific aims (SA) outlined in this proposal seek to overcome present hurdles and enhance existing infrastructures to support growing biomedical research initiatives.  More specifically, the RIMI program will increase the number of faculty personnel with expertise in thematic research areas relevant to the strategic plan of the institution (SA1), create the necessary research infrastructure to support biomedical research (SA2) and support intra- and inter-institutional collaborative research projects contributing to the accumulation of knowledge, support scientific environment and career development (SA3).  Finally, a successful RIMI application will enhance the overall quality of the educational experience, provide new career opportunities, and would certainly impact minority health disparities in the LRGV.         ",Developing Biomedical Research Infrastructure at UTB/TSC,6888450,P20MD001091,"['minority institution research support ', ' Hispanic American ', ' health disparity ', ' ']",NIMHD,UNIV/TEXAS BROWNSVILLE & SOUTHMOST COLL,P20,2005,837983,0.1337870479372775
"Creation of an Hispanic Health Research Center in the L* DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Creation of a Hispanic Health Research Center in the Lower Rio Grande Valley. There are two disabling dimensions to Health Disparities in minorities. The first is that minorities have higher frequencies of many diseases, and the second that they have fewer trained people to research and address those diseases within their own populations. Nowhere in the US does this apply more than to the Lower Rio Grande Valley of South Texas. This proposal addresses both dimensions of health disparity by partnering two institutions in a predominantly (85%) Hispanic border region of South Texas: that is, the, Regional Campus at Brownsville of the University of Texas Houston School of Public Health and The University of Texas at Brownsville/Texas Southmost College. This partnership will also draw on expertise and resources of the University of Texas Houston School of Public Health and the University of Texas Houston Health Science Center. Nowhere in the US is there a center dedicated specifically to research on the health of Hispanic Americans. The purpose of this proposal is to create such a Hispanic Health Research Center within the existing academic institutions of a predominantly Hispanic community, designed to address the disease burdens and the paucity of research capacity in this poor, undereducated and medically underserved Hispanic population. The activities of the Hispanic Health Research Center will encompass research on health disparities in Hispanics, provide a source of data on Hispanic health, develop and evaluate intervention strategies for Hispanic cultures, evolve research collaborations with other Hispanic communities, and build research capacity in South Texas LRGV. We propose to develop nine cores, of which three are research cores with projects addressing specific aspects of the major killers of the Hispanic population of South Texas, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and cancer. The grant will be centered in Brownsville, in the adjacent, newly constructed buildings of the two partnering institutions on their common campus, sharing web and video facilities, library services, laboratories and other resources. The long-term goals are to enhance the ability of individuals from both partnering institutions to apply for research funding, and to create a strong scientific and academic relationship between the two institutions and the collaborating institutions in Houston. The two Hispanic population and the higher educational institutions attempting to serve them in the LRGV fit every ethnic, economic, geographic and scientific criteria of Project EXPORT.

"Bridging the Gap: A Patient-Centered Curriculum for Cultural Competence    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       As in the nation, health disparities undercut the health and well-being of the multicultural populations of West Texas and the Texas-Mexico Border. Improving the cultural competence of health care providers is critical for spanning the fault lines of the health care divide: enthnicity and acculturation; socioeconomic status; health belief systems; language and intercultural communication; and provider skills, to name but a few. The Patient-Centered Cultural Competence Curriculum proposed by the Texas Tech Univeristy Health Sciences Center School of Medicine (TTUHSC-SOM) will develop and implement curricular activities and training programs to enhance the cultural competence of medical students, residents, faculty and community physicians, and health care professionals to better address the needs and health outcomes of the West Texas and Border populations. The specific aims of the Texas Tech Cultural Competence Curriculum are to: (1) to develop and implement a patient-centered community-based Cultural Competence Curriculum; (2) to improve the cultural competence of faculty, practicing physicians, and allied disciplines in West Texas through a new Cultural Competence Faculty Development and Continuing Medical Education Program; and (3) to disseminate curricular activities, project evaluation reports, and scholarship on the impact of the Cultural Competence Curriculum to West Texans, the NHBLI Coordinating Centers, and the national medical education community through a Cultural Competence Education Network and website, two symposia on Measuring Cultural Competence in Medical Education, and Project publications. An interdisciplinary Health   Disparities Project Team will develop curricular activities targeting cardiovascular, pulmonary, hematological, and sleep disorders with known health disparities in our region-hypertension, asthma, sickle cell anemia, and obesity/sleep disorders. A Health Disparities Advisory Board will help anchor this curriculum to new knowledge about health disparities from the ultimate arbiters of culturally competent care, the patients and the community. This Curriculum will be embedded in the first new undergraduate program at the TTUHSCSOM in 30 years. The Curriculum features a variety of learning exercises in all 4 years, such as taking patient life histories in the community, learning medical Spanish, serving as patient navigators, and analyzing cases of cultural mismatch or health inequities. An intensive Project evaluation program is planned.

The goal of the Community Outreach/Dissemination Core is to disseminate research from the CEHDR into targeted communities (K-12, health professions, community-based organizations, community residents, and researchers at Texas Medical Center Institutions) by linking with an existing network of community health collaboratives in the Houston area. This network, developed by St. Luke's Episcopal Health Charities (sub-component of a tertiary care health system), actively addresses local health concerns in 10 multi-ethnic neighborhoods highly affected by health disparities. The goal of the Training/Mentoring Core is to provide mentoring by linking junior faculty at TSU with established researchers at TSU, Houston Center for Quality of Care and Utilization Studies, and Baylor College of Medicine.         ",Research & Community: Cardiovascular Disease and Stroke,7091621,R24MD001116,"['hypertension ', ' stroke ', ' health science research support ', ' clinical research ', ' health disparity ', ' ']",NIMHD,TEXAS SOUTHERN UNIVERSITY,R24,2006,714582,-0.05687075269806318
"Creation of an Hispanic Health Research Center in LRGV DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  There are two disabling dimensions to Health Disparities in minorities. The first is that minorities have higher frequencies of many diseases, and the second that they have fewer trained people to research and address those diseases within their own populations. Nowhere in the US does this apply more than to the Lower Rio Grande Valley of South Texas. This proposal addresses both dimensions of health disparity by partnering two institutions in a predominantly (85%) Hispanic border region of South Texas: that is, the, Regional Campus at Brownsville of the University of Texas Houston School of Public Health and The University of Texas at Brownsville/Texas Southmost College. This partnership will also draw on expertise and resources of the University of Texas Houston School of Public Health and the University of Texas Houston Health Science Center. Nowhere in the US is there a center dedicated specifically to research on the health of Hispanic Americans. The purpose of this proposal is to create such a Hispanic Health Research Center within the existing academic institutions of a predominantly Hispanic community, designed to address the disease burdens and the paucity of research capacity in this poor, undereducated and medically underserved Hispanic population. The activities of the Hispanic Health Research Center will encompass research on health disparities in Hispanics, provide a source of data on Hispanic health, develop and evaluate intervention strategies for Hispanic cultures, evolve research collaborations with other Hispanic communities, and build research capacity in South Texas LRGV. We propose to develop nine cores, of which three are research cores with projects addressing specific aspects of the major killers of the Hispanic population of South Texas, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and cancer. The grant will be centered in Brownsville, in the adjacent, newly constructed buildings of the two partnering institutions on their common campus, sharing web and video facilities, library services, laboratories and other resources. The long-term goals are to enhance the ability of individuals from both partnering institutions to apply for research funding, and to create a strong scientific and academic relationship between the two institutions and the collaborating institutions in Houston.

"West Texas EXPORT Center    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Health disparities in West Texas are associated with healthcare under-service on a scale that is both vast and highly diverse. This region offers a valuable context for (1) study of disparities in health status among Hispanic and rural underserved populations (2) development of community-based participatory research methods for studying intervention approaches to traditionally intractable rural health problems, and (3) creation of interventions that can reduce disparities in health outcomes. The West Texas Rural EXPORT Center will leverage resources at Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center (TTUHSC) and Texas Tech University. Work of the Center will build on a tradition of successful collaboration, community outreach, and program development in the TTUHSC Office of Rural & Community Health, which is currently directing the West Texas Area Health Education Center (AHEC) program. The AHECs will play key roles in establishing partnerships with community-based organizations and individuals from health-disparity groups, in disseminating information, and in eliciting participation in clinical studies and in the conduct of health promotion, disease prevention and early intervention research. The West Texas Rural EXPORT Center will be organized in five components: Administrative, Community Outreach, Shared Resources, Training, and Research Questions. Research will focus on three leading determinants of health disparities in the region: low socioeconomic status, ethnicity and rurality. The West Texas Rural EXPORT Center will (1) develop partnerships between other academic institutions and community organizations (2) strengthen research and training infrastructure (3) develop research questions through pilot studies that explore behavioral, cultural, economic, and political determinants of disparity in rural areas and (4) develop community-based research methods for studying intervention approaches to eliminating health disparities, all leading to the submission of a P20 grant to further develop research in this area.         ",West Texas EXPORT Center,7104245,R24MD001097,"['health science research support ', ' human subject ', ' Hispanic American ', ' rural area ', ' clinical research ', ' health disparity ', ' ']",NIMHD,TEXAS TECH UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIS CENTER,R24,2006,484159,0.19334087690564597
"Developing Biomedical Research Infrastructure at UTB/TSC    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The partnership of the University of Texas at Brownsville and Texas Southmost College (UTB/TSC) has produced a rapidly-growing institution that serves over 11,000 predominately Hispanic students (93%) from the impoverished southern Texas region of the Lower Rio Grande Valley (LRGV).  Strategies dedicated to foster the development of research opportunities are being pursued to better serve this student population.  As a result, UTB/TSC is making the transition from an exclusively teaching to a research/teaching institution.  UTB/TSC has agreed to create centers of excellence to develop competitive research programs in areas relevant to its mission.  To this aim, the Center for Biomedical Studies (CBS) was created in 2003 with the mission of promoting biomedical research initiatives and facilitating intra- and inter-institutional collaborations among scientists.  The long-term goal of the CBS is to reduce minority health disparities by fostering research programs relevant to the community, offering new career opportunities to minority students, and supporting diverse outreach activities.  Although biomedical scientists of the CBS have successfully obtained federal funding, existing resources and research infrastructure are limited and insufficient to support present and projected growth.  The specific aims (SA) outlined in this proposal seek to overcome present hurdles and enhance existing infrastructures to support growing biomedical research initiatives.  More specifically, the RIMI program will increase the number of faculty personnel with expertise in thematic research areas relevant to the strategic plan of the institution (SA1), create the necessary research infrastructure to support biomedical research (SA2) and support intra- and inter-institutional collaborative research projects contributing to the accumulation of knowledge, support scientific environment and career development (SA3).  Finally, a successful RIMI application will enhance the overall quality of the educational experience, provide new career opportunities, and would certainly impact minority health disparities in the LRGV.         ",Developing Biomedical Research Infrastructure at UTB/TSC,6967536,P20MD001091,"['education evaluation /planning ', ' minority institution research support ', ' Hispanic American ', ' science education ', ' behavioral /social science research tag ', ' health services research tag ', ' medically underserved population ', ' health disparity ', ' ']",NIMHD,UNIV/TEXAS BROWNSVILLE & SOUTHMOST COLL,P20,2006,1020447,0.1337870479372775

"Project EXPORT: Bridging the Gap: Addressing Environmen*    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  ""Bridging the Gap: Addressing Environmental Health through Science,"" is presented by the Center for Research on Minority Health (CRMH), the first Congressionally-mandated center outside the nation's capital to address minority health issues. The CRMH, part of The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center (UTMDACC), and Prairie View A & M University are in a unique position to address cancer disparities. (1) We have well-established networks in Houston's highly diverse communities, and 11 of the CRMH's 29 staff members are bilingual in either Spanish, Chinese, or Vietnamese. (2) Our mission and infrastructure were designed for the types of programs that a Project EXPORT center is expected to implement and maintain. (3) We have previous experience using a multi-disciplinary approach that successfully combines the skills of basic and clinical scientists, field epidemiologists, nurses, public health professionals, and community outreach workers with the resources of numerous educational and medical facilities and hearth coalitions. Unlike other centers that are based in schools of public health or similar academic departments, the CRMH has access to numerous clinical and basic research facilities and training grants at UTMDACC and other institutions in and around the Texas Medical Center. Students participating in our programs will receive mentoring and develop professional networks that foster interest in graduate and post-graduate training in health disparities research and related career opportunities in science and medicine. The primary research project will be a molecular epidemiology study of the roles that genetic susceptibility and mutagenicity biomarkers play in assessing exposure risks and synergistic effects of chronic pesticide exposure in children of migrant/seasonal farm workers in Harris County (Houston, Baytown) and Hidalgo County (South Texas). Community outreach and educational efforts will focus on public awareness of environmental factors in cancer and the importance of minorities' participation in clinical trials. We will share resources with the UTMDACC Center for Research on Environmental Diseases (CRED) and other health centers sponsored by the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences to (1) begin educational programs for the kindergarten-12th grade levels promoting healthy eating habits; (2) develop a curriculum for summer training programs for K-12 teachers; and (3) augment the CRED website with translations of its existing materials into Spanish. We will also work with Cancer Information Services and the UTMDACC Office of Public Education to inform the public, health care providers, and potential clinical trial participants about cancer treatment and prevention trials. Our professional training efforts include (1) developing a curriculum that will promote the study of cancer and health disparities in ethnic minorities and the medically underserved and (2) providing experience to minority students seeking a career in environmental nursing. Students will begin training with one of our collaborators at the high school or junior college level and gain access to the resources of our collaborating institutions that offer graduate and post-graduate training. Additionally, the UTMDACC Biostatistics Department will develop a data management system with Prairie View A & M, a historically black university, and will train Prairie View students to maintain and update the system for future research projects. Pilot projects include (1) a study of gene-environment interactions and their relationship to cancer in Latino populations and (2) a health needs assessment of local Asian American populations.

"Bridging the Gap: A Patient-Centered Curriculum for Cultural Competence    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       As in the nation, health disparities undercut the health and well-being of the multicultural populations of West Texas and the Texas-Mexico Border. Improving the cultural competence of health care providers is critical for spanning the fault lines of the health care divide: enthnicity and acculturation; socioeconomic status; health belief systems; language and intercultural communication; and provider skills, to name but a few. The Patient-Centered Cultural Competence Curriculum proposed by the Texas Tech Univeristy Health Sciences Center School of Medicine (TTUHSC-SOM) will develop and implement curricular activities and training programs to enhance the cultural competence of medical students, residents, faculty and community physicians, and health care professionals to better address the needs and health outcomes of the West Texas and Border populations. The specific aims of the Texas Tech Cultural Competence Curriculum are to: (1) to develop and implement a patient-centered community-based Cultural Competence Curriculum; (2) to improve the cultural competence of faculty, practicing physicians, and allied disciplines in West Texas through a new Cultural Competence Faculty Development and Continuing Medical Education Program; and (3) to disseminate curricular activities, project evaluation reports, and scholarship on the impact of the Cultural Competence Curriculum to West Texans, the NHBLI Coordinating Centers, and the national medical education community through a Cultural Competence Education Network and website, two symposia on Measuring Cultural Competence in Medical Education, and Project publications. An interdisciplinary Health   Disparities Project Team will develop curricular activities targeting cardiovascular, pulmonary, hematological, and sleep disorders with known health disparities in our region-hypertension, asthma, sickle cell anemia, and obesity/sleep disorders. A Health Disparities Advisory Board will help anchor this curriculum to new knowledge about health disparities from the ultimate arbiters of culturally competent care, the patients and the community. This Curriculum will be embedded in the first new undergraduate program at the TTUHSCSOM in 30 years. The Curriculum features a variety of learning exercises in all 4 years, such as taking patient life histories in the community, learning medical Spanish, serving as patient navigators, and analyzing cases of cultural mismatch or health inequities. An intensive Project evaluation program is planned.

"Developing Biomedical Research Infrastructure at UTB/TSC    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The partnership of the University of Texas at Brownsville and Texas Southmost College (UTB/TSC) has produced a rapidly-growing institution that serves over 11,000 predominately Hispanic students (93%) from the impoverished southern Texas region of the Lower Rio Grande Valley (LRGV).  Strategies dedicated to foster the development of research opportunities are being pursued to better serve this student population.  As a result, UTB/TSC is making the transition from an exclusively teaching to a research/teaching institution.  UTB/TSC has agreed to create centers of excellence to develop competitive research programs in areas relevant to its mission.  To this aim, the Center for Biomedical Studies (CBS) was created in 2003 with the mission of promoting biomedical research initiatives and facilitating intra- and inter-institutional collaborations among scientists.  The long-term goal of the CBS is to reduce minority health disparities by fostering research programs relevant to the community, offering new career opportunities to minority students, and supporting diverse outreach activities.  Although biomedical scientists of the CBS have successfully obtained federal funding, existing resources and research infrastructure are limited and insufficient to support present and projected growth.  The specific aims (SA) outlined in this proposal seek to overcome present hurdles and enhance existing infrastructures to support growing biomedical research initiatives.  More specifically, the RIMI program will increase the number of faculty personnel with expertise in thematic research areas relevant to the strategic plan of the institution (SA1), create the necessary research infrastructure to support biomedical research (SA2) and support intra- and inter-institutional collaborative research projects contributing to the accumulation of knowledge, support scientific environment and career development (SA3).  Finally, a successful RIMI application will enhance the overall quality of the educational experience, provide new career opportunities, and would certainly impact minority health disparities in the LRGV.         ",Developing Biomedical Research Infrastructure at UTB/TSC,7141696,P20MD001091,[''],NIMHD,UNIV/TEXAS BROWNSVILLE & SOUTHMOST COLL,P20,2007,922653,0.1337870479372775
"UTPA Health Services Research Initiative    DESCRIPTION (PROVIDED BY APPLICANT): The University of Texas-Pan American (UTPA) is the second largest Hispanic Serving Institution in the U S. and it educates more Mexican American students than any other institution of higher education in the country. UTPA serves the educational needs of one of the poorest regions in the U.S.-the U.S.-Mexico border communities located in the Rio Grande Valley of South Texas. According to The University of Texas- Pan American Compact with the University of Texas System, the highest priority long-term initiative of UTPA for the next ten years is to become the doctoral research university of South Texas. In order to achieve this objective, UTPA is interested in developing new graduate degree programs and in increasing the research capacity and productivity of its faculty, especially in areas of regional strategic significance such as health services research. This AHRQ M-RISP application seeks to develop a Health Services Research (HSR) Initiative within the UTPA Institute for Population Health Policy (IPHP) to strengthen the research environment at UTPA and to enhance the competitiveness of faculty members in health services research. The research activities to be undertaken under the HSR Initiative primarily focus on health disparities and health care utilization/access for priority populations-more specifically, low-income minority populations in the U.S.-Mexico border and the uninsured. The HSR Initiative also takes advantage of an ongoing collaborative partnership between the IPHP and the Leonard Davis Institute (LDI) of Health Economics at the University of Pennsylvania. The LDI will provide technical expertise, mentoring and support to the proposed HSR Initiative. The Specific Aims of this M-RISP application are: (1) to develop a Health Services Research Initiative at UTPA, (2) to enhance the capacity of individual faculty members to undertake health service research, with a focus on research in low-income minority populations and the uninsured, and (3) to develop and foster research dedicated to reducing health and health care access disparities among Latino populations, particularly in the U.S.-Mexico border region. The HSR Initiative will support four individual investigator research projects which deal with community uninsurance and health care access, the use of health care services in the U.S.-Mexico border region, severe weather and health care use by low-income and uninsured vulnerable populations, and the cost-effectiveness and net-benefits of school-based health promotion programs. The proposed HSR Initiative will also actively promote the development of research projects by junior faculty and graduate students which focus on the U.S. Latino population and are consistent with the goals and objectives of both AHRQ and the UTPA-IPHP HSR Initiative.          ",UTPA Health Services Research Initiative,7348706,R24HS017003,[''],AHRQ,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS RIO GRANDE VALLEY,R24,2007,487345,0.04940705684402506
"Creation of an Hispanic Health Research Center in LRGV DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  There are two disabling dimensions to Health Disparities in minorities. The first is that minorities have higher frequencies of many diseases, and the second that they have fewer trained people to research and address those diseases within their own populations. Nowhere in the US does this apply more than to the Lower Rio Grande Valley of South Texas. This proposal addresses both dimensions of health disparity by partnering two institutions in a predominantly (85%) Hispanic border region of South Texas: that is, the, Regional Campus at Brownsville of the University of Texas Houston School of Public Health and The University of Texas at Brownsville/Texas Southmost College. This partnership will also draw on expertise and resources of the University of Texas Houston School of Public Health and the University of Texas Houston Health Science Center. Nowhere in the US is there a center dedicated specifically to research on the health of Hispanic Americans. The purpose of this proposal is to create such a Hispanic Health Research Center within the existing academic institutions of a predominantly Hispanic community, designed to address the disease burdens and the paucity of research capacity in this poor, undereducated and medically underserved Hispanic population. The activities of the Hispanic Health Research Center will encompass research on health disparities in Hispanics, provide a source of data on Hispanic health, develop and evaluate intervention strategies for Hispanic cultures, evolve research collaborations with other Hispanic communities, and build research capacity in South Texas LRGV. We propose to develop nine cores, of which three are research cores with projects addressing specific aspects of the major killers of the Hispanic population of South Texas, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and cancer. The grant will be centered in Brownsville, in the adjacent, newly constructed buildings of the two partnering institutions on their common campus, sharing web and video facilities, library services, laboratories and other resources. The long-term goals are to enhance the ability of individuals from both partnering institutions to apply for research funding, and to create a strong scientific and academic relationship between the two institutions and the collaborating institutions in Houston.

"The Program for Rural and Minority Health Disparities Research    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Despite considerable progress over the past 30 years in improving the health of the U.S. population, there continue to be substantial disparities in health status among many minority and underserved populations. Previous research has examined the impact of setting on health disparities or the impact of race/ethnicity on health disparities; the proposed program capitalizes on the complementary research expertise of two nationally recognized research centers to look at the interaction of setting and population factors. This Program for Rural and Minority Health Disparities Research will address rural and minority health issues by: (i) providing critical information on how population and setting characteristics (contextual factors) impact food choice, dietary patterns, and the risk of obesity in minority and rural populations, including children; (2) developing interventions to reduce the risk of obesity, particularly among rural, minority, and underserved individuals; (3) testing the differential effectiveness of diabetes self-management models in rural, urban and minority populations; (4) strengthening the ability of Texas A&M University, the Texas A&M Health Science Center, and the Texas A&M System to support disparities research and the recruitment and training of faculty committed to disparities research; and (5) developing a health disparities institute at the system level that will serve the 9 universities and 6 state agencies of the Texas A&M System. The system-level health disparities institute will strengthen collaboration among disparities researchers at multiple campuses, support training of faculty and students in disparities issues, and support the recruitment and training of students and new faculty in health disparities. Jointly sponsored by the Texas A&M University Center for the Study of Health Disparities and the Texas A&M Health Science Center School of Rural Public Health Center for Community Health Development, this Program will support 3 core research projects around the Program focus of obesity prevention and chronic disease self-management; the development of a network of disparities researchers; and the training of students-graduate and undergraduate-and faculty in disparities issues and research methods. The Program will also facilitate continued outreach and collaboration with multiple community partners in the Brazos Valley and surrounding counties to reduce health disparities; and strengthened collaboration among Faculty of Texas A&M University and the Health Science Center in addressing health disparities.           ",The Program for Rural and Minority Health Disparities Research,7304261,P20MD002295,[''],NIMHD,TEXAS A&M UNIVERSITY,P20,2007,1381487,0.18621352837639088
"Can Promotoras Change Clinical Outcomes for Chronic Diseases in El Paso, Texas    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): With a commitment to the development of strong academic-community partnerships, the University of Texas at El Paso in collaboration with the UT School of Public Health El Paso regional campus, along with several academic-community partners propose to address cardiovascular health disparities experienced by residents in a Texas community along the US-Mexico border region. The project proposes to develop a plan that employs a community health worker (CHW)/Promotoras approach to effectively promote cardiovascular health among Hispanics in order to brake the cycle of behaviors that place individuals and their families at risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD). Specific aims are to develop a Community Advisory Board (CAB) to lead the participatory research process; perform a community needs/assets assessment to guide the research process; and conduct a pilot intervention to identify an optimal CHW outreach approach. Participating border community is geographically bound within the Lower Valley and Mission Valley of El Paso, Texas. Strategies for involving the community at initiation of the project include community forums, focus groups, and monthly round table working discussions with many community partners from the targeted population. The participation of the community in the research process will be formally established via the CAB. Salud para su Corazon (Health for your Heart) intervention will serve as catalyst for discussion of a community action plan.This dialogue generated from the collaborative relationships will drive the design of a two-year pilot intervention based upon community needs. The research team seeks to employ a field experimental design with random assignment to intervention and control groups of 330 Hispanic adults with two or more CVD risk factors for the two year pilot study. The outcome variables of interest include behavioral and clinical measures. The ultimate goal of the project is to consolidate partnerships as part of a unified approach to prevention and control of CVD prevalent in the US-Mexico border area.

"MBRS RISE Program at the University of Texas at Brownsville  Principal Investigator/Program Director (Last, first, middle): Nelson, Eldon Lane INSTITUTIONAL SETTING AND GENERAL PLAN DESCRIPTION OF THE INSTITUTION Origin and development of the institution Located on the Texas-Mexico border at the southern tip of the state, the newest component of the University of Texas System, The University of Texas at Brownsville (UTB) and the oldest accredited public junior college in Texas, Texas Southmost College (TSC), have formed an innovative partnership (UTB/TSC) to meet the special educational needs of the region. This new ""partnership"" institution, created in 1991 by special state legislation and designated a ""consolidated entity"" by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools (SACS), offers students the combined instructional, administrative, and support services of a comprehensive community college and an upper division and graduate university. Although the two institutions retain separate legal status along with separate funding sources and fee structures, UTB/TSC functions as one institution to maximize resources and offer combined educational programs as a single seamless curriculum. UTB/TSC is one school and is accredited as one institution. In the fall of 2002, the student enrollment at UTB/TSC totaled 9,974 of which 93% of the students qualified as minority members (1). UTB/TSC is internally composed of five schools: the College of Science, Mathematics and Technology (CSMT), the College of Liberal Arts, the School of Business, the School of Education, and the School of Health Sciences. Presently, CSMT offers ten certificate programs, four associate degree programs, six bachelor degree programs, and one Master of Science degree program. Within CSMT resides the RISE participating department (Biology). The average (fall/spring) enrollment for this one department nears 1,800 students per semester. Currently, a Bachelor of Science degree is being offered in Biology. A Master of Science Degree in Interdisciplinary Studies with a concentration in Biology is also currently offered, and a Master of Science Degree in Biology has been developed and is pending UT System approval. UTB/TSC's innovative purpose and structure have been responsive to the educational challenges of the Rio Grande Valley. UTB/TSC operates with an open- admissions policy that enables it to provide a wide range of educational options to low-income, minority students, many of whom are first-generation college students. Our region is a largely Hispanic, an economically poor, and a relatively uneducated population. According the 2000 U.S. Census, the city of Brownsville's official population totaled 139,722 people. From 1990 - 2000, Brownsville was the third fastest growing city in the state of Texas at 41.2% and is projected to continue to grow at a phenomenal rate. Nevertheless, Brownsville was also listed as the poorest city in the U.S.A. amongst all cities with 100,000 or more populations. Coupled with the local economic situation, only 13.4% of our residents hold college degrees as compared to a national average of 24.4%. Only 55% of the population 25 years and older have even graduated from high school (2). The challenges of our area are great and the resources are sparse. Nevertheless, UTB/TSC believes that the strength of our region and our nation as well as our economy will triumph through education. Scholarly Activity Table 1 (page 78) summarizes and reveals the scholarly activity in terms of publications and grant applications made by and awarded to, the faculty of the participating department (Biology). The publication and grant success for this department's small faculty has been somewhat successful over the past few years, even though the focus of the institution has not been to research. Table 2 (page 78) more specifically identifies the research and scholarly activities over the last year (2002/03) of those faculty included as MBRS RISE Faculty in this grant proposal (Dr. Luis Colom, Dr. Yaima Garrido, Dr. Daniele Provenzano, Dr. Gerson Peltz, and Dr. Massoud Zarei). These five, relatively new (all hired within the past two years) faculty members have initiated a UTB/TSC publication and grant base upon which to enhance the professional productivity of our biomedical program. Colom, Peltz, and Zarei currently have grants awarded to UTB/TSC. UTB/TSC Demographic Information: PHS 398/2590 (Rev. 05/01) Page .5 ] __ Continuation Format Page PrincipInavelstigator/Program Director (Last, first, middle): Nelson, Eldon Lane Distribution of Students Table 3 (page 78) illustrates the overall student enrollments at UTB/TSC over the past four years. Of the 9,974 students enrolled in 2002, 93% are predominately Hispanic minority students and 91% of UTB/TSC graduate students enrolled are classified as Hispanic. Table 4 (page 78) shows that during the Fall 2002 semester, there were a total of 116 Biology majors of which 90% are classified as minority members; 89% are Hispanic. Distribution of Faculty Parallel to the growth in the student population, the minority faculty members at UTB/TSC have increased. Nearly 55% of our faculty are minority members, 49% are Hispanic (Table 5 page 78). Of those minority faculty members, 36%, are tenured which places UTB/TSC as one of the top most Hispanic institutions in Texas as rated by the Texas Higher Education Hispanic Report Card (3). Research activities at UTB/TSC: During the past four years, faculty members, particularly in CSMT, have initiated scientific research activity in the biology and physics departments. Current biomedical research and study is being conducted principally in Biology (funding through NIH and American Heart Association). The biology department includes a large percentage of minority faculty (Table 6 page 79) and has produced a small but significant amount of publications and grants applications as described earlier in Table 1. Currently, four of the biology department faculty have biomedical research experience: Luis V. Colom in neurosciences, Gerson Peltz in cancer studies and nutrition, Daniele Provenzano in Microbial Pathogenesis, Molecular Biology of Prokaryotes, and Applied Genomics, Masoud Zarei in cardiovascular studies. Yaima Garrido also in neurosciences will also join UTB/TSC in Fall 2003. UTB/TSC's Commitment The Institution's Commitment to the Hiring of Underrepresented Minority Faculty In the May 6, 2002 edition of Hispanic Outlook (4), UTB was listed with the highest percentage of Hispanic faculty of any university in the nation at 37.9% (These figures did not include community colleges, therefore did not include our community college faculty that would have increased the UTB/TSC percentage to approximately 48% Hispanic). The January 2003 report by the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board (3) listed UTB and TSC as among the two highest rated two-year and four-year institutions in the State with regard to number of Hispanic faculty, percentage of full-time Hispanic faculty, the number of Hispanic students, the percentage of Hispanic students, the ratio comparison of Hispanic faculty to Hispanic students, and the number and percentage of degrees awarded to Hispanics. A primary objective for UTB/TSC is to promote and facilitate faculty development in research. The high percentage of Hispanic faculty in the institution as a whole and in the participating departments stands as evidence of the institution's commitment to hiring of underrepresented minority faculty (see Tables 5 and 6 pages 78-79). Although new to biomedical research, UTB/TSC is strongly committed to hiring a cadre of scholars who can enhance the curriculum and the research infrastructure of the institution. UTB/TSC requires that the faculty be engaged continually in its own development or improvement, and believes that growth is mandatory for faculty, as well as students. It recognizes, also, its responsibility, not only to require that the faculty advance professionally, but to also facilitate such advancement. This young university's objective, in this regard, is to promote and facilitate faculty development in teaching, research or scholarship, and service. The standard set, as articulated clearly in its policies on merit, promotion and tenure, is that faculty attain a high level of achievement in teaching, research/scholarship, and service to the professions, as well as to the university and the community. The university is dedicated to increase faculty/student minority representation in the fields of medicine and biomedical research. Institution Commitment to the Training of Underrepresented Minority Students UTB/TSC places particular emphasis on integrating appropriate resources from its graduate, research, and service programs into its undergraduate curriculum, in order to enhance student educational experiences and PHS 398/2590 (Rev. 05/01) Page 52 Continuation Format Page  Principal Investigator/Program Director (Last, first, middle): Nelson, Eldon Lane to motivate students to pursue programs of service. The university is committed to serving the professional communities represented by its academic programs, while also assisting local government, local businesses, and community groups in addressing the problems of the region. Special attention is given to in-service training for public school teachers and enrichment programs and counseling services for students who would not otherwise have an opportunity for pursuing college study. The ""open-admissions"" policy of the institution provides opportunities for those that ""competitive entrance"" would deny. The institution is supported by a major grant from the U. S. Department of Education - Title V - Developing Hispanic Serving Institutions Program which has as its major thrust, increasing retention through improving academic programs, especially for students in developmental and gatekeeper courses within an integrated program of faculty development and student support services. Through this program, 60 faculty have been given training in research based learning theory and methodologies, learning styles, ESL methodologies, mentoring, retention issues, and use of technology in the classroom. Over one hundred students received peer tutor training and 4,463 student contacts were recorded in the Learning Assistance Center. The Learning Assistance Center provides students with help with tutoring in many academic subject areas, supplemental instruction programs and specific programs in reading, writing, English language skills, and mathematics. UTB/TSC also has an Academic Computing Center, a newly opened Counseling Center, a Media Center, and a Center for Career Development, which makes available career counseling, planning and placement services to students from all academic departments. Some undergraduate students have been given opportunities and support for participation in research projects through the National Science Foundation - Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation Program (AMP), but most students do not currently have these opportunities. As a part of the AMP program, in the spring of 2001 the institution held its third annual student research day symposium in which students made presentations of their research projects. Unified Plan Currently UTB/TSC has made an application to the MBRS SCORE Program and is awaiting review. These two programs, the RISE and the SCORE will indeed complement each other and will both greatly expand our research capabilities as well as provide our students with opportunities to explore biomedical research and its related fields. If the SCORE is funded, it will provide to laboratory opportunities to graduate students. If the RISE is funded, it will provide additional laboratory opportunities to undergraduate students who may then have the opportunity to continue their experiences into the UTB/TSC SCORE program. The SCORE requests assistance to renovate our 2 nd floor facilities for research labs; whereas this RISE requests funding for renovating the first floor general laboratory into faculty/student biomedical research laboratories. Whereas, there may be some overlap of support requested between the SCORE and RISE proposals, these will be easily and fairly addressed if both proposals are successful. ANTICIPATED VALUE OF THE PROPOSED MBRS RISE PROGRAM TO THE INSTITUTION Until the last two years, UTB/TSC had seen little activity in research among its faculty. A few of the faculty made some presentations, had some publication activity in the science fields and but very little sponsored research activity. In forming this new university, most of the faculty in the sciences came from the community college (TSC) and were exclusively teachers as the teaching loads were full-time without research expectations, though scholarly writing was encouraged. In the last four years, however, the faculty has been somewhat transformed, i.e., new faculty and department chairs with research history and grant productivity were hired. This transformation was initiated within the physics department, but has since included the biological and health sciences areas with some effect (Table 1 page 78). Within the last 18 months, four faculty members active in biomedical research have been added to the Biology Department faculty. UTB/TSC faculty in the sciences have since obtained grant support form public and private agencies and foundations including: The National Institutes of Health, the National Science Foundation, the Department of Defense, NASA, the American Heart Association, the Texas Bureau of Economic Geology, the Welch Foundation and Kellogg Foundation. Additionally, the UTHSC-Houston School of Public Health has opened a branch on the PHS 398/2590 (Rev. 05/01) Page 53 Continuation Format Page ",MBRS RISE Program at the University of Texas at Brownsville,7625310,R25GM065925,"['Vision ', ' visual function ', ' Sight ', ' Vocational Guidance ', ' Occupational Guidance ', ' Career Counseling ', ' Investigation ', ' Walkers ', ' Work ', ' Writing ', ' Hour ', ' day ', ' Week ', ' Event ', ' Oral ', ' Distant ', ' Award ', ' Awareness ', ' Score ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' Location ', ' Class ', ' Baltimore ', ' gastrointestinal ', ' interest ', ' Visit ', ' Biochemistry ', ' Biological Chemistry ', ' Biology ', ' Biomedical Research ', ' Biometry ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Biometrics ', ' Biotechnology ', ' college ', ' collegiate ', ' Services ', ' Medical center ', ' information gathering ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' field study ', ' Performance ', ' success ', ' university student ', ' college student ', ' research facility ', ' biomedical scientist ', ' high school ', ' professor ', ' metropolitan ', ' biomathematics ', ' microbial ', ' austin ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' Budgets ', ' Secure ', ' Speed (motion) ', ' Speed ', ' Structure ', ' Pharmacology and Toxicology ', ' skills ', ' expectation ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' peer ', ' member ', ' Funding Agency ', ' Funding Source ', ' Camping ', ' research study ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Categories ', ' Pathogenesis ', ' Human Resources ', ' personnel ', ' Manpower ', ' Reporting ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' circulatory system ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' Cardiovascular system (all sites) ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Gatekeeping ', ' gatekeeper ', ' Cell physiology ', ' Subcellular Process ', ' Cellular Process ', ' Cellular Physiology ', ' Cellular Function ', ' Cell Process ', ' Cell Function ', ' Censuses ', ' Generations ', ' Measures ', ' Chemistry ', ' Admission activity ', ' Admission ', ' Research Ethics ', ' Workload ', ' Work Load ', ' Prosencephalon ', ' Forebrain ', ' Fore-Brain ', ' Telefacsimile ', ' Telefax ', ' Fax ', ' falls ', ' abstracting ', ' Businesses ', ' Pan Genus ', ' Pan Species ', ' Chimpanzee ', ' Chimp ', ' symposium ', ' conference ', ' Film ', ' Hispanics ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Latino ', ' Schedule ', ' Modeling ', ' performance tests ', ' desire ', ' theories ', ' Academic Medical Centers ', ' University Medical Centers ', ' Cities ', ' Genomics ', ' hospital organization ', ' Communicable Diseases ', ' Infectious Disorder ', ' Infectious Diseases and Manifestations ', ' Infectious Diseases ', ' Infectious Disease Pathway ', ' Communities ', ' Complement ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Instruction ', ' cost ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Minority ', ' willingness ', ' Population ', ' frontier ', ' South Texas ', ' Coupled ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' Computers ', ' Drops ', ' Publications ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Publishing ', ' Depressed mood ', ' sadness ', ' depressed ', ' Reading ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' recruit ', ' Figs -

"Hispanic Health Disparities Research Center    DESCRIPTION (provided by the applicant): We propose to develop a P20 Research Center to address Hispanic health disparities by mentoring a new generation of health researchers through education, research, and research training. The Center will be committed to translatiing and disseminating findings and lessons learned to providers, policy makers and community partners.The Center will comprise four cores: 1) Administrative, 2) Research, 3) Research Training and Education, and 4) Community Engagement and Dissemination. The proposed HHDRC will take advantage of the individual and collective momentum generated in and through ongoing collaborative relationships between the University of Texas at El Paso, School of Nursing and College of Health Sciences and University of Texas at Houston Health Science Center - School of Public Health. These relationships foster sustainable mechanisms for scholarship development in Hispanic American health disparities. The HHDRC will be guided by a conceptual framework that makes explicit the variables that influence Hispanic health disparities in our Border communities. Research based upon this framework will seek mechanisms to reduce Hispanic American health disparities. The HHDRC will integrate the two full studies submitted with this application, as well as new pilot studies in years 3-5 of the grant.

"Texas Center for Minority Health, Education, Research and Outreach    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In 2004, the combined ""minority"" populations of Texas surpassed the non-Hispanic white population. By the year 2026, the Hispanic population is projected to become the majority population in Texas. Published reports on health disparities in Texas have shown striking disparities in the health status, access to health care and risk factors between the racial and ethnic minorities and the general population in Texas. The racial and ethnic minority populations have a higher mortality rate from heart disease, stroke, diabetes, HIV and tobacco-related diseases. To combat this problem, the University of North Texas Health Science Center will establish the Texas Center for Minority Health, Education, Research and Outreach"" (Texas EXPORT Center) to coordinate the research, education and community outreach activities.      Our vision for the Texas EXPORT Center is to augment and strengthen our infrastructure and capacity to conduct basic, clinical and behavioral research aimed at eliminating health disparities that exist in the racial and ethnic minorities in Texas, as well as to develop collaborative research, education and community outreach activities with our partner underrepresented minority (URM) institutions. We will identify our institutional and community partners for the Texas EXPORT Center activities, support development of health disparity research projects, develop a pipeline for URM student participation in research and establish our community outreach programs.       The objectives of this application are: 1) Foster existing relationships and develop new relationships with URM institutions as partners for our EXPORT center; 2) Conduct research on health disparity areas that exist in Texas minorities such as diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, cancer, stroke and HIV; 3) Provide unique opportunities for minority students and faculty from URM institutions in health disparity research; 4) Promote education of students in health professions, health care practitioners and policy makers on the existence of health disparities and the need to combat the problem; and 5) Serve as a resource for the minority communities to disseminate health information, promote community participation in health education and research, and to implement disease prevention activities.      The expected outcome will be enabling research aimed at eliminating health disparities, mentor minority students and faculty to become health professionals and outreaching to the minority communities to facilitate understanding and elimination of health disparities.            ","Texas Center for Minority Health, Education, Research and Outreach",7463510,P20MD001633,[''],NIMHD,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH TEXAS HLTH SCI CTR,P20,2008,2157830,0.21210788533091926
"Bridging the Gap: A Patient-Centered Curriculum for Cultural Competence    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       As in the nation, health disparities undercut the health and well-being of the multicultural populations of West Texas and the Texas-Mexico Border. Improving the cultural competence of health care providers is critical for spanning the fault lines of the health care divide: enthnicity and acculturation; socioeconomic status; health belief systems; language and intercultural communication; and provider skills, to name but a few. The Patient-Centered Cultural Competence Curriculum proposed by the Texas Tech Univeristy Health Sciences Center School of Medicine (TTUHSC-SOM) will develop and implement curricular activities and training programs to enhance the cultural competence of medical students, residents, faculty and community physicians, and health care professionals to better address the needs and health outcomes of the West Texas and Border populations. The specific aims of the Texas Tech Cultural Competence Curriculum are to: (1) to develop and implement a patient-centered community-based Cultural Competence Curriculum; (2) to improve the cultural competence of faculty, practicing physicians, and allied disciplines in West Texas through a new Cultural Competence Faculty Development and Continuing Medical Education Program; and (3) to disseminate curricular activities, project evaluation reports, and scholarship on the impact of the Cultural Competence Curriculum to West Texans, the NHBLI Coordinating Centers, and the national medical education community through a Cultural Competence Education Network and website, two symposia on Measuring Cultural Competence in Medical Education, and Project publications. An interdisciplinary Health   Disparities Project Team will develop curricular activities targeting cardiovascular, pulmonary, hematological, and sleep disorders with known health disparities in our region-hypertension, asthma, sickle cell anemia, and obesity/sleep disorders. A Health Disparities Advisory Board will help anchor this curriculum to new knowledge about health disparities from the ultimate arbiters of culturally competent care, the patients and the community. This Curriculum will be embedded in the first new undergraduate program at the TTUHSCSOM in 30 years. The Curriculum features a variety of learning exercises in all 4 years, such as taking patient life histories in the community, learning medical Spanish, serving as patient navigators, and analyzing cases of cultural mismatch or health inequities. An intensive Project evaluation program is planned.

"The Program for Rural and Minority Health Disparities Research    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Despite considerable progress over the past 30 years in improving the health of the U.S. population, there continue to be substantial disparities in health status among many minority and underserved populations. Previous research has examined the impact of setting on health disparities or the impact of race/ethnicity on health disparities; the proposed program capitalizes on the complementary research expertise of two nationally recognized research centers to look at the interaction of setting and population factors. This Program for Rural and Minority Health Disparities Research will address rural and minority health issues by: (i) providing critical information on how population and setting characteristics (contextual factors) impact food choice, dietary patterns, and the risk of obesity in minority and rural populations, including children; (2) developing interventions to reduce the risk of obesity, particularly among rural, minority, and underserved individuals; (3) testing the differential effectiveness of diabetes self-management models in rural, urban and minority populations; (4) strengthening the ability of Texas A&M University, the Texas A&M Health Science Center, and the Texas A&M System to support disparities research and the recruitment and training of faculty committed to disparities research; and (5) developing a health disparities institute at the system level that will serve the 9 universities and 6 state agencies of the Texas A&M System. The system-level health disparities institute will strengthen collaboration among disparities researchers at multiple campuses, support training of faculty and students in disparities issues, and support the recruitment and training of students and new faculty in health disparities. Jointly sponsored by the Texas A&M University Center for the Study of Health Disparities and the Texas A&M Health Science Center School of Rural Public Health Center for Community Health Development, this Program will support 3 core research projects around the Program focus of obesity prevention and chronic disease self-management; the development of a network of disparities researchers; and the training of students-graduate and undergraduate-and faculty in disparities issues and research methods. The Program will also facilitate continued outreach and collaboration with multiple community partners in the Brazos Valley and surrounding counties to reduce health disparities; and strengthened collaboration among Faculty of Texas A&M University and the Health Science Center in addressing health disparities.           ",The Program for Rural and Minority Health Disparities Research,7504090,P20MD002295,[''],NIMHD,TEXAS A&M UNIVERSITY,P20,2008,2219051,0.18621352837639088

"Developing Biomedical Research Infrastructure at UTB/TSC    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The partnership of the University of Texas at Brownsville and Texas Southmost College (UTB/TSC) has produced a rapidly-growing institution that serves over 11,000 predominately Hispanic students (93%) from the impoverished southern Texas region of the Lower Rio Grande Valley (LRGV).  Strategies dedicated to foster the development of research opportunities are being pursued to better serve this student population.  As a result, UTB/TSC is making the transition from an exclusively teaching to a research/teaching institution.  UTB/TSC has agreed to create centers of excellence to develop competitive research programs in areas relevant to its mission.  To this aim, the Center for Biomedical Studies (CBS) was created in 2003 with the mission of promoting biomedical research initiatives and facilitating intra- and inter-institutional collaborations among scientists.  The long-term goal of the CBS is to reduce minority health disparities by fostering research programs relevant to the community, offering new career opportunities to minority students, and supporting diverse outreach activities.  Although biomedical scientists of the CBS have successfully obtained federal funding, existing resources and research infrastructure are limited and insufficient to support present and projected growth.  The specific aims (SA) outlined in this proposal seek to overcome present hurdles and enhance existing infrastructures to support growing biomedical research initiatives.  More specifically, the RIMI program will increase the number of faculty personnel with expertise in thematic research areas relevant to the strategic plan of the institution (SA1), create the necessary research infrastructure to support biomedical research (SA2) and support intra- and inter-institutional collaborative research projects contributing to the accumulation of knowledge, support scientific environment and career development (SA3).  Finally, a successful RIMI application will enhance the overall quality of the educational experience, provide new career opportunities, and would certainly impact minority health disparities in the LRGV.         ",Developing Biomedical Research Infrastructure at UTB/TSC,7305452,P20MD001091,[''],NIMHD,UNIV/TEXAS BROWNSVILLE & SOUTHMOST COLL,P20,2008,976304,0.1337870479372775

"Developing Biomedical Research Infrastructure at UTB/TSC    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The partnership of the University of Texas at Brownsville and Texas Southmost College (UTB/TSC) has produced a rapidly-growing institution that serves over 11,000 predominately Hispanic students (93%) from the impoverished southern Texas region of the Lower Rio Grande Valley (LRGV).  Strategies dedicated to foster the development of research opportunities are being pursued to better serve this student population.  As a result, UTB/TSC is making the transition from an exclusively teaching to a research/teaching institution.  UTB/TSC has agreed to create centers of excellence to develop competitive research programs in areas relevant to its mission.  To this aim, the Center for Biomedical Studies (CBS) was created in 2003 with the mission of promoting biomedical research initiatives and facilitating intra- and inter-institutional collaborations among scientists.  The long-term goal of the CBS is to reduce minority health disparities by fostering research programs relevant to the community, offering new career opportunities to minority students, and supporting diverse outreach activities.  Although biomedical scientists of the CBS have successfully obtained federal funding, existing resources and research infrastructure are limited and insufficient to support present and projected growth.  The specific aims (SA) outlined in this proposal seek to overcome present hurdles and enhance existing infrastructures to support growing biomedical research initiatives.  More specifically, the RIMI program will increase the number of faculty personnel with expertise in thematic research areas relevant to the strategic plan of the institution (SA1), create the necessary research infrastructure to support biomedical research (SA2) and support intra- and inter-institutional collaborative research projects contributing to the accumulation of knowledge, support scientific environment and career development (SA3).

"Bridging the Gap: A Patient-Centered Curriculum for Cultural Competence    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       As in the nation, health disparities undercut the health and well-being of the multicultural populations of West Texas and the Texas-Mexico Border. Improving the cultural competence of health care providers is critical for spanning the fault lines of the health care divide: enthnicity and acculturation; socioeconomic status; health belief systems; language and intercultural communication; and provider skills, to name but a few. The Patient-Centered Cultural Competence Curriculum proposed by the Texas Tech Univeristy Health Sciences Center School of Medicine (TTUHSC-SOM) will develop and implement curricular activities and training programs to enhance the cultural competence of medical students, residents, faculty and community physicians, and health care professionals to better address the needs and health outcomes of the West Texas and Border populations. The specific aims of the Texas Tech Cultural Competence Curriculum are to: (1) to develop and implement a patient-centered community-based Cultural Competence Curriculum; (2) to improve the cultural competence of faculty, practicing physicians, and allied disciplines in West Texas through a new Cultural Competence Faculty Development and Continuing Medical Education Program; and (3) to disseminate curricular activities, project evaluation reports, and scholarship on the impact of the Cultural Competence Curriculum to West Texans, the NHBLI Coordinating Centers, and the national medical education community through a Cultural Competence Education Network and website, two symposia on Measuring Cultural Competence in Medical Education, and Project publications. An interdisciplinary Health   Disparities Project Team will develop curricular activities targeting cardiovascular, pulmonary, hematological, and sleep disorders with known health disparities in our region-hypertension, asthma, sickle cell anemia, and obesity/sleep disorders. A Health Disparities Advisory Board will help anchor this curriculum to new knowledge about health disparities from the ultimate arbiters of culturally competent care, the patients and the community. This Curriculum will be embedded in the first new undergraduate program at the TTUHSCSOM in 30 years. The Curriculum features a variety of learning exercises in all 4 years, such as taking patient life histories in the community, learning medical Spanish, serving as patient navigators, and analyzing cases of cultural mismatch or health inequities. An intensive Project evaluation program is planned.

"The Program for Rural and Minority Health Disparities Research    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Despite considerable progress over the past 30 years in improving the health of the U.S. population, there continue to be substantial disparities in health status among many minority and underserved populations. Previous research has examined the impact of setting on health disparities or the impact of race/ethnicity on health disparities; the proposed program capitalizes on the complementary research expertise of two nationally recognized research centers to look at the interaction of setting and population factors. This Program for Rural and Minority Health Disparities Research will address rural and minority health issues by: (i) providing critical information on how population and setting characteristics (contextual factors) impact food choice, dietary patterns, and the risk of obesity in minority and rural populations, including children; (2) developing interventions to reduce the risk of obesity, particularly among rural, minority, and underserved individuals; (3) testing the differential effectiveness of diabetes self-management models in rural, urban and minority populations; (4) strengthening the ability of Texas A&M University, the Texas A&M Health Science Center, and the Texas A&M System to support disparities research and the recruitment and training of faculty committed to disparities research; and (5) developing a health disparities institute at the system level that will serve the 9 universities and 6 state agencies of the Texas A&M System. The system-level health disparities institute will strengthen collaboration among disparities researchers at multiple campuses, support training of faculty and students in disparities issues, and support the recruitment and training of students and new faculty in health disparities. Jointly sponsored by the Texas A&M University Center for the Study of Health Disparities and the Texas A&M Health Science Center School of Rural Public Health Center for Community Health Development, this Program will support 3 core research projects around the Program focus of obesity prevention and chronic disease self-management; the development of a network of disparities researchers; and the training of students-graduate and undergraduate-and faculty in disparities issues and research methods. The Program will also facilitate continued outreach and collaboration with multiple community partners in the Brazos Valley and surrounding counties to reduce health disparities; and strengthened collaboration among Faculty of Texas A&M University and the Health Science Center in addressing health disparities.           ",The Program for Rural and Minority Health Disparities Research,7640702,P20MD002295,[''],NIMHD,TEXAS A&M UNIVERSITY,P20,2009,2297196,0.18621352837639088
"Texas Center for Birth Defects Research and Prevention    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The CDC funded Texas Center for Birth Defects Research and Prevention is just completing its 12th year of operation. The Center is seeking another five years of continued funding. Texas has been and will continue to be well positioned as one of the National Centers for Birth Defects Research and Prevention, due to its vast geography and population, varied industries, and racial/ethnic diversity. In addition, the Texas Birth Defects Registry, from which cases are drawn for the National Birth Defects Prevention Study (NBDPS), is one of the largest active birth defects surveillance systems in the world. Furthermore, the Texas Center has assembled an impressive group of consultants, scientists, and institutions to carry out our operations and research. For the next five years, the Texas Center proposes to accomplish the following in order to help discover   preventable causes of birth defects, the leading cause of infant mortality in the U.S: (1) perform mandated activities for the NBDPS; (2) conduct pilot studies to improve the NBDPS methodology; (3) expand the NBDPS clinical responsibilities of the Texas Center's clinician; (4) enhance NBDPS data collection and research capacity with additional personnel; (5) contribute to all NBDPS activities as needed; (6) complete approved NBDPS projects; (7) develop new and innovative research areas for the NBDPS; (8) conduct local studies that can be expanded to all sites; and (9) translate Center findings into prevention messages. In the first three years, Texas collaborators will complete at least 10 NBDPS projects, resulting in 15 or more manuscripts and focusing on environmental causes, racial/ethnic disparities, and other topics of high public health impact. In addition, the Texas Center will collaboratively develop a new NBDPS research agenda in each of four areas: etiologic complexity/risk factor heterogeneity; environmental risk factors; gene-environment interaction studies, and methodological issues surrounding gestational dating estimates. Finally, we propose to conduct four   innovative local studies. For the first year of funding, $1,000,000 is requested for the Texas Center.           CONTINUATION OF THE TEXAS CENTER FOR BIRTH DEFECTS  RESEARCH AND PREVENTION: RETURN ON INVESTMENT PROJECT NARRATIVE Birth defects are the leading cause of infant mortality in the United States, accounting for approximately 20 percent of infant deaths annually. Each year, almost 150,000 babies are born with a congenital malformation. Because of the morbidity and long-term disability associated with these conditions, birth defects are also the fifth-leading cause of years of potential life lost.

"Construction of a Biomedical Research Facility at the U*    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    The University of Texas at Brownsville and Texas Southmost College (UTB/TSC) is a Hispanic- Serving Institution located at the southernmost tip of Texas, in one of the most economically underprivileged and rapidly growing regions in the nation. A primary objective of UTB/TSC is to advance and foster faculty development in biomedical research activities that address health disparities in this region's unique socio-economical setting. The gap between regional health needs and services provided in South Texas can be bridged through investigation of agents and causes of disease that afflict regional inhabitants. The development of biomedical research programs is the critical instrument that will contribute to this objective. UTB/TSC has made significant progress in the development of three program areas including infectious disease, neuroscience, and cancer. The recent success and momentum of UTB/TSC's biomedical research program was accomplished through 1) external collaborations, 2) recruitment of faculty and administrators, 3) acquisition of multimillion dollar extramural support, and 4) establishment of the first Hispanic Health Research Center in the nation. This progress indicates that UTB/TSC is positioned to become an important center for biomedical research activity in the near future. However, it will be virtually impossible to maintain this momentum if adequate research facilities are not available to house UTB/TSC biomedical researchers.

"Bridging the Gap: A Patient-Centered Curriculum for Cultural Competence    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       As in the nation, health disparities undercut the health and well-being of the multicultural populations of West Texas and the Texas-Mexico Border. Improving the cultural competence of health care providers is critical for spanning the fault lines of the health care divide: enthnicity and acculturation; socioeconomic status; health belief systems; language and intercultural communication; and provider skills, to name but a few. The Patient-Centered Cultural Competence Curriculum proposed by the Texas Tech Univeristy Health Sciences Center School of Medicine (TTUHSC-SOM) will develop and implement curricular activities and training programs to enhance the cultural competence of medical students, residents, faculty and community physicians, and health care professionals to better address the needs and health outcomes of the West Texas and Border populations. The specific aims of the Texas Tech Cultural Competence Curriculum are to: (1) to develop and implement a patient-centered community-based Cultural Competence Curriculum; (2) to improve the cultural competence of faculty, practicing physicians, and allied disciplines in West Texas through a new Cultural Competence Faculty Development and Continuing Medical Education Program; and (3) to disseminate curricular activities, project evaluation reports, and scholarship on the impact of the Cultural Competence Curriculum to West Texans, the NHBLI Coordinating Centers, and the national medical education community through a Cultural Competence Education Network and website, two symposia on Measuring Cultural Competence in Medical Education, and Project publications. An interdisciplinary Health   Disparities Project Team will develop curricular activities targeting cardiovascular, pulmonary, hematological, and sleep disorders with known health disparities in our region-hypertension, asthma, sickle cell anemia, and obesity/sleep disorders. A Health Disparities Advisory Board will help anchor this curriculum to new knowledge about health disparities from the ultimate arbiters of culturally competent care, the patients and the community. This Curriculum will be embedded in the first new undergraduate program at the TTUHSCSOM in 30 years. The Curriculum features a variety of learning exercises in all 4 years, such as taking patient life histories in the community, learning medical Spanish, serving as patient navigators, and analyzing cases of cultural mismatch or health inequities. An intensive Project evaluation program is planned.

"Hispanic Health Disparities Research Center DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The US-Mexico border region faces serious health challenges including increasing morbidity and rapidly growing health disparities. Therefore, the National Institutes of Health funded the Hispanic Health Disparities Research Center (HHDRC) as a partnership between the University of Texas at El Paso and the University of Texas Health Science Center Houston/School of Public Health. This Revision proposes the expansion of the scope of the existing HHDRC by integrating a new thematic Core focused on Environment. The long term goal is to better understand and address determinants of environmental health disparities for heterogeneous Mexican-origin and Hispanic populations through research, capacity building and outreach activities. The specific aims of the Environment Core, designed to help the HHDRC achieve its aims, are as follows: 1) Conduct research to evaluate complex interactions between social, built and natural environmental systems, while clarifying which aspects of Mexican-origin/Hispanic status are most important as determinants of environmental health disparities; 2) Build research and training capacities to examine and address environmental health disparities; and 3) Facilitate the translation of environmental health disparities research into policy, public health practice, and community-based engagement. The approach is innovative because two transdisciplinary research studies focus on understanding the role of Hispanic heterogeneity as it interacts with built/natural environmental conditions to shape health risks using complementary, but employ distinct methodologies (i.e., multilevel modeling and the case-crossover design). Within the HHDRC, the Environment Core is innovative since its thematic focus on the Environment crosscuts the research, training, and engagement activities of the other Cores. The proposed Revision is significant because the activities of the Core (e.g., transdisciplinary studies, student and faculty pilot research project, mentoring of student research assistants, curricular changes, and engagement with community constituents) will seek to advance knowledge in order to address disparities. Ultimately, such knowledge has the potential to inform interventions and policy to reduce health disparities among Hispanic populations. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This Revision is relevant to public health because of the serious environmental threats facing border communities disproportionately inhabited by people of Mexican-origin and those living in poverty. The explicit focus on Hispanic heterogeneity will change how researchers understand and seek to reduce health disparities, making the project relevant to the NIH's Mission to foster discovery that will protect health.",Hispanic Health Disparities Research Center,8318982,P20MD002287,"['Air ', ' Air Pollution ', ' Burns ', ' Burn injury ', ' Communities ', ' arid climate ', ' Desert Climate ', ' Environment ', ' Environmental Health Science ', ' Environmental Health ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' Faculty ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' healthcare service availability ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare access availability ', ' health services availability ', ' health care service availability ', ' health care service access ', ' health care availability ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Availability of Health Services ', ' Accessibility of health care ', ' Access to Healthcare ', ' Access to Health Care ', ' Access to Care ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Modern Man ', ' Man (Taxonomy) ', ' Human ', ' Laboratories ', ' Mentors ', ' Method LOINC Axis 6 ', ' Methodology ', ' Mexico ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Mission ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' pilot study ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' Poverty ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health Practice ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Residencies ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Public Health Schools ', ' Students ', ' Texas ', ' Training Programs ', ' Translations ', ' Universities ', ' visual function ', ' Sight ', ' Vision ', ' Water contamination ', ' Water Pollution ', ' Work ', ' Relative ', ' Relative (related person) ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Hispanics ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Link ', ' wasting ', ' Mexican ', ' Fostering ', ' Policies ', ' Cross-Over Designs ', ' Crossover Design ', ' Funding ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Shapes ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Complex ', ' Event ', ' Source ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' Location ', ' soil pollution ', ' trafficking ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' research study ', ' outreach ', ' social ', ' multilevel modeling ', ' multilevel model ', ' methods to study multiple-level influences ', ' multilevel analysis ', ' outreach program ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Address ', ' Health Sciences ', ' Research Training ', ' Resource Sharing ', ' Sum ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Minority ', ' Population ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' stem ', ' high risk ', ' ']",NIMHD,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS EL PASO,P20,2011,488966,0.060986186442599975
"CENTER FOR HEALTH DISPARITIES RESEARCH IN CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASES & HIV  African Americans share a disproportionate burden of the morbidity and mortality associated with conditions such as cardiovascular diseases, certain cancers, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), sexually transmitted infections (STIs), and others.

"The Program for Rural and Minority Health Disparities Research    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Despite considerable progress over the past 30 years in improving the health of the U.S. population, there continue to be substantial disparities in health status among many minority and underserved populations. Previous research has examined the impact of setting on health disparities or the impact of race/ethnicity on health disparities; the proposed program capitalizes on the complementary research expertise of two nationally recognized research centers to look at the interaction of setting and population factors. This Program for Rural and Minority Health Disparities Research will address rural and minority health issues by: (i) providing critical information on how population and setting characteristics (contextual factors) impact food choice, dietary patterns, and the risk of obesity in minority and rural populations, including children; (2) developing interventions to reduce the risk of obesity, particularly among rural, minority, and underserved individuals; (3) testing the differential effectiveness of diabetes self-management models in rural, urban and minority populations; (4) strengthening the ability of Texas A&M University, the Texas A&M Health Science Center, and the Texas A&M System to support disparities research and the recruitment and training of faculty committed to disparities research; and (5) developing a health disparities institute at the system level that will serve the 9 universities and 6 state agencies of the Texas A&M System. The system-level health disparities institute will strengthen collaboration among disparities researchers at multiple campuses, support training of faculty and students in disparities issues, and support the recruitment and training of students and new faculty in health disparities. Jointly sponsored by the Texas A&M University Center for the Study of Health Disparities and the Texas A&M Health Science Center School of Rural Public Health Center for Community Health Development, this Program will support 3 core research projects around the Program focus of obesity prevention and chronic disease self-management; the development of a network of disparities researchers; and the training of students-graduate and undergraduate-and faculty in disparities issues and research methods. The Program will also facilitate continued outreach and collaboration with multiple community partners in the Brazos Valley and surrounding counties to reduce health disparities; and strengthened collaboration among Faculty of Texas A&M University and the Health Science Center in addressing health disparities.           ",The Program for Rural and Minority Health Disparities Research,8078098,P20MD002295,[''],NIMHD,TEXAS A&M UNIVERSITY,P20,2011,1785958,0.18621352837639088
"MBRS RISE Program at the University of Texas at Brownsville    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The MBRS RISE program at the University of Texas at Brownsville will provide educational enrichment, research training and experiential opportunities for predominately Hispanic (93%) undergraduate students in preparation for entrance into Ph.D. programs in biomedical sciences. The MBRS-RISE Program at the University of Texas at Brownsville and Texas Southmost College (UTB/TSC) will continue to support the goals of Healthy People 2010 through planned research strategies and collaboration with the UT System Health Science Centers that specifically address the unique health disparities of this border region. The goals for this MBRS-RISE program are to increase the number of UTB/TSC students applying to and enrolling in Ph.D. programs in the biomedical sciences, to strengthen biomedical research capacity, and to strengthen institutional research infrastructure in biomedical sciences. Key objectives of this project are designed to enhance student awareness of careers in biomedical research; increase the number of students engaged in biomedical research training; strengthen student preparation for rigor of scientific disciplines; strengthen student preparation for admission to Ph.D. programs; promote collaborations with biomedical scientists from research-intensive institutions; provide UTB faculty with skills to effectively mentor students and promote students into biomedical and/or behavioral science research fields; schedule a program of biomedical research seminars; provide an annual research symposium; and facilitate institutional collaborations with research-intensive institutions.       It is anticipated that 18 students will participate in the MBRS-RISE program in year 01, with 16 students in each of years 02-04. It is planned that 50% of MBRS-RISE Scholars will graduate from the program and enter directly into Ph.D. programs in biomedical science.

"Texas Center for Minority Health, Education, Research and Outreach     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Despite the overall improvement in the health of Americans during the past two decades, significant disparities in health outcomes persist based on race and ethnicity, sex, level of education and income, and other social characteristics. There is a growing awareness in many segments of United States society that persistent health disparities are not acceptable, and that through, coordinated and targeted actions most health disparities are correctable. Created in 2005 with partial funding as an EXPORT Center, for the past six years the Texas Center for Health Disparities (TCHD) has been a leader in health disparities research, education, and outreach In its local community, throughout the State of Texas, and in many parts of the nation. Building on its significant experience and expansive relationships, the TCHD and its partner institutions propose the development of an NIMHD Center of Excellence (COE) with a focus on Women's Health Disparities. Consistent with the community-based participatory research (CBPR) focus of the TCHD, the focus on women's health was identified through substantial community dialogue with local and national partners. The proposed COE will focus on reducing health disparities by employing translational and CBPR approaches for identifying novel biomarkers for HIV-1 progression, developing detection and therapeutic strategies for triple negative breast cancer, and addressing weight loss and obesity. Our COE will augment and strengthen the existing infrastructure and capacity of the TCHD for conducting basic, clinical, translational, participatory, and socio-behavioral research. Our focus on Women's Health Disparities will address a significant need among racial and ethnic minority women in the U.S., the State of Texas, and our local community. We will also expand and develop new education and community outreach activities with our partner underrepresented minority (URM) institutions and community. The objectives of our COE are to: 1) Foster existing relationships and develop new relationships with URM institutions; 2) Conduct impactful research on Women's Health Disparities addressing HIV prevention, breast cancer, and obesity reduction; 3) Provide unique training and mentoring opportunities for URM students and faculty from URM institutions in health disparity research; 4. Educate health professions trainees, health care practitioners and policy makers on the existence and need to address persistent health disparities; and, 5) Serve as a reliable resource for minority communities by disseminating health information, promoting participation in health education and research, and implementing disease prevention activities.             RELEVANCE (See instructions):  The existence of health disparities in different racial, ethnic and socioeconomic groups in the United States is a significant public health concern.

"Texas Center for Minority Health, Education, Research and Outreach     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Despite the overall improvement in the health of Americans during the past two decades, significant disparities in health outcomes persist based on race and ethnicity, sex, level of education and income, and other social characteristics. There is a growing awareness in many segments of United States society that persistent health disparities are not acceptable, and that through, coordinated and targeted actions most health disparities are correctable. Created in 2005 with partial funding as an EXPORT Center, for the past six years the Texas Center for Health Disparities (TCHD) has been a leader in health disparities research, education, and outreach In its local community, throughout the State of Texas, and in many parts of the nation. Building on its significant experience and expansive relationships, the TCHD and its partner institutions propose the development of an NIMHD Center of Excellence (COE) with a focus on Women's Health Disparities. Consistent with the community-based participatory research (CBPR) focus of the TCHD, the focus on women's health was identified through substantial community dialogue with local and national partners. The proposed COE will focus on reducing health disparities by employing translational and CBPR approaches for identifying novel biomarkers for HIV-1 progression, developing detection and therapeutic strategies for triple negative breast cancer, and addressing weight loss and obesity. Our COE will augment and strengthen the existing infrastructure and capacity of the TCHD for conducting basic, clinical, translational, participatory, and socio-behavioral research. Our focus on Women's Health Disparities will address a significant need among racial and ethnic minority women in the U.S., the State of Texas, and our local community. We will also expand and develop new education and community outreach activities with our partner underrepresented minority (URM) institutions and community. The objectives of our COE are to: 1) Foster existing relationships and develop new relationships with URM institutions; 2) Conduct impactful research on Women's Health Disparities addressing HIV prevention, breast cancer, and obesity reduction; 3) Provide unique training and mentoring opportunities for URM students and faculty from URM institutions in health disparity research; 4. Educate health professions trainees, health care practitioners and policy makers on the existence and need to address persistent health disparities; and, 5) Serve as a reliable resource for minority communities by disseminating health information, promoting participation in health education and research, and implementing disease prevention activities.             RELEVANCE (See instructions):  The existence of health disparities in different racial, ethnic and socioeconomic groups in the United States is a significant public health concern.

"Center for Biomedical and Health Research Excellence (CBHRE)     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Texas Southern University is requesting support for the Center for Biomedical and Health Research Excellence (CBHRE) formerly known as the Institute for Biomedical and Health Disparities Research. The purpose of the CBHRE is to support the conduct of research on two diseases, cancer and cardiovascular, which are leading causes of death in Houston, the state of Texas and the nation. The RCMI program is being reinvented and reinvigorated. The goals of the program are to: 1) upgrade research infrastructure to enhance the university's biomedical research capacity and help promote a research rich environment; 2) enable investigators to become more successful in obtaining competitive extramural support for the conduct of biomedical research, particularly on diseases that disproportionately impact minority populations; and 3) foster vibrant environments conducive to professional development in biomedical sciences. Based on these goals, at the end of five years of RCMI support the CHBRE proposes multiple outcomes including substantial increases in publications citing NIH support; more proposal submissions; more grants awarded; increased number of investigators receiving ""mainstream"" extramural grant support; and increased number of professional development activities. The CBHRE will have an evaluation component that will be responsible for monitoring the progress of the CBHRE at regular intervals and making recommendations for improvement. The CBHRE will institute a Pilot Program project using a rigorous set of criteria and investigators supported by this program will undergo professional development activities that will help them gain independence within two years of completion of the CBHRE program. The CBHRE and agreed on college and university resources will be leveraged to form new and strengthen collaborations.         The CBHRE will be organized into the following activities and/or cores: Administrative Core, Collaborations and Partnerships, Pilot Project Program, Professional Development, Assessment and Evaluation, Environmental Toxicology Research Core, Molecular Biology Research Core and Pharmacology Research Core.

"Texas Center for Minority Health, Education, Research and Outreach     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Despite the overall improvement in the health of Americans during the past two decades, significant disparities in health outcomes persist based on race and ethnicity, sex, level of education and income, and other social characteristics. There is a growing awareness in many segments of United States society that persistent health disparities are not acceptable, and that through, coordinated and targeted actions most health disparities are correctable. Created in 2005 with partial funding as an EXPORT Center, for the past six years the Texas Center for Health Disparities (TCHD) has been a leader in health disparities research, education, and outreach In its local community, throughout the State of Texas, and in many parts of the nation. Building on its significant experience and expansive relationships, the TCHD and its partner institutions propose the development of an NIMHD Center of Excellence (COE) with a focus on Women's Health Disparities. Consistent with the community-based participatory research (CBPR) focus of the TCHD, the focus on women's health was identified through substantial community dialogue with local and national partners. The proposed COE will focus on reducing health disparities by employing translational and CBPR approaches for identifying novel biomarkers for HIV-1 progression, developing detection and therapeutic strategies for triple negative breast cancer, and addressing weight loss and obesity. Our COE will augment and strengthen the existing infrastructure and capacity of the TCHD for conducting basic, clinical, translational, participatory, and socio-behavioral research. Our focus on Women's Health Disparities will address a significant need among racial and ethnic minority women in the U.S., the State of Texas, and our local community. We will also expand and develop new education and community outreach activities with our partner underrepresented minority (URM) institutions and community. The objectives of our COE are to: 1) Foster existing relationships and develop new relationships with URM institutions; 2) Conduct impactful research on Women's Health Disparities addressing HIV prevention, breast cancer, and obesity reduction; 3) Provide unique training and mentoring opportunities for URM students and faculty from URM institutions in health disparity research; 4. Educate health professions trainees, health care practitioners and policy makers on the existence and need to address persistent health disparities; and, 5) Serve as a reliable resource for minority communities by disseminating health information, promoting participation in health education and research, and implementing disease prevention activities.             RELEVANCE (See instructions):  The existence of health disparities in different racial, ethnic and socioeconomic groups in the United States is a significant public health concern.

"Center for Biomedical and Health Research Excellence (CBHRE) DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Texas Southern University is requesting support for the Center for Biomedical and Health Research Excellence (CBHRE) formerly known as the Institute for Biomedical and Health Disparities Research. The purpose of the CBHRE is to support the conduct of research on two diseases, cancer and cardiovascular, which are leading causes of death in Houston, the state of Texas and the nation. The RCMI program is being reinvented and reinvigorated. The goals of the program are to: 1) upgrade research infrastructure to enhance the university's biomedical research capacity and help promote a research rich environment; 2) enable investigators to become more successful in obtaining competitive extramural support for the conduct of biomedical research, particularly on diseases that disproportionately impact minority populations; and 3) foster vibrant environments conducive to professional development in biomedical sciences. Based on these goals, at the end of five years of RCMI support the CHBRE proposes multiple outcomes including substantial increases in publications citing NIH support; more proposal submissions; more grants awarded; increased number of investigators receiving ""mainstream"" extramural grant support; and increased number of professional development activities. The CBHRE will have an evaluation component that will be responsible for monitoring the progress of the CBHRE at regular intervals and making recommendations for improvement. The CBHRE will institute a Pilot Program project using a rigorous set of criteria and investigators supported by this program will undergo professional development activities that will help them gain independence within two years of completion of the CBHRE program. The CBHRE and agreed on college and university resources will be leveraged to form new and strengthen collaborations.         The CBHRE will be organized into the following activities and/or cores: Administrative Core, Collaborations and Partnerships, Pilot Project Program, Professional Development, Assessment and Evaluation, Environmental Toxicology Research Core, Molecular Biology Research Core and Pharmacology Research Core. Each activity and/or core is designed to support the purpose, goals and objectives of the CBHRE. The core research laboratories will be organized in a manner that will allow investigators access to the state-of-the-art facilities, instrumentatio and service oriented scientific expertise. Multiple investigators will come together to conduct research on cancer and cardiovascular diseases based on discovering common biological, biochemical, genomic, lipidomic, and/or proteomic malfunctions to help understand the mechanistic and clinical relevance of the disease processes. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The focus of the research supported by the CBHRE will be cancer and cardiovascular diseases that disproportionately affect minority populations and lead to burdensome morbidity and mortality among this community. Collectively, cardiovascular disease (including stroke), cancer, and diabetes account for approximately two-thirds of all deaths in the U.S. and about $700 billion in direct and indirect economic costs each year.

"Promoting Diversity in Research Training for Health Professionals ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The racial and ethnic minority population in Texas surpassed the Anglo population in 2004, and is projected to increase substantially in the coming years. Projections for educational attainment for minorities, historically low because of socioeconomic and other factors, suggest continued disparity for college, graduate and professional school enrollment. Admission of minority students into doctoral study in the biomedical sciences in Texas, and indeed in the nation, remains low despite population changes in Texas, the second most populous in the country. Thus, there is a critical need to train a large number of health professionals to serve minority populations, not only in Texas but also at the national level. To address this critical need, we propose the ""Promoting Diversity in Research Training for Health Professionals (PDRT)"" program. University of North Texas Health Science Center (UNTHSC) is a leader among the health science centers in Texas in training minority biomedical scientists. We have developed an integrated plan to increase the number of minorities in biomedical research, incorporating education at the K-12, undergraduate, graduate and post-doctoral levels. The overall goal of PRDT is to provide underrepresented minority individuals, who are enrolled in a health professional program, a challenging and focused research experience in health disparities related to cardiovascular, pulmonary, hematologic and sleep disorders.. The specific aims of the PRDT are: Aim 1. Generate a pool of applicants from the health professional programs at UNTHSC (Osteopathy, Pharmacy, Public Health and Physician Assistants) as well as regional health professional programs (UT-Southwestern Medical Center, Texas A&M College of Medicine, Texas Women's University), and recruit 15 participants each year for the PDRT program. Aim 2. Provide a 10-week research program that combines research in cardiovascular, pulmonary, hematologic and sleep disorders, with a special emphasis on health disparities. Aim 3. Provide workshops in responsible conduct of research, experimental design, interprofessional education and health disparities. These aims will be accomplished by the following activities: (1) Recruitment, (2) Research Training and Education, (3) Training Scholar to improve their skills to succeed, (4) Evaluation and (5) Tracking. Our expectation is that continued focus on the aims in meeting our objective will directly impact eventual achievement of our goal of obtaining a diverse population comprised of underrepresented populations in health disparity research related to cardiovascular diseases. (End of Abstract)             Project Narrative There are three overarching goals of this project: 1) Identify PDRT Scholars with high potential for success. 2) Prepare the PDRT scholars for a career in research by providing a meaningful research and didactic exposure and 3) Support their success in their health professional programs and increase the number of underrepresented minority students and students from disadvantaged backgrounds and disabilities who will pursue health professional and biomedical research.",Promoting Diversity in Research Training for Health Professionals,9146508,R25HL125447,"['abstracting ', ' Academic Training ', ' Achievement Attainment ', ' Achievement ', ' Biomedical Research ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' circulatory system ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Cardio-vascular ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' Censuses ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Professional Education ', ' Engineering ', ' Experimental Designs ', ' Goals ', ' health science profession ', ' Health Professions ', ' Health Occupations ', ' Household ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Income ', ' Leadership ', ' Learning ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Light ', ' pulmonary ', ' Lung Respiratory System ', ' Lung ', ' Math ', ' Mathematics ', ' Medicine ', ' Persons ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' Osteopathy ', ' Osteopathic Medicine ', ' Pharmacies ', ' Pharmacy facility ', "" Physicians' Extenders "", "" Doctor's Assistants "", ' Physician Assistants ', ' Public Health ', ' recruit ', ' active recruitment ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' Research ', ' R&D ', ' R & D ', ' Development and Research ', ' research and development ', ' School Enrollments ', ' school of medicine ', ' medical college ', ' medical schools ', ' Science ', ' Sleep ', ' Students ', ' Technology ', ' Texas ', ' Training Programs ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' Woman ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Hispanics ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Latino ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' population diversity ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' diverse populations ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Medical ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' disability ', ' Individual ', ' Workshop ', ' Educational workshop ', ' Research Activity ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' programs ', ' Investigation ', ' Country ', ' Best Practice Analysis ', ' Benchmarking ', ' meetings ', ' post-doctoral ', ' post-doc ', ' Research Associate ', ' Postdoc ', ' Postdoctoral Fellow ', ' collegiate ', ' college ', ' Medical center ', ' Training and Education ', ' educationally disadvantaged ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' biomedical scientist ', ' skills ', ' expectation ', ' Participant ', ' underclass ', ' economically disadvantaged ', ' economic disadvantage ', ' Economically Deprived ', ' Economically Deprived Population ', ' Admission ', ' Admission activity ', ' sleep problem ', ' Sleep Disorders ', ' Physiotherapy ', ' Physical Therapeutics ', ' Physical Medicine Procedure ', ' Physiatric Procedure ', ' Physical therapy ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Institution ', ' Address ', ' Health Sciences ', ' International ', ' Research Training ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' underrepresentation of minorities ', ' under-represented minority ', ' under-representation of minorities ', ' Underrepresented Ethnic Minority ', ' Underrepresented Minority ', ' trend ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socio-economically ', ' socio-economic ', ' socioeconomics ', ' Healthcare professional ', ' Health Care Professional ', ' Health Professional ', ' NHLBI ', ' National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute ', ' Minority ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' responsible research conduct ', ' underrepresented minority student ', ' under-represented minority student ', ' URM student ', ' Underrepresented Students ', ' under-represented student ', ' Underrepresented Populations ', ' disadvantaged student ', ' minority student ', ' racial minority ', ' disparity reduction ', ' reduce disparity ', ' Health Care Research ', ' healthcare research ', ' ']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH TEXAS HLTH SCI CTR,R25,2016,206280,0.15494886656869122

"MBRS RISE Program at The University of Texas at Brownsville DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The MBRS RISE Program at University of Texas at Brownsville (UTB) will provide biomedical and behavioral research training opportunities for underrepresented (UR) minority students. The mission of the UTB, ""seeks to help students at all levels develop critical thinking skills, quantitative analysis and effective communication, which will sustain lifelong learning."" The MBRS RISE Program, supporting that mission, will expand and continue a program of research-related education and training for the predominately Hispanic students (93%) at UTB. The program will enhance awareness of biomedical research as a professional career. The MBRS RISE proposed program will support the goals of Healthy People 2020 through planned research strategies and collaboration with the University of Texas School of Public Health-Brownsville (UTSPH-B) that specifically studies the unique health disparities of this border region by providing student and faculty training and centralizing relevant research in the area. The RISE program will also actively engage students in biomedical research while simultaneously providing faculty mentorship training for professional growth. The expansion and emphasis on research at UTB has resulted in increased institutional and community interest and support, evidenced by the 2004 bond election where voters approved construction of a biomedical research and outreach facility. The facility will open in fal 2011. This proposal will enhance the current program by expanding educational experiences and collaborations, and through strengthening instruction in responsible conduct in research and ethics. This renewal proposal consists of the following:  Goal 1: Increase the number of UTB minority students applying to and enrolling in PhD programs in the biomedical sciences (BMS), with the objectives to increase applicants from STEM and Behavioral Sciences disciplines; achieve 100% participation in research; increase exposure to a research environment; graduate 50% of the students to enter doctoral programs; and increase retention in the program.  Goal 2: Strengthen Biomedical Research Infrastructure, with the objectives to increase participation in research related events; and increase collaborations among institutions.  Goal 3: Advance Scientific Integrity and Ethical Principles in Research through the objective to increase awareness in scientific integrity and ethical principles in research.  UTB has provided a structured program for UR student participation in the MBRS RISE program since 2002. The design and rationale for the proposed project builds upon knowledge gained through the successes and weaknesses of those prior years, with the intent to provide a rigorous, relevant and effective program that prepares students for doctoral biomedical research studies. Research has shown that people from underrepresented racial and ethnic groups are more likely to work in underserved communities, are more successful in recruiting minority patients to participate in clinical research, and often bring a nw perspective to a research question or problem. The overall goal of the Research Initiative for Scientific Enhancement (RISE) program at the University of Texas at Brownsville (UTB) is to increase the number of students from underrepresented racial and ethnic groups entering and completing a Ph.D. in biomedical or behavioral sciences. By enriching education and research opportunities for minority students, students can integrate new knowledge with a wealth of cultural and social experiences that will impact novel approaches to health disparities among the poor and underserved.

"Evaluating utility and improving implementation of genomic sequencing for pediatric cancer patients in the diverse population and healthcare settings of Texas: The KidsCanSeq Study Through this Clinical Sequencing Evidence-Generating Research (CSER2) with Enhanced Diversity project we will complete a trial (The Texas KidsCanSeq Study) comparing the results of targeted cancer panel sequencing versus genome-scale testing in pediatric cancer patients across diverse clinical settings. We will compare the targeted cancer panel to germline whole exome sequencing (WES) of unselected childhood cancer patients (n=1100) and WES, transcriptome sequencing and copy number array of FFPE tumor samples for the subset of patients with high-risk tumors (n=360). We will build on our success completing the CSER program BASIC3 exome sequencing trial (which included 60% Hispanic and African-American patients from a single large academic center) in this large multi-institutional study of an even more diverse patient population from five heterogeneous healthcare settings across Texas. The trial will be led by an experienced multi-PI team of Drs. Plon (medical geneticist), Parsons (pediatric oncologist) and McGuire (ethicist and health policy expert). We will assess clinical utility of these tests by measuring the frequency of diagnostic and/or actionable germline and tumor findings and the effect on treatment decisions (Aim 1). We will compare uptake by first degree relatives for familial genetic testing and recommended cancer surveillance by race, ethnicity and clinical settings (Aim 2). We will describe perceived utility (clinical, psychological, and pragmatic) by surveying and interviewing parents and participating pediatric oncologists (n=40) (Aim 3). Working with our pediatric cancer stakeholders, including advocates, BASIC3 study parents, and national organizations, we will create and evaluate the use of culturally sensitive educational materials, including videos in English and Spanish, improved integrated genomic test reports and counseling materials, and will compare in-person versus telemedicine exome results disclosure (Aim 4). Finally, we will provide data to guide future application of clinical genomics through three innovative pilot projects focused on health economics, decision support for cancer surveillance and whole genome sequencing (Aim 5). Baylor College of Medicine, Texas Children’s Hospital, and our partner institutions across the state are ideally suited to conduct this study and play leadership roles in CSER2 consortium activities based on our longstanding pediatric oncology and cancer genetics expertise, extensive experience in CLIA-certified clinical germline and cancer genomic diagnostic testing, and a track record of scholarship in ethical and social implications of genomics and health disparities research. This study is designed to determine the relative clinical, pragmatic and psychological utility of more focused panel testing versus genome-scale testing including exome and RNA sequencing of both blood and tumor samples with regard to improving the care of childhood cancer patients and their at-risk family members.

"Texas Minority Health, Education, Research and Outreach (Texas MiHERO) Project Summary The long term objective of the Texas Minority Health, Education, Research and Outreach (Texas MiHERO) is to expand the capacity of University of North Texas Health Science Center (UNTHSC) to enhance research and research training in minority health and health disparities by increasing the number of under-represented students in health disparity research, providing interdisciplinary research and leadership training to junior faculty, and increasing the number of health professional faculty involved in health disparity research. Given the substantial need for physicians, physician scientists, and other health professionals to care for vulnerable populations, and the critical need to study diseases and conditions that disproportionately affect these groups, more efforts are needed to increase the participation of individuals from diverse backgrounds in conducting research on minority health and health disparities, and encouraging them to consider careers in research and related fields. The Texas Center for Health Disparities (TCHD), a Center of Excellence funded by a P20 grant award from NIMHD will develop the MiHERO program to increase health disparity research capacity by increasing the size of the PhD workforce in health disparities, train junior faculty in interdisciplinary research leadership, and provide opportunities for senior investigators to develop research focus in minority health and health disparities. Three priority activities will be conducted under the MiHERO program:   Priority Activity 1: Develop an Interdisciplinary Research Leadership (IRL) Program for junior faculty in  Minority Health and Health Disparities  Priority Activity 2: Establish a Health Education, Awareness and Research in Disparities Scholarship  (HEARD Scholars) program for recruitment/retention of diverse faculty in Minority Health and Health Disparities.  Priority Activity 3: Increase the diversity of the biomedical, behavioral and clinical research workforce  by recruiting a new cohort of PhD students from minority and underrepresented groups each year who  focus on health disparities. Using the endowment funds secured through this mechanism of funding, we will ensure the creation of robust training opportunities that encourage participants of the proposed program to seek careers in research and related field that address the issue of health disparities. The impact of the endowment income will be establishment of a sustainable program in Minority Health and Health Disparities, including health disparity curricula for graduate students, a junior faculty development program that can be expanded to faculty from other institutions, and a cadre of health disparity researchers who have active research projects in the area of Minority Health and Health Disparities. Project Narrative The goal of the Texas MiHERO program is to utilize NIMHD S21 Endowment funding to build capacity and infrastructure at the UNTHSC for its nationally recognized health disparities research, training and outreach activities, specifically in recruiting and training more minority faculty and PhD students. Through an innovative interdisciplinary research leaders program, a faculty scholarship program and training PhD students in minority health and health disparities, MiHERO will enable transdisciplinary, interprofessional collaborations and novel approaches to understanding minority health and eliminate health disparities.","Texas Minority Health, Education, Research and Outreach

"Promoting Diversity in Research Training for Health Professionals ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The racial and ethnic minority population in Texas surpassed the Anglo population in 2004, and is projected to increase substantially in the coming years. Projections for educational attainment for minorities, historically low because of socioeconomic and other factors, suggest continued disparity for college, graduate and professional school enrollment. Admission of minority students into doctoral study in the biomedical sciences in Texas, and indeed in the nation, remains low despite population changes in Texas, the second most populous in the country. Thus, there is a critical need to train a large number of health professionals to serve minority populations, not only in Texas but also at the national level. To address this critical need, we propose the ""Promoting Diversity in Research Training for Health Professionals (PDRT)"" program. University of North Texas Health Science Center (UNTHSC) is a leader among the health science centers in Texas in training minority biomedical scientists. We have developed an integrated plan to increase the number of minorities in biomedical research, incorporating education at the K-12, undergraduate, graduate and post-doctoral levels. The overall goal of PRDT is to provide underrepresented minority individuals, who are enrolled in a health professional program, a challenging and focused research experience in health disparities related to cardiovascular, pulmonary, hematologic and sleep disorders.. The specific aims of the PRDT are: Aim 1. Generate a pool of applicants from the health professional programs at UNTHSC (Osteopathy, Pharmacy, Public Health and Physician Assistants) as well as regional health professional programs (UT-Southwestern Medical Center, Texas A&M College of Medicine, Texas Women's University), and recruit 15 participants each year for the PDRT program. Aim 2. Provide a 10-week research program that combines research in cardiovascular, pulmonary, hematologic and sleep disorders, with a special emphasis on health disparities. Aim 3. Provide workshops in responsible conduct of research, experimental design, interprofessional education and health disparities. These aims will be accomplished by the following activities: (1) Recruitment, (2) Research Training and Education, (3) Training Scholar to improve their skills to succeed, (4) Evaluation and (5) Tracking. Our expectation is that continued focus on the aims in meeting our objective will directly impact eventual achievement of our goal of obtaining a diverse population comprised of underrepresented populations in health disparity research related to cardiovascular diseases. (End of Abstract) Project Narrative There are three overarching goals of this project: 1) Identify PDRT Scholars with high potential for success. 2) Prepare the PDRT scholars for a career in research by providing a meaningful research and didactic exposure and 3) Support their success in their health professional programs and increase the number of underrepresented minority students and students from disadvantaged backgrounds and disabilities who will pursue health professional and biomedical research.",Promoting Diversity in Research Training for Health Professionals,9274093,R25HL125447,"['Academic Training ', ' Achievement Attainment ', ' Achievement ', ' Biomedical Research ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' circulatory system ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Cardio-vascular ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' Censuses ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Professional Education ', ' Engineering ', ' Experimental Designs ', ' Goals ', ' health science profession ', ' Health Professions ', ' Health Occupations ', ' blood disorder ', ' Hematological Disorder ', ' Hematologic Diseases ', ' Blood Diseases ', ' Hematological Disease ', ' Household ', ' Income ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Leadership ', ' Learning ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Lung ', ' pulmonary ', ' Lung Respiratory System ', ' Lung diseases ', ' lung disorder ', ' Respiratory System Disorder ', ' Respiratory System Disease ', ' Respiratory Disease ', ' Pulmonary Disorder ', ' Pulmonary Diseases ', ' Mathematics ', ' Math ', ' Medicine ', ' Persons ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' Osteopathic Medicine ', ' Osteopathy ', ' Pharmacy facility ', ' Pharmacies ', ' Physician Assistants ', "" Physicians' Extenders "", "" Doctor's Assistants "", ' Public Health ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' recruit ', ' active recruitment ', ' Research ', ' research and development ', ' R&D ', ' R & D ', ' Development and Research ', ' School Enrollments ', ' medical schools ', ' school of medicine ', ' medical college ', ' Science ', ' Sleep ', ' Students ', ' Technology ', ' Texas ', ' Training Programs ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' Woman ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Hispanics ', ' Latino ', ' population diversity ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' diverse populations ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Medical ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' disability ', ' Individual ', ' Workshop ', ' Educational workshop ', ' Research Activity ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' programs ', ' Investigation ', ' Country ', ' Benchmarking ', ' Best Practice Analysis ', ' meetings ', ' Postdoctoral Fellow ', ' post-doctoral ', ' post-doc ', ' Research Associate ', ' Postdoc ', ' college ', ' collegiate ', ' Medical center ', ' Training and Education ', ' Education and Training ', ' educationally disadvantaged ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' biomedical scientist ', ' skills ', ' expectation ', ' Participant ', ' Economically Deprived Population ', ' underclass ', ' economically disadvantaged ', ' economic disadvantage ', ' Economically Deprived ', ' Admission activity ', ' Admission ', ' Sleep Disorders ', ' sleep problem ', ' Physical therapy ', ' Physiotherapy ', ' Physical Therapeutics ', ' Physical Medicine Procedure ', ' Physiatric Procedure ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Institution ', ' Address ', ' Health Sciences ', ' International ', ' Research Training ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' underrepresentation of minorities ', ' under-represented minority ', ' under-representation of minorities ', ' Underrepresented Ethnic Minority ', ' Underrepresented Minority ', ' trend ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socio-economically ', ' socio-economic ', ' socioeconomics ', ' Healthcare professional ', ' Health Care Professional ', ' Health Professional ', ' NHLBI ', ' National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute ', ' Minority ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' responsible research conduct ', ' undergraduate student ', ' undergraduate ', ' underrepresented minority student ', ' under-represented minority student ', ' URM student ', ' Underrepresented Students ', ' under-represented student ', ' Underrepresented Populations ', ' disadvantaged student ', ' minority student ', ' racial minority ', ' disparity reduction ', ' reduce disparity ', ' Health Care Research ', ' healthcare research ', ' ']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH TEXAS HLTH SCI CTR,R25,2017,206280,0.15494886656869122
"Center for Biomedical and Health Research Excellence (CBHRE) DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Texas Southern University is requesting support for the Center for Biomedical and Health Research Excellence (CBHRE) formerly known as the Institute for Biomedical and Health Disparities Research. The purpose of the CBHRE is to support the conduct of research on two diseases, cancer and cardiovascular, which are leading causes of death in Houston, the state of Texas and the nation. The RCMI program is being reinvented and reinvigorated. The goals of the program are to: 1) upgrade research infrastructure to enhance the university's biomedical research capacity and help promote a research rich environment; 2) enable investigators to become more successful in obtaining competitive extramural support for the conduct of biomedical research, particularly on diseases that disproportionately impact minority populations; and 3) foster vibrant environments conducive to professional development in biomedical sciences. Based on these goals, at the end of five years of RCMI support the CHBRE proposes multiple outcomes including substantial increases in publications citing NIH support; more proposal submissions; more grants awarded; increased number of investigators receiving ""mainstream"" extramural grant support; and increased number of professional development activities. The CBHRE will have an evaluation component that will be responsible for monitoring the progress of the CBHRE at regular intervals and making recommendations for improvement. The CBHRE will institute a Pilot Program project using a rigorous set of criteria and investigators supported by this program will undergo professional development activities that will help them gain independence within two years of completion of the CBHRE program. The CBHRE and agreed on college and university resources will be leveraged to form new and strengthen collaborations.         The CBHRE will be organized into the following activities and/or cores: Administrative Core, Collaborations and Partnerships, Pilot Project Program, Professional Development, Assessment and Evaluation, Environmental Toxicology Research Core, Molecular Biology Research Core and Pharmacology Research Core. Each activity and/or core is designed to support the purpose, goals and objectives of the CBHRE. The core research laboratories will be organized in a manner that will allow investigators access to the state-of-the-art facilities, instrumentatio and service oriented scientific expertise. Multiple investigators will come together to conduct research on cancer and cardiovascular diseases based on discovering common biological, biochemical, genomic, lipidomic, and/or proteomic malfunctions to help understand the mechanistic and clinical relevance of the disease processes. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The focus of the research supported by the CBHRE will be cancer and cardiovascular diseases that disproportionately affect minority populations and lead to burdensome morbidity and mortality among this community. Collectively, cardiovascular disease (including stroke), cancer, and diabetes account for approximately two-thirds of all deaths in the U.S. and about $700 billion in direct and indirect economic costs each year. The CBHRE proposes to approach the study of these diseases by marshaling all of its former, current and future biomedical research resources to launch a three-pronged approach to discovering new mechanistic information about the underlying causes of these diseases and identifying prospective remedies.",Center for Biomedical and Health Research Excellence (CBHRE),9486914,G12MD007605,"['Collaborations ', ' programs ', ' Marshal ', ' college ', ' collegiate ', ' Services ', ' economic cost ', ' Proteomics ', ' Genomics ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Extramural ', ' EXTMR ', ' Extramural Activities ', ' Monitor ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' prospective ', ' clinically relevant ', ' clinical relevance ', ' public health relevance ', ' University resources ', ' Affect ', ' Award ', ' Biomedical Research ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' circulatory system ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Cardio-vascular ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Communities ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' diabetes ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Environment ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' Institutes ', ' Laboratory Research ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Mainstreaming ', ' achievement Mainstream Education ', ' Educational Mainstreaming ', ' Molecular Biology ', ' DNA Molecular Biology ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' Pharmacology ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Publications ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Support ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Science ', ' stroke ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' brain attack ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Apoplexy ', ' Texas ', ' Universities ', ' base ', ' ecological toxicology ', ' environmental toxicology ', ' Biological ', ' Biochemical ', ' Evaluation ', ' Fostering ', ' ']",NIMHD,TEXAS SOUTHERN UNIVERSITY,G12,2017,1858548,0.08956020508873799

"Evaluating utility and improving implementation of genomic sequencing for pediatric cancer patients in the diverse population and healthcare settings of Texas: The KidsCanSeq Study Through this Clinical Sequencing Evidence-Generating Research (CSER2) with Enhanced Diversity project we will complete a trial (The Texas KidsCanSeq Study) comparing the results of targeted cancer panel sequencing versus genome-scale testing in pediatric cancer patients across diverse clinical settings. We will compare the targeted cancer panel to germline whole exome sequencing (WES) of unselected childhood cancer patients (n=1100) and WES, transcriptome sequencing and copy number array of FFPE tumor samples for the subset of patients with high-risk tumors (n=360). We will build on our success completing the CSER program BASIC3 exome sequencing trial (which included 60% Hispanic and African-American patients from a single large academic center) in this large multi-institutional study of an even more diverse patient population from five heterogeneous healthcare settings across Texas. The trial will be led by an experienced multi-PI team of Drs. Plon (medical geneticist), Parsons (pediatric oncologist) and McGuire (ethicist and health policy expert). We will assess clinical utility of these tests by measuring the frequency of diagnostic and/or actionable germline and tumor findings and the effect on treatment decisions (Aim 1). We will compare uptake by first degree relatives for familial genetic testing and recommended cancer surveillance by race, ethnicity and clinical settings (Aim 2). We will describe perceived utility (clinical, psychological, and pragmatic) by surveying and interviewing parents and participating pediatric oncologists (n=40) (Aim 3). Working with our pediatric cancer stakeholders, including advocates, BASIC3 study parents, and national organizations, we will create and evaluate the use of culturally sensitive educational materials, including videos in English and Spanish, improved integrated genomic test reports and counseling materials, and will compare in-person versus telemedicine exome results disclosure (Aim 4). Finally, we will provide data to guide future application of clinical genomics through three innovative pilot projects focused on health economics, decision support for cancer surveillance and whole genome sequencing (Aim 5). Baylor College of Medicine, Texas Children’s Hospital, and our partner institutions across the state are ideally suited to conduct this study and play leadership roles in CSER2 consortium activities based on our longstanding pediatric oncology and cancer genetics expertise, extensive experience in CLIA-certified clinical germline and cancer genomic diagnostic testing, and a track record of scholarship in ethical and social implications of genomics and health disparities research. This study is designed to determine the relative clinical, pragmatic and psychological utility of more focused panel testing versus genome-scale testing including exome and RNA sequencing of both blood and tumor samples with regard to improving the care of childhood cancer patients and their at-risk family members. We will explore this innovative topology of utility for parents and physicians across the highly diverse patient populations and health care settings in Texas.",Evaluating utility and improving implementation of genomic sequencing for pediatric cancer patients in the diverse population and healthcare settings of Texas: The KidsCanSeq Study,9540074,U01HG006485,"['Age ', ' ages ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Communication ', ' Counseling ', ' Disclosure ', ' Information Disclosure ', ' Ethics ', ' ethical ', ' Feedback ', ' Freezing ', ' Future ', ' Health Policy ', ' healthcare policy ', ' health care policy ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' treatment access ', ' health services availability ', ' health service access ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' accessibility to health services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Access to Care ', ' Hispanic Americans ', ' Spanish Americans ', ' Pediatric Hospitals ', "" Children's Hospital "", ' Informed Consent ', ' Interview ', ' Language ', ' Leadership ', ' Lymphoma ', ' Reticulolymphosarcoma ', ' Malignant Lymphoma ', ' Germinoblastoma ', ' Germinoblastic Sarcoma ', ' Medicine ', ' Methods ', ' Persons ', ' Oncogenes ', ' Transforming Genes ', ' Cancer-Promoting Gene ', ' Cancer Genes ', ' Parents ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Play ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Scholarship ', ' Standardization ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Testing ', ' Texas ', ' Time ', ' Measures ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Diagnostic tests ', ' Ethicists ', ' Ethics Consultants ', ' Family member ', ' Hispanics ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' population diversity ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' diverse populations ', ' Caring ', ' Telemedicine ', ' base ', ' Blood Sample ', ' Blood specimen ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' psychological ', ' psychologic ', ' Evaluation ', ' healthcare utilization ', ' healthcare service utilization ', ' healthcare service use ', ' health care service use ', ' Health Care Utilization ', ' health care service utilization ', ' Gene Targeting ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' uptake ', ' Oncologist ', ' pediatric malignancy ', ' pediatric cancer ', ' children with cancer ', ' childhood malignancy ', ' child with cancer ', ' cancer in children ', ' cancer in a child ', ' Malignant childhood cancer ', ' Malignant Pediatric Tumor ', ' Malignant Pediatric Neoplasm ', ' Malignant Childhood Tumor ', ' Childhood Cancers ', ' Malignant Childhood Neoplasm ', ' Pediatric Oncologist ', ' Solid Tumor ', ' Solid Neoplasm ', ' Letters ', ' Diagnostic ', ' programs ', ' Frequencies ', ' Complex ', ' Visit ', ' college ', ' collegiate ', ' preference ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' cohort ', ' expectation ', ' Genetic screening method ', ' genetic testing ', ' gene-based testing ', ' gene testing ', ' novel ', ' cancer genetics ', ' Modality ', ' Reporting ', ' proband ', ' Sampling ', ' Genomics ', ' Neuraxis ', ' Central Nervous System ', ' CNS Nervous System ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Institution ', ' genome sequencing ', ' Address ', ' Advocate ', ' Consent ', ' Data ', ' Educational Materials ', ' Cancer Patient ', ' 1st degree relative ', ' First Degree Relative ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' Pediatric Oncology ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' oncogenomics ', ' cancer genomics ', ' cost ', ' health economics ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' willingness ', ' Population ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' clinical applicability ', ' clinical application ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' tumor ', ' high risk ', ' patient population ', ' genomewide ', ' genome scale ', ' genome-wide ', ' social implication ', ' exomes ', ' exome ', ' RNAseq ', ' RNA sequencing ', ' RNA Seq ', ' transcriptome sequencing ', ' exome-seq ', ' exome sequencing ', ' gene panel ', ' clinical sequencing ', ' Genomic medicine ', ' driver mutation ', ' actionable variants ', ' actionable mutation ', ' study population ', ' CLIA licensed ', ' CLIA compliant ', ' CLIA approved ', ' CLIA accredited ', ' CLIA certified ', ' full genome ', ' entire genome ', ' whole genome ', ' patient subtypes ', ' patient subpopulations ', ' patient subgroups ', ' patient subsets ', ' healthcare settings ', ' health care settings ', ' ']",NHGRI,BAYLOR COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,U01,2018,3453099,0.0848033380299188
"Texas Minority Health, Education, Research and Outreach (Texas MiHERO) Project Summary The long term objective of the Texas Minority Health, Education, Research and Outreach (Texas MiHERO) is to expand the capacity of University of North Texas Health Science Center (UNTHSC) to enhance research and research training in minority health and health disparities by increasing the number of under-represented students in health disparity research, providing interdisciplinary research and leadership training to junior faculty, and increasing the number of health professional faculty involved in health disparity research. Given the substantial need for physicians, physician scientists, and other health professionals to care for vulnerable populations, and the critical need to study diseases and conditions that disproportionately affect these groups, more efforts are needed to increase the participation of individuals from diverse backgrounds in conducting research on minority health and health disparities, and encouraging them to consider careers in research and related fields. The Texas Center for Health Disparities (TCHD), a Center of Excellence funded by a P20 grant award from NIMHD will develop the MiHERO program to increase health disparity research capacity by increasing the size of the PhD workforce in health disparities, train junior faculty in interdisciplinary research leadership, and provide opportunities for senior investigators to develop research focus in minority health and health disparities. Three priority activities will be conducted under the MiHERO program:   Priority Activity 1: Develop an Interdisciplinary Research Leadership (IRL) Program for junior faculty in  Minority Health and Health Disparities  Priority Activity 2: Establish a Health Education, Awareness and Research in Disparities Scholarship  (HEARD Scholars) program for recruitment/retention of diverse faculty in Minority Health and Health Disparities.  Priority Activity 3: Increase the diversity of the biomedical, behavioral and clinical research workforce  by recruiting a new cohort of PhD students from minority and underrepresented groups each year who  focus on health disparities. Using the endowment funds secured through this mechanism of funding, we will ensure the creation of robust training opportunities that encourage participants of the proposed program to seek careers in research and related field that address the issue of health disparities. The impact of the endowment income will be establishment of a sustainable program in Minority Health and Health Disparities, including health disparity curricula for graduate students, a junior faculty development program that can be expanded to faculty from other institutions, and a cadre of health disparity researchers who have active research projects in the area of Minority Health and Health Disparities. Project Narrative The goal of the Texas MiHERO program is to utilize NIMHD S21 Endowment funding to build capacity and infrastructure at the UNTHSC for its nationally recognized health disparities research, training and outreach activities, specifically in recruiting and training more minority faculty and PhD students.

"Promoting Diversity in Research Training for Health Professionals ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The racial and ethnic minority population in Texas surpassed the Anglo population in 2004, and is projected to increase substantially in the coming years. Projections for educational attainment for minorities, historically low because of socioeconomic and other factors, suggest continued disparity for college, graduate and professional school enrollment. Admission of minority students into doctoral study in the biomedical sciences in Texas, and indeed in the nation, remains low despite population changes in Texas, the second most populous in the country. Thus, there is a critical need to train a large number of health professionals to serve minority populations, not only in Texas but also at the national level. To address this critical need, we propose the ""Promoting Diversity in Research Training for Health Professionals (PDRT)"" program. University of North Texas Health Science Center (UNTHSC) is a leader among the health science centers in Texas in training minority biomedical scientists. We have developed an integrated plan to increase the number of minorities in biomedical research, incorporating education at the K-12, undergraduate, graduate and post-doctoral levels. The overall goal of PRDT is to provide underrepresented minority individuals, who are enrolled in a health professional program, a challenging and focused research experience in health disparities related to cardiovascular, pulmonary, hematologic and sleep disorders.. The specific aims of the PRDT are: Aim 1. Generate a pool of applicants from the health professional programs at UNTHSC (Osteopathy, Pharmacy, Public Health and Physician Assistants) as well as regional health professional programs (UT-Southwestern Medical Center, Texas A&M College of Medicine, Texas Women's University), and recruit 15 participants each year for the PDRT program. Aim 2. Provide a 10-week research program that combines research in cardiovascular, pulmonary, hematologic and sleep disorders, with a special emphasis on health disparities. Aim 3. Provide workshops in responsible conduct of research, experimental design, interprofessional education and health disparities. These aims will be accomplished by the following activities: (1) Recruitment, (2) Research Training and Education, (3) Training Scholar to improve their skills to succeed, (4) Evaluation and (5) Tracking. Our expectation is that continued focus on the aims in meeting our objective will directly impact eventual achievement of our goal of obtaining a diverse population comprised of underrepresented populations in health disparity research related to cardiovascular diseases. (End of Abstract) Project Narrative There are three overarching goals of this project: 1) Identify PDRT Scholars with high potential for success. 2) Prepare the PDRT scholars for a career in research by providing a meaningful research and didactic exposure and 3) Support their success in their health professional programs and increase the number of underrepresented minority students and students from disadvantaged backgrounds and disabilities who will pursue health professional and biomedical research.",Promoting Diversity in Research Training for Health Professionals,9478297,R25HL125447,"['Academic Training ', ' Achievement ', ' Achievement Attainment ', ' Biomedical Research ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' circulatory system ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Censuses ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Professional Education ', ' Engineering ', ' Experimental Designs ', ' Goals ', ' Health Occupations ', ' health science profession ', ' Health Professions ', ' Hematological Disease ', ' blood disorder ', ' Hematological Disorder ', ' Hematologic Diseases ', ' Blood Diseases ', ' Household ', ' Income ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Leadership ', ' Learning ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Lung ', ' pulmonary ', ' Lung Respiratory System ', ' Lung diseases ', ' lung disorder ', ' disorder of the lung ', ' disease of the lung ', ' Respiratory System Disorder ', ' Respiratory System Disease ', ' Respiratory Disease ', ' Pulmonary Disorder ', ' Pulmonary Diseases ', ' Mathematics ', ' Math ', ' Medicine ', ' Persons ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' Osteopathic Medicine ', ' Osteopathy ', ' Pharmacy facility ', ' Pharmacies ', ' Physician Assistants ', "" Physicians' Extenders "", "" Doctor's Assistants "", ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' research and development ', ' R&D ', ' R & D ', ' Development and Research ', ' School Enrollments ', ' medical schools ', ' school of medicine ', ' medical college ', ' Science ', ' Sleep ', ' Students ', ' Technology ', ' Texas ', ' Training Programs ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' Woman ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Hispanics ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Latino ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' population diversity ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' diverse populations ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Medical ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' disability ', ' Individual ', ' Workshop ', ' Educational workshop ', ' Research Activity ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' programs ', ' Investigation ', ' Country ', ' Benchmarking ', ' Best Practice Analysis ', ' meetings ', ' Postdoctoral Fellow ', ' post-doctoral ', ' post-doc ', ' Research Associate ', ' Postdoc ', ' college ', ' collegiate ', ' Medical center ', ' Training and Education ', ' Education and Training ', ' educationally disadvantaged ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' biomedical scientist ', ' skills ', ' expectation ', ' Participant ', ' Economically Deprived Population ', ' underclass ', ' economically disadvantaged ', ' economic disadvantage ', ' Economically Deprived ', ' Admission activity ', ' Admission ', ' Sleep Disorders ', ' sleep problem ', ' Physical therapy ', ' Physiotherapy ', ' Physical Therapeutics ', ' Physical Medicine Procedure ', ' Physiatric Procedure ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Institution ', ' Address ', ' Health Sciences ', ' International ', ' Research Training ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' underrepresentation of minorities ', ' under-represented minority ', ' under-representation of minorities ', ' Underrepresented Ethnic Minority ', ' Underrepresented Minority ', ' trend ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socio-economically ', ' socio-economic ', ' socioeconomics ', ' Healthcare professional ', ' Health Care Professional ', ' Health Professional ', ' NHLBI ', ' National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute ', ' Minority ', ' Population ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' ethnic minority ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' responsible research conduct ', ' undergraduate ', ' undergraduate student ', ' under-represented minority student ', ' URM student ', ' underrepresented minority student ', ' under-represented student ', ' Underrepresented Students ', ' Underrepresented Populations ', ' disadvantaged student ', ' minority student ', ' racial minority ', ' reduce disparity ', ' disparity reduction ', ' healthcare research ', ' Health Care Research ', ' recruit ', ' ']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH TEXAS HLTH SCI CTR,R25,2018,212760,0.15494886656869122
"Center for Biomedical and Health Research Excellence (CBHRE) DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Texas Southern University is requesting support for the Center for Biomedical and Health Research Excellence (CBHRE) formerly known as the Institute for Biomedical and Health Disparities Research. The purpose of the CBHRE is to support the conduct of research on two diseases, cancer and cardiovascular, which are leading causes of death in Houston, the state of Texas and the nation. The RCMI program is being reinvented and reinvigorated. The goals of the program are to: 1) upgrade research infrastructure to enhance the university's biomedical research capacity and help promote a research rich environment; 2) enable investigators to become more successful in obtaining competitive extramural support for the conduct of biomedical research, particularly on diseases that disproportionately impact minority populations; and 3) foster vibrant environments conducive to professional development in biomedical sciences. Based on these goals, at the end of five years of RCMI support the CHBRE proposes multiple outcomes including substantial increases in publications citing NIH support; more proposal submissions; more grants awarded; increased number of investigators receiving ""mainstream"" extramural grant support; and increased number of professional development activities. The CBHRE will have an evaluation component that will be responsible for monitoring the progress of the CBHRE at regular intervals and making recommendations for improvement. The CBHRE will institute a Pilot Program project using a rigorous set of criteria and investigators supported by this program will undergo professional development activities that will help them gain independence within two years of completion of the CBHRE program. The CBHRE and agreed on college and university resources will be leveraged to form new and strengthen collaborations.         The CBHRE will be organized into the following activities and/or cores: Administrative Core, Collaborations and Partnerships, Pilot Project Program, Professional Development, Assessment and Evaluation, Environmental Toxicology Research Core, Molecular Biology Research Core and Pharmacology Research Core. Each activity and/or core is designed to support the purpose, goals and objectives of the CBHRE. The core research laboratories will be organized in a manner that will allow investigators access to the state-of-the-art facilities, instrumentatio and service oriented scientific expertise. Multiple investigators will come together to conduct research on cancer and cardiovascular diseases based on discovering common biological, biochemical, genomic, lipidomic, and/or proteomic malfunctions to help understand the mechanistic and clinical relevance of the disease processes. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The focus of the research supported by the CBHRE will be cancer and cardiovascular diseases that disproportionately affect minority populations and lead to burdensome morbidity and mortality among this community. Collectively, cardiovascular disease (including stroke), cancer, and diabetes account for approximately two-thirds of all deaths in the U.S. and about $700 billion in direct and indirect economic costs each year. The CBHRE proposes to approach the study of these diseases by marshaling all of its former, current and future biomedical research resources to launch a three-pronged approach to discovering new mechanistic information about the underlying causes of these diseases and identifying prospective remedies.",Center for Biomedical and Health Research Excellence (CBHRE),9506578,G12MD007605,"['Affect ', ' Award ', ' Biomedical Research ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' circulatory system ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Communities ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Environment ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' Institutes ', ' Laboratory Research ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Mainstreaming ', ' achievement Mainstream Education ', ' Educational Mainstreaming ', ' Molecular Biology ', ' DNA Molecular Biology ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' Pharmacology ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Publications ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Support ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Science ', ' Stroke ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' brain attack ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Apoplexy ', ' Texas ', ' Universities ', ' base ', ' ecological toxicology ', ' environmental toxicology ', ' Biological ', ' Biochemical ', ' Evaluation ', ' Fostering ', ' Collaborations ', ' programs ', ' Marshal ', ' college ', ' collegiate ', ' Services ', ' economic cost ', ' Proteomics ', ' Genomics ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Extramural ', ' EXTMR ', ' Extramural Activities ', ' Monitor ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' prospective ', ' clinical relevance ', ' clinically relevant ', ' public health relevance ', ' University resources ', ' ']",NIMHD,TEXAS SOUTHERN UNIVERSITY,G12,2018,1443209,0.08956020508873799

"Genomics of HCC in the Hispanic population of Texas PROJECT SUMMARY The incidence and mortality rates of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is rapidly increasing in the United States, with the highest rates found among Hispanics in South Texas. We reported that the prevalence of cirrhosis, the main risk factor for HCC, in Hispanics in South Texas is 4-times higher than the national average and identified central obesity and diabetes as the main risk factors. The role of obesity and diabetes in liver cirrhosis in Hispanics in South Texas likely contributes to the high prevalence of HCC associated with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) in this population. The burden of NASH in this population is more substantial than predicted, affecting close to 20% of the population including children. To address the magnitude of this growing health-disparity problem, it is critically important to identify those at high risk for HCC who would benefit from surveillance and prevention strategies. HCC is a genetically heterogeneous disease and specific somatic mutations profiles are associated with different etiologies. Hispanic ethnicity and NASH etiology are critically underrepresented in HCC genomic studies. Therefore, there is a need for molecular characterization of NASH- associated HCC in Hispanics, to identify opportunities for biomarker and targeted therapy development. Because HCC somatic mutations have been detected in circulating cell free DNA (cfDNA) in patients with HCC but also in patients with pre-HCC conditions such as cirrhosis, one such opportunity is the detection in cfDNA, of selected somatic mutations for HCC risk assessment and early detection. We hypothesize that the tumor genomic landscape of HCC in Hispanics in South Texas is representative of the underlying liver diseases and environmental factors affecting this population and that selected HCC somatic mutations can be detected in plasma cfDNA at early HCC stage or prior to diagnosis and could therefore have utility in HCC risk assessment and early detection. In Aim 1, we will determine the tumor genomic landscape of NASH-associated HCC in Hispanics in South Texas and identify (if any) unique features of HCC in this population. In Aim 2, we will custom-design a targeted sequencing panel to detect with high sensitivity the most common HCC somatic mutations identified in Aim 1, in plasma cfDNA of patients with NASH-associated HCC. In Aim 3, we will determine the utility of the mutation-based model identified in Aim 2 and applied to cfDNA, in HCC risk prediction in Hispanics in South Texas using two large population-based Hispanic cohorts. This project is supported by extensive preliminary data, unique resources and a strong multidisciplinary research team. It will represent the largest genomic study of HCC associated with NASH, diabetes and obesity in an underserved population particularly affected by these chronic diseases. The project impact and translational goals are: 1) to serve the Hispanic population in South Texas, a population with health and healthcare disparities and high rates of diabetes, obesity, NASH and HCC; and 2) to develop new tests to identify, in this population, subjects at high risk for HCC and institute effective surveillance and prevention strategies, improving survival. There is an alarming increase in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) incidence in Hispanics, a trend that is affecting in particular Hispanic populations in South Texas. Public health and basic research efforts are urgently needed to understand the unique pattern of HCC in Hispanics in South Texas and reduce this disease burden. We will characterize the tumor genomic landscape of HCC in Hispanics in Texas and will identify the genomic alterations in circulating cell free DNA that best predict HCC development in Hispanic with cirrhosis.",Genomics of HCC in the Hispanic population of Texas,9507459,R01CA204665,"['Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Communities ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Fibrosis ', ' Genes ', ' Geography ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Primary carcinoma of the liver cells ', ' liver carcinoma ', ' Liver Cells Carcinoma ', ' Hepatoma ', ' Hepatocellular cancer ', ' Hepatocellular Carcinoma ', ' Hepatocarcinoma ', ' Incidence ', ' Institutes ', ' Liver Cirrhosis ', ' Hepatic Cirrhosis ', ' Liver diseases ', ' liver disorder ', ' hepatopathy ', ' hepatic disease ', ' Hepatic Disorder ', ' Mexican Americans ', ' Chicanos ', ' Chicanas ', ' mortality ', ' Mutation ', ' genome mutation ', ' Genetic defect ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Obesity ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Patients ', ' Plasma Cells ', ' plasmocyte ', ' Plasmacytes ', ' Blood Plasma Cell ', ' outcome forecast ', ' Prognosis ', ' Public Health ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Texas ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' County ', ' Hispanics ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Risk Assessment ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Custom ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Multidisciplinary Research ', ' Multidisciplinary Collaboration ', ' Interdisciplinary Research ', ' Interdisciplinary Study ', ' Disease Progression ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Central obesity ', ' waist-predominant obesity ', ' visceral obesity ', ' trunk obesity ', ' male-type obesity ', ' excess adiposity in midsection ', ' Truncal obesity ', ' Obesity of face and trunk, sparing limbs ', ' Obese face+trunk sparing limbs ', ' Fat body with thin limbs ', ' Centripetal obesity ', ' Android fat distribution ', ' Abdominal obesity ', ' Frequencies ', ' Pattern ', ' Country ', ' Severity of illness ', ' disease severity ', ' Somatic Mutation ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' early detection ', ' cohort ', ' novel ', ' Prevention strategy ', ' Preventive strategy ', ' Preventative strategy ', ' Basic Science ', ' Basic Research ', ' Population Study ', ' study of the population ', ' studies of populations ', ' population-level study ', ' population-based study ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' Reporting ', ' Modeling ', ' Genomics ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Etiology ', ' disease causation ', ' causation ', ' Causality ', ' Address ', ' DNA Sequence Alteration ', ' genomic alteration ', ' Sequence Alteration ', ' Genetic mutation ', ' DNA mutation ', ' DNA Alteration ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' High Prevalence ', ' Mutate ', ' Catchment Area ', ' trend ', ' Molecular ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' cirrhotic ', ' Cirrhosis ', ' years of life lost to disease ', ' years of life lost to disability ', ' disease burden ', ' burden of disease ', ' burden of illness ', ' underserved people ', ' under served population ', ' Underserved Population ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Population ', ' South Texas ', ' Prevalence ', ' prospective ', ' treatment development ', ' intervention development ', ' develop therapy ', ' therapy development ', ' tumor ', ' nonalcoholic steato-hepatitis ', ' non-alcoholic steatohepatitis ', ' non-alcoholic steato-hepatitis ', ' non-alcohol induced steatohepatitis ', ' NASH ', ' nonalcoholic steatohepatitis ', ' high risk ', ' population based ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' Biological Markers ', ' surveillance strategy ', ' targeted therapy ', ' targeted therapeutic agents ', ' targeted therapeutic ', ' targeted drug treatments ', ' targeted drug therapy ', ' targeted treatment ', ' cell free circulating DNA ', ' cell free DNA ', ' targeted sequencing ', ' genomic profiles ', ' healthcare disparity ', ' disparity in healthcare ', ' disparity in care ', ' health care disparity ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF TX MD ANDERSON CAN CTR,R01,2018,390463,0.14848182299503035
"Evaluating utility and improving implementation of genomic sequencing for pediatric cancer patients in the diverse population and healthcare settings of Texas: The KidsCanSeq Study Through this Clinical Sequencing Evidence-Generating Research (CSER2) with Enhanced Diversity project we will complete a trial (The Texas KidsCanSeq Study) comparing the results of targeted cancer panel sequencing versus genome-scale testing in pediatric cancer patients across diverse clinical settings. We will compare the targeted cancer panel to germline whole exome sequencing (WES) of unselected childhood cancer patients (n=1100) and WES, transcriptome sequencing and copy number array of FFPE tumor samples for the subset of patients with high-risk tumors (n=360). We will build on our success completing the CSER program BASIC3 exome sequencing trial (which included 60% Hispanic and African-American patients from a single large academic center) in this large multi-institutional study of an even more diverse patient population from five heterogeneous healthcare settings across Texas. The trial will be led by an experienced multi-PI team of Drs. Plon (medical geneticist), Parsons (pediatric oncologist) and McGuire (ethicist and health policy expert). We will assess clinical utility of these tests by measuring the frequency of diagnostic and/or actionable germline and tumor findings and the effect on treatment decisions (Aim 1). We will compare uptake by first degree relatives for familial genetic testing and recommended cancer surveillance by race, ethnicity and clinical settings (Aim 2). We will describe perceived utility (clinical, psychological, and pragmatic) by surveying and interviewing parents and participating pediatric oncologists (n=40) (Aim 3). Working with our pediatric cancer stakeholders, including advocates, BASIC3 study parents, and national organizations, we will create and evaluate the use of culturally sensitive educational materials, including videos in English and Spanish, improved integrated genomic test reports and counseling materials, and will compare in-person versus telemedicine exome results disclosure (Aim 4). Finally, we will provide data to guide future application of clinical genomics through three innovative pilot projects focused on health economics, decision support for cancer surveillance and whole genome sequencing (Aim 5). Baylor College of Medicine, Texas Children’s Hospital, and our partner institutions across the state are ideally suited to conduct this study and play leadership roles in CSER2 consortium activities based on our longstanding pediatric oncology and cancer genetics expertise, extensive experience in CLIA-certified clinical germline and cancer genomic diagnostic testing, and a track record of scholarship in ethical and social implications of genomics and health disparities research. This study is designed to determine the relative clinical, pragmatic and psychological utility of more focused panel testing versus genome-scale testing including exome and RNA sequencing of both blood and tumor samples with regard to improving the care of childhood cancer patients and their at-risk family members.

"Border Biomedical Research Center OVERALL SUMMARY The University of Texas at El Paso (UTEP), through support from the Research Centers at Minority Institutions (RCMI) has created the Border Biomedical Research Center (BBRC) to address issues of Hispanic Health Disparities unique to the far West Texas region that we call the Borderplex. In this proposal UTEP has developed an extensive cadre of collaborators consisting of experts from regional academic, medical, and community partners with the goal to address cancer health disparities that permeate our majority Mexican American population. When combined with our sister city of Ciudad Juarez, Mexico, we represent the largest binational community in the world, with nearly 3 million people. The overall goal for this application is to develop, grow and sustain the extant infrastructure and programs of the BBRC, as well as to recruit, train, and develop cancer scientists and health practitioners to promote high quality cancer research and to translate meaningful findings back to the community. Through mentoring, pilot programs, and enhanced research infrastructure we seek to promote investigator competitiveness in acquiring extramural funding to address regional disease disparities. We also seek to generate an environment that creates pipelines for undergraduate and graduate students into biomedical careers and serves as a major point of entry for Hispanics and other underrepresented minorities into the nation’s biomedical workforce. These outcomes will be obtained through the achievement of five specific objectives which are to: (1) Contribute, to cancer research through innovative (a) basic; (b) behavioral; or (c) clinical studies within our geographically isolated and underserved Mexican American population. Increased emphasis on epidemiology and collaborations with clinical and public health specialists is within the context of the University’s mission to address the broader scope of pressing health problems in its service population. (2) Strengthen research infrastructure and, thereby, capabilities of BBRC investigators through (a) enhancement of extant multi-user core facilities for research related to proteins, DNA, cell culture, biorepository, biostatistics and bioinformatics; (3) Recruit experienced faculty members to address cancer health issues; (4) Facilitate the professional development and mentoring of BBRC investigators, including postdocs via (a) training/education, (b) pilot grant programs focusing on our cancer project themes, and through interdisciplinary research, address important health disparity issues and (5), Promote meaningful community partnerships to engage and recruit participants for research studies and augment outreach and dissemination efforts, through community events, discussions, seminars, and international symposia for our scientific professionals to share findings and best practices. Included in infrastructure enhancement are physical plant components that support research, an administrative core to carry out coordination, management and governance of program components, an evaluative component to ensure programmatic and border health objectives are achieved, and ultimately the development of new approaches to reduce cancer health disparities in our underrepresented population. PROJECT NARRATIVE The University of Texas at El Paso’s RCMI program proposes to address cancer health disparities that profoundly impact our community. We realize that only through research, the integration of scientists and medical professionals working together with the community, will we be able to address these issues. This proposal has been designed to provide an integrated approach of technical and human engagement to address cancer health disparities and move towards health equity.",Border Biomedical Research

"Texas Center for Minority Health, Education, Research and Outreach Project Summary-Overall Despite the overall improvement in the health of Americans during the past three decades, significant disparities in health outcomes persist based on race and ethnicity, sex, level of education and income, and other social characteristics. There is a growing awareness in many segments of United States society that persistent health disparities are not acceptable, and that through coordinated and targeted actions most health disparities are correctable. Created in 2005 with funding as an EXPORT Center, and current funding as a NIMHD Center of Excellence (P20), the Texas Center for Health Disparities (TCHD) has been a leader in health disparities research, education, and outreach in its local community, throughout the State of Texas, and in many parts of the nation. Building on its significant experience and expansive relationships, the TCHD proposes the NIMHD Specialized Center of Excellence (COE) with a focus on Women's Health Disparities. Consistent with the community-based participatory research (CBPR) focus of the TCHD, the focus area was identified through substantial community dialogue with partners. We will employ translational and CBPR approaches for identifying developing detection and therapeutic strategies for triple negative breast cancer, testing a patient- centered, community pharmacy-based comprehensive medication therapy management for HIV patients and an intervention to improve health behavior among women in underserved communities. Our COE will augment and strengthen the existing infrastructure and capacity of the TCHD for conducting basic, clinical, translational, participatory, and socio-behavioral research consistent with the NIMHD Research Framework. Our focus on Women's Health Disparities will address a significant need among racial and ethnic minority women in the U.S., the State of Texas, and our local community. We will also expand and develop new education and community engagement activities with our partner institutions and community. The objectives of our COE are to: 1) Conduct CBPR based- and biomedical- research on health disparities in women's health that exists in Texas minorities such as cancer, HIV, obesity, cardiovascular diseases, and stroke, 2) Provide opportunities for junior faculty, postdocs and early stage investigators to train in health disparity research that meets the community needs, 3) Promote education of students in health professions, health care practitioners and policy makers on the existence of health disparities and the need to combat the problem, and 4) Serve as a resource for the minority communities in North Texas to disseminate health information, promote community participation in health education and research, and to implement disease prevention activities. Project Narrative The goal of the Texas Center for Minority Health, Education, Research and Outreach program is to utilize NIMHD COE funding to build capacity and infrastructure at the UNTHSC for its nationally recognized health disparities research, training and outreach activities, specifically in recruiting and training more junior faculty, postdocs and early stage investigators in research on minority health and health disparities. The Center will enable transdisciplinary, interprofessional collaborations and novel approaches to understanding minority health and eliminate health disparities.","Texas Center for Minority Health, Education, Research and Outreach",9966070,U54MD006882,"['Affect ', ' Award ', ' Awareness ', ' Biomedical Research ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Communities ', ' Community Participation ', ' Community Pharmacy ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Evaluation Research ', ' Faculty ', ' Family ', ' Foundations ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' Health Tutoring ', ' Health Instruction ', ' Health education ', ' health science profession ', ' Health Professions ', ' Health Occupations ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Income ', ' Leadership ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Obesity ', ' Patients ', ' Poverty ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Support ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Schools ', ' Science ', ' sociobehavioral ', ' sociobehavior ', ' Social Behavior ', ' Social Characteristics ', ' Societies ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' brain attack ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Apoplexy ', ' Stroke ', ' Students ', ' Testing ', ' Texas ', ' Translating ', ' United States ', ' white race ', ' Occidental ', ' Caucasoid Race ', ' Caucasoid ', ' Caucasian Race ', ' Caucasian ', ' Caucasians ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Destinations ', ' Generations ', ' Female Health ', "" Women's Health "", ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Hispanics ', ' Uninsured ', ' medication therapy management ', ' Pharmacologic Management ', ' Analgesic Management ', ' Medication Management ', ' Advisory Committees ', ' advisory team ', ' Task Forces ', ' base ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Trust ', ' Mexican ', ' Policy Maker ', ' Educational workshop ', ' Workshop ', ' Funding ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Collaborations ', ' Immigrant ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Disease Management ', ' Disorder Management ', ' programs ', ' Educational Background ', ' Education Level ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' Postdoctoral Fellow ', ' post-doctoral ', ' post-doc ', ' Research Associate ', ' Postdoc ', ' college ', ' collegiate ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' metropolitan ', ' Municipalities ', ' Structure ', ' disorder prevention ', ' disease prevention ', ' outreach ', ' Modeling ', ' outreach program ', ' response ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Institution ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Low income ', ' Address ', ' Detection ', ' Education and Outreach ', ' Tutoring and Outreach ', ' Training and Outreach ', ' Instruction and Outreach ', ' Research Training ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' Nonhispanic ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Specialized Center ', ' P50 Program ', ' P50 Mechanism ', ' Process ', ' sex ', ' Community Health ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' minority health ', ' triple-negative invasive breast carcinoma ', ' triple-negative breast cancer ', ' TNBC ', ' Minority ', ' novel strategies ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel approaches ', ' new approaches ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' patient oriented ', ' patient centered ', ' community based participatory research ', ' participatory action research ', ' community based research ', ' community based design ', ' combat ', ' education research ', ' community partnership ', ' racial minority ', ' minority communities ', ' recruit ', ' Infrastructure ', ' ']",NIMHD,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH TEXAS HLTH SCI CTR,U54,2019,339306,0.16506225625858525

"Adolescent and Young Adult Cancer Patients Attitudes toward and Decision-Making Preferences about Clinical Genome Sequencing Through this Clinical Sequencing Evidence-Generating Research (CSER2) with Enhanced Diversity project we will complete a trial (The Texas KidsCanSeq Study) comparing the results of targeted cancer panel sequencing versus genome-scale testing in pediatric cancer patients across diverse clinical settings. We will compare the targeted cancer panel to germline whole exome sequencing (WES) of unselected childhood cancer patients (n=1100) and WES, transcriptome sequencing and copy number array of FFPE tumor samples for the subset of patients with high-risk tumors (n=360). We will build on our success completing the CSER program BASIC3 exome sequencing trial (which included 60% Hispanic and African-American patients from a single large academic center) in this large multi-institutional study of an even more diverse patient population from five heterogeneous healthcare settings across Texas. The trial will be led by an experienced multi-PI team of Drs. Plon (medical geneticist), Parsons (pediatric oncologist) and McGuire (ethicist and health policy expert). We will assess clinical utility of these tests by measuring the frequency of diagnostic and/or actionable germline and tumor findings and the effect on treatment decisions (Aim 1). We will compare uptake by first degree relatives for familial genetic testing and recommended cancer surveillance by race, ethnicity and clinical settings (Aim 2). We will describe perceived utility (clinical, psychological, and pragmatic) by surveying and interviewing parents and participating pediatric oncologists (n=40) (Aim 3). Working with our pediatric cancer stakeholders, including advocates, BASIC3 study parents, and national organizations, we will create and evaluate the use of culturally sensitive educational materials, including videos in English and Spanish, improved integrated genomic test reports and counseling materials, and will compare in-person versus telemedicine exome results disclosure (Aim 4). Finally, we will provide data to guide future application of clinical genomics through three innovative pilot projects focused on health economics, decision support for cancer surveillance and whole genome sequencing (Aim 5). Baylor College of Medicine, Texas Children’s Hospital, and our partner institutions across the state are ideally suited to conduct this study and play leadership roles in CSER2 consortium activities based on our longstanding pediatric oncology and cancer genetics expertise, extensive experience in CLIA-certified clinical germline and cancer genomic diagnostic testing, and a track record of scholarship in ethical and social implications of genomics and health disparities research. This study is designed to determine the relative clinical, pragmatic and psychological utility of more focused panel testing versus genome-scale testing including exome and RNA sequencing of both blood and tumor samples with regard to improving the care of childhood cancer patients and their at-risk family members. We will explore this innovative topology of utility for parents and physicians across the highly diverse patient populations and health care settings in Texas.",Adolescent and Young Adult Cancer

"Promoting Diversity in Research Training for Health Professionals ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The racial and ethnic minority population in Texas surpassed the Anglo population in 2004, and is projected to increase substantially in the coming years. Projections for educational attainment for minorities, historically low because of socioeconomic and other factors, suggest continued disparity for college, graduate and professional school enrollment. Admission of minority students into doctoral study in the biomedical sciences in Texas, and indeed in the nation, remains low despite population changes in Texas, the second most populous in the country. Thus, there is a critical need to train a large number of health professionals to serve minority populations, not only in Texas but also at the national level. To address this critical need, we propose the ""Promoting Diversity in Research Training for Health Professionals (PDRT)"" program. University of North Texas Health Science Center (UNTHSC) is a leader among the health science centers in Texas in training minority biomedical scientists. We have developed an integrated plan to increase the number of minorities in biomedical research, incorporating education at the K-12, undergraduate, graduate and post-doctoral levels. The overall goal of PRDT is to provide underrepresented minority individuals, who are enrolled in a health professional program, a challenging and focused research experience in health disparities related to cardiovascular, pulmonary, hematologic and sleep disorders.. The specific aims of the PRDT are: Aim 1. Generate a pool of applicants from the health professional programs at UNTHSC (Osteopathy, Pharmacy, Public Health and Physician Assistants) as well as regional health professional programs (UT-Southwestern Medical Center, Texas A&M College of Medicine, Texas Women's University), and recruit 15 participants each year for the PDRT program. Aim 2. Provide a 10-week research program that combines research in cardiovascular, pulmonary, hematologic and sleep disorders, with a special emphasis on health disparities. Aim 3. Provide workshops in responsible conduct of research, experimental design, interprofessional education and health disparities. These aims will be accomplished by the following activities: (1) Recruitment, (2) Research Training and Education, (3) Training Scholar to improve their skills to succeed, (4) Evaluation and (5) Tracking. Our expectation is that continued focus on the aims in meeting our objective will directly impact eventual achievement of our goal of obtaining a diverse population comprised of underrepresented populations in health disparity research related to cardiovascular diseases. (End of Abstract) Project Narrative There are three overarching goals of this project: 1) Identify PDRT Scholars with high potential for success. 2) Prepare the PDRT scholars for a career in research by providing a meaningful research and didactic exposure and 3) Support their success in their health professional programs and increase the number of underrepresented minority students and students from disadvantaged backgrounds and disabilities who will pursue health professional and biomedical research.",Promoting Diversity in Research Training for Health Professionals,9697417,R25HL125447,"['Latino ', ' population diversity ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' diverse populations ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Medical ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' disability ', ' Individual ', ' Educational workshop ', ' Workshop ', ' Research Activity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Ethnicity ', ' programs ', ' Investigation ', ' Country ', ' Benchmarking ', ' Best Practice Analysis ', ' meetings ', ' Postdoctoral Fellow ', ' post-doctoral ', ' post-doc ', ' Research Associate ', ' Postdoc ', ' college ', ' collegiate ', ' Medical center ', ' Training and Education ', ' Education and Training ', ' educationally disadvantaged ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' biomedical scientist ', ' skills ', ' expectation ', ' Participant ', ' Economically Deprived Population ', ' underclass ', ' economically disadvantaged ', ' economic disadvantage ', ' Economically Deprived ', ' Admission activity ', ' Admission ', ' Sleep Disorders ', ' sleep problem ', ' sleep dysregulation ', ' sleep dysfunction ', ' Physical therapy ', ' Physiotherapy ', ' Physical Therapeutics ', ' Physical Medicine Procedure ', ' Physiatric Procedure ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Institution ', ' Address ', ' Health Sciences ', ' International ', ' Research Training ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Underrepresented Minority ', ' underrepresentation of minorities ', ' under-representation of minorities ', ' Underrepresented Ethnic Minority ', ' trend ', ' socioeconomics ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socio-economically ', ' socio-economic ', ' Health Professional ', ' Healthcare professional ', ' Health Care Professional ', ' National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute ', ' NHLBI ', ' Minority ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' responsible research conduct ', ' undergraduate student ', ' undergraduate ', ' underrepresented minority student ', ' URM student ', ' Underrepresented Students ', ' Underrepresented Populations ', ' disadvantaged student ', ' minority student ', ' racial minority ', ' disparity reduction ', ' reduce disparity ', ' Health Care Research ', ' healthcare research ', ' recruit ', ' Academic Training ', ' Achievement ', ' Achievement Attainment ', ' Biomedical Research ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' circulatory system ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Censuses ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Professional Education ', ' Engineering ', ' Experimental Designs ', ' Goals ', ' health science profession ', ' Health Professions ', ' Health Occupations ', ' blood disorder ', ' Hematological Disorder ', ' Hematologic Diseases ', ' Blood Diseases ', ' Hematological Disease ', ' Hematology ', ' Household ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Income ', ' Leadership ', ' Learning ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Light ', ' pulmonary ', ' Lung Respiratory System ', ' Lung ', ' lung disorder ', ' disorder of the lung ', ' disease of the lung ', ' Respiratory System Disorder ', ' Respiratory System Disease ', ' Respiratory Disease ', ' Pulmonary Disorder ', ' Pulmonary Diseases ', ' Lung diseases ', ' Math ', ' Mathematics ', ' Medicine ', ' Persons ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' Osteopathy ', ' Osteopathic Medicine ', ' Pharmacies ', ' Pharmacy facility ', "" Physicians' Extenders "", "" Doctor's Assistants "", ' Physician Assistants ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' R&D ', ' R & D ', ' Development and Research ', ' research and development ', ' School Enrollments ', ' school of medicine ', ' medical college ', ' medical schools ', ' Science ', ' Sleep ', ' Students ', ' Technology ', ' Texas ', ' Training Programs ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' Woman ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Hispanics ', ' ']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH TEXAS HLTH SCI CTR,R25,2019,206280,0.15494886656869122
"Genomics of HCC in the Hispanic population of Texas PROJECT SUMMARY The incidence and mortality rates of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is rapidly increasing in the United States, with the highest rates found among Hispanics in South Texas. We reported that the prevalence of cirrhosis, the main risk factor for HCC, in Hispanics in South Texas is 4-times higher than the national average and identified central obesity and diabetes as the main risk factors. The role of obesity and diabetes in liver cirrhosis in Hispanics in South Texas likely contributes to the high prevalence of HCC associated with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) in this population. The burden of NASH in this population is more substantial than predicted, affecting close to 20% of the population including children. To address the magnitude of this growing health-disparity problem, it is critically important to identify those at high risk for HCC who would benefit from surveillance and prevention strategies. HCC is a genetically heterogeneous disease and specific somatic mutations profiles are associated with different etiologies. Hispanic ethnicity and NASH etiology are critically underrepresented in HCC genomic studies. Therefore, there is a need for molecular characterization of NASH- associated HCC in Hispanics, to identify opportunities for biomarker and targeted therapy development. Because HCC somatic mutations have been detected in circulating cell free DNA (cfDNA) in patients with HCC but also in patients with pre-HCC conditions such as cirrhosis, one such opportunity is the detection in cfDNA, of selected somatic mutations for HCC risk assessment and early detection. We hypothesize that the tumor genomic landscape of HCC in Hispanics in South Texas is representative of the underlying liver diseases and environmental factors affecting this population and that selected HCC somatic mutations can be detected in plasma cfDNA at early HCC stage or prior to diagnosis and could therefore have utility in HCC risk assessment and early detection. In Aim 1, we will determine the tumor genomic landscape of NASH-associated HCC in Hispanics in South Texas and identify (if any) unique features of HCC in this population. In Aim 2, we will custom-design a targeted sequencing panel to detect with high sensitivity the most common HCC somatic mutations identified in Aim 1, in plasma cfDNA of patients with NASH-associated HCC. In Aim 3, we will determine the utility of the mutation-based model identified in Aim 2 and applied to cfDNA, in HCC risk prediction in Hispanics in South Texas using two large population-based Hispanic cohorts. This project is supported by extensive preliminary data, unique resources and a strong multidisciplinary research team. It will represent the largest genomic study of HCC associated with NASH, diabetes and obesity in an underserved population particularly affected by these chronic diseases. The project impact and translational goals are: 1) to serve the Hispanic population in South Texas, a population with health and healthcare disparities and high rates of diabetes, obesity, NASH and HCC; and 2) to develop new tests to identify, in this population, subjects at high risk for HCC and institute effective surveillance and prevention strategies, improving survival. There is an alarming increase in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) incidence in Hispanics, a trend that is affecting in particular Hispanic populations in South Texas. Public health and basic research efforts are urgently needed to understand the unique pattern of HCC in Hispanics in South Texas and reduce this disease burden. We will characterize the tumor genomic landscape of HCC in Hispanics in Texas and will identify the genomic alterations in circulating cell free DNA that best predict HCC development in Hispanic with cirrhosis.",Genomics of HCC in the Hispanic population of Texas,9670749,R01CA204665,"['Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Communities ', ' diabetes ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Fibrosis ', ' Genes ', ' Geography ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' liver carcinoma ', ' Liver Cells Carcinoma ', ' Hepatoma ', ' Hepatocellular cancer ', ' Hepatocellular Carcinoma ', ' Hepatocarcinoma ', ' Primary carcinoma of the liver cells ', ' Incidence ', ' Institutes ', ' Hepatic Cirrhosis ', ' Liver Cirrhosis ', ' liver disorder ', ' hepatopathy ', ' hepatic disease ', ' Hepatic Disorder ', ' Liver diseases ', ' Chicanos ', ' Chicanas ', ' Mexican Americans ', ' mortality ', ' genome mutation ', ' Genetic defect ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Mutation ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Obesity ', ' Patients ', ' plasmocyte ', ' Plasmacytes ', ' Blood Plasma Cell ', ' Plasma Cells ', ' Prognosis ', ' outcome forecast ', ' Public Health ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Texas ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' County ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Hispanics ', ' Risk Assessment ', ' Custom ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Interdisciplinary Study ', ' Multidisciplinary Research ', ' Multidisciplinary Collaboration ', ' Interdisciplinary Research ', ' Disease Progression ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Central obesity ', ' waist-predominant obesity ', ' visceral obesity ', ' trunk obesity ', ' male-type obesity ', ' excess adiposity in midsection ', ' Truncal obesity ', ' Obesity of face and trunk, sparing limbs ', ' Obese face+trunk sparing limbs ', ' Fat body with thin limbs ', ' Centripetal obesity ', ' Android fat distribution ', ' Abdominal obesity ', ' Frequencies ', ' Pattern ', ' Country ', ' Severity of illness ', ' disease severity ', ' Somatic Mutation ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' early detection ', ' cohort ', ' novel ', ' Prevention strategy ', ' Preventive strategy ', ' Preventative strategy ', ' Basic Science ', ' Basic Research ', ' Population Study ', ' study of the population ', ' studies of populations ', ' population-level study ', ' population-based study ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' Reporting ', ' Modeling ', ' Genomics ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' disease causation ', ' causation ', ' Causality ', ' Etiology ', ' Address ', ' DNA Sequence Alteration ', ' genomic alteration ', ' Sequence Alteration ', ' Genetic mutation ', ' DNA mutation ', ' DNA Alteration ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' High Prevalence ', ' Mutate ', ' Catchment Area ', ' trend ', ' Molecular ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Cirrhosis ', ' cirrhotic ', ' burden of illness ', ' years of life lost to disease ', ' years of life lost to disability ', ' disease burden ', ' burden of disease ', ' Underserved Population ', ' underserved people ', ' under served population ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Population ', ' South Texas ', ' Prevalence ', ' prospective ', ' therapy development ', ' treatment development ', ' intervention development ', ' develop therapy ', ' tumor ', ' nonalcoholic steatohepatitis ', ' nonalcoholic steato-hepatitis ', ' non-alcoholic steatohepatitis ', ' non-alcoholic steato-hepatitis ', ' non-alcohol induced steatohepatitis ', ' NASH ', ' high risk ', ' population based ', ' Biological Markers ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' surveillance strategy ', ' targeted treatment ', ' targeted therapy ', ' targeted therapeutic agents ', ' targeted therapeutic ', ' targeted drug treatments ', ' targeted drug therapy ', ' cell free DNA ', ' cell free circulating DNA ', ' targeted sequencing ', ' genomic profiles ', ' health care disparity ', ' healthcare disparity ', ' disparity in healthcare ', ' disparity in care ', ' genomic data ', ' genomic dataset ', ' genomic data-set ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF TX MD ANDERSON CAN CTR,R01,2019,349864,0.14848182299503035
"Texas Center for Minority Health, Education, Research and Outreach Project Summary-Overall Despite the overall improvement in the health of Americans during the past three decades, significant disparities in health outcomes persist based on race and ethnicity, sex, level of education and income, and other social characteristics. There is a growing awareness in many segments of United States society that persistent health disparities are not acceptable, and that through coordinated and targeted actions most health disparities are correctable. Created in 2005 with funding as an EXPORT Center, and current funding as a NIMHD Center of Excellence (P20), the Texas Center for Health Disparities (TCHD) has been a leader in health disparities research, education, and outreach in its local community, throughout the State of Texas, and in many parts of the nation. Building on its significant experience and expansive relationships, the TCHD proposes the NIMHD Specialized Center of Excellence (COE) with a focus on Women's Health Disparities. Consistent with the community-based participatory research (CBPR) focus of the TCHD, the focus area was identified through substantial community dialogue with partners. We will employ translational and CBPR approaches for identifying developing detection and therapeutic strategies for triple negative breast cancer, testing a patient- centered, community pharmacy-based comprehensive medication therapy management for HIV patients and an intervention to improve health behavior among women in underserved communities. Our COE will augment and strengthen the existing infrastructure and capacity of the TCHD for conducting basic, clinical, translational, participatory, and socio-behavioral research consistent with the NIMHD Research Framework. Our focus on Women's Health Disparities will address a significant need among racial and ethnic minority women in the U.S., the State of Texas, and our local community. We will also expand and develop new education and community engagement activities with our partner institutions and community. The objectives of our COE are to: 1) Conduct CBPR based- and biomedical- research on health disparities in women's health that exists in Texas minorities such as cancer, HIV, obesity, cardiovascular diseases, and stroke, 2) Provide opportunities for junior faculty, postdocs and early stage investigators to train in health disparity research that meets the community needs, 3) Promote education of students in health professions, health care practitioners and policy makers on the existence of health disparities and the need to combat the problem, and 4) Serve as a resource for the minority communities in North Texas to disseminate health information, promote community participation in health education and research, and to implement disease prevention activities. Project Narrative The goal of the Texas Center for Minority Health, Education, Research and Outreach program is to utilize NIMHD COE funding to build capacity and infrastructure at the UNTHSC for its nationally recognized health disparities research, training and outreach activities, specifically in recruiting and training more junior faculty, postdocs and early stage investigators in research on minority health and health disparities. The Center will enable transdisciplinary, interprofessional collaborations and novel approaches to understanding minority health and eliminate health disparities.","Texas Center for Minority Health, Education, Research and Outreach",9745318,U54MD006882,"['Affect ', ' Award ', ' Awareness ', ' Biomedical Research ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Communities ', ' Community Participation ', ' Community Pharmacy ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Evaluation Research ', ' Faculty ', ' Family ', ' Foundations ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' Health Tutoring ', ' Health Instruction ', ' Health education ', ' health science profession ', ' Health Professions ', ' Health Occupations ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Income ', ' Leadership ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Obesity ', ' Patients ', ' Poverty ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Support ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Schools ', ' Science ', ' sociobehavioral ', ' sociobehavior ', ' Social Behavior ', ' Social Characteristics ', ' Societies ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' brain attack ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Apoplexy ', ' Stroke ', ' Students ', ' Testing ', ' Texas ', ' Translating ', ' United States ', ' white race ', ' Occidental ', ' Caucasoid Race ', ' Caucasoid ', ' Caucasian Race ', ' Caucasian ', ' Caucasians ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Destinations ', ' Generations ', ' Female Health ', "" Women's Health "", ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Hispanics ', ' Uninsured ', ' medication therapy management ', ' Pharmacologic Management ', ' Analgesic Management ', ' Medication Management ', ' Advisory Committees ', ' advisory team ', ' Task Forces ', ' base ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Trust ', ' Mexican ', ' Policy Maker ', ' Educational workshop ', ' Workshop ', ' Funding ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Collaborations ', ' Immigrant ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Disease Management ', ' Disorder Management ', ' programs ', ' Educational Background ', ' Education Level ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' Postdoctoral Fellow ', ' post-doctoral ', ' post-doc ', ' Research Associate ', ' Postdoc ', ' college ', ' collegiate ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' metropolitan ', ' Municipalities ', ' Structure ', ' disorder prevention ', ' disease prevention ', ' outreach ', ' Modeling ', ' outreach program ', ' response ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Institution ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Low income ', ' Address ', ' Detection ', ' Education and Outreach ', ' Tutoring and Outreach ', ' Training and Outreach ', ' Instruction and Outreach ', ' Research Training ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' Nonhispanic ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Specialized Center ', ' P50 Program ', ' P50 Mechanism ', ' Process ', ' sex ', ' Community Health ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' minority health ', ' triple-negative invasive breast carcinoma ', ' triple-negative breast cancer ', ' TNBC ', ' Minority ', ' novel strategies ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel approaches ', ' new approaches ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' patient oriented ', ' patient centered ', ' community based participatory research ', ' participatory action research ', ' community based research ', ' community based design ', ' combat ', ' education research ', ' community partnership ', ' racial minority ', ' minority communities ', ' recruit ', ' Infrastructure ', ' ']",NIMHD,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH TEXAS HLTH SCI CTR,U54,2019,1458957,0.16506225625858525
"Texas Minority Health, Education, Research and Outreach (Texas MiHERO) Project Summary The long term objective of the Texas Minority Health, Education, Research and Outreach (Texas MiHERO) is to expand the capacity of University of North Texas Health Science Center (UNTHSC) to enhance research and research training in minority health and health disparities by increasing the number of under-represented students in health disparity research, providing interdisciplinary research and leadership training to junior faculty, and increasing the number of health professional faculty involved in health disparity research. Given the substantial need for physicians, physician scientists, and other health professionals to care for vulnerable populations, and the critical need to study diseases and conditions that disproportionately affect these groups, more efforts are needed to increase the participation of individuals from diverse backgrounds in conducting research on minority health and health disparities, and encouraging them to consider careers in research and related fields. The Texas Center for Health Disparities (TCHD), a Center of Excellence funded by a P20 grant award from NIMHD will develop the MiHERO program to increase health disparity research capacity by increasing the size of the PhD workforce in health disparities, train junior faculty in interdisciplinary research leadership, and provide opportunities for senior investigators to develop research focus in minority health and health disparities. Three priority activities will be conducted under the MiHERO program:   Priority Activity 1: Develop an Interdisciplinary Research Leadership (IRL) Program for junior faculty in  Minority Health and Health Disparities  Priority Activity 2: Establish a Health Education, Awareness and Research in Disparities Scholarship  (HEARD Scholars) program for recruitment/retention of diverse faculty in Minority Health and Health Disparities.  Priority Activity 3: Increase the diversity of the biomedical, behavioral and clinical research workforce  by recruiting a new cohort of PhD students from minority and underrepresented groups each year who  focus on health disparities. Using the endowment funds secured through this mechanism of funding, we will ensure the creation of robust training opportunities that encourage participants of the proposed program to seek careers in research and related field that address the issue of health disparities.

"Texas Minority Health, Education, Research and Outreach (Texas MiHERO) Project Summary The long term objective of the Texas Minority Health, Education, Research and Outreach (Texas MiHERO) is to expand the capacity of University of North Texas Health Science Center (UNTHSC) to enhance research and research training in minority health and health disparities by increasing the number of under-represented students in health disparity research, providing interdisciplinary research and leadership training to junior faculty, and increasing the number of health professional faculty involved in health disparity research. Given the substantial need for physicians, physician scientists, and other health professionals to care for vulnerable populations, and the critical need to study diseases and conditions that disproportionately affect these groups, more efforts are needed to increase the participation of individuals from diverse backgrounds in conducting research on minority health and health disparities, and encouraging them to consider careers in research and related fields. The Texas Center for Health Disparities (TCHD), a Center of Excellence funded by a P20 grant award from NIMHD will develop the MiHERO program to increase health disparity research capacity by increasing the size of the PhD workforce in health disparities, train junior faculty in interdisciplinary research leadership, and provide opportunities for senior investigators to develop research focus in minority health and health disparities. Three priority activities will be conducted under the MiHERO program:   Priority Activity 1: Develop an Interdisciplinary Research Leadership (IRL) Program for junior faculty in  Minority Health and Health Disparities  Priority Activity 2: Establish a Health Education, Awareness and Research in Disparities Scholarship  (HEARD Scholars) program for recruitment/retention of diverse faculty in Minority Health and Health Disparities.  Priority Activity 3: Increase the diversity of the biomedical, behavioral and clinical research workforce  by recruiting a new cohort of PhD students from minority and underrepresented groups each year who  focus on health disparities. Using the endowment funds secured through this mechanism of funding, we will ensure the creation of robust training opportunities that encourage participants of the proposed program to seek careers in research and related field that address the issue of health disparities. The impact of the endowment income will be establishment of a sustainable program in Minority Health and Health Disparities, including health disparity curricula for graduate students, a junior faculty development program that can be expanded to faculty from other institutions, and a cadre of health disparity researchers who have active research projects in the area of Minority Health and Health Disparities.

"Texas EXperimental Cancer Therapeutics Network - TEX CTN Project Summary The Texas Experimental Cancer Therapeutic Network (TEX-CTN) is comprised of the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center (UT MDACC; Lead Academic Organization, LAO), the UT Health San Antonio Cancer Center (UT Health SA; Affiliate Organization, AO), the UT at Austin (UTA); Affiliate Organization, AO) and the UT Medical Branch at Galveston (UTMB; Affiliate Organization, AO). We propose to advance the development of novel therapeutics using precision oncology approaches and rationally designed clinical trials. The long-term objective is to provide the ETCTN with the joint expertise of the faculty from the four member institutions, expediting translating preclinical discoveries to the clinic, and to provide significant scientific and administrative leadership to the ETCTN. Our hypothesis for the optimal development of novel targeted agents includes testing within a molecularly profiled population, integrating pharmacodynamics markers in early clinical trials and programmatic assessment of predictors of intrinsic sensitivity/resistance and mechanisms of acquired resistance. We are proposing to achieve these goals through the following five specific aims: 1) To study, in an efficient, systematic and collaborative manner, the safety and clinical activity of new agents or hypothesis-driven novel combinations. 2) To molecularly profile tumors and patients (host tissues), to optimize selection of potentially relevant therapies based on the molecular aberrations identified in the tumor and immune environment, where appropriate. 3) To develop and validate clinically relevant of predictors and pharmacodynamic markers of response. 4) To mentor early career faculty, trainees and research personnel in the leadership, conduct, analysis, and reporting of ETCTN trials. 5) To provide scientific and administrative leadership within ETCTN. The TEX-CTN will unite four University of Texas institutions to facilitate access to novel therapies and biomarker-driven trials across the network, for patients with rare as well as common tumors, as well as patients from underserved minority populations. Our team consists of internationally recognized leaders of Phase I and II trials, multidisciplinary disease experts, interventional radiologists, translational pathologists, and diagnostic radiologists. TEX-CTN is well poised to attain a new paradigm for early experimental therapeutic clinical trials. Project Narrative The Texas Experimental Cancer Therapeutic Network (TEX-CTN) will leverage the strengths of the four UT institutions, to rationally design individualized novel cancer therapeutics through testing within molecularly profiled populations, integrating pharmacodynamic markers in early clinical trials, and programmatic assessment of predictors of intrinsic sensitivity/resistance and mechanisms of acquired resistance.

"Center for Clinical and Translational Sciences (CCTS) In the first awarded CTSA class, the Center for Clinical and Translational Sciences (CCTS) formed the first multiple-institution CTSA, with The University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston (UTHSC-H) and The University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center (UT MDACC). Since its inception the CCTS has been achieving the primary goal of the Clinical and Translational Sciences Award (CTSA) program: to accelerate research to transform healthcare and train the next generation of translational scientists. Our initial proposal was about bringing individuals and resources together, educating investigators, and building teams. In our 2011 renewal we described our Lowering-The-Barriers program, which focused on removing a large number of impediments through initiatives such as IRB reciprocity, standard research contracts and subcontracts, clinical data warehouses, patient registries, and biobanks. Our efforts have been successful and aligned with the national CTSA program. In this cycle, we bring in 3 new partner institutions to broaden and diversify our CTSA: The University of Texas Health Science Center at Tyler (northeast Texas, rural, economically disadvantaged), Rice University (with strengths in computer science, education, and team science), and The University of Texas Rio Grande Valley (south Texas, education and physician resources to help our nearby Brownsville Clinical Research Unit perform clinical trials). Together we will effect 5 strategic goals: Strategic Goal 1: To provide our investigators, staff, trainees, and scholars with the skills and knowledge necessary to advance discoveries and their translation in the new environment of clinical and translational research (Workforce Development). Strategic Goal 2: To collaborate with all of our stakeholders in a mutually beneficial way to advance translation by furthering engagement and team science (Collaboration/Engagement). Strategic Goal 3: To integrate pediatric and geriatric patients, Hispanic patients with cancer, and the LGBTQ+ community into the full spectrum of clinical and translational research (Integration). Strategic Goal 4: To advance translational science by providing novel processes, increasing efficiency, and streamlining research (Methods/Processes). Strategic Goal 5. To create and apply innovative informatics solutions to advance translational research, train the CTSA workforce, disseminate best practices, engage communities and integrate clinical and basic research data (Informatics).

"Evaluating utility and improving implementation of genomic sequencing for pediatric cancer patients in the diverse population and healthcare settings of Texas: The KidsCanSeq Study Through this Clinical Sequencing Evidence-Generating Research (CSER2) with Enhanced Diversity project we will complete a trial (The Texas KidsCanSeq Study) comparing the results of targeted cancer panel sequencing versus genome-scale testing in pediatric cancer patients across diverse clinical settings. We will compare the targeted cancer panel to germline whole exome sequencing (WES) of unselected childhood cancer patients (n=1100) and WES, transcriptome sequencing and copy number array of FFPE tumor samples for the subset of patients with high-risk tumors (n=360). We will build on our success completing the CSER program BASIC3 exome sequencing trial (which included 60% Hispanic and African-American patients from a single large academic center) in this large multi-institutional study of an even more diverse patient population from five heterogeneous healthcare settings across Texas. The trial will be led by an experienced multi-PI team of Drs. Plon (medical geneticist), Parsons (pediatric oncologist) and McGuire (ethicist and health policy expert). We will assess clinical utility of these tests by measuring the frequency of diagnostic and/or actionable germline and tumor findings and the effect on treatment decisions (Aim 1). We will compare uptake by first degree relatives for familial genetic testing and recommended cancer surveillance by race, ethnicity and clinical settings (Aim 2). We will describe perceived utility (clinical, psychological, and pragmatic) by surveying and interviewing parents and participating pediatric oncologists (n=40) (Aim 3). Working with our pediatric cancer stakeholders, including advocates, BASIC3 study parents, and national organizations, we will create and evaluate the use of culturally sensitive educational materials, including videos in English and Spanish, improved integrated genomic test reports and counseling materials, and will compare in-person versus telemedicine exome results disclosure (Aim 4). Finally, we will provide data to guide future application of clinical genomics through three innovative pilot projects focused on health economics, decision support for cancer surveillance and whole genome sequencing (Aim 5). Baylor College of Medicine, Texas Children’s Hospital, and our partner institutions across the state are ideally suited to conduct this study and play leadership roles in CSER2 consortium activities based on our longstanding pediatric oncology and cancer genetics expertise, extensive experience in CLIA-certified clinical germline and cancer genomic diagnostic testing, and a track record of scholarship in ethical and social implications of genomics and health disparities research. This study is designed to determine the relative clinical, pragmatic and psychological utility of more focused panel testing versus genome-scale testing including exome and RNA sequencing of both blood and tumor samples with regard to improving the care of childhood cancer patients and their at-risk family members. We will explore this innovative topology of utility for parents and physicians across the highly diverse patient populations and health care settings in Texas.",Evaluating utility and improving

"Texas A&M College of Medicine Developing and Readying Underrepresented Minority Researchers (DRUMR) Summer Research Program PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Texas A&M College of Medicine Developing and Readying Underrepresented Minority Researchers (DRUMR) Summer Research Program  Texas ranks 2nd behind California in the percentage of its minority population (55%) as well as in the size of its Hispanic population (11.7 million as of 2017). Texas is also 2nd in terms of the size of its rural area, only behind Alaska. Since NIDDK-related diseases affect minorities and rural populations at a significantly greater rate, it is not surprising that Texas sits near the top for deaths (CDC). One important step to rectify these disparities involves an increase in minority representation of Texas’ biomedical research workforce, such that it more adequately reflects the state’s population diversity. This program will provide research opportunities to the best minority undergraduate students of the Texas A&M University System.  The Texas A&M University System is a statewide network of 11 university campuses with an enrollment of over 152,000 students. Aside from the flagship campus located in College Station, the majority of students at the other 10 campuses are mainly Hispanic, Black, disadvantaged, and/or underprivileged students from mostly rural and remote areas of Texas. The Texas A&M’s College of Medicine (TAMCOM) Developing and Readying Underrepresented Minority Researchers (DRUMR) Summer Research Program (SRP) will offer disadvantaged and underrepresented minority students the opportunity to work with TAMCOM faculty in Bryan/College Station on research projects in NIDDK-related biomedical research areas. This 10-week program will also feature the nationally recognized Southwest Rural Health Research Center, 1 of only 7 in the country, and the A&M Rural and Community Health Institute. The 50 total students, 1 from each of the 10 sister schools each year for 5 years, will be selected by their institution based on eligibility, academics, and career goals, and then matched with College of Medicine faculty mentors in Bryan/College Station based on their NIDDK-related area of research interest.  TAMCOM has been operating a SRP for 12 years and on average about 30% of participants each year are underrepresented minorities or disadvantaged. Over this time, 78% of participants enter graduate and/or medical school, which is higher than the 54% national average for other SRPs (National Science Foundation). The overall objective of the TAMCOM DRUMR SRP is to prepare disadvantaged and underrepresented Texas A&M University System students for careers in NIDDK-related biomedical research. The TAMCOM DRUMR SRP has 3 aims: (1) Provide integrative training and mentoring to participants in NIDDK-related biomedical research, (2) Provide laboratory skills to prepare participants for a career in biomedical research, and (3) Develop a network of students (“DRUMRs”) that will increase the diversity of the biomedical research workforce. PROJECT NARRATIVE/RELEVANCE TO PUBLIC HEALTH The proposed program (Developing and Readying Underrepresented Minority Researchers) will provide 10 disadvantaged and underrepresented minority Texas A&M University System students each year the opportunity to participate in the Texas A&M College of Medicine's Summer Research Program (SRP). We have operated a very competitive and highly successful SRP for the past 12 years and our 10-week program offers various seminars on biomedical research as well as training in the responsible conduct of research while providing the 50 “DRUMRs” the opportunity to choose from a number of invested mentors. Increasing the number of and training the next generation of disadvantaged and underrepresented minority researchers in NIDDK-related biomedical research areas is critical to ensure future discoveries that will improve the health and well-being of millions of Americans.",Texas A&M College of Medicine Developing and Readying Underrepresented Minority Researchers (DRUMR) Summer Research Program,10090921,R25DK126642,"['Affect ', ' Alaska ', ' Americas ', ' Biomedical Research ', ' California ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' CDC ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Eligibility Determination ', ' Eligibility ', ' Protocol Screening ', ' Faculty ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Institutes ', ' Laboratories ', ' Medicine ', ' Mentors ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' well-being ', ' wellbeing ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Rural Health ', ' Rural Population ', ' Schools ', ' medical schools ', ' medical college ', ' school of medicine ', ' Science ', ' Students ', ' Texas ', ' Time ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Latino Population ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' hispanic community ', ' Hispanics ', ' diverse populations ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' population diversity ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' base ', ' career ', ' rural region ', ' rural area ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Ensure ', ' Training ', ' Rural ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R01 Program ', ' Research Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Sister ', ' programs ', ' System ', ' Country ', ' interest ', ' collegiate ', ' college ', ' American ', ' skills ', ' Participant ', ' Institution ', ' NIDDK ', ' National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Underrepresented Ethnic Minority ', ' under-representation of minorities ', ' underrepresentation of minorities ', ' Underrepresented Minority ', ' Community Health ', ' next generation ', ' Minority ', ' Population ', ' responsible research conduct ', ' undergraduate ', ' undergraduate student ', ' URM student ', ' underrepresented minority student ', ' faculty mentor ', ' summer research ', ' minority undergraduate ', ' ']",NIDDK,TEXAS A&M UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCE CTR,R25,2020,102384,0.12742588772346133
"Promoting Diversity in Research Training for Health Professionals ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The racial and ethnic minority population in Texas surpassed the Anglo population in 2004, and is projected to increase substantially in the coming years. Projections for educational attainment for minorities, historically low because of socioeconomic and other factors, suggest continued disparity for college, graduate and professional school enrollment. Admission of minority students into doctoral study in the biomedical sciences in Texas, and indeed in the nation, remains low despite population changes in Texas, the second most populous in the country. Thus, there is a critical need to train a large number of health professionals to serve minority populations, not only in Texas but also at the national level. To address this critical need, we propose the ""Promoting Diversity in Research Training for Health Professionals (PDRT)"" program. University of North Texas Health Science Center (UNTHSC) is a leader among the health science centers in Texas in training minority biomedical scientists. We have developed an integrated plan to increase the number of minorities in biomedical research, incorporating education at the K-12, undergraduate, graduate and post-doctoral levels. The overall goal of PRDT is to provide underrepresented minority individuals, who are enrolled in a health professional program, a challenging and focused research experience in health disparities related to cardiovascular, pulmonary, hematologic and sleep disorders.. The specific aims of the PRDT are: Aim 1. Generate a pool of applicants from the health professional programs at UNTHSC (Osteopathy, Pharmacy, Public Health and Physician Assistants) as well as regional health professional programs (UT-Southwestern Medical Center, Texas A&M College of Medicine, Texas Women's University), and recruit 15 participants each year for the PDRT program. Aim 2. Provide a 10-week research program that combines research in cardiovascular, pulmonary, hematologic and sleep disorders, with a special emphasis on health disparities. Aim 3. Provide workshops in responsible conduct of research, experimental design, interprofessional education and health disparities. These aims will be accomplished by the following activities: (1) Recruitment, (2) Research Training and Education, (3) Training Scholar to improve their skills to succeed, (4) Evaluation and (5) Tracking. Our expectation is that continued focus on the aims in meeting our objective will directly impact eventual achievement of our goal of obtaining a diverse population comprised of underrepresented populations in health disparity research related to cardiovascular diseases. (End of Abstract) Project Narrative There are three overarching goals of this project: 1) Identify PDRT Scholars with high potential for success. 2) Prepare the PDRT scholars for a career in research by providing a meaningful research and didactic exposure and 3) Support their success in their health professional programs and increase the number of underrepresented minority students and students from disadvantaged backgrounds and disabilities who will pursue health professional and biomedical research.",Promoting Diversity in Research Training for Health Professionals,9925277,R25HL125447,"['Academic Training ', ' Achievement ', ' Achievement Attainment ', ' Biomedical Research ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Censuses ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Professional Education ', ' Engineering ', ' Experimental Designs ', ' Goals ', ' Health Occupations ', ' Health Professions ', ' health science profession ', ' Hematological Disease ', ' Blood Diseases ', ' Hematologic Diseases ', ' Hematological Disorder ', ' blood disorder ', ' Household ', ' Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Economical Income ', ' Leadership ', ' Learning ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Lung diseases ', ' Pulmonary Diseases ', ' Pulmonary Disorder ', ' Respiratory Disease ', ' Respiratory System Disease ', ' Respiratory System Disorder ', ' disease of the lung ', ' disorder of the lung ', ' lung disorder ', ' Mathematics ', ' Math ', ' Medicine ', ' Persons ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Osteopathic Medicine ', ' Osteopathy ', ' Pharmacy facility ', ' Pharmacies ', ' Physician Assistants ', "" Doctor's Assistants "", "" Physicians' Extenders "", ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' research and development ', ' Development and Research ', ' R & D ', ' R&D ', ' School Enrollments ', ' medical schools ', ' medical college ', ' school of medicine ', ' Science ', ' Students ', ' Technology ', ' Texas ', ' Training Programs ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' Woman ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Latino Population ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' hispanic community ', ' Hispanics ', ' Latino ', ' diverse populations ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' population diversity ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Medical ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' disability ', ' Individual ', ' Workshop ', ' Educational workshop ', ' Research Activity ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' programs ', ' Investigation ', ' Country ', ' Best Practice Analysis ', ' Benchmarking ', ' meetings ', ' Postdoc ', ' Research Associate ', ' post-doc ', ' post-doctoral ', ' Postdoctoral Fellow ', ' collegiate ', ' college ', ' Medical center ', ' Education and Training ', ' Training and Education ', ' educationally disadvantaged ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' biomedical scientist ', ' skills ', ' expectation ', ' Participant ', ' Economically Deprived ', ' economic disadvantage ', ' economically disadvantaged ', ' underclass ', ' Economically Deprived Population ', ' Admission ', ' Admission activity ', ' sleep diseases ', ' sleep dysfunction ', ' sleep dysregulation ', ' sleep problem ', ' Sleep Disorders ', ' Physiatric Procedure ', ' Physical Medicine Procedure ', ' Physical Therapeutics ', ' Physiotherapy ', ' Physical therapy ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Institution ', ' Address ', ' Health Sciences ', ' International ', ' Research Training ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Underrepresented Ethnic Minority ', ' under-representation of minorities ', ' underrepresentation of minorities ', ' Underrepresented Minority ', ' trend ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio-economically ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomics ', ' Health Care Professional ', ' Healthcare professional ', ' Health Professional ', ' NHLBI ', ' National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute ', ' Minority ', ' Population ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' ethnic minority ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' responsible research conduct ', ' undergraduate ', ' undergraduate student ', ' URM student ', ' underrepresented minority student ', ' Underrepresented Students ', ' Underrepresented Populations ', ' disadvantaged student ', ' minority student ', ' racial minority ', ' reduce disparity ', ' disparity reduction ', ' healthcare research ', ' Health Care Research ', ' recruit ', ' ']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH TEXAS HLTH SCI CTR,R25,2020,206280,0.15494886656869122
"Texas Center for Minority Health, Education, Research and Outreach Project Summary-Overall Despite the overall improvement in the health of Americans during the past three decades, significant disparities in health outcomes persist based on race and ethnicity, sex, level of education and income, and other social characteristics. There is a growing awareness in many segments of United States society that persistent health disparities are not acceptable, and that through coordinated and targeted actions most health disparities are correctable. Created in 2005 with funding as an EXPORT Center, and current funding as a NIMHD Center of Excellence (P20), the Texas Center for Health Disparities (TCHD) has been a leader in health disparities research, education, and outreach in its local community, throughout the State of Texas, and in many parts of the nation. Building on its significant experience and expansive relationships, the TCHD proposes the NIMHD Specialized Center of Excellence (COE) with a focus on Women's Health Disparities. Consistent with the community-based participatory research (CBPR) focus of the TCHD, the focus area was identified through substantial community dialogue with partners. We will employ translational and CBPR approaches for identifying developing detection and therapeutic strategies for triple negative breast cancer, testing a patient- centered, community pharmacy-based comprehensive medication therapy management for HIV patients and an intervention to improve health behavior among women in underserved communities. Our COE will augment and strengthen the existing infrastructure and capacity of the TCHD for conducting basic, clinical, translational, participatory, and socio-behavioral research consistent with the NIMHD Research Framework. Our focus on Women's Health Disparities will address a significant need among racial and ethnic minority women in the U.S., the State of Texas, and our local community. We will also expand and develop new education and community engagement activities with our partner institutions and community. The objectives of our COE are to: 1) Conduct CBPR based- and biomedical- research on health disparities in women's health that exists in Texas minorities such as cancer, HIV, obesity, cardiovascular diseases, and stroke, 2) Provide opportunities for junior faculty, postdocs and early stage investigators to train in health disparity research that meets the community needs, 3) Promote education of students in health professions, health care practitioners and policy makers on the existence of health disparities and the need to combat the problem, and 4) Serve as a resource for the minority communities in North Texas to disseminate health information, promote community participation in health education and research, and to implement disease prevention activities. Project Narrative The goal of the Texas Center for Minority Health, Education, Research and Outreach program is to utilize NIMHD COE funding to build capacity and infrastructure at the UNTHSC for its nationally recognized health disparities research, training and outreach activities, specifically in recruiting and training more junior faculty, postdocs and early stage investigators in research on minority health and health disparities. The Center will enable transdisciplinary, interprofessional collaborations and novel approaches to understanding minority health and eliminate health disparities.","Texas Center for Minority Health, Education, Research and Outreach",9932804,U54MD006882,"['Affect ', ' Award ', ' Awareness ', ' Biomedical Research ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Communities ', ' Community Participation ', ' Community Pharmacy ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Evaluation Research ', ' Faculty ', ' Family ', ' Foundations ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' Health education ', ' Health Instruction ', ' Health Tutoring ', ' Health Occupations ', ' Health Professions ', ' health science profession ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' HIV ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Economical Income ', ' Leadership ', ' Obesity ', ' adiposity ', ' corpulence ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulentia ', ' obese ', ' obese people ', ' obese person ', ' obese population ', ' Patients ', ' Poverty ', ' Race ', ' Racial Group ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Research Support ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Schools ', ' Science ', ' Social Behavior ', ' sociobehavior ', ' sociobehavioral ', ' Social Characteristics ', ' Societies ', ' Stroke ', ' Apoplexy ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' brain attack ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' Students ', ' Testing ', ' Texas ', ' Translating ', ' United States ', ' Caucasians ', ' Caucasian ', ' Caucasian Race ', ' Caucasoid ', ' Caucasoid Race ', ' Occidental ', ' white race ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Destinations ', ' Generations ', "" Women's Health "", ' Female Health ', ' Afro American ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Black Populations ', ' black American ', ' African American ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Latino Population ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' hispanic community ', ' Hispanics ', ' Uninsured ', ' Analgesic Management ', ' Pharmacologic Management ', ' medication therapy management ', ' Medication Management ', ' Task Forces ', ' advisory team ', ' Advisory Committees ', ' base ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Trust ', ' Mexican ', ' Policy Maker ', ' Workshop ', ' Educational workshop ', ' Funding ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R01 Program ', ' Research Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Collaborations ', ' Immigrant ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Disorder Management ', ' Disease Management ', ' programs ', ' Education Level ', ' Educational Background ', ' Home ', ' Home environment ', ' Postdoc ', ' Research Associate ', ' post-doc ', ' post-doctoral ', ' Postdoctoral Fellow ', ' collegiate ', ' college ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' metropolitan ', ' Municipalities ', ' Structure ', ' disease prevention ', ' disorder prevention ', ' outreach ', ' Modeling ', ' outreach program ', ' response ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Institution ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Low income ', ' Address ', ' Detection ', ' Instruction and Outreach ', ' Training and Outreach ', ' Tutoring and Outreach ', ' Education and Outreach ', ' Research Training ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Nonhispanic ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' P50 Mechanism ', ' P50 Program ', ' Specialized Center ', ' Process ', ' sex ', ' Community Health ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' minority health ', ' TNBC ', ' triple-negative breast cancer ', ' triple-negative invasive breast carcinoma ', ' Minority ', ' new approaches ', ' novel approaches ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel strategies ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' ethnic minority ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' patient centered ', ' patient oriented ', ' community based design ', ' community based research ', ' participatory action research ', ' community based participatory research ', ' combat ', ' education research ', ' community partnership ', ' racial minority ', ' minority communities ', ' recruit ', ' Infrastructure ', ' ']",NIMHD,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH TEXAS HLTH SCI CTR,U54,2020,975149,0.16506225625858525
"Center for Biomedical and Minority Health Research PROJECT SUMMARY Texas Southern University (TSU) is requesting continuous RCMI U54 support for the Center for Biomedical and Minority Health Research (CBMHR) formerly known as the Center for Biomedical and Health Research Excellence under the G12 mechanism. The purpose of the CBMHR is to support basic biomedical research for diseases that disproportionately impact underrepresented minority (URM) populations (e.g. cancer, infectious diseases). The proposed CBMHR program is being enhanced to better attract and engage new community partnerships and address contemporary health issues that disproportionately affect African Americans. The goals of the program are to: (1) enhance TSU’s biomedical research capability through continuous infrastructure building and development; (2) equip all investigators to secure competitive extramural support for biomedical research, particularly on diseases that disproportionately impact underrepresented minorities (URMs); (3) promote professional development for new and early career investigators; (4) foster an environment conducive to scientific inquiry that promotes new basic science research focused on diseases that affect minority populations; and (5) provide enhanced mechanisms for the development of collaborations and partnerships with community-based organizations. The CBMHR will be organized into 4 cores: Administrative Core (ADC), Research Infrastructure Core (RIC), Investigator Development Core (IDC), Community Engagement Core (CEC), and two independent research projects. Each core will be designed to support the purpose, goals and objectives of the CBMHR. The ADC will provide oversight and administrative support as well as career enhancement program and collaborative environment. The RIC will be organized in a manner that will allow investigators access to advanced research facilities, instrumentation, and service-oriented scientific expertise. The IDC will fully engage pilot projects. And the CEC will promote community engagement activities in bridging the health disparity gaps for URMs in the Greater Houston Community (GHC). The two research projects will address challenges of current cancer studies. At the end of five years of RCMI U54 support, the CBMHR will demonstrate outcomes including substantial increases in publications citing NIH support, grant proposal submissions, NIH R- type grants awarded, successful professional development outcomes as indicated by young investigators receiving NIH funding for their research, and long-term partnerships with multiple health care providers and community groups that together engage the URM population of the GHC in biomedical research education and participation. The CBMHR will have an evaluation component that will monitor the progress of the CBMHR at regular intervals and provide recommendations for improvement. We believe this RCMI award will significantly strengthen and synergize biomedical research efforts at TSU and positively impact current and new collaborators/partners within TSU and other institutions to facilitate high reward research with promise of improving health outcomes for URMs in the GHC, Texas, and beyond. PROJECT NARRATIVE The Center for Biomedical and Minority Health Research (CBMHR) at Texas Southern University (TSU) aims to support basic biomedical research for diseases that disproportionately impact underrepresented minority (URM) populations and lead to burdensome morbidity and mortality among this community. The CBMHR proposes to propel studies of these diseases by providing facilities, equipment, and expertise for research studies, career enhancement programs to develop early stage investigators into thriving biomedical scientists able to secure funding for URM health research, as well as strategic community partnerships that bridge URMs with healthcare services and research throughout the Greater Houston Community.",Center for Biomedical and Minority Health Research,10145448,U54MD007605,"['Affect ', ' Award ', ' Biomedical Research ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Communicable Diseases ', ' Infectious Disease Pathway ', ' Infectious Diseases ', ' Infectious Disorder ', ' Communities ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Environment ', ' Equipment ', ' Faculty ', ' Foundations ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' Health Personnel ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' health care worker ', ' health provider ', ' health workforce ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' medical personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' Health Services Research ', ' Health Services Evaluation ', ' Medical Care Research ', ' services research ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' instrumentation ', ' Language ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methodology ', ' Mission ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Paper ', ' Legal patent ', ' Patents ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Productivity ', ' Publications ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Publishing ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Research Design ', ' Study Type ', ' study design ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Research Proposals ', ' Research Support ', ' Students ', ' Texas ', ' Training Programs ', ' Universities ', ' Vision ', ' Sight ', ' visual function ', ' Writing ', ' Afro American ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Black Populations ', ' black American ', ' African American ', ' base ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Evaluation ', ' Fostering ', ' Funding ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R01 Program ', ' Research Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Collaborations ', ' instrument ', ' programs ', ' Postdoc ', ' Research Associate ', ' post-doc ', ' post-doctoral ', ' Postdoctoral Fellow ', ' Services ', ' success ', ' research facility ', ' biomedical scientist ', ' synergism ', ' Animal Models and Related Studies ', ' model of animal ', ' model organism ', ' Animal Model ', ' novel ', ' research study ', ' Basic Research ', ' Basic Science ', ' outreach ', ' Modality ', ' career development ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Institution ', ' Address ', ' Grant Proposals ', ' Applications Grants ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' EXTMR ', ' Extramural ', ' Extramural Activities ', ' Underrepresented Ethnic Minority ', ' under-representation of minorities ', ' underrepresentation of minorities ', ' Underrepresented Minority ', ' Monitor ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' minority health ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' data acquisition ', ' HBCUs ', ' Historically Black Colleges ', ' Historically Black Institution ', ' Historically Black University ', ' Historically Black Colleges and Universities ', ' high reward ', ' Secure ', ' Faculty Education ', ' Faculty Training ', ' Teacher Education ', ' Teacher Educator ', ' Teacher Preparation ', ' Teacher Training ', ' faculty development ', ' faculty professional development ', ' instructor training ', ' teacher development ', ' Teacher Professional Development ', ' Business-Friendly Atmosphere ', ' business-friendly environment ', ' collaborative atmosphere ', ' interactive atmosphere ', ' interactive environment ', ' interdisciplinary atmosphere ', ' interdisciplinary environment ', ' peer-group atmosphere ', ' peer-group environment ', ' collaborative environment ', ' faculty research ', ' education research ', ' community partnership ', ' Scientific Inquiry ', ' healthcare service ', ' health care service ', ' minority communities ', ' Infrastructure ', ' COVID19 ', ' corona virus disease 2019 ', ' coronavirus disease 2019 ', ' COVID-19 ', ' ']",NIMHD,TEXAS SOUTHERN UNIVERSITY,U54,2020,1726423,0.04731585287287614
"Center for Clinical and Translational Sciences (CCTS) In the first awarded CTSA class, the Center for Clinical and Translational Sciences (CCTS) formed the first multiple-institution CTSA, with The University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston (UTHSC-H) and The University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center (UT MDACC). Since its inception the CCTS has been achieving the primary goal of the Clinical and Translational Sciences Award (CTSA) program: to accelerate research to transform healthcare and train the next generation of translational scientists. Our initial proposal was about bringing individuals and resources together, educating investigators, and building teams. In our 2011 renewal we described our Lowering-The-Barriers program, which focused on removing a large number of impediments through initiatives such as IRB reciprocity, standard research contracts and subcontracts, clinical data warehouses, patient registries, and biobanks. Our efforts have been successful and aligned with the national CTSA program. In this cycle, we bring in 3 new partner institutions to broaden and diversify our CTSA: The University of Texas Health Science Center at Tyler (northeast Texas, rural, economically disadvantaged), Rice University (with strengths in computer science, education, and team science), and The University of Texas Rio Grande Valley (south Texas, education and physician resources to help our nearby Brownsville Clinical Research Unit perform clinical trials). Together we will effect 5 strategic goals: Strategic Goal 1: To provide our investigators, staff, trainees, and scholars with the skills and knowledge necessary to advance discoveries and their translation in the new environment of clinical and translational research (Workforce Development). Strategic Goal 2: To collaborate with all of our stakeholders in a mutually beneficial way to advance translation by furthering engagement and team science (Collaboration/Engagement). Strategic Goal 3: To integrate pediatric and geriatric patients, Hispanic patients with cancer, and the LGBTQ+ community into the full spectrum of clinical and translational research (Integration). Strategic Goal 4: To advance translational science by providing novel processes, increasing efficiency, and streamlining research (Methods/Processes). Strategic Goal 5. To create and apply innovative informatics solutions to advance translational research, train the CTSA workforce, disseminate best practices, engage communities and integrate clinical and basic research data (Informatics).

"Border Biomedical Research Center OVERALL SUMMARY The University of Texas at El Paso (UTEP), through support from the Research Centers at Minority Institutions (RCMI) has created the Border Biomedical Research Center (BBRC) to address issues of Hispanic Health Disparities unique to the far West Texas region that we call the Borderplex. In this proposal UTEP has developed an extensive cadre of collaborators consisting of experts from regional academic, medical, and community partners with the goal to address cancer health disparities that permeate our majority Mexican American population. When combined with our sister city of Ciudad Juarez, Mexico, we represent the largest binational community in the world, with nearly 3 million people. The overall goal for this application is to develop, grow and sustain the extant infrastructure and programs of the BBRC, as well as to recruit, train, and develop cancer scientists and health practitioners to promote high quality cancer research and to translate meaningful findings back to the community. Through mentoring, pilot programs, and enhanced research infrastructure we seek to promote investigator competitiveness in acquiring extramural funding to address regional disease disparities. We also seek to generate an environment that creates pipelines for undergraduate and graduate students into biomedical careers and serves as a major point of entry for Hispanics and other underrepresented minorities into the nation’s biomedical workforce. These outcomes will be obtained through the achievement of five specific objectives which are to: (1) Contribute, to cancer research through innovative (a) basic; (b) behavioral; or (c) clinical studies within our geographically isolated and underserved Mexican American population. Increased emphasis on epidemiology and collaborations with clinical and public health specialists is within the context of the University’s mission to address the broader scope of pressing health problems in its service population. (2) Strengthen research infrastructure and, thereby, capabilities of BBRC investigators through (a) enhancement of extant multi-user core facilities for research related to proteins, DNA, cell culture, biorepository, biostatistics and bioinformatics; (3) Recruit experienced faculty members to address cancer health issues; (4) Facilitate the professional development and mentoring of BBRC investigators, including postdocs via (a) training/education, (b) pilot grant programs focusing on our cancer project themes, and through interdisciplinary research, address important health disparity issues and (5), Promote meaningful community partnerships to engage and recruit participants for research studies and augment outreach and dissemination efforts, through community events, discussions, seminars, and international symposia for our scientific professionals to share findings and best practices. Included in infrastructure enhancement are physical plant components that support research, an administrative core to carry out coordination, management and governance of program components, an evaluative component to ensure programmatic and border health objectives are achieved, and ultimately the development of new approaches to reduce cancer health disparities in our underrepresented population. PROJECT NARRATIVE The University of Texas at El Paso’s RCMI program proposes to address cancer health disparities that profoundly impact our community. We realize that only through research, the integration of scientists and medical professionals working together with the community, will we be able to address these issues. This proposal has been designed to provide an integrated approach of technical and human engagement to address cancer health disparities and move towards health equity.",Border Biomedical Research

"Genomics of HCC in the Hispanic population of Texas PROJECT SUMMARY The incidence and mortality rates of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is rapidly increasing in the United States, with the highest rates found among Hispanics in South Texas. We reported that the prevalence of cirrhosis, the main risk factor for HCC, in Hispanics in South Texas is 4-times higher than the national average and identified central obesity and diabetes as the main risk factors. The role of obesity and diabetes in liver cirrhosis in Hispanics in South Texas likely contributes to the high prevalence of HCC associated with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) in this population. The burden of NASH in this population is more substantial than predicted, affecting close to 20% of the population including children. To address the magnitude of this growing health-disparity problem, it is critically important to identify those at high risk for HCC who would benefit from surveillance and prevention strategies. HCC is a genetically heterogeneous disease and specific somatic mutations profiles are associated with different etiologies. Hispanic ethnicity and NASH etiology are critically underrepresented in HCC genomic studies. Therefore, there is a need for molecular characterization of NASH- associated HCC in Hispanics, to identify opportunities for biomarker and targeted therapy development. Because HCC somatic mutations have been detected in circulating cell free DNA (cfDNA) in patients with HCC but also in patients with pre-HCC conditions such as cirrhosis, one such opportunity is the detection in cfDNA, of selected somatic mutations for HCC risk assessment and early detection. We hypothesize that the tumor genomic landscape of HCC in Hispanics in South Texas is representative of the underlying liver diseases and environmental factors affecting this population and that selected HCC somatic mutations can be detected in plasma cfDNA at early HCC stage or prior to diagnosis and could therefore have utility in HCC risk assessment and early detection. In Aim 1, we will determine the tumor genomic landscape of NASH-associated HCC in Hispanics in South Texas and identify (if any) unique features of HCC in this population. In Aim 2, we will custom-design a targeted sequencing panel to detect with high sensitivity the most common HCC somatic mutations identified in Aim 1, in plasma cfDNA of patients with NASH-associated HCC. In Aim 3, we will determine the utility of the mutation-based model identified in Aim 2 and applied to cfDNA, in HCC risk prediction in Hispanics in South Texas using two large population-based Hispanic cohorts. This project is supported by extensive preliminary data, unique resources and a strong multidisciplinary research team. It will represent the largest genomic study of HCC associated with NASH, diabetes and obesity in an underserved population particularly affected by these chronic diseases. The project impact and translational goals are: 1) to serve the Hispanic population in South Texas, a population with health and healthcare disparities and high rates of diabetes, obesity, NASH and HCC; and 2) to develop new tests to identify, in this population, subjects at high risk for HCC and institute effective surveillance and prevention strategies, improving survival. There is an alarming increase in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) incidence in Hispanics, a trend that is affecting in particular Hispanic populations in South Texas. Public health and basic research efforts are urgently needed to understand the unique pattern of HCC in Hispanics in South Texas and reduce this disease burden. We will characterize the tumor genomic landscape of HCC in Hispanics in Texas and will identify the genomic alterations in circulating cell free DNA that best predict HCC development in Hispanic with cirrhosis.",Genomics of HCC in the Hispanic population of Texas,9878667,R01CA204665,"['Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' children ', "" childrens' "", ' youngster ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Communities ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Fibrosis ', ' Genes ', ' Geography ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Primary carcinoma of the liver cells ', ' Hepatocarcinoma ', ' Hepatocellular Carcinoma ', ' Hepatocellular cancer ', ' Hepatoma ', ' Liver Cells Carcinoma ', ' liver carcinoma ', ' Incidence ', ' Institutes ', ' Liver Cirrhosis ', ' Hepatic Cirrhosis ', ' Liver diseases ', ' Hepatic Disorder ', ' hepatic disease ', ' hepatopathy ', ' liver disorder ', ' Mexican Americans ', ' Chicanas ', ' Chicanos ', ' mortality ', ' Mutation ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic defect ', ' genome mutation ', ' Obesity ', ' adiposity ', ' corpulence ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulentia ', ' obese ', ' obese people ', ' obese person ', ' obese population ', ' Patients ', ' Plasma Cells ', ' Blood Plasma Cell ', ' Plasmacytes ', ' plasmocyte ', ' outcome forecast ', ' Prognosis ', ' Public Health ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Texas ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' County ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Latino Population ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' hispanic community ', ' Hispanics ', ' Risk Assessment ', ' Custom ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Interdisciplinary Research ', ' Multidisciplinary Collaboration ', ' Multidisciplinary Research ', ' Interdisciplinary Study ', ' Disease Progression ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Abdominal obesity ', ' Android fat distribution ', ' Centripetal obesity ', ' Fat body with thin limbs ', ' Obese face+trunk sparing limbs ', ' Obesity of face and trunk, sparing limbs ', ' Truncal obesity ', ' excess adiposity in midsection ', ' male-type obesity ', ' trunk obesity ', ' visceral obesity ', ' waist-predominant obesity ', ' Central obesity ', ' Frequencies ', ' Pattern ', ' Country ', ' disease severity ', ' Severity of illness ', ' Somatic Mutation ', ' early detection ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' cohort ', ' novel ', ' Preventative strategy ', ' Preventive strategy ', ' Prevention strategy ', ' Basic Research ', ' Basic Science ', ' population-based study ', ' population-level study ', ' studies of populations ', ' study of the population ', ' Population Study ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' Reporting ', ' Modeling ', ' Genomics ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Causality ', ' causation ', ' disease causation ', ' Etiology ', ' Address ', ' DNA Alteration ', ' DNA mutation ', ' Genetic mutation ', ' Sequence Alteration ', ' genomic alteration ', ' DNA Sequence Alteration ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' High Prevalence ', ' Mutate ', ' Catchment Area ', ' trend ', ' Molecular ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' cirrhotic ', ' Cirrhosis ', ' burden of disease ', ' disease burden ', ' years of life lost to disability ', ' years of life lost to disease ', ' burden of illness ', ' under served population ', ' underserved people ', ' Underserved Population ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Population ', ' South Texas ', ' Prevalence ', ' prospective ', ' develop therapy ', ' intervention development ', ' treatment development ', ' therapy development ', ' tumor ', ' NASH ', ' non-alcohol induced steatohepatitis ', ' non-alcoholic steato-hepatitis ', ' non-alcoholic steatohepatitis ', ' nonalcoholic steato-hepatitis ', ' nonalcoholic steatohepatitis ', ' high risk ', ' population based ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' surveillance strategy ', ' targeted drug therapy ', ' targeted drug treatments ', ' targeted therapeutic ', ' targeted therapeutic agents ', ' targeted therapy ', ' targeted treatment ', ' cell free circulating DNA ', ' cell free DNA ', ' targeted sequencing ', ' genomic profiles ', ' disparity in care ', ' disparity in healthcare ', ' healthcare disparity ', ' health care disparity ', ' genomic data-set ', ' genomic dataset ', ' genomic data ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF TX MD ANDERSON CAN CTR,R01,2020,360685,0.14848182299503035
"The Texas Resource Center on Minority Aging Research (RCMAR) ABSTRACT The overall purpose of the Texas RCMAR is to provide an infrastructure that facilitates the development of research on health and aging in minority populations with special focus on the Hispanic population in the United States as well as in Mexico. Special focus is given to mentoring researchers from underrepresented populations. The Texas RCMAR is based at the University of Texas Medical Branch with the University of Texas at Austin being the primary collaborating institution. To accomplish its objectives, the Texas RCMAR will have three cores: Administrative Core, Analysis Core, and Research Education Core. The Administrative Core will be directed by Kyriakos S. Markides, PhD, Gnitzinger Professor at the University of Texas Medical Branch (UTMB). As overall RCMAR Principal Investigator/Director, Dr. Markides will oversee and promote the activities of the other two cores. The Analysis core will be directed by Yong-Fang Kuo, PhD, Director of the UTMB Office of Biostatistics and Professor of Internal Medicine (Geriatrics) and of Preventive Medicine and Community Health. The Analysis Core will provide methodological and statistical support to promote the research and career development of minority aging investigators, especially those from underrepresented populations. The Core will interface with the Research Education Core to support Pilot research projects of mentored investigators and to participate in an annual two-day conference on minority aging to take place each September in conjunction with the annual International Conference on Aging in the Americas (ICAA) directed by Jacqueline Angel, PhD, University of Texas at Austin and member of our Research Education Core. The Research Education Core (REC) will be directed by Rebeca Wong, PhD, Kempner Professor and Director of UTMB's Pan American Health Organization Collaborating Center on Aging and Health. The REC will oversee funding of five pilot grants by minority investigators at UTMB, UT Austin and elsewhere. An effort will be made to recruit RCMAR scholars through the ICAA network of investigators conducting research on Hispanic aging in the United States and Mexico. Special emphasis will be given to providing training opportunities to Hispanic Servicing Institutions (e.g., University of Texas Pan American) and major universities in Texas with large numbers of minority/Hispanic students and faculty (e.g., Texas A&M University).
