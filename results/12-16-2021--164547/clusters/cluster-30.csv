"AFRICAN AMERICAN MENTAL HEALTH RESEARCH PROGRAM The proposed program project has stress, coping, and the adaptation of           African Americans as its central focus and reflects the strengths of             established and nw personnel of the Program for Research on Block                Americans (PRBA). Conceptually and methodologically we emphasize a               multiple level approach to the investigation of the racial, ethnic,              systemic, and cultural influences on: 1) the distribution, risk, and             protective factors relate to serious mental disorder and mental health           services use; 2) phenomenological experiences of symptoms and disorders;         and 3) diagnosis and treatment issues in community, inpatient, and               outpatient populations. Administrative and Methodological/Statistical            Cores and six interrelated substantive preliminary and pilot projects are        proposed  over a five year period. The Program Project Cores are designed        to provide administrative support, a focal set of intellectual and               research activities, and expert statistical and methodological support for       the proposed empirical projects. Each of the six studies are tied to the         central core concern of stress, coping, and adaptation among African             Americans, and inter-related, and will provide critical data for the             design and implementation of future competitive applications. Pathways and       Barriers to Mental Health Care: Linkages Between a CMHC and County Jail          will examine problems in initiating the search for help, pathways into           care, the impact of informal networks on help-seeking, and barriers to           care in two public settings: an urban community mental health center and         the psychiatric wards of a county jail. It will also explore how                 experiences with  discrimination relate to symptoms of distress and              depression. A closely related project, the Clinical Interview Process            study focuses on in-depth analyses of how race and ethnicity influence the       nature of interchanges among patients and therapists. The Stress,                Discrimination and Cortisol Response project addresses our longstanding          interest in the influences of the perceptions of inequality and racism,          and the experiences of discrimination, on the sociological, psychological        and physical stress responses of African Americans. The Blocked                  Opportunities, Persistence and Mood study proposes to utilize the same           community sample as the prior project but focuses directly on how mobility       barriers, coping and adaptation are related to depressive symptomatology         and major depression among African Americans. A conceptually related             project, Racial Identity, Coping and Adaptation, proposed a short-term           longitudinal investigation of African American college samples at HBCUs          and white institutions to examine the multi-dimensional assessment and           meaning(s) of racial identify, the relationship to process of coping and         positive and negative adaptation. The final project, Appraisal of                Religiosity, Coping and Church Support, builds on the prior proposed             projects and examines the often cited, but empirically under-studied, role       of religion, religious beliefs and religious institutional affiliation in        mental health and mental disorders among African Americans.

"Pathways to Mental Health Services Among Native Women        DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): For Native American populations, mental         disorder prevalence, distribution and subsequent treatment seeking is not well       known. Evidence from the few studies that have been published and research           underway now, however, suggests a serious disparity in the prevalence of mental      disorders for this population compared to the general US population and a very       low utilization of mental health services.                                                                                                                                Research Plan: Two complementary studies are proposed. The first is a small          qualitative investigation of illness experience and contextual factors related       to treatment seeking among Native American women with current and lifetime           psychological pathology. The second is a quantitative secondary analysis of          pathways to mental health treatment and care seeking among Native women. Both        studies aim to provide descriptive and analytic information on utilization by        type of disorder and treatment system and identify other influences on care          seeking as suggested by the Network-Episode Model theory. The research will          test models regarding the pathways into care that consider social, community         and system variables as determinants of access to treatment and provide              narratives to contextualize the results. One data set to be used for the             secondary analysis is drawn from the largest psychiatric epidemiologic, risk         and protective factors study ever conducted among Native Americans (the              SUPERPFP study N=3200).

"Management Practices as a Factor in Workplace Violence DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This revised dissertation research project application of 1 R03 OH07374-0l will investigate the influence of management practices in contributing to the increased exposure of male social workers to workplace violence. Specifically, this project will test the effect of decision-making practices, as they relate to informal risk management efforts, regarding the task assignment of clients in the workplace. Examining the assignment practices of volatile (or high-risk) mental health clients may provide additional understanding of contributors to gender disparity in occupational health hazards for social workers. This experimental study will solicit a national random sample of 1000 National Association of Social Workers (NASW) members for analysis. The sample inclusion criteria are: current membership in NASW, mental health as the primary service setting, and supervision as the primary practice function. This research addresses the following questions: (1) Does a mental health client's behavioral history significantly increase the client's likelihood of assignment to a male social worker? (2) Does a mental health client's behavioral history and a social work supervisor's gender role perception interact to significantly increase the client's likelihood of case assignment to a male social worker? (3) Does a mental health client's behavioral history and the male gender of the client interact to significantly increase the client's likelihood of case assignment to a male social worker? (4) Does a mental health client's behavioral history and gender of supervisor interact to significantly increase the client's likelihood of case assignment to a male social worker? (5) Does a mental health client's behavioral history and an organization's policy practices interact to significantly increase the client's likelihood of case assignment to a male social worker? By investigating management practices around volatile clients and testing hypotheses regarding their outcome, this study has implications for the Work Environment and Workforce priority research area of the National Occupational Research Agenda. In general, this research will help us understand mechanisms that may contribute to gender disparities in occupational health hazards within an occupation. More specifically, these findings will increase our knowledge of gender disparities in client-related violence, risk exposure of an at-risk population, supervisory practices, and organizational policy practices in mental health service settings across the nation.

"New Mexico Mental Health Mentorship /Education Program We propose to continue and to strengthen a Mentorship and Educational Program (MEP) in Mental Health Services Research at the University of New Mexico (UNM). This program began to receive NIMH funding in August 1999. Focusing on minority mental health issues in primary care settings, especially disparities in mental health outcomes, the MEP provides an intensive, one-week annual training session, which introduces mental health services research to minority junior faculty members and graduate students. The MEP also enhances ongoing mentorship relationships with outstanding mental health researchers who serve as both advisers for the trainees' research and as role models in their career development. The overall aims of the MEP are to: 1) teach trainees basic research methods in this field, with an emphasis on how to write proposals and manage funded proposals; 2) introduce trainees to important recent findings of mental health services research, with special emphasis on research concerning the disparities in mental health outcomes that affect minority populations of the Southwest; 3) establish networks among trainees and research mentors; 4) help trainees with various aspects of career development; S) produce a minority-oriented mental health services research curriculum that is exportable to other educational institutions; and 6) initiate an ongoing sequence of training sessions in mental health services research on an annual basis. Targeted participants for the MEP include the minority junior faculty members who have participated in the NIMH-funded Minority Research Infrastructure Support Program (M-RISP) at UNM, other minority faculty members at UNM, and minority trainees from other institutions in the Southwest region. Each participating trainee is matched with a mentor at UNM and/or an external mentor with whom to work during the one-week MEP session and during the following year. External faculty members, who include outstanding minority mental health services researchers able to serve as role models, teach at the MEP annual session and then act as ongoing mentors. UNM-based faculty meet with local trainees on a weekly or bi-weekly basis. We expect that the Institute will continue to develop a focus for mental health services research in New Mexico and the Southwest region and to emerge as a nationally recognized model for training of minority faculty members in mental health research at the interface with primary care.

"Young African American Males' Readiness to Seek Help    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Both cursory and in-depth reviews of the social and behavioral science literature show that studies of the helpseeking behaviors of African American males are miniscule in comparison to analyses of their poor-to-marginal health and social status in the United States. Yet, the health and help-seeking behaviors of African American men have been implicated in their higher rates of morbidity and mortality. This study, the Male African American Help-Seeking Study (MAAHS), focuses on African American males leaving the foster care system. MAAHS builds on an NIMH-funded project (1RO 1MH061404-01A1) that examines the mental health and service use of older adolescents leaving the foster care system.  Specifically, MAAHS adds a focus on the influence of stigma, mistrust, and satisfaction with prior social and mental-health services on current and subsequent use of mental health services and the readiness of African American males to seek professional help in the future. MAAHS will also explore, qualitatively, the characteristics of African American males' current and former service utilization histories that are associated with low readiness to use social and mental health services in the future.   Data on 90 African American males will be collected at two points in time. At baseline, participants will be administered a structured questionnaire that collects data about stigma, mistrust, and prior service satisfaction. A follow-up, semi-structured interview (6-months later) will collect numerical and non-numerical data about African American males' voluntary use of professional social and mental health services during the previous 6- months and their readiness to use these services in the future.  Loglinear analyses will be conducted with the quantitative data to determine whether stigma, mistrust, and prior service satisfaction is related to mental health service use and readiness. Qualitative data will be entered into QSR NU*DIST and coded based on recurrent themes from open-ended responses. Hence, this study provides an opportunity for the voices of African American males leaving foster care to inform services that are rendered to their future counterparts in the foster care system and the adult systems of mental health care that they may be accessing in the future. The resources of the Center for Mental Health Services Research and the added dimension of this RO3 study to the parent grant make this a worthy and cost-effective investigation.         ",Young African American Males' Readiness to Seek Help,6569481,R03MH067124,"['child foster care /adoption ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' health care service utilization ', ' human subject ', ' interview ', ' questionnaire ', ' mental health service ', ' longitudinal human study ', ' health behavior ', ' satisfaction ', ' psychosocial separation ', ' male ', ' African American ', ' clinical research ', ' behavioral /social science research tag ', ' health services research tag ', ' health disparity ', ' ']",NIMH,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R03,2003,76500,0.08739981224129131

"Enhancing Quality in Expanded School Mental Health DESCRIPTION:  (Provided by the Applicant) In response to PA-00-111, this application seeks to systematically enhance the quality, appropriateness and effectiveness of mental health services in schools. The last two decades in the United States have witnessed the progressive development of expanded school mental health (ESMH) programs, which provide comprehensive mental health care to youth in general and special education through partnerships between schools and community agencies. The Center for School Mental Health Assistance (CSMHA) is one of two federally funded centers to advance school-based mental health programs. Since its inception in 1995, the center has had a major focus on school mental health quality and for the past two years has been working to develop a set of 10 principles and corresponding quality indicators reflecting the vision of best practice for the ESMH field. Through a survey and interactive forums with school health, mental health and education staff nationwide the principles and quality indicators have been refined, and a quality assessment and improvement (QAI) intervention based on them has been developed. The study will involve ESMH programs in three locations: Delaware, Maryland and Texas. Within each program, through stratified random assignment we will assign ESMH clinicians in schools to either receive a systematic Quality Assessment and Improvement (QAI) intervention (targeted group: 35 clinicians in 40 schools) or receive an intervention on Staff Wellness Plus Information on the ESMH Principles (comparison group: 35 clinicians in 40 schools). In the proposed three-year study, clinicians in targeted and comparison schools will participate in the respective interventions in Years 1 and 2. Between groups (targeted versus comparison) analyses will be conducted on dependent variables of the quality of services provided by clinicians, clinician attitudes and behavior, satisfaction ratings provided by students, parents and schools staff, and student grades, attendance, lateness and discipline problems. Year 3 will focus on analyses, writing and broad dissemination of findings and lessons learned through the CSMHA's networks.

"Testing EBP and Organization Effects in Rural Appalachia DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The proposed study examines a two-level strategy for overcoming barriers to the implementation of effective mental health treatments for youth in very rural, deeply impoverished communities. The two-level strategy includes (1) the implementation of an evidence-based practice (EBP) delivered in the homes of referred youth by therapists organized to provide treatment over large, rural, geographical areas and (2) an organizational-community intervention (entitled ARC) that changes the social context in which the service is provided and supports therapists' efforts to serve children in widely-dispersed, isolated communities. The study will be conducted in eight of the poorest, least populated counties in the rural Appalachian Mountains of East Tennessee. The sample will include 720 children referred to juvenile courts in those counties as a result of antisocial behavior. Half of the children selected in each county will receive an EBP, Multisystemic Therapy (MST), and half will receive the usual care provided to children referred to juvenile courts in the eight counties. In addition, an organizational-community intervention (ARC) will be administered in half (four) of the counties by change agents (Ph.D. industrial-organizational psychologists trained in organizational and community development). The change agents will work with treatment teams, judges, school administrators, and other community opinion leaders to address the barriers to mental health care in rural Appalachia and develop community and organizational support for the implementation of the EBP. Multisystemic Therapy (MST) will be provided by Youth Villages, the state's largest private children's mental health service organization. MST services will be funded by the Bureau of TennCare, the state's Medicaid-waiver health insurance program that covers children eligible for Medicaid as well as the children of the working poor who are ineligible for Medicaid. The services are being structured and funded in a way that will ensure they can be sustained in each county, if successful, after the completion of the study.

"Stigma and PTSD in Refugee Adolescents    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The broad, long-term objective of this proposed project is to understand the relations between stigma and health outcomes in refugee children. Although stigma has been clearly linked to negative health outcomes in various populations, no work examines stigma in refugee populations. The results of this study will lay the foundation for further examination of types of stigma experienced by adolescent refugees, pathways through which stigma relates to health outcomes, and potential areas of intervention for this population. Link and Phelan (1995, 2000, 2002) posit a theoretical model in which stigma results in general social disadvantage (e.g., decreased knowledge, money, power, prestige and social connections), via discrimination. Social disadvantage, in turn, leads to a greater exposure to risk factors and decreased access to protective factors related to health outcomes. In addition, stigma directly contributes to life stress, which impacts health outcomes. This model forms the theoretical basis for examining the relations between stigma and health in refugee children. This study seeks to examine the link between stigma associated with race, religion, and mental illness, and mental health outcomes (particularly PTSD) in Somali refugee adolescents who have resettled in the U.S. It further seeks to test a theoretical model in which stigma relates to mental health problems through a variety of pathways. Social disadvantage, environmental stressors, and mental health service access will be examined as variables mediating the relationship of stigma and mental health. Specifically, this project has the following Specific Aims: 1) to examine and analyze the relations between stigma and mental health symptoms in refugee adolescents, and 2) to test a model relating stigma to mental health via social disadvantage, environmental stressors, and treatment access in refugee adolescents. The study will employ a cross-sectional design to assess 150 Somali adolescent refugees who have been resettled in the states of Massachusetts and Maine. Variables of stigma, social disadvantage, environmental stressors, service access, and mental health will be assessed, and relations between variables examined. In addition, supplementary data examining coping, social support, and social capital in relation to mental health outcomes will be examined.         ",Stigma and PTSD in Refugee Adolescents,6683762,R21MH070261,"['child psychology ', ' child behavior disorder ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' health care service availability ', ' human subject ', ' mental health ', ' mental health service ', ' social model ', ' coping ', ' depression ', ' psychosocial separation ', ' social change ', ' African ', ' racial /ethnic difference ', ' social support network ', ' religion ', ' environmental stressor ', ' posttraumatic stress disorder ', ' immigrant ', ' clinical research ', ' behavioral /social science research tag ', ' outcomes research ', ' health disparity ', ' ']",NIMH,BOSTON MEDICAL CENTER,R21,2003,161000,0.028504194164560993
"Spanish Adaptation of the BASIS Mental Health Survey    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The goal of this application is to develop a culturally and linguistically appropriate mental health assessment instrument designed to assess outcome of treatment for Spanish-speaking mental health and substance abuse service recipients. Culturally and linguistically appropriate outcome measures are especially needed to determine the presence and direction of health disparities, and to assess quality and outcomes of treatment among minority populations. The proposed research will accomplish this by adapting, translating and field testing and validating the revised Behavior and Symptom Identification Scale (BASIS-R) for use among Spanish speakers from three Spanish-speaking regions: Puerto Rico, Mexico and The Dominican Republic. Under a currently funded project (R01 MH58240) an extensive revision of the BASIS-32, a widely used consumer self-report mental health status measure, was undertaken. This application extends the currently funded work by adapting and translating the instrument for Spanish-speaking Latinos in the U.S. and Puerto Rico, and by allowing for culture-specific modules to be added to the core instrument. Specific aims are to: adapt and translate the instrument into Spanish; identify symptom and functioning domains and items that are culturally relevant to Spanish-speaking Latinos but are not included in the English version of the instrument; field test the adapted/translated instrument; and assess data quality, factor structure reliability, validity, differential item functioning and sensitivity to change for the Spanish instrument. These goals will be accomplished by using the best established methods to develop a preliminary translation. To assess content and semantic equivalence we will conduct focus groups and cognitive interviews. Analysis of the results will be used to further refine the translation for field testing. To assess technical equivalence, we will use the same format, and layout for the Spanish adaptation of the instrument as for the English. The field test of the instrument will enroll a total sample of 600 Latinos: 100 inpatients and 100 outpatients receiving treatment at each of three participating sites in Boston, Puerto Rico and Fresno. To assess criterion and conceptual equivalence, field test data will be used to assess reliability and validity of the instrument. Item Response Theory will be used to assess differential item functioning of the Spanish and English instruments. The instrument developed from this research will provide an important tool for assessing outcomes of mental health treatment among the Latino population.

"The Economics of Mental Health Disparties    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  A positive association between socio-economic status (SES) and good mental health outcomes has long been observed in many contexts. Active research continues to try to tease out answers about the direction of causality in this relationship, and about the causal mechanisms at play. This research proposes to extend this literature by exploiting the longitudinal structure of data in the 1979 cohort of the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (NLSY79). The research will provide insight into causality by testing hypotheses about temporal sequencing in the relationship between depression outcomes and income, controlling for other socio-demographic covariates, such as age, race, education and gender. This analysis will also permit the researcher to test whether the effects of economic status upon depression outcomes and vice-versa are stronger for minority sub-populations. The independent effect of local income inequality will also be tested. The proposed training component of this grant period is designed to build on the investigator's strengths as an economist by providing further exposure to recent research in mental health practice, etiology and epidemiology. This training will take the forms of courses, conferring with the primary mentors and consultants, and participation in relevant workshops in the Psychiatry Department and elsewhere in the University. Finally, the last 18 months of the grant will be devoted to developing a new research protocol on the role of time preference (i.e., impatience or delay of gratification) in determining patient demand for mental health services.

"Center for the Psychological Study of Urban Diversity This new M-RISP application builds on the existing momentum of productive newer mental health researchers/faculty members in the Department of Psychology at an Hispanic Serving Institution, California State University, Northridge (CSUN). This M-RISP award would facilitate the research careers of current newer faculty and attract qualified faculty of color to our department, which currently does not represent our 53% minority student population. CSUN's location is unique in the quality of research opportunities available in an ethnically diverse, highly populous urban region. The university strives to support research productivity by providing funding and equipment, but recent cutbacks have meant fewer research resources. This MRISP award would provide enrichment opportunities for developing projects and faculty that would complement the existing strengths of the Department. The projects proposed here represent crucial areas of mental health research -- culturally sensitive norms for neurological tests (Razani), social perception of schizophrenics (Sergi), adjustment and educational expectations in low income Latinos (Saetermoe), social psychology and mental health issues in academic adjustment (Grant/Quilici), and adjustment and engagement of elders in computer-based activities (Lagana). By providing reassigned time, payment for participants, clerical services, travel funds, equipment funds, and, most importantly, educational opportunities, this program proposes to provide developing faculty members with the resources they need to conduct state-of-the-art research and to disseminate findings while moving toward non-developmentally funded research. The educational component of this M-RISP grant includes seminars and workshops in quantitative statistics and methodology (e.g., structural equation modeling, project-specific workshops), qualitative methods and analysis (e.g., interviewing, qualitative interpretation), accompanied by weekly colloquia and workshops including faculty and student presentations of their own research, guest speakers, library informational workshops, data base workshops, and a variety of other enrichment activities.

"New Mexico Mental Health Mentorship /Education Program We propose to continue and to strengthen a Mentorship and Educational Program (MEP) in Mental Health Services Research at the University of New Mexico (UNM). This program began to receive NIMH funding in August 1999. Focusing on minority mental health issues in primary care settings, especially disparities in mental health outcomes, the MEP provides an intensive, one-week annual training session, which introduces mental health services research to minority junior faculty members and graduate students. The MEP also enhances ongoing mentorship relationships with outstanding mental health researchers who serve as both advisers for the trainees' research and as role models in their career development. The overall aims of the MEP are to: 1) teach trainees basic research methods in this field, with an emphasis on how to write proposals and manage funded proposals; 2) introduce trainees to important recent findings of mental health services research, with special emphasis on research concerning the disparities in mental health outcomes that affect minority populations of the Southwest; 3) establish networks among trainees and research mentors; 4) help trainees with various aspects of career development; S) produce a minority-oriented mental health services research curriculum that is exportable to other educational institutions; and 6) initiate an ongoing sequence of training sessions in mental health services research on an annual basis. Targeted participants for the MEP include the minority junior faculty members who have participated in the NIMH-funded Minority Research Infrastructure Support Program (M-RISP) at UNM, other minority faculty members at UNM, and minority trainees from other institutions in the Southwest region. Each participating trainee is matched with a mentor at UNM and/or an external mentor with whom to work during the one-week MEP session and during the following year. External faculty members, who include outstanding minority mental health services researchers able to serve as role models, teach at the MEP annual session and then act as ongoing mentors. UNM-based faculty meet with local trainees on a weekly or bi-weekly basis. We expect that the Institute will continue to develop a focus for mental health services research in New Mexico and the Southwest region and to emerge as a nationally recognized model for training of minority faculty members in mental health research at the interface with primary care.

"Pathways to Mental Health Services Among Native Women        DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): For Native American populations, mental         disorder prevalence, distribution and subsequent treatment seeking is not well       known. Evidence from the few studies that have been published and research           underway now, however, suggests a serious disparity in the prevalence of mental      disorders for this population compared to the general US population and a very       low utilization of mental health services.                                                                                                                                Research Plan: Two complementary studies are proposed. The first is a small          qualitative investigation of illness experience and contextual factors related       to treatment seeking among Native American women with current and lifetime           psychological pathology. The second is a quantitative secondary analysis of          pathways to mental health treatment and care seeking among Native women. Both        studies aim to provide descriptive and analytic information on utilization by        type of disorder and treatment system and identify other influences on care          seeking as suggested by the Network-Episode Model theory. The research will          test models regarding the pathways into care that consider social, community         and system variables as determinants of access to treatment and provide              narratives to contextualize the results. One data set to be used for the             secondary analysis is drawn from the largest psychiatric epidemiologic, risk         and protective factors study ever conducted among Native Americans (the              SUPERPFP study N=3200). The other data set is from the candidates own study of       the same variables drawn from Native women in a primary care setting (Mental         Health and Abuse Among Native Women in Primary Care N=234)                                                                                                                Career Development Program: This study will be conducted within the broader          context of an expert-led training program. The proposed 5-year course of study       includes instruction in advanced quantitative research design and statistical        methods, multi-level and mixed method approaches, psychiatric nosology, and the      operationalization of theory in pathways to mental health care research. The         ultimate goal of this revised Career Development Award is for the candidate to       have the skills, knowledge, and experience to teach and conduct rigorous,            culturally competent mental health services research for Native Americans and        other culturally distinct groups.

"Shortage of Health Professionals in Rural Areas DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  An ongoing challenge to the provision of state of the science, empirically tested mental health interventions in rural areas is a shortage of mental health and general health care professionals. The lack of specialty mental health professionals in many rural areas is compounded by the current registered nurse shortage, which is predicted to worsen. More daunting is the lack of providers with adequate training in the provision of culturally relevant care as well as the small number of mental health providers of different minority race and ethnic populations. The shortages of these professionals may result in the absence of care, the provision of substandard care, poor consumer outcomes, the lack of culturally acceptable care and, ultimately,  in negative health for the community. Using existing data we will evaluate the impact of having different amounts and mixes of professionals on public health and utilization types of outcomes. We will:    1) determine the influence of community characteristics including race, poverty and rurality on the availability of different types of mental health professionals; 2) evaluate the relationship between current and proposed numbers of professionals, the need for culturally relevant mental health care and the outcomes of mental health care; and 3) propose better methods for determining a shortage of mental health professionals (e.g. HPSA's). Products of the research will include a CD with information on the nation, states', and counties' mental health workforce. This data will be available for use in planning by policy-makers and for use in other research studies. The study will provide both improved data and improved methods to create and evaluate different definitions of Mental Health Shortage Areas. According to the Health Resources and Services Administration more than 34 federal programs depend on the shortage designation to determine eligibility or as a funding reference (HRSA, 2002). This study will provide improved accuracy to these important designations which influence eligibility for participation in federal programs, loan repayment for the National Health Service Corps and financial incentives to providers for caring for Medicare clients residing in these designated areas.

"Minority Undergraduate MH Research Training Program DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  In accordance with the goals of the NIMH Mental Health Education Program, Project L/EARN recruits members of ethnic and cultural groups traditionally under-represented in mental health related graduate programs, with the intent of increasing the number of minority researchers in the mental health field. Project L/EARN is a program of the multi-disciplinary Institute for Health, Health Care Policy and Aging Research (the Institute) at Rutgers University. Project L/EARN provides scientific training, experience and guidance to make undergraduate members of underrepresented groups successful candidates for admission to relevant graduate programs in mental health research.  By increasing the number of well-trained undergraduates from underrepresented groups applying to graduate programs, Project L/EARN addresses the lack of diversity among health researchers. By providing sound training in statistics, sampling and study design we insure they will excel both in graduate training and as contributing members of the mental health research community. Our goal has been to increase the number of minority applicants to mental health related graduate programs through timely intervention early in the college experience while many students are exploring career options. The summer training component of Project L/EARN consists of a highly structured ten-week experience. During the first eight weeks, the program provides six hours of daily instruction in the principles of scientific inquiry including study design, methods of data collection, techniques of data management and statistical analysis, and fundamentals of statistical package programming. An instructor introduces the students to these topics in morning workshops. Teaching assistants reinforce the morning lessons in supervised homework sessions that meet in the afternoon. The instructor and teaching assistants are all Project L/EARN graduates. Faculty dedicate considerable time to Project L/EARN, providing guest lectures on a broad range of research issues, and serving as mentors. Each intern undertakes an independent research project under the guidance of their faculty mentor, and nightly reading assignments provide a broad foundation in current mental health research. The student poster session and oral presentations provide the opportunity for the interns to present their research projects, demonstrating the integration of the statistical, analytical and substantive issues.

"Mental Health Treatment for Rural Poor and Minorities DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This three-year study will provide a comprehensive, nationally representative, description of rural mental health care, including access to care, patterns of treatment, and outcomes of care. The study will focus on understanding the particular problems faced by rural African Americans and Mexican Americans, women, and the poor in obtaining mental health treatment. We also will evaluate these relationships using guideline-concordant care as the standard for those with depressive and anxiety disorders. The Behavioral Model of Utilization is used as a framework to understand the complex relationship among environmental factors, population characteristics, services use, and outcomes. The proposed research is organized around three specific aims. First, we will describe variation in the likelihood of mental health treatment with respect to residential, ethnic minority status, poverty, and gender. Our second aim is to understand the role of access in explaining variation in mental health treatment with respect to residential, ethnic minority status, poverty, and gender status. Finally, our third aim is to examine the effect of treatment for depression and anxiety on several outcomes for adults, and parental treatment on child outcomes. Our analysis will use data from four panels of the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS) supplemented with information from the National Health Interview Survey. A strength of the proposed research is its use of county-level measures of rurality. Pooled across four years, the MEPS includes approximately 10,000 respondents residing in non-metropolitan areas, offering a unique opportunity to understand variation in mental health treatment across rural subpopulations. The availability of detailed medical histories will allow us to examine use of mental health services over a 2 1/2 year period. The populations studied, ethnic minorities and rural residents, are priority areas for the National Institute of Mental Health. By addressing the pressing need to reduce disparities in mental health care, our research will inform mental health policy with regard to services delivery systems for rural impoverished and minority populations.

"M-RISP at San Diego State University DESCRIPTION (Provided by applicant): Approval of the proposed M-RISP grant would come at a critical time for the development of mental health-related research at San Diego State University (SDSU). Because the faculty is aging and the student body is growing, 50 percent of the faculty will be newly hired within the next 5 years. The SDSU administration is dedicated to developing strength in mental health research to match the strength that has already been developed in biological sciences. An M-RISP program at SDSU would build on the strength of an existing joint doctoral program in clinical psychology with University of California, San Diego (UCSD) that was begun in 1985. The M-RISP program at SDSU would be dedicated to promoting and supporting multidisciplinary research in mental health. Program activities will focus on: 1) increasing research collaborations among faculty members at SDSU and research-intensive institutions; 2) establishing national and international faculty networks for mental health research; 3) seeking and obtaining R01-level extramural funding; and 4) increasing faculty research productivity, as indicated by peer-reviewed presentations and publications. The faculty would obtain release time through the grant, matched by the university, and several minority students would be supported and provide the faculty with assistance. A systematic and extensive plan for educating both M-RISP faculty and students about high-quality mental health research is planned, with the help of collaborators from UCSD. In addition, four Independent Investigator projects associated with the M-RISP core are proposed and include: studies examining social exclusion, emotion regulation, self-control, and impulsive behavior, stress in the work place, basic research on perceptual categorizations, and examining self-esteem among minority and majority groups. All four of the independent investigators will focus on disparities. The SDSU administration is dedicated to the program and has committed matching funds and its full support to the M-RISP program. SDSU has submitted a application for a Career Opportunities in Research (COR) grant with whose activities the M-RISP activities will be closely coordinated if both are funded.

"M-RISP at San Francisco State University    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  San Francisco State University (SFSU) requests funds for the renewal, continuation and expansion of our highly successful M-RISP program, currently in the second year of its initial three-year funding. The goal of the program is to enhance the institutional capacity of SFSU by conducting mental health research projects that are responsive to NIMH priorities and can potentially be funded through regular R01 and R03 mechanisms. Situated within an academic institution committed to ethnic diversity and responsive to the needs of ethnic minority communities, our M-RISP program emphasizes research that addresses mental health disparities among ethnic minority groups in the United States. In addition, we aim to increase the number of ethnic minority Principal Investigators funded by NIMH. To achieve these goals, we propose to conduct a set of faculty mentoring, networking, and institutional development activities, many of which have been piloted successfully within our current M-RISP program, including the implementation of structured ""proposal development groups"" and methodological/statistical workshops. Through intramural competitions, we will select 12 junior faculty members and mentor them in the development of mental health research proposals to be submitted extramurally. We will also support the implementation of four new individual faculty projects that address mental health concerns in African American, Latino,  Asian and Native American populations. The results obtained from these four projects will be incorporated as preliminary studies in future R01 submissions by the four investigators.      All activities will be conducted under the direction of Dr. Rafael Diaz, M-RISP Program Director, a developmental psychologist whose research has been funded by different institutes at NIH for the past 10 years.

"Stigma and PTSD in Refugee Adolescents    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The broad, long-term objective of this proposed project is to understand the relations between stigma and health outcomes in refugee children. Although stigma has been clearly linked to negative health outcomes in various populations, no work examines stigma in refugee populations. The results of this study will lay the foundation for further examination of types of stigma experienced by adolescent refugees, pathways through which stigma relates to health outcomes, and potential areas of intervention for this population. Link and Phelan (1995, 2000, 2002) posit a theoretical model in which stigma results in general social disadvantage (e.g., decreased knowledge, money, power, prestige and social connections), via discrimination. Social disadvantage, in turn, leads to a greater exposure to risk factors and decreased access to protective factors related to health outcomes. In addition, stigma directly contributes to life stress, which impacts health outcomes. This model forms the theoretical basis for examining the relations between stigma and health in refugee children. This study seeks to examine the link between stigma associated with race, religion, and mental illness, and mental health outcomes (particularly PTSD) in Somali refugee adolescents who have resettled in the U.S. It further seeks to test a theoretical model in which stigma relates to mental health problems through a variety of pathways. Social disadvantage, environmental stressors, and mental health service access will be examined as variables mediating the relationship of stigma and mental health. Specifically, this project has the following Specific Aims: 1) to examine and analyze the relations between stigma and mental health symptoms in refugee adolescents, and 2) to test a model relating stigma to mental health via social disadvantage, environmental stressors, and treatment access in refugee adolescents. The study will employ a cross-sectional design to assess 150 Somali adolescent refugees who have been resettled in the states of Massachusetts and Maine. Variables of stigma, social disadvantage, environmental stressors, service access, and mental health will be assessed, and relations between variables examined. In addition, supplementary data examining coping, social support, and social capital in relation to mental health outcomes will be examined.         ",Stigma and PTSD in Refugee Adolescents,6784731,R21MH070261,"['child psychology ', ' child behavior disorder ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' health care service availability ', ' human subject ', ' mental health ', ' mental health service ', ' social model ', ' coping ', ' depression ', ' psychosocial separation ', ' social change ', ' African ', ' racial /ethnic difference ', ' social support network ', ' religion ', ' environmental stressor ', ' posttraumatic stress disorder ', ' immigrant ', ' clinical research ', ' behavioral /social science research tag ', ' outcomes research ', ' health disparity ', ' ']",NIMH,BOSTON MEDICAL CENTER,R21,2004,161000,0.028504194164560993
"Spanish Adaptation of the BASIS Mental Health Survey    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The goal of this application is to develop a culturally and linguistically appropriate mental health assessment instrument designed to assess outcome of treatment for Spanish-speaking mental health and substance abuse service recipients. Culturally and linguistically appropriate outcome measures are especially needed to determine the presence and direction of health disparities, and to assess quality and outcomes of treatment among minority populations. The proposed research will accomplish this by adapting, translating and field testing and validating the revised Behavior and Symptom Identification Scale (BASIS-R) for use among Spanish speakers from three Spanish-speaking regions: Puerto Rico, Mexico and The Dominican Republic. Under a currently funded project (R01 MH58240) an extensive revision of the BASIS-32, a widely used consumer self-report mental health status measure, was undertaken. This application extends the currently funded work by adapting and translating the instrument for Spanish-speaking Latinos in the U.S. and Puerto Rico, and by allowing for culture-specific modules to be added to the core instrument. Specific aims are to: adapt and translate the instrument into Spanish; identify symptom and functioning domains and items that are culturally relevant to Spanish-speaking Latinos but are not included in the English version of the instrument; field test the adapted/translated instrument; and assess data quality, factor structure reliability, validity, differential item functioning and sensitivity to change for the Spanish instrument. These goals will be accomplished by using the best established methods to develop a preliminary translation. To assess content and semantic equivalence we will conduct focus groups and cognitive interviews. Analysis of the results will be used to further refine the translation for field testing. To assess technical equivalence, we will use the same format, and layout for the Spanish adaptation of the instrument as for the English. The field test of the instrument will enroll a total sample of 600 Latinos: 100 inpatients and 100 outpatients receiving treatment at each of three participating sites in Boston, Puerto Rico and Fresno. To assess criterion and conceptual equivalence, field test data will be used to assess reliability and validity of the instrument. Item Response Theory will be used to assess differential item functioning of the Spanish and English instruments. The instrument developed from this research will provide an important tool for assessing outcomes of mental health treatment among the Latino population.

"New Mexico Mental Health Mentorship /Education Program We propose to continue and to strengthen a Mentorship and Educational Program (MEP) in Mental Health Services Research at the University of New Mexico (UNM). This program began to receive NIMH funding in August 1999. Focusing on minority mental health issues in primary care settings, especially disparities in mental health outcomes, the MEP provides an intensive, one-week annual training session, which introduces mental health services research to minority junior faculty members and graduate students. The MEP also enhances ongoing mentorship relationships with outstanding mental health researchers who serve as both advisers for the trainees' research and as role models in their career development. The overall aims of the MEP are to: 1) teach trainees basic research methods in this field, with an emphasis on how to write proposals and manage funded proposals; 2) introduce trainees to important recent findings of mental health services research, with special emphasis on research concerning the disparities in mental health outcomes that affect minority populations of the Southwest; 3) establish networks among trainees and research mentors; 4) help trainees with various aspects of career development; S) produce a minority-oriented mental health services research curriculum that is exportable to other educational institutions; and 6) initiate an ongoing sequence of training sessions in mental health services research on an annual basis. Targeted participants for the MEP include the minority junior faculty members who have participated in the NIMH-funded Minority Research Infrastructure Support Program (M-RISP) at UNM, other minority faculty members at UNM, and minority trainees from other institutions in the Southwest region. Each participating trainee is matched with a mentor at UNM and/or an external mentor with whom to work during the one-week MEP session and during the following year. External faculty members, who include outstanding minority mental health services researchers able to serve as role models, teach at the MEP annual session and then act as ongoing mentors. UNM-based faculty meet with local trainees on a weekly or bi-weekly basis. We expect that the Institute will continue to develop a focus for mental health services research in New Mexico and the Southwest region and to emerge as a nationally recognized model for training of minority faculty members in mental health research at the interface with primary care.

"Shortage of Health Professionals in Rural Areas DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  An ongoing challenge to the provision of state of the science, empirically tested mental health interventions in rural areas is a shortage of mental health and general health care professionals. The lack of specialty mental health professionals in many rural areas is compounded by the current registered nurse shortage, which is predicted to worsen. More daunting is the lack of providers with adequate training in the provision of culturally relevant care as well as the small number of mental health providers of different minority race and ethnic populations. The shortages of these professionals may result in the absence of care, the provision of substandard care, poor consumer outcomes, the lack of culturally acceptable care and, ultimately,  in negative health for the community. Using existing data we will evaluate the impact of having different amounts and mixes of professionals on public health and utilization types of outcomes. We will:    1) determine the influence of community characteristics including race, poverty and rurality on the availability of different types of mental health professionals; 2) evaluate the relationship between current and proposed numbers of professionals, the need for culturally relevant mental health care and the outcomes of mental health care; and 3) propose better methods for determining a shortage of mental health professionals (e.g. HPSA's). Products of the research will include a CD with information on the nation, states', and counties' mental health workforce. This data will be available for use in planning by policy-makers and for use in other research studies. The study will provide both improved data and improved methods to create and evaluate different definitions of Mental Health Shortage Areas. According to the Health Resources and Services Administration more than 34 federal programs depend on the shortage designation to determine eligibility or as a funding reference (HRSA, 2002). This study will provide improved accuracy to these important designations which influence eligibility for participation in federal programs, loan repayment for the National Health Service Corps and financial incentives to providers for caring for Medicare clients residing in these designated areas.

"Pathways to Mental Health Services Among Native Women        DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): For Native American populations, mental         disorder prevalence, distribution and subsequent treatment seeking is not well       known. Evidence from the few studies that have been published and research           underway now, however, suggests a serious disparity in the prevalence of mental      disorders for this population compared to the general US population and a very       low utilization of mental health services.                                                                                                                                Research Plan: Two complementary studies are proposed. The first is a small          qualitative investigation of illness experience and contextual factors related       to treatment seeking among Native American women with current and lifetime           psychological pathology. The second is a quantitative secondary analysis of          pathways to mental health treatment and care seeking among Native women. Both        studies aim to provide descriptive and analytic information on utilization by        type of disorder and treatment system and identify other influences on care          seeking as suggested by the Network-Episode Model theory. The research will          test models regarding the pathways into care that consider social, community         and system variables as determinants of access to treatment and provide              narratives to contextualize the results. One data set to be used for the             secondary analysis is drawn from the largest psychiatric epidemiologic, risk         and protective factors study ever conducted among Native Americans (the              SUPERPFP study N=3200). The other data set is from the candidates own study of       the same variables drawn from Native women in a primary care setting (Mental         Health and Abuse Among Native Women in Primary Care N=234)                                                                                                                Career Development Program: This study will be conducted within the broader          context of an expert-led training program. The proposed 5-year course of study       includes instruction in advanced quantitative research design and statistical        methods, multi-level and mixed method approaches, psychiatric nosology, and the      operationalization of theory in pathways to mental health care research. The         ultimate goal of this revised Career Development Award is for the candidate to       have the skills, knowledge, and experience to teach and conduct rigorous,            culturally competent mental health services research for Native Americans and        other culturally distinct groups.

"Enhancing Quality in Expanded School Mental Health DESCRIPTION:  (Provided by the Applicant) In response to PA-00-111, this application seeks to systematically enhance the quality, appropriateness and effectiveness of mental health services in schools. The last two decades in the United States have witnessed the progressive development of expanded school mental health (ESMH) programs, which provide comprehensive mental health care to youth in general and special education through partnerships between schools and community agencies. The Center for School Mental Health Assistance (CSMHA) is one of two federally funded centers to advance school-based mental health programs. Since its inception in 1995, the center has had a major focus on school mental health quality and for the past two years has been working to develop a set of 10 principles and corresponding quality indicators reflecting the vision of best practice for the ESMH field. Through a survey and interactive forums with school health, mental health and education staff nationwide the principles and quality indicators have been refined, and a quality assessment and improvement (QAI) intervention based on them has been developed. The study will involve ESMH programs in three locations: Delaware, Maryland and Texas. Within each program, through stratified random assignment we will assign ESMH clinicians in schools to either receive a systematic Quality Assessment and Improvement (QAI) intervention (targeted group: 35 clinicians in 40 schools) or receive an intervention on Staff Wellness Plus Information on the ESMH Principles (comparison group: 35 clinicians in 40 schools). In the proposed three-year study, clinicians in targeted and comparison schools will participate in the respective interventions in Years 1 and 2. Between groups (targeted versus comparison) analyses will be conducted on dependent variables of the quality of services provided by clinicians, clinician attitudes and behavior, satisfaction ratings provided by students, parents and schools staff, and student grades, attendance, lateness and discipline problems. Year 3 will focus on analyses, writing and broad dissemination of findings and lessons learned through the CSMHA's networks.

"Ethnic Minority Children in Public Mental Health DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Racial/ethnic disparities in access and quality of mental health care are well documented among adults. Parallel differences affect minority children and youth. The proposed study seeks to document minority-white disparities in psychiatric crisis care and to explain them as reflecting differential access to community-based services. It takes a cross-sectional, longitudinal (1998-2001) perspective of the 57 autonomous county-level mental health programs responsible for Medicaid mental health services in the ethnically diverse state of California. Specific questions are: Do African American, Latino, and Asian American children and youth experience more crisis-related care than whites as measured by hospital-based crisis stabilization and clinic-based crisis intervention visits? Are ethnic disparities in crisis care more pronounced for children in the community than for those in foster care, i.e. does placement in foster care, with its associated monitoring and referral for mental health problems, decrease disparities in crisis care? Are ethnic disparities in crisis care affected by differences in use of linkage-brokerage and outpatient care? Secondary data come from California Department of Mental Health Medi-Cal claims files. Primary data are collected and coded from annual state-county contracts and compliance reviews. Data are organized as client-level observations embedded within county systems observed annually over the 3-year period. We build models of client-level ethnic disparities in crisis use and remove any confounding county-level variation through the use of fixed effects, or through direct specification of county characteristics when they vary both longitudinally and cross-sectionally. Dependent variables, measuring the two types of crisis care use -- crisis stabilization and intervention -- are specified in separate models as the probability of any use (0, 1), and if used, the level of use (# of visits). Main independent variables are categorical (0, 1) variables representing the client's ethnicity. The magnitude and direction of the ethnicity coefficients will reveal the level of ethnic disparities in crisis use. We assess relationships between crisis care use, ethnicity and foster care status by entering foster care categorical variables and observing their effect on the ethnic variables' coefficients. Similarly, we test the effect of clients' outpatient/linkage-brokerage use on ethnic disparities in crisis care use.

"Economics of Racial & Ethnic Disparities in MH Services    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The mechanisms that generate racial/ethnic disparities in health care operate at two levels: the healthcare system, and the clinical encounter. This application proposes to conduct research on the mechanisms that lead to racial/ethnic disparities in mental health services. Disparities, defined formally in the application, are essentially unjustified differences in the rates of use of health care services across groups. Recent theoretical and conceptual research provides the frameworks for empirical analyses of the reasons behind disparities. This application proposes to apply and test these frameworks for the purposes of informing policy about effective actions to combat disparities. We bring together a multidisciplinary team to conduct a series of integrated empirical and policy studies using previously collected data. The proposed research capitalizes on NIMH investments in data with large numbers of members of racial and ethnic minorities to make progress on understanding and reducing mental health care disparities. The specific aims of the application are: Operationalize the recently proposed Institute of Medicine definition of disparities using a large national data set to distinguish among Differences, Disparities and Discrimination when comparing mental health care for minority and majority populations. Quantify disparities in mental health, and identify the role of system factors and discrimination in mental health services disparities. Compare mental health care use by African Americans, Asian Americans and Latinos with use by Whites.   Investigate provider-side mechanisms explaining discrimination in the clinical encounter using data from the Quality Improvement for Depression (QID) projects. Test whether ""statistical discrimination"" can account for some of racial/ethnic differences in diagnosis and treatment recommendations for African-American and Latino populations. Test for evidence that patient reaction to provider discrimination leads to lower compliance rates and worse outcomes for these minorities.         ",Economics of Racial & Ethnic Disparities in MH Services,6670050,R01MH068260,"['health care service utilization ', ' health economics ', ' statistics /biometry ', ' mental health service ', ' mathematical model ', ' Asian American ', ' African American ', ' Hispanic American ', ' caucasian American ', ' racial /ethnic difference ', ' human data ', ' clinical research ', ' outcomes research ', ' medically underserved population ', ' health disparity ', ' ']",NIMH,HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL,R01,2004,394182,0.09842029240462781
"M-RISP at San Diego State University DESCRIPTION (Provided by applicant): Approval of the proposed M-RISP grant would come at a critical time for the development of mental health-related research at San Diego State University (SDSU). Because the faculty is aging and the student body is growing, 50 percent of the faculty will be newly hired within the next 5 years. The SDSU administration is dedicated to developing strength in mental health research to match the strength that has already been developed in biological sciences. An M-RISP program at SDSU would build on the strength of an existing joint doctoral program in clinical psychology with University of California, San Diego (UCSD) that was begun in 1985. The M-RISP program at SDSU would be dedicated to promoting and supporting multidisciplinary research in mental health. Program activities will focus on: 1) increasing research collaborations among faculty members at SDSU and research-intensive institutions; 2) establishing national and international faculty networks for mental health research; 3) seeking and obtaining R01-level extramural funding; and 4) increasing faculty research productivity, as indicated by peer-reviewed presentations and publications. The faculty would obtain release time through the grant, matched by the university, and several minority students would be supported and provide the faculty with assistance. A systematic and extensive plan for educating both M-RISP faculty and students about high-quality mental health research is planned, with the help of collaborators from UCSD. In addition, four Independent Investigator projects associated with the M-RISP core are proposed and include: studies examining social exclusion, emotion regulation, self-control, and impulsive behavior, stress in the work place, basic research on perceptual categorizations, and examining self-esteem among minority and majority groups. All four of the independent investigators will focus on disparities. The SDSU administration is dedicated to the program and has committed matching funds and its full support to the M-RISP program. SDSU has submitted a application for a Career Opportunities in Research (COR) grant with whose activities the M-RISP activities will be closely coordinated if both are funded.

"Mental Health Treatment for Rural Poor and Minorities DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This three-year study will provide a comprehensive, nationally representative, description of rural mental health care, including access to care, patterns of treatment, and outcomes of care. The study will focus on understanding the particular problems faced by rural African Americans and Mexican Americans, women, and the poor in obtaining mental health treatment. We also will evaluate these relationships using guideline-concordant care as the standard for those with depressive and anxiety disorders. The Behavioral Model of Utilization is used as a framework to understand the complex relationship among environmental factors, population characteristics, services use, and outcomes. The proposed research is organized around three specific aims. First, we will describe variation in the likelihood of mental health treatment with respect to residential, ethnic minority status, poverty, and gender. Our second aim is to understand the role of access in explaining variation in mental health treatment with respect to residential, ethnic minority status, poverty, and gender status. Finally, our third aim is to examine the effect of treatment for depression and anxiety on several outcomes for adults, and parental treatment on child outcomes. Our analysis will use data from four panels of the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS) supplemented with information from the National Health Interview Survey. A strength of the proposed research is its use of county-level measures of rurality. Pooled across four years, the MEPS includes approximately 10,000 respondents residing in non-metropolitan areas, offering a unique opportunity to understand variation in mental health treatment across rural subpopulations. The availability of detailed medical histories will allow us to examine use of mental health services over a 2 1/2 year period. The populations studied, ethnic minorities and rural residents, are priority areas for the National Institute of Mental Health. By addressing the pressing need to reduce disparities in mental health care, our research will inform mental health policy with regard to services delivery systems for rural impoverished and minority populations.

"Providing Mental Health Care in Community Health Centers DESCRIPTION (provided by the applicant): The goal of this qualitative study is to better understand primary care clinicians' approaches to providing mental health care for socially and economically disadvantaged adult patients with chronic disease who receive their care in community health centers (CHCs).  With evidence that mental illness increases symptom burden, functional impairment and medical costs, and impedes self-management efforts in people with chronic disease, recognition and management of mental disorders in these patients constitutes an important component of their care. While a large proportion of mental disorders continue to be unrecognized in the U.S. population, evidence shows that socially and economically disadvantaged patients are at greatest risk for non-recognition and inappropriate treatment. Recognition of mental disorders and associated diagnostic decisions are complicated by sociocultural, economic and environmental factors affecting people from culturally diverse backgrounds and those living in poverty, as well as by the co-existence of physical and psychological signs and symptoms. Providing integrated physical and mental health care is thus especially challenging for CHC primary care clinicians whose patients are not only affected by these factors but who also tend to have poorer physical and mental health than the general population.  This study uses observation in CHC settings and multiple interview techniques to accomplish two specific aims focused on CHC clinicians' recognition, interpretation and responses to patient psychosocial issues in the context of chronic disease management. These aims are to: 1) Describe how CHC clinicians frame the psychosocial concerns of and structure the provision of mental health care to patients with chronic disease; and 2) Identify factors that influence CHC clinicians' beliefs, attitudes and clinical decisions in providing mental health care to these patients. The proposal addresses two important areas for improving health care for patients with chronic illness: 1) identification and management of mental illness; and 2) attention to the unique needs of socially and economically disadvantaged patients with chronic illness.

"Center for Research on Mental Health in Social Services    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  In response to the ACISR Program Announcement, we propose to establish the Center for Research to Improve Mental Health Care in the Social Services (C-RIMSS). Our research agenda addresses quality of mental health care in settings with the highest potential to reduce racial and ethnic disparities. Studies will be conducted in social service agencies, where prevalence of mental disorder is high and vulnerable of clients predominate. A cultural exchange perspective informs our work at the mental health-social service intersect, and across the academic-practice divide. Through the work of seven units, our Operations Core will provide an infrastructure for research, methodological advances, and partnerships with community agencies. The Principal Research Core will support pilot studies to address three aims: (1) understand quality of care for mental disorder in the social services from stakeholder perspective; (2) assess practice variation in quality of care for mental disorder and identify provider, client, and system ecostructure and economic influences on that variation; and (3) working ""trench to bench and back to trench,"" test a menu of quality improvements for mental health care in the social services. The Research Methods Core's two units--Qualitative Methods and Statistical Analysis -- will provide ongoing, state of the art support to investigators. The RMC will support projects and provide consultation for stakeholder preference assessment, quality indicators, and organizational research methods. Our outcomes will include completed pilot projects, generation of RO 1, R21, or R34 studies, scientific publications, strengthened agency partnerships and infrastructure for research, and dissemination of findings to academic and stakeholder networks. Improving mental health care to social service clients can increase treatment to persons whose disorder currently goes undetected, improve the quality of evidence-based care to those who are now served poorly, and reduce racial/ethnic disparities in care. Our research agenda is responsive to the recommendation of the President's New Freedom Commission Report on Mental Health to improve the response to mental disorder in readily accessible and low-stigma settings where a high level of risk for mental health problems exists, especially all federally-funded health and human services.

"Developing Minority Mental Health Research at TSU    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This proposal seeks to renew a M-RISP Development Center (for five years) with the goal of enhancing the research infrastructure at Tennessee State University and its institutional capacity to conduct high-quality, multidisciplinary behavioral science research in minority mental health. Specifically, the M-RISP Development Center will continue to implement two types of training in mental health research at Tennessee State University: (a) faculty research development, and (b) training of students. This proposal builds on the progress made during the past three years (including two funded individual investigator projects) and expands the Center activities to be more multidisciplinary and encompass more faculty researchers and students. The proposed activities during the second cycle of MRISP will further develop the University's ability to compete for investigator-initiated extramural research funding. The specific aims of the Center are: (1) Enhance the University infrastructure (including the Administrative Division) to facilitate expansion of the M-RISP Development Center faculty training activities; (2) Maintain the Research Division at the Center to provide assistance and support for the implementation of research projects and development of new fundable projects by junior faculty; (3) Utilize and expand the existing databases at the Center For Health Research for use by junior faculty to develop new research ideas and hypothesis testing; and (4) Train students in mental health research through 'hands-on' experience as assistants on funded faculty-led projects. This proposal consists of two parts: (A) the Institutional Research Development Core, and (B) three Individual Faculty Research Projects. All three projects complement the Center's guiding theme of minority mental health and race disparities in health using a conceptual framework of community-based research. Success of the Center will be measured in terms of the number of junior faculty and students trained, research presentations, peer reviewed publications, and investigator-initiated proposals submitted to NIMH and other funding agencies in the area of mental health.

"Culturally Responsive Person-Centered Care for Psychosis    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Patient-centered care has become increasingly important over the past several decades, though the translation of these principles into clinical practices that customize care on an individual basis have been markedly inconsistent. This gap between principles and practices is especially evident in the context of public sector care for people with psychosis. As documented thoroughly in the Surgeon General's recent report Mental Health: Culture, Race, and Ethnicity (2001), the disenfranchisement of adults with psychosis is further accentuated among ethnic/racial minority communities in urban environments.  The proposed study addresses these health disparities through qualitative and experimental evaluations of two complementary approaches to culturally responsive person-centered care for psychosis. The study has the following three specific aims: 1) to describe perceived barriers to, and benefits of, processes of help-seeking, participation in psychiatric care, and illness self-management efforts among low-income adults of color being treated for psychosis; 2) to evaluate the effectiveness of a facilitated approach to person-centered care with and without the augmentation of a community integration program in increasing customization of care over a 6 and 18-month period of outpatient treatment. Primary outcomes of person centered care are hypothesized to be increases in illness self-management and satisfaction with services, and secondary outcomes to be decreased symptoms and enhanced clinical and functional status and quality of life; and 3) to test a theoretical model that stipulates relationships between ethnic identity, community resources, and degree of cultural responsiveness and collaboration present in relationships between patients and outpatient mental health providers in mediating customization of care among an urban population of low-income adults of color.  By identifying critical factors that promote effective patient-provider partnerships, this project enhances prospects for person-centered care and self-management of psychosis for low-income urban communities of color. If successful in the state of Connecticut, the project will offer a model that then can be replicated throughout the country to enhance care for this historically underserved population.           ",Culturally Responsive Person-Centered Care for Psychosis,6823825,R01MH067687,"['outpatient care ', ' patient care management ', ' patient care personnel relations ', ' health care service evaluation ', ' health care service availability ', ' human subject ', ' interview ', ' mental health facility ', ' community mental health service ', ' psychiatric patient care ', ' health care model ', ' satisfaction ', ' psychosis ', ' racial /ethnic difference ', ' low socioeconomic status ', ' urban area ', ' culture ', ' functional ability ', ' quality of life ', ' clinical research ', ' behavioral /social science research tag ', ' health services research tag ', ' medically underserved population ', ' patient oriented research ', ' health disparity ', ' ']",NIMH,CONNECTICUT ST DEPT OF MH/ADDICTION SRVS,R01,2004,440749,0.04011383547644064
"Minority Undergraduate MH Research Training Program DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  In accordance with the goals of the NIMH Mental Health Education Program, Project L/EARN recruits members of ethnic and cultural groups traditionally under-represented in mental health related graduate programs, with the intent of increasing the number of minority researchers in the mental health field. Project L/EARN is a program of the multi-disciplinary Institute for Health, Health Care Policy and Aging Research (the Institute) at Rutgers University. Project L/EARN provides scientific training, experience and guidance to make undergraduate members of underrepresented groups successful candidates for admission to relevant graduate programs in mental health research.  By increasing the number of well-trained undergraduates from underrepresented groups applying to graduate programs, Project L/EARN addresses the lack of diversity among health researchers. By providing sound training in statistics, sampling and study design we insure they will excel both in graduate training and as contributing members of the mental health research community. Our goal has been to increase the number of minority applicants to mental health related graduate programs through timely intervention early in the college experience while many students are exploring career options. The summer training component of Project L/EARN consists of a highly structured ten-week experience. During the first eight weeks, the program provides six hours of daily instruction in the principles of scientific inquiry including study design, methods of data collection, techniques of data management and statistical analysis, and fundamentals of statistical package programming. An instructor introduces the students to these topics in morning workshops. Teaching assistants reinforce the morning lessons in supervised homework sessions that meet in the afternoon. The instructor and teaching assistants are all Project L/EARN graduates. Faculty dedicate considerable time to Project L/EARN, providing guest lectures on a broad range of research issues, and serving as mentors. Each intern undertakes an independent research project under the guidance of their faculty mentor, and nightly reading assignments provide a broad foundation in current mental health research. The student poster session and oral presentations provide the opportunity for the interns to present their research projects, demonstrating the integration of the statistical, analytical and substantive issues.  Project L/EARN successfully integrates its trainees into active research during the academic year. We   request funds to support the summer training program as well as additional training/research experiences and attendance at professional conferences and other training programs.

"Trauma Interventions for Low-income Women in PrimaryCare DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Trauma exposure and trauma-related mental disorders make substantial contributions to widely recognized health disparities in the U. S. Because low-income populations have little access to mental health specialty care and often find it stigmatizing, and because attention to mental health issues in primary care settings is limited, their trauma-related problems receive little if any professional attention. The goal of the Center for Trauma Interventions in Primary Care (C-TIP) is to develop innovative and sustainable interventions to address the spectrum of trauma-related mental health needs presenting to primary care settings serving low-income, mostly minority populations through academic-community research partnerships with local jurisdictions. To increase the adoption and sustainability of these interventions, the trauma-related services to be developed are being conceptualized in close collaboration with three highly invested community partners: the Department of Health in Prince George's County, MD; the Primary Care Coalition in Montgomery County, MD; and Unity Health Care, Inc. in the District of Columbia. The Center will extend the high quality research our Research Infrastructure Support Program (RISP) has already generated in this under-studied population by active collaboration with new academic partners: Georgetown's School of Nursing and Health Studies and its Department of Family Medicine. The Center's work will be conducted through three cores (Operations, Research Methods, and Principal Research) providing administrative oversight, statistical support, and access to expert advisory groups; innovative methods/research designs integrating perspectives from applied anthropology and public health; and expertise and support for the development of promising research. C-TIP funded research projects include: 1) a series of qualitative ethnographic studies describing relevant dimensions of the health care systems and clinical settings in which the work will take place; 2) a methods study evaluating the feasibility and acceptability of three strategies of recruitment and two strategies of retention of participants to trauma-related intervention research; and 3) a pilot study of a trauma-focused group intervention delivered by nursing personnel. The working partnerships and infrastructure capability that will be continued and fostered through C-TIP will allow us to develop comprehensive trauma intervention models whose translation to settings serving low income individuals we propose to study through an advanced center and other grant mechanisms.

"Testing EBP and Organization Effects in Rural Appalachia DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The proposed study examines a two-level strategy for overcoming barriers to the implementation of effective mental health treatments for youth in very rural, deeply impoverished communities. The two-level strategy includes (1) the implementation of an evidence-based practice (EBP) delivered in the homes of referred youth by therapists organized to provide treatment over large, rural, geographical areas and (2) an organizational-community intervention (entitled ARC) that changes the social context in which the service is provided and supports therapists' efforts to serve children in widely-dispersed, isolated communities. The study will be conducted in eight of the poorest, least populated counties in the rural Appalachian Mountains of East Tennessee. The sample will include 720 children referred to juvenile courts in those counties as a result of antisocial behavior. Half of the children selected in each county will receive an EBP, Multisystemic Therapy (MST), and half will receive the usual care provided to children referred to juvenile courts in the eight counties. In addition, an organizational-community intervention (ARC) will be administered in half (four) of the counties by change agents (Ph.D. industrial-organizational psychologists trained in organizational and community development). The change agents will work with treatment teams, judges, school administrators, and other community opinion leaders to address the barriers to mental health care in rural Appalachia and develop community and organizational support for the implementation of the EBP. Multisystemic Therapy (MST) will be provided by Youth Villages, the state's largest private children's mental health service organization. MST services will be funded by the Bureau of TennCare, the state's Medicaid-waiver health insurance program that covers children eligible for Medicaid as well as the children of the working poor who are ineligible for Medicaid. The services are being structured and funded in a way that will ensure they can be sustained in each county, if successful, after the completion of the study.

"The Economics of Mental Health Disparties    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  A positive association between socio-economic status (SES) and good mental health outcomes has long been observed in many contexts. Active research continues to try to tease out answers about the direction of causality in this relationship, and about the causal mechanisms at play. This research proposes to extend this literature by exploiting the longitudinal structure of data in the 1979 cohort of the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (NLSY79). The research will provide insight into causality by testing hypotheses about temporal sequencing in the relationship between depression outcomes and income, controlling for other socio-demographic covariates, such as age, race, education and gender. This analysis will also permit the researcher to test whether the effects of economic status upon depression outcomes and vice-versa are stronger for minority sub-populations. The independent effect of local income inequality will also be tested. The proposed training component of this grant period is designed to build on the investigator's strengths as an economist by providing further exposure to recent research in mental health practice, etiology and epidemiology. This training will take the forms of courses, conferring with the primary mentors and consultants, and participation in relevant workshops in the Psychiatry Department and elsewhere in the University. Finally, the last 18 months of the grant will be devoted to developing a new research protocol on the role of time preference (i.e., impatience or delay of gratification) in determining patient demand for mental health services.

"Center for the Psychological Study of Urban Diversity This new M-RISP application builds on the existing momentum of productive newer mental health researchers/faculty members in the Department of Psychology at an Hispanic Serving Institution, California State University, Northridge (CSUN). This M-RISP award would facilitate the research careers of current newer faculty and attract qualified faculty of color to our department, which currently does not represent our 53% minority student population. CSUN's location is unique in the quality of research opportunities available in an ethnically diverse, highly populous urban region. The university strives to support research productivity by providing funding and equipment, but recent cutbacks have meant fewer research resources. This MRISP award would provide enrichment opportunities for developing projects and faculty that would complement the existing strengths of the Department. The projects proposed here represent crucial areas of mental health research -- culturally sensitive norms for neurological tests (Razani), social perception of schizophrenics (Sergi), adjustment and educational expectations in low income Latinos (Saetermoe), social psychology and mental health issues in academic adjustment (Grant/Quilici), and adjustment and engagement of elders in computer-based activities (Lagana). By providing reassigned time, payment for participants, clerical services, travel funds, equipment funds, and, most importantly, educational opportunities, this program proposes to provide developing faculty members with the resources they need to conduct state-of-the-art research and to disseminate findings while moving toward non-developmentally funded research. The educational component of this M-RISP grant includes seminars and workshops in quantitative statistics and methodology (e.g., structural equation modeling, project-specific workshops), qualitative methods and analysis (e.g., interviewing, qualitative interpretation), accompanied by weekly colloquia and workshops including faculty and student presentations of their own research, guest speakers, library informational workshops, data base workshops, and a variety of other enrichment activities.

The main mission of the proposed UPR-CHA Exploratory EXPORT Center is to generate and test interventions that can remedy service disparities in asthma and mental health for disadvantaged Latino and African Caribbean populations. The UPR-CHA EXPORT Center is led by an experienced and diverse team with a long history of collaboration, committed to the study of service disparities among ethnic minority populations, and with expertise in epidemiology, psychometrics, clinical interventions, services research, systems intervention, statistics, anthropology, and economics. The proposed UPR-CHA EXPORT Exploratory Center, together with the expertise at Harvard Medical School, will integrate the needs of the communities and of these two units and also enhance existing ties with other researchers and institutions. The proposed UPR-CHA Exploratory EXPORT Center has the following specific aims: 1) Promote multidisciplinary research, training, and community outreach, focusing on the development of improved service delivery models; 2) build research capacity and training in health and mental health service disparities at the University of Puerto Rico, the Cambridge Health Alliance, and its community partners that is relevant to understanding and improving the health and mental health care of Latinos and African Caribbean's; 3) promote the development of a mentorship program to engage health and mental health service disparities researchers in medical and behavioral research, prevention and intervention activities; and 4) disseminate the product of these efforts to inform policy decisions, clinical practice and community outreach and to orient the health service systems to provide culturally and linguistically appropriate services (CLAS). Our goal is that over time, with sustained infrastructure, we can build mentoring capacity to promote a scientifically attractive and vital field of ethnic and racial service disparities research.         ",UPR/CHA Exploratory EXPORT Center: Bridging Communities,6805985,P20MD000537,"['Hispanic American ', ' clinical research ', ' health disparity ', ' ']",NIMHD,UNIVERSITY OF PUERTO RICO MED SCIENCES,P20,2004,2487111,0.06918105054119814
"Promoting Engagement of Low Income Clients    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Access to mental health care and treatment engagement are major problems for vulnerable populations living in low-income communities. In addition, efficacious treatments developed and tested in academic settings are rarely adopted by clinicians who work in the community settings available to serve these individuals. While attempts have been made to disseminate proven interventions to community mental health services, the university-community collaborations designed to do so often fail. Based on the theoretical perspective provided by the literature on culture, we posit that prospective clients, mental health treatment professionals, and academic mental health treatment researchers comprise three disparate cultures, each with different perceptions of the meaning and etiology of distress. A failure to address this disconnect, can serve as a barrier to both patient care and collaboration, preventing those most in need of effective mental health services from receiving them. This revised application, in response to the NIMH IP-RISP announcement, proposes to address these barriers by developing, implementing, and evaluating a community agency research infrastructure to promote a capacity to collect data on issues of patient access and retention, develop innovative engagement strategies tailored to both client and clinician needs, conduct effective staff training programs, and evaluate the effectiveness of interventions, training and efforts to collaborate. Specifically, the University of Pittsburgh's Department of Psychiatry, School of Social Work, and Family Services of Western Pennsylvania (FSWP), a progressive mental health/social service agency, will: (1) establish a community agency-university collaborative partnership; (2) conduct an ethnographic study of this partnership; (3) conduct 2 pilot studies documenting the differences between client and clinician perspectives, and develop, implement, and test engagement strategies based on these findings, and (4) create a training program to disseminate evidence-based interventions to clinical staff. The work will be further guided by a participatory action research perspective, which requires that research be done with people, not to them, and will be closely woven into the current structure of the agency to insure its survival beyond the term of this application. The ethnographic study of the cultures involved in the collaborative process (Aim 2) will involve periodic feedback to all parts of the system to increase the effectiveness and longevity of the academic-community collaboration, facilitate patient access, and improve clinician morale. The pilot studies (Aim 3) will address the ways in which divergent cultural beliefs, values, and expectations of clinicians and low-income patients act as deterrents to the use of services. Data from two pilot studies, one from a semi-rural community, the other from an urban minority community, will be used to develop innovative engagement strategies and adapt interventions to be appropriate to low income clients (Aim 4). In so doing, we believe we can improve client engagement rates, prevent treatment drop-out, enhance treatment outcomes, and increase satisfaction with services.

"Spanish Adaptation of the BASIS Mental Health Survey    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The goal of this application is to develop a culturally and linguistically appropriate mental health assessment instrument designed to assess outcome of treatment for Spanish-speaking mental health and substance abuse service recipients. Culturally and linguistically appropriate outcome measures are especially needed to determine the presence and direction of health disparities, and to assess quality and outcomes of treatment among minority populations. The proposed research will accomplish this by adapting, translating and field testing and validating the revised Behavior and Symptom Identification Scale (BASIS-R) for use among Spanish speakers from three Spanish-speaking regions: Puerto Rico, Mexico and The Dominican Republic. Under a currently funded project (R01 MH58240) an extensive revision of the BASIS-32, a widely used consumer self-report mental health status measure, was undertaken. This application extends the currently funded work by adapting and translating the instrument for Spanish-speaking Latinos in the U.S. and Puerto Rico, and by allowing for culture-specific modules to be added to the core instrument. Specific aims are to: adapt and translate the instrument into Spanish; identify symptom and functioning domains and items that are culturally relevant to Spanish-speaking Latinos but are not included in the English version of the instrument; field test the adapted/translated instrument; and assess data quality, factor structure reliability, validity, differential item functioning and sensitivity to change for the Spanish instrument. These goals will be accomplished by using the best established methods to develop a preliminary translation. To assess content and semantic equivalence we will conduct focus groups and cognitive interviews. Analysis of the results will be used to further refine the translation for field testing. To assess technical equivalence, we will use the same format, and layout for the Spanish adaptation of the instrument as for the English. The field test of the instrument will enroll a total sample of 600 Latinos: 100 inpatients and 100 outpatients receiving treatment at each of three participating sites in Boston, Puerto Rico and Fresno. To assess criterion and conceptual equivalence, field test data will be used to assess reliability and validity of the instrument. Item Response Theory will be used to assess differential item functioning of the Spanish and English instruments. The instrument developed from this research will provide an important tool for assessing outcomes of mental health treatment among the Latino population.

"New Mexico Mental Health Mentorship/Education Program    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The New Mexico Mentorship and Education Program (MEP) focuses on minority mental health issues in primary care settings, especially disparities in mental health outcomes. An intensive, one-week annual training institute introduces mental health services research to minority junior faculty members and graduate students from Southwest institutions. The MEP also enhances ongoing mentorship relationships with outstanding mental health researchers. The NIMH National Advisory Mental Health Council has designated the MEP as a high program priority. By this competitive continuation application, we will strengthen the successful program by expanding it in two important ways: a) By recruiting minority primary care practitioners (PCPs) based at community health centers, the MEP will address the importance of ""translational"" research to bridge the nationally recognized gap between research and real-life practice settings, b) A new component will lead to recruitment of minority researchers and mentors who focus on geriatric mental health services in minority populations.      The MEP's specific aims are as follows: 1) Due to the difficulties that minority junior faculty members, graduate students, and practitioners have experienced in obtaining suitable training that helps them compete for research support, we will teach trainees basic research methods in this field, with an emphasis on how to write proposals and manage funded proposals. 2) To enhance the translation of research into real life practice settings, we will introduce university-based and community-based trainees to important recent findings of mental health services research, with special emphasis on research concerning the disparities in mental health outcomes that affect minority populations of the Southwest. 3) Because of the isolation and marginalization experienced by young minority researchers, we will establish networks among these trainees and nationally prominent research mentors. 4) Recognizing the challenges that minority graduate students, faculty members, and practitioners face in obtaining and retaining work positions that foster research activities, we will help trainees with various aspects of ""career development."" 5) Due to the difficulties of organizing training programs in the many locations where junior minority researchers live and work, we will produce a minority-oriented mental health services research curriculum that is exportable to other educational institutions and primary care practice sites. 6) To facilitate continuity of training and mentoring as junior investigators try to advance in their careers, we will initiate an ongoing sequence of training sessions in mental health services research on an annual basis. 7) Because of the sparse research conducted about the mental health problems of minority elders, we will initiate a new emphasis on mental health services research focusing on the older, minority populations of the Southwest.               ",New Mexico Mental Health Mentorship/Education Program,6823179,R25MH060288,"['curriculum ', ' health care personnel education ', ' postgraduate education ', ' training ', ' education evaluation /planning ', ' health science manpower ', ' minority health professional ', ' primary care physician ', ' health science research support ', ' health science research potential ', ' mental health service ', ' career ', ' health services research tag ', ' geriatric medicine ', ' educational resource design /development ', ' medically underserved population ', ' health disparity ', ' mentoring /mentor ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF NEW MEXICO,R25,2005,248842,0.1597235231195145
"Shortage of Health Professionals in Rural Areas DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  An ongoing challenge to the provision of state of the science, empirically tested mental health interventions in rural areas is a shortage of mental health and general health care professionals. The lack of specialty mental health professionals in many rural areas is compounded by the current registered nurse shortage, which is predicted to worsen. More daunting is the lack of providers with adequate training in the provision of culturally relevant care as well as the small number of mental health providers of different minority race and ethnic populations. The shortages of these professionals may result in the absence of care, the provision of substandard care, poor consumer outcomes, the lack of culturally acceptable care and, ultimately,  in negative health for the community. Using existing data we will evaluate the impact of having different amounts and mixes of professionals on public health and utilization types of outcomes. We will:    1) determine the influence of community characteristics including race, poverty and rurality on the availability of different types of mental health professionals; 2) evaluate the relationship between current and proposed numbers of professionals, the need for culturally relevant mental health care and the outcomes of mental health care; and 3) propose better methods for determining a shortage of mental health professionals (e.g. HPSA's). Products of the research will include a CD with information on the nation, states', and counties' mental health workforce. This data will be available for use in planning by policy-makers and for use in other research studies. The study will provide both improved data and improved methods to create and evaluate different definitions of Mental Health Shortage Areas. According to the Health Resources and Services Administration more than 34 federal programs depend on the shortage designation to determine eligibility or as a funding reference (HRSA, 2002). This study will provide improved accuracy to these important designations which influence eligibility for participation in federal programs, loan repayment for the National Health Service Corps and financial incentives to providers for caring for Medicare clients residing in these designated areas.

"Racial Disparities in School and Mental Health Services    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project uses a comprehensive longitudinal dataset to examine the complex multi-level processes underlying black children's disproportionate underutilization of mental health services and overrepresentation in special education relative to white children. Four specific aims are addressed: 1) To describe and analyze the dynamics of disparities in special education placement and mental health services use among black and white children; 2) To evaluate the degree to which child and family characteristics explain black/white disparity in special education entry and exit and in placement restrictiveness, and explain mental health services use; 3) To examine the influence of school and community characteristics on racial disparities in special education and mental health services use; and 4) To evaluate whether the process determining special education placement and use of mental health services varies by race. Hypotheses are tested related to each specific aim based on a multi-stage, multi-level conceptual model reflecting the influence of race/ethnicity on the inputs children bring to the process of mental health services and special education participation, as well as its influence on the process itself. Extensive data gathered annually since 1990 on non-intervention participants in the Fast Track project are analyzed. These data are uniquely suited to the proposed project because they include detailed information from school and medical records as well as parental interviews providing information on mental health functioning, symptomatology, and diagnosis.       Analyses to be performed include Kaplan-Meier survival functions to describe the timing of entry and exit from special education and mental health services; multivariate Cox proportional hazards models and multinomial logit models to examine the effects of child and family characteristics on timing of services and restrictiveness of educational placement, respectively; and multi-level hazard models quantifying the influence of school and community characteristics on disparities taking individual-level factors into account.         ",Racial Disparities in School and Mental Health Services,6987003,R03MH071713,"['school ', ' remedial /special education ', ' health care service utilization ', ' statistics /biometry ', ' mental health service ', ' mathematical model ', ' longitudinal human study ', ' African American ', ' caucasian American ', ' racial /ethnic difference ', ' socioenvironment ', ' human data ', ' clinical research ', ' health services research tag ', ' children ', ' health disparity ', ' ']",NIMH,PENNSYLVANIA STATE UNIVERSITY-UNIV PARK,R03,2005,72500,0.13771144938861404
"Minority Fellowship Program Psychology Summer Research Institute(MFP-PSI) DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The American Psychological Association (APA) - Minority Fellowship Program (MFP) in Psychology is a national program designed to increase the numbers of underrepresented ethnic minority groups conducting mental health-related and health disparity oriented research of interest to NIMH. As an extension of our training role, we have implemented an MFP Psychology Summer Institute (MFP-PSI) to promote the professional development of our trainees in preparation for successful research careers. The aims of this summer training program are to (1) provide educational and mentoring experiences to promising graduate students and doctoral-level professionals at early-career stages that will advance them in the development of tangible projects, (2) provide opportunities to network at various levels with NIMH and other federal agency representatives, as well as with leading mental health researchers from across the country, (3) facilitate the career development of participants through technical training, exposure to research and treatment models, and counsel from advanced mental health research professionals, and (4) foster cross-fertilization of ideas between those primarily involved in research and those primarily involved in service delivery. These aims will be accomplished through a 4-day training institute to be held in Washington, DC at which participants are exposed to topical and methodological lectures by leading researchers in the field, information about the array of research funded by NIMH and other federal agencies, and technical assistance in developing existing research projects and written manuscripts which included peer mentoring, and high-level individual mentoring from leading psychologists. We will conduct an evaluation comprised of an immediate, post-institute survey along with a 6-month and 12-month follow-up on-line survey. Our evaluation will be both formative and outcome based.

"Mental Health Treatment for Rural Poor and Minorities DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This three-year study will provide a comprehensive, nationally representative, description of rural mental health care, including access to care, patterns of treatment, and outcomes of care. The study will focus on understanding the particular problems faced by rural African Americans and Mexican Americans, women, and the poor in obtaining mental health treatment. We also will evaluate these relationships using guideline-concordant care as the standard for those with depressive and anxiety disorders. The Behavioral Model of Utilization is used as a framework to understand the complex relationship among environmental factors, population characteristics, services use, and outcomes. The proposed research is organized around three specific aims. First, we will describe variation in the likelihood of mental health treatment with respect to residential, ethnic minority status, poverty, and gender. Our second aim is to understand the role of access in explaining variation in mental health treatment with respect to residential, ethnic minority status, poverty, and gender status. Finally, our third aim is to examine the effect of treatment for depression and anxiety on several outcomes for adults, and parental treatment on child outcomes. Our analysis will use data from four panels of the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS) supplemented with information from the National Health Interview Survey. A strength of the proposed research is its use of county-level measures of rurality. Pooled across four years, the MEPS includes approximately 10,000 respondents residing in non-metropolitan areas, offering a unique opportunity to understand variation in mental health treatment across rural subpopulations. The availability of detailed medical histories will allow us to examine use of mental health services over a 2 1/2 year period. The populations studied, ethnic minorities and rural residents, are priority areas for the National Institute of Mental Health. By addressing the pressing need to reduce disparities in mental health care, our research will inform mental health policy with regard to services delivery systems for rural impoverished and minority populations.

"M-RISP at San Diego State University DESCRIPTION (Provided by applicant): Approval of the proposed M-RISP grant would come at a critical time for the development of mental health-related research at San Diego State University (SDSU). Because the faculty is aging and the student body is growing, 50 percent of the faculty will be newly hired within the next 5 years. The SDSU administration is dedicated to developing strength in mental health research to match the strength that has already been developed in biological sciences. An M-RISP program at SDSU would build on the strength of an existing joint doctoral program in clinical psychology with University of California, San Diego (UCSD) that was begun in 1985. The M-RISP program at SDSU would be dedicated to promoting and supporting multidisciplinary research in mental health. Program activities will focus on: 1) increasing research collaborations among faculty members at SDSU and research-intensive institutions; 2) establishing national and international faculty networks for mental health research; 3) seeking and obtaining R01-level extramural funding; and 4) increasing faculty research productivity, as indicated by peer-reviewed presentations and publications. The faculty would obtain release time through the grant, matched by the university, and several minority students would be supported and provide the faculty with assistance. A systematic and extensive plan for educating both M-RISP faculty and students about high-quality mental health research is planned, with the help of collaborators from UCSD. In addition, four Independent Investigator projects associated with the M-RISP core are proposed and include: studies examining social exclusion, emotion regulation, self-control, and impulsive behavior, stress in the work place, basic research on perceptual categorizations, and examining self-esteem among minority and majority groups. All four of the independent investigators will focus on disparities. The SDSU administration is dedicated to the program and has committed matching funds and its full support to the M-RISP program.

"Testing EBP and Organization Effects in Rural Appalachia DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The proposed study examines a two-level strategy for overcoming barriers to the implementation of effective mental health treatments for youth in very rural, deeply impoverished communities. The two-level strategy includes (1) the implementation of an evidence-based practice (EBP) delivered in the homes of referred youth by therapists organized to provide treatment over large, rural, geographical areas and (2) an organizational-community intervention (entitled ARC) that changes the social context in which the service is provided and supports therapists' efforts to serve children in widely-dispersed, isolated communities. The study will be conducted in eight of the poorest, least populated counties in the rural Appalachian Mountains of East Tennessee. The sample will include 720 children referred to juvenile courts in those counties as a result of antisocial behavior. Half of the children selected in each county will receive an EBP, Multisystemic Therapy (MST), and half will receive the usual care provided to children referred to juvenile courts in the eight counties. In addition, an organizational-community intervention (ARC) will be administered in half (four) of the counties by change agents (Ph.D. industrial-organizational psychologists trained in organizational and community development). The change agents will work with treatment teams, judges, school administrators, and other community opinion leaders to address the barriers to mental health care in rural Appalachia and develop community and organizational support for the implementation of the EBP. Multisystemic Therapy (MST) will be provided by Youth Villages, the state's largest private children's mental health service organization. MST services will be funded by the Bureau of TennCare, the state's Medicaid-waiver health insurance program that covers children eligible for Medicaid as well as the children of the working poor who are ineligible for Medicaid. The services are being structured and funded in a way that will ensure they can be sustained in each county, if successful, after the completion of the study.

"Pathways to Mental Health Services Among Native Women        DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): For Native American populations, mental         disorder prevalence, distribution and subsequent treatment seeking is not well       known. Evidence from the few studies that have been published and research           underway now, however, suggests a serious disparity in the prevalence of mental      disorders for this population compared to the general US population and a very       low utilization of mental health services.                                                                                                                                Research Plan: Two complementary studies are proposed. The first is a small          qualitative investigation of illness experience and contextual factors related       to treatment seeking among Native American women with current and lifetime           psychological pathology. The second is a quantitative secondary analysis of          pathways to mental health treatment and care seeking among Native women. Both        studies aim to provide descriptive and analytic information on utilization by        type of disorder and treatment system and identify other influences on care          seeking as suggested by the Network-Episode Model theory. The research will          test models regarding the pathways into care that consider social, community         and system variables as determinants of access to treatment and provide              narratives to contextualize the results. One data set to be used for the             secondary analysis is drawn from the largest psychiatric epidemiologic, risk         and protective factors study ever conducted among Native Americans (the              SUPERPFP study N=3200).

"Ethnic Minority Children in Public Mental Health DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Racial/ethnic disparities in access and quality of mental health care are well documented among adults. Parallel differences affect minority children and youth. The proposed study seeks to document minority-white disparities in psychiatric crisis care and to explain them as reflecting differential access to community-based services. It takes a cross-sectional, longitudinal (1998-2001) perspective of the 57 autonomous county-level mental health programs responsible for Medicaid mental health services in the ethnically diverse state of California. Specific questions are: Do African American, Latino, and Asian American children and youth experience more crisis-related care than whites as measured by hospital-based crisis stabilization and clinic-based crisis intervention visits? Are ethnic disparities in crisis care more pronounced for children in the community than for those in foster care, i.e. does placement in foster care, with its associated monitoring and referral for mental health problems, decrease disparities in crisis care? Are ethnic disparities in crisis care affected by differences in use of linkage-brokerage and outpatient care? Secondary data come from California Department of Mental Health Medi-Cal claims files. Primary data are collected and coded from annual state-county contracts and compliance reviews. Data are organized as client-level observations embedded within county systems observed annually over the 3-year period. We build models of client-level ethnic disparities in crisis use and remove any confounding county-level variation through the use of fixed effects, or through direct specification of county characteristics when they vary both longitudinally and cross-sectionally. Dependent variables, measuring the two types of crisis care use -- crisis stabilization and intervention -- are specified in separate models as the probability of any use (0, 1), and if used, the level of use (# of visits). Main independent variables are categorical (0, 1) variables representing the client's ethnicity. The magnitude and direction of the ethnicity coefficients will reveal the level of ethnic disparities in crisis use. We assess relationships between crisis care use, ethnicity and foster care status by entering foster care categorical variables and observing their effect on the ethnic variables' coefficients. Similarly, we test the effect of clients' outpatient/linkage-brokerage use on ethnic disparities in crisis care use.

"Minority Undergraduate MH Research Training Program DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  In accordance with the goals of the NIMH Mental Health Education Program, Project L/EARN recruits members of ethnic and cultural groups traditionally under-represented in mental health related graduate programs, with the intent of increasing the number of minority researchers in the mental health field. Project L/EARN is a program of the multi-disciplinary Institute for Health, Health Care Policy and Aging Research (the Institute) at Rutgers University. Project L/EARN provides scientific training, experience and guidance to make undergraduate members of underrepresented groups successful candidates for admission to relevant graduate programs in mental health research.  By increasing the number of well-trained undergraduates from underrepresented groups applying to graduate programs, Project L/EARN addresses the lack of diversity among health researchers. By providing sound training in statistics, sampling and study design we insure they will excel both in graduate training and as contributing members of the mental health research community. Our goal has been to increase the number of minority applicants to mental health related graduate programs through timely intervention early in the college experience while many students are exploring career options. The summer training component of Project L/EARN consists of a highly structured ten-week experience. During the first eight weeks, the program provides six hours of daily instruction in the principles of scientific inquiry including study design, methods of data collection, techniques of data management and statistical analysis, and fundamentals of statistical package programming. An instructor introduces the students to these topics in morning workshops. Teaching assistants reinforce the morning lessons in supervised homework sessions that meet in the afternoon. The instructor and teaching assistants are all Project L/EARN graduates. Faculty dedicate considerable time to Project L/EARN, providing guest lectures on a broad range of research issues, and serving as mentors. Each intern undertakes an independent research project under the guidance of their faculty mentor, and nightly reading assignments provide a broad foundation in current mental health research. The student poster session and oral presentations provide the opportunity for the interns to present their research projects, demonstrating the integration of the statistical, analytical and substantive issues.  Project L/EARN successfully integrates its trainees into active research during the academic year. We   request funds to support the summer training program as well as additional training/research experiences and attendance at professional conferences and other training programs.

"Center for Research on Mental Health in Social Services    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  In response to the ACISR Program Announcement, we propose to establish the Center for Research to Improve Mental Health Care in the Social Services (C-RIMSS). Our research agenda addresses quality of mental health care in settings with the highest potential to reduce racial and ethnic disparities. Studies will be conducted in social service agencies, where prevalence of mental disorder is high and vulnerable of clients predominate. A cultural exchange perspective informs our work at the mental health-social service intersect, and across the academic-practice divide. Through the work of seven units, our Operations Core will provide an infrastructure for research, methodological advances, and partnerships with community agencies. The Principal Research Core will support pilot studies to address three aims: (1) understand quality of care for mental disorder in the social services from stakeholder perspective; (2) assess practice variation in quality of care for mental disorder and identify provider, client, and system ecostructure and economic influences on that variation; and (3) working ""trench to bench and back to trench,"" test a menu of quality improvements for mental health care in the social services. The Research Methods Core's two units--Qualitative Methods and Statistical Analysis -- will provide ongoing, state of the art support to investigators. The RMC will support projects and provide consultation for stakeholder preference assessment, quality indicators, and organizational research methods. Our outcomes will include completed pilot projects, generation of RO 1, R21, or R34 studies, scientific publications, strengthened agency partnerships and infrastructure for research, and dissemination of findings to academic and stakeholder networks. Improving mental health care to social service clients can increase treatment to persons whose disorder currently goes undetected, improve the quality of evidence-based care to those who are now served poorly, and reduce racial/ethnic disparities in care. Our research agenda is responsive to the recommendation of the President's New Freedom Commission Report on Mental Health to improve the response to mental disorder in readily accessible and low-stigma settings where a high level of risk for mental health problems exists, especially all federally-funded health and human services.

"Stigma and PTSD in Refugee Adolescents    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The broad, long-term objective of this proposed project is to understand the relations between stigma and health outcomes in refugee children. Although stigma has been clearly linked to negative health outcomes in various populations, no work examines stigma in refugee populations. The results of this study will lay the foundation for further examination of types of stigma experienced by adolescent refugees, pathways through which stigma relates to health outcomes, and potential areas of intervention for this population. Link and Phelan (1995, 2000, 2002) posit a theoretical model in which stigma results in general social disadvantage (e.g., decreased knowledge, money, power, prestige and social connections), via discrimination. Social disadvantage, in turn, leads to a greater exposure to risk factors and decreased access to protective factors related to health outcomes. In addition, stigma directly contributes to life stress, which impacts health outcomes. This model forms the theoretical basis for examining the relations between stigma and health in refugee children. This study seeks to examine the link between stigma associated with race, religion, and mental illness, and mental health outcomes (particularly PTSD) in Somali refugee adolescents who have resettled in the U.S. It further seeks to test a theoretical model in which stigma relates to mental health problems through a variety of pathways. Social disadvantage, environmental stressors, and mental health service access will be examined as variables mediating the relationship of stigma and mental health. Specifically, this project has the following Specific Aims: 1) to examine and analyze the relations between stigma and mental health symptoms in refugee adolescents, and 2) to test a model relating stigma to mental health via social disadvantage, environmental stressors, and treatment access in refugee adolescents. The study will employ a cross-sectional design to assess 150 Somali adolescent refugees who have been resettled in the states of Massachusetts and Maine. Variables of stigma, social disadvantage, environmental stressors, service access, and mental health will be assessed, and relations between variables examined. In addition, supplementary data examining coping, social support, and social capital in relation to mental health outcomes will be examined.         ",Stigma and PTSD in Refugee Adolescents,6931189,R21MH070261,"['child psychology ', ' child behavior disorder ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' health care service availability ', ' human subject ', ' mental health ', ' mental health service ', ' social model ', ' coping ', ' depression ', ' psychosocial separation ', ' social change ', ' African ', ' racial /ethnic difference ', ' social support network ', ' religion ', ' environmental stressor ', ' posttraumatic stress disorder ', ' immigrant ', ' clinical research ', ' behavioral /social science research tag ', ' outcomes research ', ' health disparity ', ' ']",NIMH,BOSTON MEDICAL CENTER,R21,2005,161000,0.028504194164560993
"Center for the Psychological Study of Urban Diversity This new M-RISP application builds on the existing momentum of productive newer mental health researchers/faculty members in the Department of Psychology at an Hispanic Serving Institution, California State University, Northridge (CSUN). This M-RISP award would facilitate the research careers of current newer faculty and attract qualified faculty of color to our department, which currently does not represent our 53% minority student population. CSUN's location is unique in the quality of research opportunities available in an ethnically diverse, highly populous urban region. The university strives to support research productivity by providing funding and equipment, but recent cutbacks have meant fewer research resources. This MRISP award would provide enrichment opportunities for developing projects and faculty that would complement the existing strengths of the Department. The projects proposed here represent crucial areas of mental health research -- culturally sensitive norms for neurological tests (Razani), social perception of schizophrenics (Sergi), adjustment and educational expectations in low income Latinos (Saetermoe), social psychology and mental health issues in academic adjustment (Grant/Quilici), and adjustment and engagement of elders in computer-based activities (Lagana). By providing reassigned time, payment for participants, clerical services, travel funds, equipment funds, and, most importantly, educational opportunities, this program proposes to provide developing faculty members with the resources they need to conduct state-of-the-art research and to disseminate findings while moving toward non-developmentally funded research. The educational component of this M-RISP grant includes seminars and workshops in quantitative statistics and methodology (e.g., structural equation modeling, project-specific workshops), qualitative methods and analysis (e.g., interviewing, qualitative interpretation), accompanied by weekly colloquia and workshops including faculty and student presentations of their own research, guest speakers, library informational workshops, data base workshops, and a variety of other enrichment activities.

"The STIRR Intervention for Dually Diagnosed Clients    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): People with severe mental illness and co-occurring substance abuse disorder are at extremely high risk for HIV, hepatitis B, and hepatitis C. An estimated 1/2 of these dually diagnosed clients test positive for at least one infection, and co-infection, which complicates course and treatment of infection, is also high. Approximately 2/3rds of dually diagnosed clients with HIV are likely to be infected with HCV. Best-practice interventions for blood-borne infections, including screening, testing, immunizing, counseling, and referring to medical specialists could be life-saving for these clients, but they generally do not receive these services. We have developed and pilot tested a brief intervention (STIRR) to provide common basic preventive measures for blood-borne infections to patients with severe mental illness and substance use disorders. Community mental health systems, where clients are most reliably engaged, are not adequately providing these recommended services. The STIRR intervention is based on integrating mental health and other medical care through a public health approach, delivered by nursing and medical specialists, at the site of mental health care. We propose a randomized clinical trial to test STIRR against the usual service model, in which mental health practitioners refer patients directly to other medical providers off site. The proposed RCT will be conducted with an ethnically diverse, inner city sample of low-income clients receiving community based mental health care at two sites in Baltimore, MD, an area of high infection prevalence. Pilot data support the hypothesis that the intervention will prove feasible in typical community mental health settings serving high-risk clients. We hypothesize that clients who receive STIRR, compared to clients receiving treatment as usual, will be more likely to receive screening, testing, immunization, counseling for risk reduction, and appropriate medical care.

"Economics of Racial & Ethnic Disparities in MH Services    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The mechanisms that generate racial/ethnic disparities in health care operate at two levels: the healthcare system, and the clinical encounter. This application proposes to conduct research on the mechanisms that lead to racial/ethnic disparities in mental health services. Disparities, defined formally in the application, are essentially unjustified differences in the rates of use of health care services across groups. Recent theoretical and conceptual research provides the frameworks for empirical analyses of the reasons behind disparities. This application proposes to apply and test these frameworks for the purposes of informing policy about effective actions to combat disparities. We bring together a multidisciplinary team to conduct a series of integrated empirical and policy studies using previously collected data. The proposed research capitalizes on NIMH investments in data with large numbers of members of racial and ethnic minorities to make progress on understanding and reducing mental health care disparities. The specific aims of the application are: Operationalize the recently proposed Institute of Medicine definition of disparities using a large national data set to distinguish among Differences, Disparities and Discrimination when comparing mental health care for minority and majority populations. Quantify disparities in mental health, and identify the role of system factors and discrimination in mental health services disparities. Compare mental health care use by African Americans, Asian Americans and Latinos with use by Whites.   Investigate provider-side mechanisms explaining discrimination in the clinical encounter using data from the Quality Improvement for Depression (QID) projects. Test whether ""statistical discrimination"" can account for some of racial/ethnic differences in diagnosis and treatment recommendations for African-American and Latino populations.

"Race/Ethnicity, Acculturation, and Outcomes DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Evidence of racial/ethnic disparities in mental health services has been established, and attention to racial/ethnic differences in outcomes is warranted to effect appropriate service utilization and improvement of mental health care for different ethnic groups. The long-term objective of this research proposal is to contribute to the knowledge of outcomes for four major ethnic groups, and this purpose will be achieved in two studies. First, exploratory analyses will be conducted to examine whether there are a) racial/ethnic differences or b) parent acculturation level differences in youth outcomes for different service types. Second, treatment variables that may mediate and/or moderate the relationship between race/ethnicity, acculturation, and outcomes will be investigated. These aims will be achieved through the analysis of data from a large, longitudinal study that surveyed the mental health needs and service use of a racially/ethnically-diverse sample of at-risk youth {Patterns of Care; PI: R. Hough; n=1715). The results of these studies may help to improve treatment planning and design for different ethnic groups, help researchers and professionals to increase understanding of components that help make services effective for different populations, and aid professionals in reducing barriers to service use for different ethnic groups.

"M-RISP at San Francisco State University    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  San Francisco State University (SFSU) requests funds for the renewal, continuation and expansion of our highly successful M-RISP program, currently in the second year of its initial three-year funding. The goal of the program is to enhance the institutional capacity of SFSU by conducting mental health research projects that are responsive to NIMH priorities and can potentially be funded through regular R01 and R03 mechanisms. Situated within an academic institution committed to ethnic diversity and responsive to the needs of ethnic minority communities, our M-RISP program emphasizes research that addresses mental health disparities among ethnic minority groups in the United States. In addition, we aim to increase the number of ethnic minority Principal Investigators funded by NIMH. To achieve these goals, we propose to conduct a set of faculty mentoring, networking, and institutional development activities, many of which have been piloted successfully within our current M-RISP program, including the implementation of structured ""proposal development groups"" and methodological/statistical workshops. Through intramural competitions, we will select 12 junior faculty members and mentor them in the development of mental health research proposals to be submitted extramurally. We will also support the implementation of four new individual faculty projects that address mental health concerns in African American, Latino, Asian and Native American populations. The results obtained from these four projects will be incorporated as preliminary studies in future R01 submissions by the four investigators.      All activities will be conducted under the direction of Dr. Rafael Diaz, M-RISP Program Director, a developmental psychologist whose research has been funded by different institutes at NIH for the past 10 years.

"Race Differences in the Psychosocial Determinants of Depressive Symptoms    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Race disparities in mental health outcomes have been noted, but have been characterized by mixed findings and limited sampling. In addition, much of the literature on race and mental health lacks a clear theoretical framework. This dissertation draws upon social psychological theory on roles and identity to explain race differences in the effects of roles on mental health. While the effects of holding multiple roles appears to be beneficial for mental health, we know little about race differences in the effect of multiple role occupancy on mental health. The limited research available on this topic suggests that the relationship between social roles and mental health does vary across race. What remains less clear is why race differences in the effect of roles have been observed. Social psychological explanations suggest that the meanings people attach to roles may moderate the effect roles have on mental health. However, a limitation of this research is that it does not consider cultural variation in the meaning of roles. An understanding of the relationships among race, role occupancy and role meaning will shed light on the reasons for the differential effects of roles on mental health. This project will add to existing literature on race and mental health in several important ways. First, it extends theory and research on social roles and mental health by applying sociological theory to the examination of race and well-being. Second, this research extends current research in identity theory. To date, identity theory does not adequately address minority mental health (for an exception see Jackson and Mustillo 2001). Third, applications of identity theory tend to be based on convenience samples. This study uses nationally representative data. This allows for gender and race comparisons in the relationship between role meaning and mental health.               ",Race Differences in the Psychosocial Determinants of Depressive Symptoms,6944103,R36MH074350,"['human subject ', ' mental health ', ' social psychology ', ' role ', ' social behavior ', ' gender difference ', ' racial /ethnic difference ', ' culture ', ' quality of life ', ' clinical research ', ' behavioral /social science research tag ', ' ']",NIMH,KENT STATE UNIVERSITY,R36,2005,30668,0.13202572363859605

"Enhancing Quality in Expanded School Mental Health DESCRIPTION:  (Provided by the Applicant) In response to PA-00-111, this application seeks to systematically enhance the quality, appropriateness and effectiveness of mental health services in schools. The last two decades in the United States have witnessed the progressive development of expanded school mental health (ESMH) programs, which provide comprehensive mental health care to youth in general and special education through partnerships between schools and community agencies. The Center for School Mental Health Assistance (CSMHA) is one of two federally funded centers to advance school-based mental health programs. Since its inception in 1995, the center has had a major focus on school mental health quality and for the past two years has been working to develop a set of 10 principles and corresponding quality indicators reflecting the vision of best practice for the ESMH field. Through a survey and interactive forums with school health, mental health and education staff nationwide the principles and quality indicators have been refined, and a quality assessment and improvement (QAI) intervention based on them has been developed. The study will involve ESMH programs in three locations: Delaware, Maryland and Texas. Within each program, through stratified random assignment we will assign ESMH clinicians in schools to either receive a systematic Quality Assessment and Improvement (QAI) intervention (targeted group: 35 clinicians in 40 schools) or receive an intervention on Staff Wellness Plus Information on the ESMH Principles (comparison group: 35 clinicians in 40 schools). In the proposed three-year study, clinicians in targeted and comparison schools will participate in the respective interventions in Years 1 and 2. Between groups (targeted versus comparison) analyses will be conducted on dependent variables of the quality of services provided by clinicians, clinician attitudes and behavior, satisfaction ratings provided by students, parents and schools staff, and student grades, attendance, lateness and discipline problems. Year 3 will focus on analyses, writing and broad dissemination of findings and lessons learned through the CSMHA's networks.

"Culturally Responsive Person-Centered Care for Psychosis    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Patient-centered care has become increasingly important over the past several decades, though the translation of these principles into clinical practices that customize care on an individual basis have been markedly inconsistent. This gap between principles and practices is especially evident in the context of public sector care for people with psychosis. As documented thoroughly in the Surgeon General's recent report Mental Health: Culture, Race, and Ethnicity (2001), the disenfranchisement of adults with psychosis is further accentuated among ethnic/racial minority communities in urban environments.  The proposed study addresses these health disparities through qualitative and experimental evaluations of two complementary approaches to culturally responsive person-centered care for psychosis. The study has the following three specific aims: 1) to describe perceived barriers to, and benefits of, processes of help-seeking, participation in psychiatric care, and illness self-management efforts among low-income adults of color being treated for psychosis; 2) to evaluate the effectiveness of a facilitated approach to person-centered care with and without the augmentation of a community integration program in increasing customization of care over a 6 and 18-month period of outpatient treatment. Primary outcomes of person centered care are hypothesized to be increases in illness self-management and satisfaction with services, and secondary outcomes to be decreased symptoms and enhanced clinical and functional status and quality of life; and 3) to test a theoretical model that stipulates relationships between ethnic identity, community resources, and degree of cultural responsiveness and collaboration present in relationships between patients and outpatient mental health providers in mediating customization of care among an urban population of low-income adults of color.  By identifying critical factors that promote effective patient-provider partnerships, this project enhances prospects for person-centered care and self-management of psychosis for low-income urban communities of color.

Active research continues to try to tease out answers about the direction of causality in this relationship, and about the causal mechanisms at play. This research proposes to extend this literature by exploiting the longitudinal structure of data in the 1979 cohort of the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (NLSY79). The research will provide insight into causality by testing hypotheses about temporal sequencing in the relationship between depression outcomes and income, controlling for other socio-demographic covariates, such as age, race, education and gender. This analysis will also permit the researcher to test whether the effects of economic status upon depression outcomes and vice-versa are stronger for minority sub-populations. The independent effect of local income inequality will also be tested. The proposed training component of this grant period is designed to build on the investigator's strengths as an economist by providing further exposure to recent research in mental health practice, etiology and epidemiology. This training will take the forms of courses, conferring with the primary mentors and consultants, and participation in relevant workshops in the Psychiatry Department and elsewhere in the University. Finally, the last 18 months of the grant will be devoted to developing a new research protocol on the role of time preference (i.e., impatience or delay of gratification) in determining patient demand for mental health services.

"Testing EBP and Organization Effects in Rural Appalachia DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The proposed study examines a two-level strategy for overcoming barriers to the implementation of effective mental health treatments for youth in very rural, deeply impoverished communities. The two-level strategy includes (1) the implementation of an evidence-based practice (EBP) delivered in the homes of referred youth by therapists organized to provide treatment over large, rural, geographical areas and (2) an organizational-community intervention (entitled ARC) that changes the social context in which the service is provided and supports therapists' efforts to serve children in widely-dispersed, isolated communities. The study will be conducted in eight of the poorest, least populated counties in the rural Appalachian Mountains of East Tennessee. The sample will include 720 children referred to juvenile courts in those counties as a result of antisocial behavior. Half of the children selected in each county will receive an EBP, Multisystemic Therapy (MST), and half will receive the usual care provided to children referred to juvenile courts in the eight counties. In addition, an organizational-community intervention (ARC) will be administered in half (four) of the counties by change agents (Ph.D. industrial-organizational psychologists trained in organizational and community development). The change agents will work with treatment teams, judges, school administrators, and other community opinion leaders to address the barriers to mental health care in rural Appalachia and develop community and organizational support for the implementation of the EBP. Multisystemic Therapy (MST) will be provided by Youth Villages, the state's largest private children's mental health service organization. MST services will be funded by the Bureau of TennCare, the state's Medicaid-waiver health insurance program that covers children eligible for Medicaid as well as the children of the working poor who are ineligible for Medicaid. The services are being structured and funded in a way that will ensure they can be sustained in each county, if successful, after the completion of the study.

"Promoting Engagement of Low Income Clients    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Access to mental health care and treatment engagement are major problems for vulnerable populations living in low-income communities. In addition, efficacious treatments developed and tested in academic settings are rarely adopted by clinicians who work in the community settings available to serve these individuals. While attempts have been made to disseminate proven interventions to community mental health services, the university-community collaborations designed to do so often fail. Based on the theoretical perspective provided by the literature on culture, we posit that prospective clients, mental health treatment professionals, and academic mental health treatment researchers comprise three disparate cultures, each with different perceptions of the meaning and etiology of distress. A failure to address this disconnect, can serve as a barrier to both patient care and collaboration, preventing those most in need of effective mental health services from receiving them. This revised application, in response to the NIMH IP-RISP announcement, proposes to address these barriers by developing, implementing, and evaluating a community agency research infrastructure to promote a capacity to collect data on issues of patient access and retention, develop innovative engagement strategies tailored to both client and clinician needs, conduct effective staff training programs, and evaluate the effectiveness of interventions, training and efforts to collaborate. Specifically, the University of Pittsburgh's Department of Psychiatry, School of Social Work, and Family Services of Western Pennsylvania (FSWP), a progressive mental health/social service agency, will: (1) establish a community agency-university collaborative partnership; (2) conduct an ethnographic study of this partnership; (3) conduct 2 pilot studies documenting the differences between client and clinician perspectives, and develop, implement, and test engagement strategies based on these findings, and (4) create a training program to disseminate evidence-based interventions to clinical staff. The work will be further guided by a participatory action research perspective, which requires that research be done with people, not to them, and will be closely woven into the current structure of the agency to insure its survival beyond the term of this application. The ethnographic study of the cultures involved in the collaborative process (Aim 2) will involve periodic feedback to all parts of the system to increase the effectiveness and longevity of the academic-community collaboration, facilitate patient access, and improve clinician morale. The pilot studies (Aim 3) will address the ways in which divergent cultural beliefs, values, and expectations of clinicians and low-income patients act as deterrents to the use of services. Data from two pilot studies, one from a semi-rural community, the other from an urban minority community, will be used to develop innovative engagement strategies and adapt interventions to be appropriate to low income clients (Aim 4). In so doing, we believe we can improve client engagement rates, prevent treatment drop-out, enhance treatment outcomes, and increase satisfaction with services.

"Developing Minority Mental Health Research at TSU:    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This proposal seeks to renew a M-RISP Development Center (for five years) with the goal of enhancing the research infrastructure at Tennessee State University and its institutional capacity to conduct high-quality, multidisciplinary behavioral science research in minority mental health. Specifically, the M-RISP Development Center will continue to implement two types of training in mental health research at Tennessee State University: (a) faculty research development, and (b) training of students. This proposal builds on the progress made during the past three years (including two funded individual investigator projects) and expands the Center activities to be more multidisciplinary and encompass more faculty researchers and students. The proposed activities during the second cycle of MRISP will further develop the University's ability to compete for investigator-initiated extramural research funding. The specific aims of the Center are: (1) Enhance the University infrastructure (including the Administrative Division) to facilitate expansion of the M-RISP Development Center faculty training activities; (2) Maintain the Research Division at the Center to provide assistance and support for the implementation of research projects and development of new fundable projects by junior faculty; (3) Utilize and expand the existing databases at the Center For Health Research for use by junior faculty to develop new research ideas and hypothesis testing; and (4) Train students in mental health research through 'hands-on' experience as assistants on funded faculty-led projects. This proposal consists of two parts: (A) the Institutional Research Development Core, and (B) three Individual Faculty Research Projects. All three projects complement the Center's guiding theme of minority mental health and race disparities in health using a conceptual framework of community-based research. Success of the Center will be measured in terms of the number of junior faculty and students trained, research presentations, peer reviewed publications, and investigator-initiated proposals submitted to NIMH and other funding agencies in the area of mental health.

"Multi-Method Ethnographic Assessment of Behavioral Health Reform in New Mexico    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The State of New Mexico will implement a major reform in managed mental health service delivery for low-income populations in July 2005. Seventeen state agencies will contract with a single behavioral health organization to oversee the delivery of all public mental health services. This reform is designed to decrease administrative costs and service fragmentation while improving access to culturally relevant, evidence-based mental health services, particularly in rural areas. However, concerns linger that managed mental health care programs may adversely affect access and services for vulnerable populations and may overly burden rural safety-net institutions. The 5-year R01 research project proposed in this application will use a multi-method ethnographic approach to examine: (1) the process of introducing the reform in a rural and multiethnic state and (2) the degree to which the reform results in improved access and quality of care for low-income seriously mentally ill (SMI) patients in public mental health programs and other safety-net institutions.  This longitudinal study has three specific aims: (1) To examine changes in help-seeking behavior, access, and utilization of services by American Indian, Hispanic, and White SMI patients and their social supports (e.g., family and close peers) in three rural and three urban settings before, during, and after the reform. (2) To investigate changes in the work environment, attitudes, and behavior of frontline service providers and staff members of safety-net institutions in the targeted settings before, during, and after the reform. (3) To assess the impacts of the reform on the organization and financial condition of safety-net institutions in the targeted settings and statewide.  Our multi-method ethnographic research strategy will employ both qualitative and quantitative methods in two sets of studies, conducted prior to and after the reform is implemented. The first set, consisting of administrative database reviews and ethnographic interviews and observations with SMI patients and frontline service providers, will describe changes in patterns of mental health care utilization and provider behavior. These studies will occur in three rural counties and three comparison urban counties. The second set, consisting of ethnographic interviews with state policymakers and structured surveys with clinical directors of rural and urban safety-net institutions, will identify changes in service provision for the SMI statewide. This latter statewide component will facilitate linking of the community-level ethnographic data with broader system change.  The proposed ethnographic assessment of New Mexico's reform will offer new practical knowledge, grounded in the actual experiences of diverse stakeholders, that may improve state mental health policy for rural and minority SMI populations. In collaboration with the State of New Mexico, we will assess whether the reform decreases barriers to   care for these underserved groups and how it affects the viability of existing services rendered in safety-net institutions.  This research will fill a gap in research on statewide assessments of public health care initiatives, which do not typically focus on patient help-seeking behavior and the unique access and utilization problems faced by rural, racial and ethnic minorities. Since rural states may turn to the New Mexico reform as a model to reduce administrative costs and service fragmentation and to increase access for the SMI, this research is of great national relevance.

"The STIRR Intervention for Dually Diagnosed Clients    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): People with severe mental illness and co-occurring substance abuse disorder are at extremely high risk for HIV, hepatitis B, and hepatitis C. An estimated 1/2 of these dually diagnosed clients test positive for at least one infection, and co-infection, which complicates course and treatment of infection, is also high. Approximately 2/3rds of dually diagnosed clients with HIV are likely to be infected with HCV. Best-practice interventions for blood-borne infections, including screening, testing, immunizing, counseling, and referring to medical specialists could be life-saving for these clients, but they generally do not receive these services. We have developed and pilot tested a brief intervention (STIRR) to provide common basic preventive measures for blood-borne infections to patients with severe mental illness and substance use disorders. Community mental health systems, where clients are most reliably engaged, are not adequately providing these recommended services. The STIRR intervention is based on integrating mental health and other medical care through a public health approach, delivered by nursing and medical specialists, at the site of mental health care. We propose a randomized clinical trial to test STIRR against the usual service model, in which mental health practitioners refer patients directly to other medical providers off site. The proposed RCT will be conducted with an ethnically diverse, inner city sample of low-income clients receiving community based mental health care at two sites in Baltimore, MD, an area of high infection prevalence. Pilot data support the hypothesis that the intervention will prove feasible in typical community mental health settings serving high-risk clients. We hypothesize that clients who receive STIRR, compared to clients receiving treatment as usual, will be more likely to receive screening, testing, immunization, counseling for risk reduction, and appropriate medical care.

"Center for Research on Mental Health in Social Services    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  In response to the ACISR Program Announcement, we propose to establish the Center for Research to Improve Mental Health Care in the Social Services (C-RIMSS). Our research agenda addresses quality of mental health care in settings with the highest potential to reduce racial and ethnic disparities. Studies will be conducted in social service agencies, where prevalence of mental disorder is high and vulnerable of clients predominate. A cultural exchange perspective informs our work at the mental health-social service intersect, and across the academic-practice divide. Through the work of seven units, our Operations Core will provide an infrastructure for research, methodological advances, and partnerships with community agencies. The Principal Research Core will support pilot studies to address three aims: (1) understand quality of care for mental disorder in the social services from stakeholder perspective; (2) assess practice variation in quality of care for mental disorder and identify provider, client, and system ecostructure and economic influences on that variation; and (3) working ""trench to bench and back to trench,"" test a menu of quality improvements for mental health care in the social services. The Research Methods Core's two units--Qualitative Methods and Statistical Analysis -- will provide ongoing, state of the art support to investigators. The RMC will support projects and provide consultation for stakeholder preference assessment, quality indicators, and organizational research methods. Our outcomes will include completed pilot projects, generation of RO 1, R21, or R34 studies, scientific publications, strengthened agency partnerships and infrastructure for research, and dissemination of findings to academic and stakeholder networks. Improving mental health care to social service clients can increase treatment to persons whose disorder currently goes undetected, improve the quality of evidence-based care to those who are now served poorly, and reduce racial/ethnic disparities in care.

"New Mexico Mental Health Mentorship/Education Program    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The New Mexico Mentorship and Education Program (MEP) focuses on minority mental health issues in primary care settings, especially disparities in mental health outcomes. An intensive, one-week annual training institute introduces mental health services research to minority junior faculty members and graduate students from Southwest institutions. The MEP also enhances ongoing mentorship relationships with outstanding mental health researchers. The NIMH National Advisory Mental Health Council has designated the MEP as a high program priority. By this competitive continuation application, we will strengthen the successful program by expanding it in two important ways: a) By recruiting minority primary care practitioners (PCPs) based at community health centers, the MEP will address the importance of ""translational"" research to bridge the nationally recognized gap between research and real-life practice settings, b) A new component will lead to recruitment of minority researchers and mentors who focus on geriatric mental health services in minority populations.      The MEP's specific aims are as follows: 1) Due to the difficulties that minority junior faculty members, graduate students, and practitioners have experienced in obtaining suitable training that helps them compete for research support, we will teach trainees basic research methods in this field, with an emphasis on how to write proposals and manage funded proposals. 2) To enhance the translation of research into real life practice settings, we will introduce university-based and community-based trainees to important recent findings of mental health services research, with special emphasis on research concerning the disparities in mental health outcomes that affect minority populations of the Southwest. 3) Because of the isolation and marginalization experienced by young minority researchers, we will establish networks among these trainees and nationally prominent research mentors. 4) Recognizing the challenges that minority graduate students, faculty members, and practitioners face in obtaining and retaining work positions that foster research activities, we will help trainees with various aspects of ""career development."" 5) Due to the difficulties of organizing training programs in the many locations where junior minority researchers live and work, we will produce a minority-oriented mental health services research curriculum that is exportable to other educational institutions and primary care practice sites. 6) To facilitate continuity of training and mentoring as junior investigators try to advance in their careers, we will initiate an ongoing sequence of training sessions in mental health services research on an annual basis. 7) Because of the sparse research conducted about the mental health problems of minority elders, we will initiate a new emphasis on mental health services research focusing on the older, minority populations of the Southwest.               ",New Mexico Mental Health Mentorship/Education Program,7126465,R25MH060288,"['curriculum ', ' health care personnel education ', ' postgraduate education ', ' training ', ' education evaluation /planning ', ' health science manpower ', ' minority health professional ', ' primary care physician ', ' health science research support ', ' health science research potential ', ' mental health service ', ' career ', ' health services research tag ', ' geriatrics ', ' educational resource design /development ', ' medically underserved population ', ' health disparity ', ' mentoring /mentor ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF NEW MEXICO,R25,2006,246779,0.1597235231195145
"Development of Culturally Competent Mental Health Care    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Recent national reports have called for the implementation of culturally competent mental health care. However the conceptual and empirical base of cultural competence is weak, thus limiting what our systems of care can do to respond to this call. The overall objective of this application is to address these noted limitations by (a) operationalizing an existing cultural competence model into a treatment approach, (b) producing a training protocol to accompany this model, (c) carrying out the training with a group of public mental health practitioners, and (d) assessing whether clinicians' cultural competence skills increase as a function of the training and whether patients' satisfaction, treatment retention, and functioning improve as a result of the clinicians' training. A conceptual model of cultural competence entitled ""Shifting Cultural Lenses"" (Lopez, 1997) will be translated into a systematic set of procedures. In addition, recent advances in culture theory will be integrated into this treatment manual. A training protocol will be produced to facilitate the implementation of the treatment approach. As a first step in developing this model, the focus of training will be in working with Latinos, the largest ethnic/racial minority group in the United States. A preliminary evaluation of the treatment manual/training protocol will be carried out with 30 mental health practitioners (nonpsychiatrists) who serve the public sector in Santa Cruz County California. A within subjects design will be applied such that both clinician and patient outcomes will be evaluated with Latino consumers in videotaped clinical interactions with a newly admitted patient prior to the training and another newly admitted patient after the training. We expect that clinicians' cultural competence skills, their therapeutic alliance, and their expression of warmth will increase after training. In addition, we expect that patients' satisfaction, treatment retention, and clinical functioning will increase after training.

"Disparities Among Children Served by the CMHS Children's Services Program    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application is submitted by the Johns Hopkins University and ORC Macro in response to PA-04-019, which encourages applications focusing on the Center for Mental Health Services' (CMHS) Comprehensive Community Mental Health Services for Children and Their Families Program. Since 1993, CMHS has provided funding to 121 grantees to develop service systems to provide a comprehensive spectrum of mental health and other support services to children with serious emotional disturbance (SED) and their families. We are proposing to analyze data available from approximately 69,000 youth served and 28,000 youth enrolled in the monitoring component of the study in order to investigate racial/ethnic, gender, and age differences in the characteristics of youth entering the program and disparities in the services received and outcomes. The project has three aims. Aim 1. Describe characteristics of youth at baseline for all 121 Service Programs initiated since 1993 (and any added during the study period) and identify trends in these baseline characteristics across this time period. Aim 2. Investigate the potential disparities at baseline and in treatment outcomes for youth enrolled in the program. Aim 3. Identify the determinants of treatment trajectories and also the determinants of disparities in treatment outcomes over time. We hypothesize that the characteristics of youth served will vary over time and that disparities in outcomes will become less over time. This research will identify gaps in our current services and the extent to which disparities remain a challenge, even in our nation's model program.           ",Disparities Among Children Served by the CMHS Children's Services Program,7146634,R01MH075828,"['child mental health service ', ' time resolved data ', ' health care service evaluation ', ' human subject ', ' statistics /biometry ', ' longitudinal human study ', ' psychological shock ', ' mood disorder ', ' gender difference ', ' racial /ethnic difference ', ' human therapy evaluation ', ' age difference ', ' human data ', ' clinical research ', ' behavioral /social science research tag ', ' health services research tag ', ' outcomes research ', ' behavior therapy ', ' health disparity ', ' ']",NIMH,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R01,2006,479744,0.04558792375364972
"Racial Disparities in School and Mental Health Services    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project uses a comprehensive longitudinal dataset to examine the complex multi-level processes underlying black children's disproportionate underutilization of mental health services and overrepresentation in special education relative to white children. Four specific aims are addressed: 1) To describe and analyze the dynamics of disparities in special education placement and mental health services use among black and white children; 2) To evaluate the degree to which child and family characteristics explain black/white disparity in special education entry and exit and in placement restrictiveness, and explain mental health services use; 3) To examine the influence of school and community characteristics on racial disparities in special education and mental health services use; and 4) To evaluate whether the process determining special education placement and use of mental health services varies by race. Hypotheses are tested related to each specific aim based on a multi-stage, multi-level conceptual model reflecting the influence of race/ethnicity on the inputs children bring to the process of mental health services and special education participation, as well as its influence on the process itself. Extensive data gathered annually since 1990 on non-intervention participants in the Fast Track project are analyzed.

"CSULB Minority Research Infrastructure Support Program    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This resubmission of a M-RISP grant application aims to develop the mental health disparities research capability of faculty in the Departments of Psychology and Human Development at California State University, Long Beach (CSULB). Situated in a highly diverse ethnic metropolitan region, CSULB has abundant opportunities and needs for research relevant to understanding and reducing health disparities in populations with different cultural backgrounds. An M-RISP award would provide opportunities for faculty development in research that would complement the existing strengths and reinforce the momentum of research productivity by faculty. Our M-RISP fosters individualized plans for training participants with the long range objective of producing competitive research applications for extramural funding. It would (1) involve faculty members in conducting pilot work that would lead to a competitive research grant on mental health disparities; (2) increase graduate and undergraduate student research participation, (3) provide research development activities for faculty; and (4) strengthen the institutional infrastructure for mental health research. Our M-RISP would provide reassigned time for participants that would be matched by the College of Liberal Arts and the Department of Psychology, payment for participants, clerical services, travel funds, equipment funds, and state of the art research skill training for faculty development that will enable them to conduct high quality research. Participants would receive seminars and workshops in quantitative research methods and analysis (e.g., web-based survey, daily diary method, structural equation modeling), as well as qualitative research methods and analysis (e.g., interviewing, qualitative interpretation), accompanied by bi-weekly colloquia including faculty and student presentations of their own research and guest speakers and a variety of other enrichment activities. Our M-RISP activities will be closely coordinated with an existing Career Opportunities in Research (COR) program funded by NIMH at CSULB since 1981 to mentor minority undergraduates toward doctoral studies. The three projects proposed here represent crucial areas of mental health research - 1) acculturation, stress and coping among Korean immigrants; 2) sibling influences on coping in families with a child with Type 2 diabetes; 3) cultural factors related to disclosure by rape victims, and its effect on mental health. The award would be timely because recent fiscal cutbacks by the State of California have reduced University resources for research even though the University has shown that it values and rewards research productivity.              ",CSULB Minority Research Infrastructure Support Program,7075143,R24MH073882,"['noninsulin dependent diabetes mellitus ', ' postgraduate education ', ' training ', ' university student ', ' minority health professional ', ' health science research support ', ' minority institution research support ', ' health science research potential ', ' human subject ', ' mental health epidemiology ', ' coping ', ' psychology ', ' rape ', ' Asian American ', ' culture ', ' psychological stressor ', ' clinical research ', ' behavioral /social science research tag ', ' health services research tag ', ' interdisciplinary collaboration ', ' health disparity ', ' mentoring /mentor ', ' ']",NIMH,CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY LONG BEACH,R24,2006,426602,0.08873455436078269
"Shortage of Health Professionals in Rural Areas DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  An ongoing challenge to the provision of state of the science, empirically tested mental health interventions in rural areas is a shortage of mental health and general health care professionals. The lack of specialty mental health professionals in many rural areas is compounded by the current registered nurse shortage, which is predicted to worsen. More daunting is the lack of providers with adequate training in the provision of culturally relevant care as well as the small number of mental health providers of different minority race and ethnic populations. The shortages of these professionals may result in the absence of care, the provision of substandard care, poor consumer outcomes, the lack of culturally acceptable care and, ultimately,  in negative health for the community. Using existing data we will evaluate the impact of having different amounts and mixes of professionals on public health and utilization types of outcomes. We will:    1) determine the influence of community characteristics including race, poverty and rurality on the availability of different types of mental health professionals; 2) evaluate the relationship between current and proposed numbers of professionals, the need for culturally relevant mental health care and the outcomes of mental health care; and 3) propose better methods for determining a shortage of mental health professionals (e.g. HPSA's). Products of the research will include a CD with information on the nation, states', and counties' mental health workforce. This data will be available for use in planning by policy-makers and for use in other research studies. The study will provide both improved data and improved methods to create and evaluate different definitions of Mental Health Shortage Areas. According to the Health Resources and Services Administration more than 34 federal programs depend on the shortage designation to determine eligibility or as a funding reference (HRSA, 2002). This study will provide improved accuracy to these important designations which influence eligibility for participation in federal programs, loan repayment for the National Health Service Corps and financial incentives to providers for caring for Medicare clients residing in these designated areas.

"Culturally Responsive Person-Centered Care for Psychosis    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Patient-centered care has become increasingly important over the past several decades, though the translation of these principles into clinical practices that customize care on an individual basis have been markedly inconsistent. This gap between principles and practices is especially evident in the context of public sector care for people with psychosis. As documented thoroughly in the Surgeon General's recent report Mental Health: Culture, Race, and Ethnicity (2001), the disenfranchisement of adults with psychosis is further accentuated among ethnic/racial minority communities in urban environments.  The proposed study addresses these health disparities through qualitative and experimental evaluations of two complementary approaches to culturally responsive person-centered care for psychosis. The study has the following three specific aims: 1) to describe perceived barriers to, and benefits of, processes of help-seeking, participation in psychiatric care, and illness self-management efforts among low-income adults of color being treated for psychosis; 2) to evaluate the effectiveness of a facilitated approach to person-centered care with and without the augmentation of a community integration program in increasing customization of care over a 6 and 18-month period of outpatient treatment. Primary outcomes of person centered care are hypothesized to be increases in illness self-management and satisfaction with services, and secondary outcomes to be decreased symptoms and enhanced clinical and functional status and quality of life; and 3) to test a theoretical model that stipulates relationships between ethnic identity, community resources, and degree of cultural responsiveness and collaboration present in relationships between patients and outpatient mental health providers in mediating customization of care among an urban population of low-income adults of color.  By identifying critical factors that promote effective patient-provider partnerships, this project enhances prospects for person-centered care and self-management of psychosis for low-income urban communities of color. If successful in the state of Connecticut, the project will offer a model that then can be replicated throughout the country to enhance care for this historically underserved population.           ",Culturally Responsive Person-Centered Care for Psychosis,7086199,R01MH067687,"['outpatient care ', ' patient care management ', ' patient care personnel relations ', ' health care service evaluation ', ' health care service availability ', ' human subject ', ' interview ', ' mental health facility ', ' community mental health service ', ' psychiatric patient care ', ' health care model ', ' satisfaction ', ' psychosis ', ' racial /ethnic difference ', ' low socioeconomic status ', ' urban area ', ' culture ', ' functional ability ', ' quality of life ', ' clinical research ', ' behavioral /social science research tag ', ' health services research tag ', ' medically underserved population ', ' patient oriented research ', ' health disparity ', ' ']",NIMH,CONNECTICUT ST DEPT OF MH/ADDICTION SRVS,R01,2006,507804,0.04011383547644064
"The Economics of Mental Health Disparties    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  A positive association between socio-economic status (SES) and good mental health outcomes has long been observed in many contexts. Active research continues to try to tease out answers about the direction of causality in this relationship, and about the causal mechanisms at play. This research proposes to extend this literature by exploiting the longitudinal structure of data in the 1979 cohort of the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (NLSY79). The research will provide insight into causality by testing hypotheses about temporal sequencing in the relationship between depression outcomes and income, controlling for other socio-demographic covariates, such as age, race, education and gender. This analysis will also permit the researcher to test whether the effects of economic status upon depression outcomes and vice-versa are stronger for minority sub-populations. The independent effect of local income inequality will also be tested. The proposed training component of this grant period is designed to build on the investigator's strengths as an economist by providing further exposure to recent research in mental health practice, etiology and epidemiology. This training will take the forms of courses, conferring with the primary mentors and consultants, and participation in relevant workshops in the Psychiatry Department and elsewhere in the University. Finally, the last 18 months of the grant will be devoted to developing a new research protocol on the role of time preference (i.e., impatience or delay of gratification) in determining patient demand for mental health services.

"Multi-Method Ethnographic Assessment of Behavioral Health Reform in New Mexico    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The State of New Mexico will implement a major reform in managed mental health service delivery for low-income populations in July 2005. Seventeen state agencies will contract with a single behavioral health organization to oversee the delivery of all public mental health services. This reform is designed to decrease administrative costs and service fragmentation while improving access to culturally relevant, evidence-based mental health services, particularly in rural areas. However, concerns linger that managed mental health care programs may adversely affect access and services for vulnerable populations and may overly burden rural safety-net institutions. The 5-year R01 research project proposed in this application will use a multi-method ethnographic approach to examine: (1) the process of introducing the reform in a rural and multiethnic state and (2) the degree to which the reform results in improved access and quality of care for low-income seriously mentally ill (SMI) patients in public mental health programs and other safety-net institutions.  This longitudinal study has three specific aims: (1) To examine changes in help-seeking behavior, access, and utilization of services by American Indian, Hispanic, and White SMI patients and their social supports (e.g., family and close peers) in three rural and three urban settings before, during, and after the reform. (2) To investigate changes in the work environment, attitudes, and behavior of frontline service providers and staff members of safety-net institutions in the targeted settings before, during, and after the reform. (3) To assess the impacts of the reform on the organization and financial condition of safety-net institutions in the targeted settings and statewide.  Our multi-method ethnographic research strategy will employ both qualitative and quantitative methods in two sets of studies, conducted prior to and after the reform is implemented. The first set, consisting of administrative database reviews and ethnographic interviews and observations with SMI patients and frontline service providers, will describe changes in patterns of mental health care utilization and provider behavior. These studies will occur in three rural counties and three comparison urban counties. The second set, consisting of ethnographic interviews with state policymakers and structured surveys with clinical directors of rural and urban safety-net institutions, will identify changes in service provision for the SMI statewide. This latter statewide component will facilitate linking of the community-level ethnographic data with broader system change.  The proposed ethnographic assessment of New Mexico's reform will offer new practical knowledge, grounded in the actual experiences of diverse stakeholders, that may improve state mental health policy for rural and minority SMI populations. In collaboration with the State of New Mexico, we will assess whether the reform decreases barriers to   care for these underserved groups and how it affects the viability of existing services rendered in safety-net institutions.  This research will fill a gap in research on statewide assessments of public health care initiatives, which do not typically focus on patient help-seeking behavior and the unique access and utilization problems faced by rural, racial and ethnic minorities. Since rural states may turn to the New Mexico reform as a model to reduce administrative costs and service fragmentation and to increase access for the SMI, this research is of great national relevance.

"MHREG for Research in Ethnically Diverse Communities    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): As the nation becomes more racially and ethnically diverse, novel approaches to research and research education are needed to decrease the burden of mental illness. Mood disorders are a leading cause of disability and a powerful contributor to mortality, including deaths by suicide. Treatments for mood disorders among Blacks and Latinos require innovative research models responsive to economic disparities, culturally- mediated preferences and expectations of treatment, and the co-morbidities that disproportionately affect people of color such as substance misuse and medical illness. Meeting this scientific and public health challenge requires innovation in the education of clinical scientists. New collaborations involving university and community partners must be developed, given the central roles that community agencies play in the lives of the emerging majority, and the understandable reluctance of many ethnic minorities to seek treatment in the existing specialized mental health care delivery system. The Rochester Program of Research and Innovation in Disparities Education (Rochester PRIDE) is a novel training program designed to inspire and prepare trainees to conduct mental health research in partnership with community agencies. Over the next five years, we will 1) enhance our established research training partnerships with community agencies in a manner that facilitates trainee research, 2) recruit and educate at least 25 trainees from psychology and medicine in a core didactic curriculum that features a new, multidisciplinary seminar titled ""Race, Socioeconomic Status and Health in the Urban Setting"", 3) implement an innovative collaborative mentoring- precepting program that teaches trainees how to develop and implement research in community settings, 4) evaluate PRIDE by monitoring trainee outcomes and by soliciting and reviewing feedback from an external Evaluator, and 5) disseminate our findings by convening symposia and publishing peer-reviewed articles describing program design, implementation, and outcomes. This multidisciplinary research education program will be highly attractive to trainees who seek to gain skills and knowledge to conduct research in real-world settings. Rochester PRIDE will also serve as a model for other mental health training and educational programs designed to meet the nation's changing public health needs. By the end of the Award period, we will have sufficient experience and data to disseminate the program's findings and expand its scope by adding trainees interested in research on children and adolescents. As well, we will consider adding trainees at other developmental levels or from other disciplines.           ",MHREG for Research in Ethnically Diverse Communities,7143642,R25MH074898,"['medical education ', ' training ', ' human subject ', ' mental health personnel ', ' mental health service ', ' community mental health service ', ' emotional adjustment ', ' emotion ', ' mood disorder ', ' African American ', ' Hispanic American ', ' racial /ethnic difference ', ' clinical research ', ' behavioral /social science research tag ', ' health services research tag ', ' interdisciplinary collaboration ', ' patient oriented research ', ' health disparity ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF ROCHESTER,R25,2006,231784,0.029837204674584044
"The Collaborative Center for Trauma and Mental Health Disparities    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  We propose to establish a five-year, multi-ethnic and multi-disciplinary ""Collaborative Center for Trauma and Mental Health"" (CCTMHD) to promote interdisciplinary research examining the prevalence and impact of traumatic experiences on PTSD, depression and concomitant cognitive/emotional, behavioral, psychological and biological processes in ethnic minority populations. The overarching aim is to inform new strategies to reduce mental health disparities associated with trauma exposure. Multiple sources of acute and chronic stress combine to have a cumulative effect in the lives of ethnic minorities, giving rise to our use of the conceptual framework of allostatic load to (1) describe the socio-cultural context in which violence occurs; (2) examine cultural differences in the appraisal of traumatic events; (3) identify protective and vulnerability factors within ethnic groups; and (4) characterize the expression of mental health symptoms and help-seeking that contribute to mental health disparities. The Center, led by Dr. Gail Wyatt in collaboration with an experienced team of minority mental health researchers includes an Administrative Core, which will coordinate and integrate all Center activities including mentoring of investigators and a Methods & Statistics Core, which will be responsible for providing methodological support to all Center investigators and projects. Project 1 is a 4-year, longitudinal study, ""Intimate Partner Violence and Mental Health Outcomes among Latinas"", led by Dr. M. Rodriguez. He will investigate the longitudinal course of PTSD and depression, attachment and related biological sequelae in an existing cohort of 205 Latina mothers, who vary on intimate partner violence histories. Project 2, ""Disclosure & Appraisal of Child Sexual Abuse (CSA): Relationships with PTSD, Depression, & Associated Biomarkers"" is led by Drs. J. Vargas-Carmona and T. Loeb.

"Fostering Mental Health Research in Psychiatry Residents    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There is a critical lack of minority physician scientists engaged in and leading mental health clinical research. The proposed research educational program addresses this gap in targeting primarily minority psychiatry residents attending a small HBCU medical school, Morehouse School of Medicine, and partners - for the fourth year research elective - with the much larger, research oriented, Department of Psychiatry of Emory University School of Medicine. The proposed program permeates the four-year residency training program. By the end of the second year, the residents are becoming competent in evidence-based medicine principles, are research literate, and have participated in ongoing research projects. Collaboration with Emory assures a wide variety of experienced investigators with sponsored research, augmented by Morehouse's own resources, from which the PGY IV resident can select a mentor and research project. In addition to traditional research training subjects, this directly addresses cultural competency in mental health research, including bioethical, biological and psychological issues of minority populations in research content and conduct, and as a means to decreasing mental health disparities. The program will also facilitate a bridge to postdoctoral training and mentoring. Furthermore, the practice of mentoring others will be instilled in the participants, and they will be encouraged to mentor those in earlier years of training. The specific aims include: support educational experiences relevant to conducting mental health related clinical research that will attract, train and further career development of primarily under-represented minority physician scientists; provide mentored clinical research opportunities that will encourage physician scientists to embark on research projects directly applicable to clinical practice and transitional research; assure the training and experience necessary to progress to the next step of the participants careers, either by entering a research postdoctoral fellowship or by joining an existing research environment; and establish the feasibility of a paradigm of smaller medical schools, especially those with large minority residency programs, to partner with larger, more research oriented, local medical schools to provide more advanced training that otherwise would not possible.           ",Fostering Mental Health Research in Psychiatry Residents,7144209,R25MH071735,"['medical education ', ' training ', ' ethics ', ' health science manpower ', ' minority health professional ', ' minority institution research support ', ' health science research potential ', ' human subject ', ' mental health ', ' psychiatrist ', ' culture ', ' clinical research ', ' interdisciplinary collaboration ', ' educational resource design /development ', ' health disparity ', ' mentoring /mentor ', ' ']",NIMH,MOREHOUSE SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,R25,2006,238346,0.09732233521145747
"NLAAS II: Unraveling Differences for Clinical Services    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This continuation application requests three-years of support to investigate differences in the correlates of psychiatric illness and mental health service disparities among Asian Americans and Latinos as compared to non-Latino Whites. We will use recently collected data from the National Latino and Asian American Study (NLAAS), a national psychiatric epidemiologic study conducted to measure psychiatric disorders and mental health service usage in a representative sample of Asians and Latinos, and the National Comorbidity Study Replication (NCS-R). The combined NLAAS/NCS-R data are the best available to address critical questions regarding the level of service disparities, and the identification of service disparities ""hot spots."" In this resubmission, we apply an innovative conceptual framework to organize correlates for psychiatric illness, mental health service use and mental health service disparities, giving attention to health system and contextual factors in addition to traditional individual level factors. Specifically, our aims are to: (1) Use combined data from the NLAAS and the NCS-R to: compare prevalence of psychiatric disorders and mental health service use among Latinos, Asian, and non-Latino Whites; investigate hypotheses related to differences in the correlates of illness and mental health services; and assess bias in disorder prevalence and service use, (2) Apply the IOM definition of disparities to quantify disparities in services utilization and identify potential mechanisms underlying services disparities, and (3) Apply methods from spatial epidemiology to identify ""hot spots"" of mental health service disparities at the MSA level, and investigate health care system factors associated with high and low performing MSAs. This study will provide national baseline data on which to define the progress and measurable targets for mental health service disparity improvements for Latinos and Asian Americans as compared to non-Latino Whites. In addition, it will identify health system factors measured at the community and individual level that mediate disparities and can be targeted by policymakers. Finally, it will provide policymakers with information regarding where in the US mental health service disparities are unusually high. These findings can be used to target resources, develop coherent public policies, and inform guidelines aimed at making mental health prevention and treatment services more responsive and sensitive to the needs of ethnic/racial minorities.

Besides his reputation as a quality researcher and his strong track record of funding in mental health services, the candidate has an excellent record of mentorship. He has provided critical mentorship to a large number of successful pre- and post-doctoral psychologists, psychiatry residents, and junior faculty investigators from a range of disciplines (> 25 total mentees) over the past thirteen years. His immediate goals are to continue to mentor junior investigators, and to acquire new skills to assist him in continuing his own patient-oriented mental health services research. Toward this end, he will acquire skills and knowledge in health economics, and will submit an R01 for a clinical trial to evaluate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of using videoconferencing (""telehealth"") applications to provide service delivery to trauma survivors, in order to address disparities in rural resource utilization. His long-term goal is to continue to develop a unique expertise in the area of mental health services and economic research relevant to trauma survivors served in via public sector agencies through the opportunities afforded by this award. This expertise will better enable him to mentor junior researchers in conducting patient-oriented mental health services research in the future.          ",Mentoring/Career Development in PTSD Services Research,7141020,K24MH074468,"['telemedicine ', ' health care service evaluation ', ' health care service availability ', ' human subject ', ' interview ', ' mental health service ', ' longitudinal human study ', ' satisfaction ', ' mental disorder diagnosis ', ' human therapy evaluation ', ' posttraumatic stress disorder ', ' clinical research ', ' behavioral /social science research tag ', ' health services research tag ', ' personal log /diary ', ' medically underserved population ', ' patient oriented research ', ' therapy design /development ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF HAWAII AT HILO,K24,2006,133983,0.11659342346872124
"Trauma Interventions for Low-income Women in PrimaryCare DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Trauma exposure and trauma-related mental disorders make substantial contributions to widely recognized health disparities in the U. S. Because low-income populations have little access to mental health specialty care and often find it stigmatizing, and because attention to mental health issues in primary care settings is limited, their trauma-related problems receive little if any professional attention. The goal of the Center for Trauma Interventions in Primary Care (C-TIP) is to develop innovative and sustainable interventions to address the spectrum of trauma-related mental health needs presenting to primary care settings serving low-income, mostly minority populations through academic-community research partnerships with local jurisdictions. To increase the adoption and sustainability of these interventions, the trauma-related services to be developed are being conceptualized in close collaboration with three highly invested community partners: the Department of Health in Prince George's County, MD; the Primary Care Coalition in Montgomery County, MD; and Unity Health Care, Inc. in the District of Columbia. The Center will extend the high quality research our Research Infrastructure Support Program (RISP) has already generated in this under-studied population by active collaboration with new academic partners: Georgetown's School of Nursing and Health Studies and its Department of Family Medicine. The Center's work will be conducted through three cores (Operations, Research Methods, and Principal Research) providing administrative oversight, statistical support, and access to expert advisory groups; innovative methods/research designs integrating perspectives from applied anthropology and public health; and expertise and support for the development of promising research. C-TIP funded research projects include: 1) a series of qualitative ethnographic studies describing relevant dimensions of the health care systems and clinical settings in which the work will take place; 2) a methods study evaluating the feasibility and acceptability of three strategies of recruitment and two strategies of retention of participants to trauma-related intervention research; and 3) a pilot study of a trauma-focused group intervention delivered by nursing personnel. The working partnerships and infrastructure capability that will be continued and fostered through C-TIP will allow us to develop comprehensive trauma intervention models whose translation to settings serving low income individuals we propose to study through an advanced center and other grant mechanisms.

"Minority Undergraduate MH Research Training Program DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  In accordance with the goals of the NIMH Mental Health Education Program, Project L/EARN recruits members of ethnic and cultural groups traditionally under-represented in mental health related graduate programs, with the intent of increasing the number of minority researchers in the mental health field. Project L/EARN is a program of the multi-disciplinary Institute for Health, Health Care Policy and Aging Research (the Institute) at Rutgers University. Project L/EARN provides scientific training, experience and guidance to make undergraduate members of underrepresented groups successful candidates for admission to relevant graduate programs in mental health research.  By increasing the number of well-trained undergraduates from underrepresented groups applying to graduate programs, Project L/EARN addresses the lack of diversity among health researchers. By providing sound training in statistics, sampling and study design we insure they will excel both in graduate training and as contributing members of the mental health research community. Our goal has been to increase the number of minority applicants to mental health related graduate programs through timely intervention early in the college experience while many students are exploring career options. The summer training component of Project L/EARN consists of a highly structured ten-week experience. During the first eight weeks, the program provides six hours of daily instruction in the principles of scientific inquiry including study design, methods of data collection, techniques of data management and statistical analysis, and fundamentals of statistical package programming. An instructor introduces the students to these topics in morning workshops. Teaching assistants reinforce the morning lessons in supervised homework sessions that meet in the afternoon. The instructor and teaching assistants are all Project L/EARN graduates. Faculty dedicate considerable time to Project L/EARN, providing guest lectures on a broad range of research issues, and serving as mentors. Each intern undertakes an independent research project under the guidance of their faculty mentor, and nightly reading assignments provide a broad foundation in current mental health research. The student poster session and oral presentations provide the opportunity for the interns to present their research projects, demonstrating the integration of the statistical, analytical and substantive issues.  Project L/EARN successfully integrates its trainees into active research during the academic year. We   request funds to support the summer training program as well as additional training/research experiences and attendance at professional conferences and other training programs.

"Ethnic Minority Children in Public Mental Health DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Racial/ethnic disparities in access and quality of mental health care are well documented among adults. Parallel differences affect minority children and youth. The proposed study seeks to document minority-white disparities in psychiatric crisis care and to explain them as reflecting differential access to community-based services. It takes a cross-sectional, longitudinal (1998-2001) perspective of the 57 autonomous county-level mental health programs responsible for Medicaid mental health services in the ethnically diverse state of California. Specific questions are: Do African American, Latino, and Asian American children and youth experience more crisis-related care than whites as measured by hospital-based crisis stabilization and clinic-based crisis intervention visits? Are ethnic disparities in crisis care more pronounced for children in the community than for those in foster care, i.e. does placement in foster care, with its associated monitoring and referral for mental health problems, decrease disparities in crisis care? Are ethnic disparities in crisis care affected by differences in use of linkage-brokerage and outpatient care? Secondary data come from California Department of Mental Health Medi-Cal claims files. Primary data are collected and coded from annual state-county contracts and compliance reviews. Data are organized as client-level observations embedded within county systems observed annually over the 3-year period. We build models of client-level ethnic disparities in crisis use and remove any confounding county-level variation through the use of fixed effects, or through direct specification of county characteristics when they vary both longitudinally and cross-sectionally. Dependent variables, measuring the two types of crisis care use -- crisis stabilization and intervention -- are specified in separate models as the probability of any use (0, 1), and if used, the level of use (# of visits). Main independent variables are categorical (0, 1) variables representing the client's ethnicity. The magnitude and direction of the ethnicity coefficients will reveal the level of ethnic disparities in crisis use. We assess relationships between crisis care use, ethnicity and foster care status by entering foster care categorical variables and observing their effect on the ethnic variables' coefficients. Similarly, we test the effect of clients' outpatient/linkage-brokerage use on ethnic disparities in crisis care use.

"The Economics of Mental Health Disparties    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  A positive association between socio-economic status (SES) and good mental health outcomes has long been observed in many contexts. Active research continues to try to tease out answers about the direction of causality in this relationship, and about the causal mechanisms at play. This research proposes to extend this literature by exploiting the longitudinal structure of data in the 1979 cohort of the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (NLSY79). The research will provide insight into causality by testing hypotheses about temporal sequencing in the relationship between depression outcomes and income, controlling for other socio-demographic covariates, such as age, race, education and gender. This analysis will also permit the researcher to test whether the effects of economic status upon depression outcomes and vice-versa are stronger for minority sub-populations. The independent effect of local income inequality will also be tested. The proposed training component of this grant period is designed to build on the investigator's strengths as an economist by providing further exposure to recent research in mental health practice, etiology and epidemiology. This training will take the forms of courses, conferring with the primary mentors and consultants, and participation in relevant workshops in the Psychiatry Department and elsewhere in the University. Finally, the last 18 months of the grant will be devoted to developing a new research protocol on the role of time preference (i.e., impatience or delay of gratification) in determining patient demand for mental health services.

"Multi-Method Ethnographic Assessment of Behavioral Health Reform in New Mexico    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The State of New Mexico will implement a major reform in managed mental health service delivery for low-income populations in July 2005. Seventeen state agencies will contract with a single behavioral health organization to oversee the delivery of all public mental health services. This reform is designed to decrease administrative costs and service fragmentation while improving access to culturally relevant, evidence-based mental health services, particularly in rural areas. However, concerns linger that managed mental health care programs may adversely affect access and services for vulnerable populations and may overly burden rural safety-net institutions. The 5-year R01 research project proposed in this application will use a multi-method ethnographic approach to examine: (1) the process of introducing the reform in a rural and multiethnic state and (2) the degree to which the reform results in improved access and quality of care for low-income seriously mentally ill (SMI) patients in public mental health programs and other safety-net institutions.  This longitudinal study has three specific aims: (1) To examine changes in help-seeking behavior, access, and utilization of services by American Indian, Hispanic, and White SMI patients and their social supports (e.g., family and close peers) in three rural and three urban settings before, during, and after the reform. (2) To investigate changes in the work environment, attitudes, and behavior of frontline service providers and staff members of safety-net institutions in the targeted settings before, during, and after the reform. (3) To assess the impacts of the reform on the organization and financial condition of safety-net institutions in the targeted settings and statewide.  Our multi-method ethnographic research strategy will employ both qualitative and quantitative methods in two sets of studies, conducted prior to and after the reform is implemented. The first set, consisting of administrative database reviews and ethnographic interviews and observations with SMI patients and frontline service providers, will describe changes in patterns of mental health care utilization and provider behavior. These studies will occur in three rural counties and three comparison urban counties. The second set, consisting of ethnographic interviews with state policymakers and structured surveys with clinical directors of rural and urban safety-net institutions, will identify changes in service provision for the SMI statewide. This latter statewide component will facilitate linking of the community-level ethnographic data with broader system change.  The proposed ethnographic assessment of New Mexico's reform will offer new practical knowledge, grounded in the actual experiences of diverse stakeholders, that may improve state mental health policy for rural and minority SMI populations. In collaboration with the State of New Mexico, we will assess whether the reform decreases barriers to   care for these underserved groups and how it affects the viability of existing services rendered in safety-net institutions.  This research will fill a gap in research on statewide assessments of public health care initiatives, which do not typically focus on patient help-seeking behavior and the unique access and utilization problems faced by rural, racial and ethnic minorities. Since rural states may turn to the New Mexico reform as a model to reduce administrative costs and service fragmentation and to increase access for the SMI, this research is of great national relevance.

"New Parents' Mental Health in Socio-Cultural Context    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Given the dramatic increase in women's employment over the past half century, the transition to parenthood is now followed by the early transition back to paid work for the majority of new mothers. Pressures associated with parental employment and childcare have become growing concerns for new parents. Research highlights the lack of consensus about the short- and long-term consequences of early parental employment for both parents and children. Even less is known about how socio-cultural factors, such as race, class, and family structure, affect parents' and children's mental health across these multiple transitions. The primary goal of the proposed research is to explore how the transition to parenthood, coupled with the early return to paid employment affects the mental health and family relationships of working-class parents and children over the short- (1-year) and long-term (6 years), with the aim of exploring how these processes differ as a function of race and family structure. The first aim is to explore the long-term effects of the transition to parenthood and early parental employment on parents' and children's mental health five years later. A sample of 153 couples, who experienced the transition to parenthood between 1996 and 2001, will be re-interviewed as their first child enters kindergarten, affording the unique opportunity to examine how patterns established in the first year of parenthood are related to family members' mental health and relationships five years later. The second aim is to examine how race and family structure moderate how new parents fare as they become new parents and manage full-time employment. The original transition to parenthood study will be replicated with three new sub-samples including, African-American, single-mother and two-parent families and European-American single mothers. The objectives of the replication are: (1) to examine change in new parents' mental health and intimate relationships as they become new parents and soon thereafter return to full-time work, (2) to identify how work conditions, social support, gender ideology, expectations about parenthood, and characteristics of the child and parents mediate the effects of the multiple transitions on parents' mental health, (3) to examine change in family roles and behaviors across the first year of parenthood, and (4) to determine the effects of family-friendly workplace policies on parents' mental health across the transition to parenthood.

"Exploring Parent & Youth Concepts of Teen Mental Illness in High-Poverty Settings    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This exploratory qualitative study asks: How do youth and their parents in high-poverty urban environments conceptualize, recognize and respond to teen mental health problems? Mental health problems not only take an emotional toll on families, but also can interfere with normal adolescent development, impeding academic success and the establishment of healthy relationships. Yet as many as two-thirds of adolescents experiencing mental health problems, including those with psychiatric disorders, are underserved by the mental health service system. This is especially the case for economically disadvantaged youth, many of whom reside in our nation's inner cities. Building on over a decade of research conducted with New York City schools serving low-income families, this study will use a theoretically and empirically informed qualitative approach to create a rich database of youths' and parents' ""emic"" concepts of teen mental health problems and treatment. Core data collection will consist of semi-structured open-ended interviews with 100 parent-youth dyads. Narratives obtained through open-ended inquiry will further understanding of how families think about and make sense of adolescent mental health problems in their community. Examining parents' and youths' narratives will also help identify where there are barriers, including negative perceptions of and experiences with mental health services, that derail pathways to appropriate treatment. In addition, interviews will use hypothetical vignettes as a common stimulus to elicit norms, attitudes, and beliefs about teen mental health, psychiatric symptoms and illness, and treatment. An initial set of focus groups will conducted to obtain community input on the interview protocol and a final set of focus groups will be conducted to review key findings and their interpretation. The specific aims are to: 1. Elicit youth and parent emic conceptualizations of adolescent mental health problems, warning signs of problems, and beliefs and attitudes about mental illness and its treatment; 2. Identify normative beliefs, attitudes, and behaviors related to self-help practices and help-seeking strategies used by adolescents and parents to address teen mental health problems; 3. Synthesize findings to (a) refine a conceptual model of help seeking for teen problems that can guide future research and (b) contribute to the development of emic-informed strategies for improving teen mental health and mental health education, outreach, and services in high-poverty settings. The long-term goal is to inform culturally-relevant education, outreach and services that support families and improve the functioning and life chances of adolescents who may be experiencing mental health problems. Findings have the potential to provide a fuller understanding of why adolescents in challenging economically disadvantaged settings are underserved and what steps can be taken to remedy ongoing disparities.           ",Exploring Parent & Youth Concepts of Teen Mental Illness in High-Poverty Settings,7178648,R21MH079301,"['Data Collection ', ' mental health education ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Low income ', ' Emotions ', ' Environment ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Feeling hopeless ', ' hopelessness ', ' No hope for the future ', ' Negative about the future ', ' Loss of hope for the future ', ' Feels there is no future ', ' Cannot see a future ', ' Education and Outreach ', ' Tutoring and Outreach ', ' Training and Outreach ', ' Instruction and Outreach ', ' Scheme ', ' Teenagers ', ' teen years ', ' Teen ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Family ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Future ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' Age ', ' base ', ' concept ', ' Goals ', ' improved ', ' Health ', ' Health Surveys ', ' minority health ', ' Family Study ', ' Adolescent ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Ensure ', ' Interview ', ' Evaluation ', ' Stimulus ', ' Premature Mortality ', ' Databases ', ' data repository ', ' clinical data repository ', ' Electronic Database ', ' Electronic Databank ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Funding ', ' male ', ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health Services ', ' Mental Hygiene Services ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' New York City ', ' Parents ', ' Perception ', ' Poverty ', ' Pregnancy in Adolescence ', ' Underage Pregnancy ', ' Teenage Pregnancy ', ' Teen Pregnancy ', ' Pregnancy in Minors ', ' Adolescent Pregnancy ', ' Research ', ' Risk-Taking ', ' Schools ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Suicide ', ' suicidality ', ' intent to die ', ' fatal suicide ', ' fatal attempt ', ' Suicide attempt ', ' suicidal attempt ', ' non fatal attempt ', ' Thinking, function ', ' thoughts ', ' Thinking ', ' Attention ', ' Violence ', ' violent behavior ', ' violent ', ' Attitude ', ' Work ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' System ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' Behavior ', ' Mental disorders ', ' psychological disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Belief ', ' inner city ', ' Services ', ' experience ', ' self help ', ' success ', ' Structure ', ' expectation ', ' Participant ', ' Prevention program ', ' member ', ' help-seeking behavior ', ' help seeking ', ' Categories ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' AIDS/HIV problem ', ' HIV/AIDS problem ', ' HIV/AIDS ', ' AIDS/HIV ', ' Substance abuse problem ', ' substance abuse ', ' abuse of substances ', ' Gender ', ' Generations ', ' psychological distress ', ' Emotional ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' depressive symptoms ', ' depressive ', ' depression symptom ', ' Emotional Depression ', ' Latino ', ' Modeling ', ' Adolescent Development ', ' response ', ' Youth ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Accounting ', ' Communities ', ' health economics ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' improved functioning ', ' Population ', ' ']",NIMH,"EDUCATION DEVELOPMENT CENTER, INC.",R21,2007,217271,0.07478671863483359
"National Survey of American Life    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Good mental health is vital for the economic and social well-being of the nation. Mental disorders are highly disabling conditions; psychiatric illness ranks second only to cardiovascular disease in its effects on disability. Despite the prevalence of some psychiatric disorders generally, we do not have a clear understanding of the prevalence and nature of treatment of psychiatric disorders for the American black population. Further the underutilization of outpatient mental health services has been well documented for ethnic minority groups. The correlates of service use and patterns of help-seeking, however, as well as risk and resiliency factors both within and across racial/ethnic groups have been identified as critical areas for future research. The National Survey of American Life (NSAL) is a comprehensive and detailed study of mental disorders and mental health of American adults and adolescents of African and Caribbean black descent. Over the past two years of the current NIMH grant, more than 70 authors from approximately a dozen national and international institutions have worked extensively on NSAL analyses and papers. This competing continuation application requests funds to extend the NSAL for four years to: 1) complete manuscripts that are currently in process; 2) respond to new lines of research raised by prior and ongoing analyses, and to conduct new analyses regarding the nature, extent, and reasons for racial and ethnic disparities in the prevalence rates of mental disorders and treatment for symptoms of psychopathology. These issues will be addressed across race and ethnic groups using the NSAL, the National Latino and Asian American Study (NLAAS); and 3) maintain and implement new training programs for scholars and students interested in using NSAL data.

"Designing Culturally and Socially Valid Interventions DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The overarching goal of the proposed mentored career award is to provide the applicant with the necessary skills to launch an independent research program focusing on the development of culturally and socially valid interventions for Asian American families affected by physical abuse. The applicant is well qualified for this award based on her strong training in two lines of research: mental health care for ethnic minorities and (2) mental health needs associated with child maltreatment. However, to meet her career objective she requires additional instruction and mentorship in: (1) intervention design, implementation, and evaluation; (2) translation of findings from the basic behavioral sciences to intervention development; (3) family, community and institutional engagement in intervention research and dissemination; (4) advanced data analysis appropriate for evaluation research; and (5) ethics in the conduct of mental health research with ethnic minority children. This training plan will enable the applicant to establish a methodology for producing, implementing, disseminating and evaluating culturally relevant interventions to target abusive parenting, thereby reducing child mental health problems in ethnic minority families. The research plan is divided into three phases. Phase 1 is an observational study that will identify culturally salient correlates of physical abuse in Asian-American families. In Phase 2, an existing evidence based parent training intervention for physical abuse will be augmented to include newly designed treatment components to address the culturally salient risk factors for abuse identified in Phase 1. Phase 3 will involve a limited test of the proposed intervention to provide an initial estimate of its efficacy. The product of this research will be an empirically derived, culturally responsive intervention for physical abuse in Asian  American families ready for implementation and evaluation in a future study.

"The Collaborative Center for Trauma and Mental Health Disparities    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  We propose to establish a five-year, multi-ethnic and multi-disciplinary ""Collaborative Center for Trauma and Mental Health"" (CCTMHD) to promote interdisciplinary research examining the prevalence and impact of traumatic experiences on PTSD, depression and concomitant cognitive/emotional, behavioral, psychological and biological processes in ethnic minority populations. The overarching aim is to inform new strategies to reduce mental health disparities associated with trauma exposure. Multiple sources of acute and chronic stress combine to have a cumulative effect in the lives of ethnic minorities, giving rise to our use of the conceptual framework of allostatic load to (1) describe the socio-cultural context in which violence occurs; (2) examine cultural differences in the appraisal of traumatic events; (3) identify protective and vulnerability factors within ethnic groups; and (4) characterize the expression of mental health symptoms and help-seeking that contribute to mental health disparities. The Center, led by Dr. Gail Wyatt in collaboration with an experienced team of minority mental health researchers includes an Administrative Core, which will coordinate and integrate all Center activities including mentoring of investigators and a Methods & Statistics Core, which will be responsible for providing methodological support to all Center investigators and projects. Project 1 is a 4-year, longitudinal study, ""Intimate Partner Violence and Mental Health Outcomes among Latinas"", led by Dr. M. Rodriguez. He will investigate the longitudinal course of PTSD and depression, attachment and related biological sequelae in an existing cohort of 205 Latina mothers, who vary on intimate partner violence histories. Project 2, ""Disclosure & Appraisal of Child Sexual Abuse (CSA): Relationships with PTSD, Depression, & Associated Biomarkers"" is led by Drs. J. Vargas-Carmona and T. Loeb. This 2-year pilot study focuses on the impact of CSA disclosure and self-blame among 110 Black and Latina women with CSA histories. Project 3, a 2-year pilot study, ""Coping among Ethnic Men Sexually Abused as Children"", is led by Dr. F. Galvan. He will recruit 150 Latino and Black men to examine ethnic differences in coping strategies and their role as possible moderators or mediators of psychological distress, biological effects of childhood sexual trauma and mental health service utilization. This Center will stimulate state-of-the-art research on trauma and mental health disparities, and inform the development of future interventions to close these gaps.        ",The Collaborative Center for Trauma and Mental Health Disparities,7275269,P50MH073453,[''],NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,P50,2007,745882,0.08250169991418697
"Diversity Workshop at ENAR DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The purpose of this application is to enhance an ongoing annual workshop on the recruitment, retention, and promotion of biostatisticians of color at the annual meeting of the Eastern North Atlantic Region (ENAR) of the International Biometric Society (IBS), which is the major annual conference for biostatisticians in academia and government. The first enhancement is to add a mental health research focus in a context that stimulates future and current researchers from underrepresented minorities to pursue graduate studies and careers in biostatistics. The second enhancement is to obtain secure, long-term funding for the workshop, which since its inception in 1999 has been minimally funded by a mix of sources. With this Conference Grant, NIMH will provide continuity to the workshop so that it will receive the advanced publicity and planning necessary for drawing the necessary attendees and making the desired impact that is needed in biostatistics and mental health research. More significantly from NIMH's point of view, it will be providing prospective and current biostatisticians exposure to mental health research, which in turn will help increase the number of biostatisticians, in general, and biostatisticians of color in particular, who are committed to mental health research and related areas of biomedical comorbidities. The workshop will target undergraduates with majors in math, statistics, or quantitative psychology, from local Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs), Hispanic-Serving Institutions (HSIs), and Native American Tribal Colleges (TCs), graduate students in biostatistics programs, faculty members at HBCUs, HSIs, and TCs who may serve as advisors and/or mentors to the undergraduates, faculty from graduate biostatistics programs with collaborations in mental health and other biomedical areas, and statistical and mental health representatives from industry and governmental agencies. Through interactive sessions featuring workshop participants, the workshop will offer in-depth coverage of a variety of key topics in three general areas in the context of health promotion (e.g., mental health): (1) the experiences and expectations of graduate biostatistics students of color; (2) career opportunities for persons of color with advanced degrees in biostatistics; and 3) networking among students and professional from academia, industry, and government.

"Addressing Cultural Factors and Mental Health Disparities in Research and Practic    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Abstract. This Conference Grant application is to request funding to support three annual conferences aimed at sharing state of the art scientific research and best professional practices to address the mental health disparities of racial/ethnic minorities and immigrants. The successive themes for the three years are (a) addressing the intersections between race and culture in scientific research and mental health service delivery for children, adolescents, and families; and (b) examination of the intersection of culture, race, and trauma and mental health across the life span; and (c) racial identity and cultural factors in treatment and service delivery (Each conference builds upon the recommendations of Dr. David Satcher's supplemental report, Mental Health: Culture, Race, and Ethnicity; the President's New Freedom Commission on Mental Health Report: Achieving the Promise: Transforming Mental Health Care in America; the mission of NIMH; as well as the longstanding objectives of the Institute for the Study and Promotion of Race and Culture (ISPRC) at Boston College. In an effort to reduce mental health disparities among People of Color relative to non-minorities, each conference involves sharing innovative, pragmatic, and empirically based strategies for delineating and addressing the mental health burdens of ethnic and linguistic minorities. The primary common goals and objectives of each of the conferences are to: (1) Share state of the art mental health theory, research, and practice with respect to the roles of race and culture in the etiology, maintenance, and remediation of mental health disparities; (2) Use strategies to engage scientist- practitioners and mental health service providers in interdisciplinary communication and collaboration to address the role of culture and race in their research, practice, and service delivery. (3) Develop and disseminate information regarding race and culture and mental health disparities. Speakers for the conference will be nationally and internationally acknowledged researchers and clinicians presenting in their areas of expertise via interactive formats. Each of the thematic 2-day conferences will take place at the Diversity Challenge conference at Boston College in successive years, October of 2007, 2008, and 2009. Each thematic conference will be characterized by varied formats consisting of plenary sessions, individual presentations, concurrent workgroups, roundtable discussions, and informational poster and exhibit sessions intended to achieve the stated aims. Proceedings from the conference will be disseminated through published monographs, and on the ISPRC web site. Thematic books based on each conference will be co-edited by the co-PIs. The conference grant addresses mental health disparities of People of Color in the United States. This focus is consistent with the Surgeon General's Supplemental Report on Race, Culture, and Mental Health, the President's New Freedom Commission report, and the mission of NIMH, which identified these populations as being at significant public health risk and called for interventions to eliminate the health disparities.          ",Addressing Cultural Factors and Mental Health Disparities in Research and Practic,7277384,R13MH078714,"['Provider ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Etiology ', ' disease causation ', ' causation ', ' Causality ', ' Address ', ' Caring ', ' Applications Grants ', ' Grant Proposals ', ' Exhibits ', ' Family ', ' Freedom ', ' Liberty ', ' base ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Adolescent ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Institutes ', ' Individual ', ' Linguistics ', ' Linguistic ', ' Longevity ', ' lifespan ', ' life span ', ' Length of Life ', ' Funding ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Maintenance ', ' Americas ', ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health Services ', ' Mental Hygiene Services ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' Mission ', ' National Institute of Mental Health (U.S.) ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' NIMH ', ' Internet ', ' world wide web ', ' web ', ' WWW ', ' Collaborations ', ' Immigrant ', ' Monograph ', ' Professional Practice ', ' health care professional practice ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' Publishing ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' posters ', ' Arts ', ' Scientist ', ' United States ', ' day ', ' college ', ' collegiate ', ' Services ', ' Surgeon ', ' Books ', ' Boston ', ' Reporting ', ' Interdisciplinary Communication ', ' Multidisciplinary Communication ', ' Cross-Disciplinary Communication ', ' Relative (related person) ', ' Relative ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' abstracting ', ' symposium ', ' conference ', ' Proceedings and Conferences ', ' theories ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Color ', ' Minority ', ' remediation ', ' Population ', ' Trauma ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' Proceedings, Conference ', ' ']",NIMH,BOSTON COLLEGE,R13,2007,123391,0.013919371030323162
"Fostering Mental Health Research in Psychiatry Residents    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There is a critical lack of minority physician scientists engaged in and leading mental health clinical research. The proposed research educational program addresses this gap in targeting primarily minority psychiatry residents attending a small HBCU medical school, Morehouse School of Medicine, and partners - for the fourth year research elective - with the much larger, research oriented, Department of Psychiatry of Emory University School of Medicine. The proposed program permeates the four-year residency training program. By the end of the second year, the residents are becoming competent in evidence-based medicine principles, are research literate, and have participated in ongoing research projects. Collaboration with Emory assures a wide variety of experienced investigators with sponsored research, augmented by Morehouse's own resources, from which the PGY IV resident can select a mentor and research project. In addition to traditional research training subjects, this directly addresses cultural competency in mental health research, including bioethical, biological and psychological issues of minority populations in research content and conduct, and as a means to decreasing mental health disparities. The program will also facilitate a bridge to postdoctoral training and mentoring. Furthermore, the practice of mentoring others will be instilled in the participants, and they will be encouraged to mentor those in earlier years of training. The specific aims include: support educational experiences relevant to conducting mental health related clinical research that will attract, train and further career development of primarily under-represented minority physician scientists; provide mentored clinical research opportunities that will encourage physician scientists to embark on research projects directly applicable to clinical practice and transitional research; assure the training and experience necessary to progress to the next step of the participants careers, either by entering a research postdoctoral fellowship or by joining an existing research environment; and establish the feasibility of a paradigm of smaller medical schools, especially those with large minority residency programs, to partner with larger, more research oriented, local medical schools to provide more advanced training that otherwise would not possible.           ",Fostering Mental Health Research in Psychiatry Residents,7279308,R25MH071735,"['health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Environment ', ' Address ', ' Caring ', ' Doctor of Philosophy ', ' PhD ', ' Ph.D. ', ' Research Training ', ' Underrepresented Minority ', ' underserved minority ', ' under-represented minority ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Fellowship ', ' Fibrinogen ', ' Factor One ', ' Factor I ', ' Coagulation Factor One ', ' Coagulation Factor I ', ' Blood Factor One ', ' Blood Coagulation Factor One ', ' Blood Coagulation Factor I ', ' Journals ', ' Magazine ', ' career ', ' Goals ', ' improved ', ' Housing ', ' Clinical ', ' Biological ', ' psychologic ', ' psychological ', ' Training ', ' literacy ', ' Educational workshop ', ' Workshop ', ' Fostering ', ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mentors ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Collaborations ', ' Physicians ', ' Staging ', ' Psychiatrist ', ' Psychiatry ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Residencies ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Rotation ', ' medical schools ', ' school of medicine ', ' medical college ', ' Evidence Based Medicine ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' Training Programs ', ' Translating ', ' Universities ', ' Mental disorders ', ' psychological disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Drug Formulations ', ' Formulation ', ' experience ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Basic Science ', ' Basic Research ', ' literate ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Minority ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' post-doctoral training ', ' postdoctoral training ', ' Historically Black Colleges and Universities ', ' Historically Black University ', ' Historically Black Institution ', ' Historically Black Colleges ', ' HBCUs ', ' ']",NIMH,MOREHOUSE SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,R25,2007,233303,0.09732233521145747
"Improving Depression Treatment for Latinas    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Latinos comprise one of the fastest growing racial/ethnic populations in the United States, currently constituting 14% of the total U.S. population. The increasing rate of Latinos will undoubtedly increase the number of people at risk for mental health disorders. Latina women will be at heightened risk since previous studies have found greater lifetime prevalence of mental health disorders, especially depression, in comparison to men. Social capital is a promising construct with which investigators may examine a community's capacity to respond to challenges and promote individual-level health. However, the relation between social capital and mental health in ethnic minority populations remains unclear.

"Disparities Among Children Served by the CMHS Children's Services Program    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application is submitted by the Johns Hopkins University and ORC Macro in response to PA-04-019, which encourages applications focusing on the Center for Mental Health Services' (CMHS) Comprehensive Community Mental Health Services for Children and Their Families Program. Since 1993, CMHS has provided funding to 121 grantees to develop service systems to provide a comprehensive spectrum of mental health and other support services to children with serious emotional disturbance (SED) and their families. We are proposing to analyze data available from approximately 69,000 youth served and 28,000 youth enrolled in the monitoring component of the study in order to investigate racial/ethnic, gender, and age differences in the characteristics of youth entering the program and disparities in the services received and outcomes. The project has three aims. Aim 1. Describe characteristics of youth at baseline for all 121 Service Programs initiated since 1993 (and any added during the study period) and identify trends in these baseline characteristics across this time period. Aim 2. Investigate the potential disparities at baseline and in treatment outcomes for youth enrolled in the program. Aim 3. Identify the determinants of treatment trajectories and also the determinants of disparities in treatment outcomes over time. We hypothesize that the characteristics of youth served will vary over time and that disparities in outcomes will become less over time. This research will identify gaps in our current services and the extent to which disparities remain a challenge, even in our nation's model program.           ",Disparities Among Children Served by the CMHS Children's Services Program,7258827,R01MH075828,[''],NIMH,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R01,2007,422215,0.04558792375364972
"M-RISP at San Francisco State University    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  San Francisco State University (SFSU) requests funds for the renewal, continuation and expansion of our highly successful M-RISP program, currently in the second year of its initial three-year funding. The goal of the program is to enhance the institutional capacity of SFSU by conducting mental health research projects that are responsive to NIMH priorities and can potentially be funded through regular R01 and R03 mechanisms. Situated within an academic institution committed to ethnic diversity and responsive to the needs of ethnic minority communities, our M-RISP program emphasizes research that addresses mental health disparities among ethnic minority groups in the United States. In addition, we aim to increase the number of ethnic minority Principal Investigators funded by NIMH. To achieve these goals, we propose to conduct a set of faculty mentoring, networking, and institutional development activities, many of which have been piloted successfully within our current M-RISP program, including the implementation of structured ""proposal development groups"" and methodological/statistical workshops. Through intramural competitions, we will select 12 junior faculty members and mentor them in the development of mental health research proposals to be submitted extramurally. We will also support the implementation of four new individual faculty projects that address mental health concerns in African American, Latino, Asian and Native American populations. The results obtained from these four projects will be incorporated as preliminary studies in future R01 submissions by the four investigators.      All activities will be conducted under the direction of Dr. Rafael Diaz, M-RISP Program Director, a developmental psychologist whose research has been funded by different institutes at NIH for the past 10 years.

"NLAAS II: Unraveling Differences for Clinical Services    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This continuation application requests three-years of support to investigate differences in the correlates of psychiatric illness and mental health service disparities among Asian Americans and Latinos as compared to non-Latino Whites. We will use recently collected data from the National Latino and Asian American Study (NLAAS), a national psychiatric epidemiologic study conducted to measure psychiatric disorders and mental health service usage in a representative sample of Asians and Latinos, and the National Comorbidity Study Replication (NCS-R). The combined NLAAS/NCS-R data are the best available to address critical questions regarding the level of service disparities, and the identification of service disparities ""hot spots."" In this resubmission, we apply an innovative conceptual framework to organize correlates for psychiatric illness, mental health service use and mental health service disparities, giving attention to health system and contextual factors in addition to traditional individual level factors. Specifically, our aims are to: (1) Use combined data from the NLAAS and the NCS-R to: compare prevalence of psychiatric disorders and mental health service use among Latinos, Asian, and non-Latino Whites; investigate hypotheses related to differences in the correlates of illness and mental health services; and assess bias in disorder prevalence and service use, (2) Apply the IOM definition of disparities to quantify disparities in services utilization and identify potential mechanisms underlying services disparities, and (3) Apply methods from spatial epidemiology to identify ""hot spots"" of mental health service disparities at the MSA level, and investigate health care system factors associated with high and low performing MSAs. This study will provide national baseline data on which to define the progress and measurable targets for mental health service disparity improvements for Latinos and Asian Americans as compared to non-Latino Whites. In addition, it will identify health system factors measured at the community and individual level that mediate disparities and can be targeted by policymakers. Finally, it will provide policymakers with information regarding where in the US mental health service disparities are unusually high. These findings can be used to target resources, develop coherent public policies, and inform guidelines aimed at making mental health prevention and treatment services more responsive and sensitive to the needs of ethnic/racial minorities.

"M-RISP at San Diego State University    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  We request funds to continue and expand our very successful M-RISP. Our goal is still to enhance the capacity of SDSU to conduct mental health research that is responsive to NIMH priorities and that leads to applications that can be funded through RO1 and R03 mechanisms. We are dedicated to promoting and supporting high quality mental health research, focused on ethnic disparities. Faculty obtain release time, funded through the M-RISP and matched by the university, through an intramural research competition. Several minority students are supported and assist the faculty. A systematic and extensive plan for educating both M-RISP faculty and students about high quality mental health research is proposed, with the help of collaborators from UCSD. Support for faculty presentations of their research findings will be made available, a brown bag will be established so faculty can receive feedback about their research ideas before implementation, and biostatistical consulting, mentoring, and a mental health colloquium series are included. These activities will 1) increase research collaborations among faculty members at SDSU and research-intensive institutions; 2) establish national and international faculty networks for mental health research; 3) increase the number of faculty members who seek and obtain RO1-level extramural funding; and 4) increase faculty research productivity, as demonstrated by peer-reviewed presentations and publications. The number of ethnic minority investigators who conduct research to address the NIMH priorities and who become funded by NIMH will increase. In addition, three Independent Investigator projects associated with the M-RISP core are proposed. They include: studies examining the effects of marital satisfaction on mental health, the impact of national identification on the mental health of minorities, and the coping strategies employed by minority adolescents and their effects on mental health. All of the independent investigators address current NIMH priorities, and their research is relevant to public health because it will increase the understanding of ethnic differences in the causes and cures of mental health problems. Interventions tailored to help minorities overcome their unique barriers to receiving treatment can be designed better as a result of the proposed research.

"Culturally Responsive Person-Centered Care for Psychosis    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Patient-centered care has become increasingly important over the past several decades, though the translation of these principles into clinical practices that customize care on an individual basis have been markedly inconsistent. This gap between principles and practices is especially evident in the context of public sector care for people with psychosis. As documented thoroughly in the Surgeon General's recent report Mental Health: Culture, Race, and Ethnicity (2001), the disenfranchisement of adults with psychosis is further accentuated among ethnic/racial minority communities in urban environments.  The proposed study addresses these health disparities through qualitative and experimental evaluations of two complementary approaches to culturally responsive person-centered care for psychosis. The study has the following three specific aims: 1) to describe perceived barriers to, and benefits of, processes of help-seeking, participation in psychiatric care, and illness self-management efforts among low-income adults of color being treated for psychosis; 2) to evaluate the effectiveness of a facilitated approach to person-centered care with and without the augmentation of a community integration program in increasing customization of care over a 6 and 18-month period of outpatient treatment. Primary outcomes of person centered care are hypothesized to be increases in illness self-management and satisfaction with services, and secondary outcomes to be decreased symptoms and enhanced clinical and functional status and quality of life; and 3) to test a theoretical model that stipulates relationships between ethnic identity, community resources, and degree of cultural responsiveness and collaboration present in relationships between patients and outpatient mental health providers in mediating customization of care among an urban population of low-income adults of color.  By identifying critical factors that promote effective patient-provider partnerships, this project enhances prospects for person-centered care and self-management of psychosis for low-income urban communities of color. If successful in the state of Connecticut, the project will offer a model that then can be replicated throughout the country to enhance care for this historically underserved population.           ",Culturally Responsive Person-Centered Care for Psychosis,7252513,R01MH067687,"['Provider ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Low income ', ' Environment ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Caring ', ' Data ', ' Range ', ' Process ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' base ', ' urban area ', ' Health Personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Housing ', ' Psychiatric therapeutic procedure ', ' psychiatric treatment ', ' psychiatric therapy ', ' psychiatric care ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Medical ', ' Interview ', ' Evaluation ', ' Psyche structure ', ' mental ', ' Individual ', ' satisfaction ', ' Patient-Centered Care ', ' Funding ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Medicine ', ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' Theoretical model ', ' Theoretic Models ', ' Collaborations ', ' Outpatients ', ' Out-patients ', ' Patients ', ' Psychotic Disorders ', ' Psychoses ', ' Public Sector ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Condition ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Social isolation ', ' Stigmata ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Victimization ', ' Testing ', ' Translating ', ' Translations ', ' Unemployment ', ' unemployed ', ' out of work ', ' joblessness ', ' jobless ', ' Urban Population ', ' Investigation ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' Country ', ' Services ', ' preference ', ' Surgeon ', ' American ', ' functional status ', ' mental health center ', ' Participant ', ' help-seeking behavior ', ' help seeking ', ' Reporting ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Mediating ', ' Self Management ', ' Modeling ', ' social stigma ', ' stigma ', ' Color ', ' Communities ', ' Community Mental Health Centers ', ' CMHC ', ' Underserved Population ', ' underserved people ', ' under served population ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Community Integration ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' person centered ', ' Connecticut ', ' ']",NIMH,CONNECTICUT ST DEPT OF MH/ADDICTION SRVS,R01,2007,448216,0.04011383547644064
"National Survey of American Life    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The National Study of African American Mental Health (NSAA) is the most comprehensive and detailed study of the mental health of black Americans ever conducted. The National Survey of American Life (NSAL) conducted as part of the NSAA is an extensive, complex, and innovative sample survey designed to explore intra-and inter-group racial and ethnic differences in mental disorders, psychological distress and informal and formal service use, as they are manifested in the context of a variety of stressors, risk and resilient factors, and coping resources, among national adult samples. The samples include blacks of African descent (African Americans) (N=3,589), the first ever, national probability study of blacks of Caribbean descent (Afro-Caribbeans) (N= 1,604), and non-Hispanic whites (Americans largely of European descent) (N= 1,006).

"Training Future Generations of Mental Health Researchers DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  In order to meet the nation's growing need for researchers in clinical psychiatry, translational neuroscience, and interventions/mental health services research, we propose in this competing renewal of R25 MH60473-06 to continue our Junior Faculty Scholars (JFS) program, designed to assist newly appointed assistant professors earn K23 and K01 awards. Of 22 scholar participants in the program, 16 have submitted K awards, 15 have been reviewed to date, and 13 (86.7%) have been funded (6 on the first submission, 7 on the second submission); this compares with an NIMH-wide success rate of 36% over the past five years. The JFS program encompasses a two-year period of 25% salary support, a weekly research survival skills practicum, mentoring by a senior mental health researcher, availability of seed money support, and access to data management and biostatistical support. Scholars also participate in workshops designed to enhance knowledge of biostatistics, psychiatric genetics, neuroimaging, and mental health interventions and services research.      In order to correct another remediable ""leak"" from the pipeline of new mental health researchers, we also propose to broaden the scope of the current JFS program to assist further development of scholars who have obtained K awards toward two additional career-development objectives: (1) R01 support; and (2) enhanced mentoring skills. We will help Scholars and their Mentors develop intensive long-term mentoring plans to realize these two developmental objectives, thereby enlarging a dedicated cadre of mentors in psychiatric research. At the same time we are committed to maintaining our efforts to help minority researchers (primarily African American) launch and maintain their careers in mental health research, an objective we will pursue in collaboration with the University's new EXPORT Center.      Our Research Education Evaluation plan will track the success of Scholars in competing for research career development (K01 or K23) and subsequent R01 awards (Specific Aim 1) and mid-career independent scientist awards (K02 or K24) (Specific Aim 2); as well as the success of under-represented minority Scholars in garnering career-development and other competitive research support (Specific Aim 3).

"New Mexico Mental Health Mentorship/Education Program    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The New Mexico Mentorship and Education Program (MEP) focuses on minority mental health issues in primary care settings, especially disparities in mental health outcomes. An intensive, one-week annual training institute introduces mental health services research to minority junior faculty members and graduate students from Southwest institutions. The MEP also enhances ongoing mentorship relationships with outstanding mental health researchers. The NIMH National Advisory Mental Health Council has designated the MEP as a high program priority. By this competitive continuation application, we will strengthen the successful program by expanding it in two important ways: a) By recruiting minority primary care practitioners (PCPs) based at community health centers, the MEP will address the importance of ""translational"" research to bridge the nationally recognized gap between research and real-life practice settings, b) A new component will lead to recruitment of minority researchers and mentors who focus on geriatric mental health services in minority populations.      The MEP's specific aims are as follows: 1) Due to the difficulties that minority junior faculty members, graduate students, and practitioners have experienced in obtaining suitable training that helps them compete for research support, we will teach trainees basic research methods in this field, with an emphasis on how to write proposals and manage funded proposals. 2) To enhance the translation of research into real life practice settings, we will introduce university-based and community-based trainees to important recent findings of mental health services research, with special emphasis on research concerning the disparities in mental health outcomes that affect minority populations of the Southwest. 3) Because of the isolation and marginalization experienced by young minority researchers, we will establish networks among these trainees and nationally prominent research mentors. 4) Recognizing the challenges that minority graduate students, faculty members, and practitioners face in obtaining and retaining work positions that foster research activities, we will help trainees with various aspects of ""career development."" 5) Due to the difficulties of organizing training programs in the many locations where junior minority researchers live and work, we will produce a minority-oriented mental health services research curriculum that is exportable to other educational institutions and primary care practice sites. 6) To facilitate continuity of training and mentoring as junior investigators try to advance in their careers, we will initiate an ongoing sequence of training sessions in mental health services research on an annual basis. 7) Because of the sparse research conducted about the mental health problems of minority elders, we will initiate a new emphasis on mental health services research focusing on the older, minority populations of the Southwest.               ",New Mexico Mental Health Mentorship/Education Program,7282429,R25MH060288,"['Educational Curriculum ', ' Curriculum ',

"Supporting Mental Health of African American Elders    This application is in response to the NIMH program announcement ""Intervention and Practice Research Infrastructure Program"" {IP-RISP; PAR -04-015). We propose a collaborative  partnership between a research center (Center for Applied Research on Aging and Health, CARAH) at Thomas Jefferson University, and a senior center in the Philadelphia Region, Center in the Park (CIP). CIP is a certified senior center. It has received numerous awards for its innovative programming for the 6,000 community-living urban elders it serves; over 85% of whom is African American. Building on our existing collaborative platform, we plan to implement a partner program, entitled ""In Touch: Mind, Body and Spirit"". The overall goal of this program is to create a sustainable infrastructure in a community setting for systematic mental health research, programming and its evaluation and research training that is responsive to the social and cultural tenets of the target group. The partnership is guided by a well-established collaborative model and is based in the tradition of action science in that it seeks to develop a ""community of inquiry"" within a ""community of practice."" It employs multimethodologies to evaluate infrastructure viability and sustainability and generate knowledge that is relevant and useful to the community which CIP serves. The three broad programmatic aims are to: 1) Develop, implement and evaluate a sustainable infrastructure for the In Touch: Mind, Body and Spirit program including a governance structure, and an electronic data management system with outcome reporting capacity and support of field-based clinical research; 2) Implement three exploratory pilot studies to test the infrastructure and advance knowledge of the adaptive mechanisms and mental health needs of older African American men and women with differing functional status; and 3) Develop, implement and evaluate research training activities including experiential and on-site involvement for health professionals (geriatric fellows, students in medicine, nursing, occupational therapy and physical therapy) that are integrated with the pilot research efforts including how to: a) design collaborative-based clinical research, b) identify culturally relevant research questions to advance knowledge on mental health issues of the target population, c) carry out clinical research in mental health and aging in an applied setting; and d) translate evidence-based programs for the target group. The exploratory studies we plan to implement are theoretically-driven. They are designed to identify and understand the broad range of adaptive strategies and self-care practices that afford positive mental health outcomes for older African American men and women experiencing a range of age-related losses. The three exploratory studies logically and incrementally build on the other moving from descriptive to associative to predictive type research questions. These include an: 1) exploration of domains of concern with the aging process and the adaptive and cultural mechanisms for offsetting loss including symptom presentation and treatment seeking for mental health concerns among African American elders; 2) examination of differential patterns of adaptive strategy use and mental health outcomes for African American men and women with different functional status; and 3) evaluation of an intervention protocol to promote positive mental health (self-efficacy, reduced depressive symptoms) among a group of African Americans elders identified at high risk for adverse psychological well-being. Thus, initial studies will form the basis for developing and testing linguistically and culturally appropriate interventions for African American elders with different health profiles as well as the ways in which current evidence-based programs need to be translated to fit this cultural group.

"MHREG for Research in Ethnically Diverse Communities    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): As the nation becomes more racially and ethnically diverse, novel approaches to research and research education are needed to decrease the burden of mental illness. Mood disorders are a leading cause of disability and a powerful contributor to mortality, including deaths by suicide. Treatments for mood disorders among Blacks and Latinos require innovative research models responsive to economic disparities, culturally- mediated preferences and expectations of treatment, and the co-morbidities that disproportionately affect people of color such as substance misuse and medical illness. Meeting this scientific and public health challenge requires innovation in the education of clinical scientists. New collaborations involving university and community partners must be developed, given the central roles that community agencies play in the lives of the emerging majority, and the understandable reluctance of many ethnic minorities to seek treatment in the existing specialized mental health care delivery system. The Rochester Program of Research and Innovation in Disparities Education (Rochester PRIDE) is a novel training program designed to inspire and prepare trainees to conduct mental health research in partnership with community agencies. Over the next five years, we will 1) enhance our established research training partnerships with community agencies in a manner that facilitates trainee research, 2) recruit and educate at least 25 trainees from psychology and medicine in a core didactic curriculum that features a new, multidisciplinary seminar titled ""Race, Socioeconomic Status and Health in the Urban Setting"", 3) implement an innovative collaborative mentoring- precepting program that teaches trainees how to develop and implement research in community settings, 4) evaluate PRIDE by monitoring trainee outcomes and by soliciting and reviewing feedback from an external Evaluator, and 5) disseminate our findings by convening symposia and publishing peer-reviewed articles describing program design, implementation, and outcomes. This multidisciplinary research education program will be highly attractive to trainees who seek to gain skills and knowledge to conduct research in real-world settings. Rochester PRIDE will also serve as a model for other mental health training and educational programs designed to meet the nation's changing public health needs. By the end of the Award period, we will have sufficient experience and data to disseminate the program's findings and expand its scope by adding trainees interested in research on children and adolescents. As well, we will consider adding trainees at other developmental levels or from other disciplines.           ",MHREG for Research in Ethnically Diverse Communities,7274320,R25MH074898,"['Educational Curriculum ', ' Curriculum ', ' Discrimination (Psychology) ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Legal ', ' Caribbean natives ', ' Economics ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Elements ', ' Environment ', ' Address ', ' Caring ', ' Data ', ' Research Training ', ' Monitor ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Faculty ', ' Family Practice ', ' family medicine ', ' Feedback ', ' Foundations ', ' Affect ', ' Africa ', ' base ', ' career ', ' Hand ', ' Health Status ', ' Level of Health ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Site ', ' Solid ', ' Clinical ', ' Biological ', ' Medical ', ' Adolescent ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' racism ', ' Caribbean region ', ' West Indies Region ', ' Caribbean Sea Region ', ' Caribbean ', ' Publishing Peer Reviews ', ' Training ', ' disability ', ' Latin America ', ' Learning ', ' Discipline ', ' Numbers ', ' health care service utilization ', ' healthcare utilization ', ' healthcare service utilization ', ' health services utilization ', ' Health Care Utilization ', ' African ', ' Educational workshop ', ' Workshop ', ' Interdisciplinary Study ', ' Multidisciplinary Research ', ' Multidisciplinary Collaboration ', ' Interdisciplinary Research ', ' Battered Women ', ' abuse of women ', ' abuse of females ', ' Abused women ', ' Abused females ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Medicine ', ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health Services ', ' Mental Hygiene Services ', ' Mentors ', ' Mission ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Mortality ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' Epidemiologic Studies ', ' epidemiologic investigation ', ' Epidemiology Research ', ' Epidemiological Studies ', ' Epidemiologic Research ', ' Collaborations ', ' Immigrant ', ' Press Releases ', ' Nuts ', ' Physicians ', ' Play ', ' Poverty ', ' Preventive Medicine ', ' preventative medicine ', ' Psychiatry ', ' Psychologist ', ' Psychology ', ' Clinical Psychology ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' recruit ', ' Nature ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Rest ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Social support ', ' social support network ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Medical Students ', ' Educational process of instructing ', ' Teaching ', ' Scientist ', ' Training Programs ', ' Travel ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' Voice ', ' Work ', ' Automobile Driving ', ' driving ', ' Award ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' Mental disorders ', ' psychological disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Mood Disorders ', ' Affective Disorders ', ' psychosocial ', ' interest ', ' Postdoctoral Fellow ', ' post-doctoral ', ' post-doc ', ' Research Associate ', ' Postdoc ', ' preference ', ' experience ', ' care delivery ', ' knowledge base ', ' knowledgebase ', ' skills ', ' expectation ', ' novel ', ' Prevention strategy ', ' Preventive strategy ', ' research study ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' Relative (related person) ', ' Relative ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Police ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' symposium ', ' conference ', ' Latino ', ' Mediating ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' diverse populations ', ' Research Methodology ', ' Research Methods ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Modeling ', ' desire ', ' Cities ', ' Color ', ' Communities ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Minority ', ' suicidal morbidity ', ' suicide morbidity ', ' suicide death ', ' novel strategies ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel approaches ', ' new approaches ', ' Outcome ', ' Community Integration ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' community based participatory research ', ' health training ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF ROCHESTER,R25,2007,225869,0.029837204674584044
"CSULB Minority Research Infrastructure Support Program    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This resubmission of a M-RISP grant application aims to develop the mental health disparities research capability of faculty in the Departments of Psychology and Human Development at California State University, Long Beach (CSULB). Situated in a highly diverse ethnic metropolitan region, CSULB has abundant opportunities and needs for research relevant to understanding and reducing health disparities in populations with different cultural backgrounds. An M-RISP award would provide opportunities for faculty development in research that would complement the existing strengths and reinforce the momentum of research productivity by faculty. Our M-RISP fosters individualized plans for training participants with the long range objective of producing competitive research applications for extramural funding. It would (1) involve faculty members in conducting pilot work that would lead to a competitive research grant on mental health disparities; (2) increase graduate and undergraduate student research participation, (3) provide research development activities for faculty; and (4) strengthen the institutional infrastructure for mental health research. Our M-RISP would provide reassigned time for participants that would be matched by the College of Liberal Arts and the Department of Psychology, payment for participants, clerical services, travel funds, equipment funds, and state of the art research skill training for faculty development that will enable them to conduct high quality research. Participants would receive seminars and workshops in quantitative research methods and analysis (e.g., web-based survey, daily diary method, structural equation modeling), as well as qualitative research methods and analysis (e.g., interviewing, qualitative interpretation), accompanied by bi-weekly colloquia including faculty and student presentations of their own research and guest speakers and a variety of other enrichment activities. Our M-RISP activities will be closely coordinated with an existing Career Opportunities in Research (COR) program funded by NIMH at CSULB since 1981 to mentor minority undergraduates toward doctoral studies. The three projects proposed here represent crucial areas of mental health research - 1) acculturation, stress and coping among Korean immigrants; 2) sibling influences on coping in families with a child with Type 2 diabetes; 3) cultural factors related to disclosure by rape victims, and its effect on mental health. The award would be timely because recent fiscal cutbacks by the State of California have reduced University resources for research even though the University has shown that it values and rewards research productivity.              ",CSULB Minority Research Infrastructure Support Program,7254838,R24MH073882,[''],NIMH,CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY LONG BEACH,R24,2007,457987,0.08873455436078269
"Trauma and Loss-Related Mental Health Needs of Latina Immigrants in Communities    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The PI, Stacey I. Kaltman, Ph.D., is a clinical psychologist who wishes to gain the skills and knowledge required to be an independent mental health services researcher focused on understanding and ameliorating disparities in access to and use of mental health services among low-income Latino immigrants in the US. The overall goal of this proposal is to gain an understanding of trauma and loss-related mental health needs of Latina immigrants from Central America and begin to develop culturally and linguistically competent services that are acceptable, effective, and accessible. This will be achieved via extensive training in Spanish as well as instruction in public health theory and methods. The specific training goals of the proposal are: 1) to increase cultural and linguistic competence to work with Latina immigrants with trauma exposure; 2) to utilize qualitative research methods to learn from the Latina immigrant's perspective about symptom perception, influences on help-seeking, and characteristics of culturally relevant interventions; 3) to apply formative research to the development and evaluation of community-based interventions; and 4) to enhance quantitative data analysis skills, building toward competence in longitudinal data analysis techniques that will be applied to intervention trials and program evaluations. The primary mentor will be Bonnie L. Green, PhD, with co-mentor Maria Cecilia Zea, PhD. Training will employ a balance of didactic coursework, mentored tutorials and critical discussions, and ongoing participation in research work groups. The research plan includes three studies, which encompass four research aims that relate directly to the training goals: 1) To study trauma and loss exposure and its mental health impact from the perspective of low-income Latina immigrants from Central America in community service settings; 2) To examine the mental and physical health correlates of trauma and loss exposure in a random sample of Central American immigrants who are engaged with community service settings; 3) To understand influences on symptom perception, predictors of help-seeking, and perceptions of culturally relevant trauma and loss-related mental health interventions among Central American immigrants; and 4) To develop and preliminarily pilot an adapted community-based intervention to address the specific trauma and loss-related mental health needs of Central American immigrants.           ",Trauma and Loss-Related Mental Health Needs of Latina Immigrants in Communities,7321153,K23MH077071,"['Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Low income ', ' Economics ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Equilibrium ', ' balance function ', ' balance ', ' Doctor of Philosophy ', ' PhD ', ' Ph.D. ', ' High Prevalence ', ' Characteristics ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' base ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health Services ', ' health care service ', ' Clinical ', ' In-Migration ', ' Immigrations ', ' Training ', ' Psyche structure ', ' mental ', ' Learning ', ' Linguistics ', ' Linguistic ', ' Central American ', "" Women's Group "", ' Female Groups ', ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health Services ', ' Mental Hygiene Services ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' Immigrant ', ' Perception ', ' Poverty ', ' Program Evaluation ', ' Psychologist ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Risk ', ' Social support ', ' social support network ', ' Knowledge ', ' Training Programs ', ' War ', ' Work ', ' Techniques ', ' Country ', ' Services ', ' experience ', ' skills ', ' help-seeking behavior ', ' help seeking ', ' social ', ' Central America ', ' Gender ', ' Intervention Trial ', ' Competence ', ' Hispanics ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Latino ', ' Programmed Learning ', ' Research Methodology ', ' Research Methods ', ' Sampling ', ' Zea ', ' theories ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Communities ', ' Community Services ', ' Latina ', ' Latinas ', ' Qualitative Research ', ' Instruction ', ' neglect ', ' community based evaluation ', ' Trauma ', ' Conflict (Psychology) ', ' Conflict ', ' ']",NIMH,GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY,K23,2007,149884,0.07828981632926012
"Center for Research on Mental Health in Social Services    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  In response to the ACISR Program Announcement, we propose to establish the Center for Research to Improve Mental Health Care in the Social Services (C-RIMSS). Our research agenda addresses quality of mental health care in settings with the highest potential to reduce racial and ethnic disparities. Studies will be conducted in social service agencies, where prevalence of mental disorder is high and vulnerable of clients predominate. A cultural exchange perspective informs our work at the mental health-social service intersect, and across the academic-practice divide. Through the work of seven units, our Operations Core will provide an infrastructure for research, methodological advances, and partnerships with community agencies. The Principal Research Core will support pilot studies to address three aims: (1) understand quality of care for mental disorder in the social services from stakeholder perspective; (2) assess practice variation in quality of care for mental disorder and identify provider, client, and system ecostructure and economic influences on that variation; and (3) working ""trench to bench and back to trench,"" test a menu of quality improvements for mental health care in the social services. The Research Methods Core's two units--Qualitative Methods and Statistical Analysis -- will provide ongoing, state of the art support to investigators. The RMC will support projects and provide consultation for stakeholder preference assessment, quality indicators, and organizational research methods. Our outcomes will include completed pilot projects, generation of RO 1, R21, or R34 studies, scientific publications, strengthened agency partnerships and infrastructure for research, and dissemination of findings to academic and stakeholder networks. Improving mental health care to social service clients can increase treatment to persons whose disorder currently goes undetected, improve the quality of evidence-based care to those who are now served poorly, and reduce racial/ethnic disparities in care. Our research agenda is responsive to the recommendation of the President's New Freedom Commission Report on Mental Health to improve the response to mental disorder in readily accessible and low-stigma settings where a high level of risk for mental health problems exists, especially all federally-funded health and human services.

"Trauma Interventions for Low-income Women in PrimaryCare DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Trauma exposure and trauma-related mental disorders make substantial contributions to widely recognized health disparities in the U. S. Because low-income populations have little access to mental health specialty care and often find it stigmatizing, and because attention to mental health issues in primary care settings is limited, their trauma-related problems receive little if any professional attention. The goal of the Center for Trauma Interventions in Primary Care (C-TIP) is to develop innovative and sustainable interventions to address the spectrum of trauma-related mental health needs presenting to primary care settings serving low-income, mostly minority populations through academic-community research partnerships with local jurisdictions. To increase the adoption and sustainability of these interventions, the trauma-related services to be developed are being conceptualized in close collaboration with three highly invested community partners: the Department of Health in Prince George's County, MD; the Primary Care Coalition in Montgomery County, MD; and Unity Health Care, Inc. in the District of Columbia. The Center will extend the high quality research our Research Infrastructure Support Program (RISP) has already generated in this under-studied population by active collaboration with new academic partners: Georgetown's School of Nursing and Health Studies and its Department of Family Medicine. The Center's work will be conducted through three cores (Operations, Research Methods, and Principal Research) providing administrative oversight, statistical support, and access to expert advisory groups; innovative methods/research designs integrating perspectives from applied anthropology and public health; and expertise and support for the development of promising research. C-TIP funded research projects include: 1) a series of qualitative ethnographic studies describing relevant dimensions of the health care systems and clinical settings in which the work will take place; 2) a methods study evaluating the feasibility and acceptability of three strategies of recruitment and two strategies of retention of participants to trauma-related intervention research; and 3) a pilot study of a trauma-focused group intervention delivered by nursing personnel. The working partnerships and infrastructure capability that will be continued and fostered through C-TIP will allow us to develop comprehensive trauma intervention models whose translation to settings serving low income individuals we propose to study through an advanced center and other grant mechanisms.

"Long-Term Impact of World Trade Center Attacks in Primary Care DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  No study to date has examined the long-term impact of large scale terrorist events, such as the 9/1 1 attacks, in particularly vulnerable communities for whom long-time effects are more likely- such as the poor, minority, less acculturated, urban recent immigrants.  The primary goals of this application are to identify risk and protective factors for the development and persistence of post-disaster psychopathology in a low-income, urban, primary care population; to determine the role of ethnicity and acculturation in the expression of physical and mental symptoms and in seeking post-disaster mental health treatment; and to explore the role of post disaster factors such as social support, and secondary stressors, in mediating the disaster effects over time.  We have a unique opportunity to carry out such a study in a well established cohort consisting of a probability sample of 720 primary care, mostly Hispanic patients, who are residents of NYC and who have reported significant exposure to the 9/11 attacks, when they have been interviewed by our.research team 7-16 months after the 9/11attacks. These goals will be achieved through a follow up survey 4.5 years after 9/11 attacks.  The proposed study will assist in planning for future disasters by providing longitudinal data collected from a systematic sample of NYC primary care patients, using state of the art measures that enable us to test theoretically guided hypotheses and to explore the relations between traumatic event experiences, sociodemographic characteristics, contextual variables, and mental health outcomes and service utilization.

"CSULB Minority Research Infrastructure Support Program    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This resubmission of a M-RISP grant application aims to develop the mental health disparities research capability of faculty in the Departments of Psychology and Human Development at California State University, Long Beach (CSULB). Situated in a highly diverse ethnic metropolitan region, CSULB has abundant opportunities and needs for research relevant to understanding and reducing health disparities in populations with different cultural backgrounds. An M-RISP award would provide opportunities for faculty development in research that would complement the existing strengths and reinforce the momentum of research productivity by faculty. Our M-RISP fosters individualized plans for training participants with the long range objective of producing competitive research applications for extramural funding. It would (1) involve faculty members in conducting pilot work that would lead to a competitive research grant on mental health disparities; (2) increase graduate and undergraduate student research participation, (3) provide research development activities for faculty; and (4) strengthen the institutional infrastructure for mental health research. Our M-RISP would provide reassigned time for participants that would be matched by the College of Liberal Arts and the Department of Psychology, payment for participants, clerical services, travel funds, equipment funds, and state of the art research skill training for faculty development that will enable them to conduct high quality research. Participants would receive seminars and workshops in quantitative research methods and analysis (e.g., web-based survey, daily diary method, structural equation modeling), as well as qualitative research methods and analysis (e.g., interviewing, qualitative interpretation), accompanied by bi-weekly colloquia including faculty and student presentations of their own research and guest speakers and a variety of other enrichment activities. Our M-RISP activities will be closely coordinated with an existing Career Opportunities in Research (COR) program funded by NIMH at CSULB since 1981 to mentor minority undergraduates toward doctoral studies. The three projects proposed here represent crucial areas of mental health research - 1) acculturation, stress and coping among Korean immigrants; 2) sibling influences on coping in families with a child with Type 2 diabetes; 3) cultural factors related to disclosure by rape victims, and its effect on mental health. The award would be timely because recent fiscal cutbacks by the State of California have reduced University resources for research even though the University has shown that it values and rewards research productivity.              ",CSULB Minority Research Infrastructure Support Program,7452378,R24MH073882,[''],NIMH,CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY LONG BEACH,R24,2008,391543,0.08873455436078269
"Fostering Mental Health Research in Psychiatry Residents    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There is a critical lack of minority physician scientists engaged in and leading mental health clinical research. The proposed research educational program addresses this gap in targeting primarily minority psychiatry residents attending a small HBCU medical school, Morehouse School of Medicine, and partners - for the fourth year research elective - with the much larger, research oriented, Department of Psychiatry of Emory University School of Medicine. The proposed program permeates the four-year residency training program. By the end of the second year, the residents are becoming competent in evidence-based medicine principles, are research literate, and have participated in ongoing research projects. Collaboration with Emory assures a wide variety of experienced investigators with sponsored research, augmented by Morehouse's own resources, from which the PGY IV resident can select a mentor and research project. In addition to traditional research training subjects, this directly addresses cultural competency in mental health research, including bioethical, biological and psychological issues of minority populations in research content and conduct, and as a means to decreasing mental health disparities. The program will also facilitate a bridge to postdoctoral training and mentoring. Furthermore, the practice of mentoring others will be instilled in the participants, and they will be encouraged to mentor those in earlier years of training. The specific aims include: support educational experiences relevant to conducting mental health related clinical research that will attract, train and further career development of primarily under-represented minority physician scientists; provide mentored clinical research opportunities that will encourage physician scientists to embark on research projects directly applicable to clinical practice and transitional research; assure the training and experience necessary to progress to the next step of the participants careers, either by entering a research postdoctoral fellowship or by joining an existing research environment; and establish the feasibility of a paradigm of smaller medical schools, especially those with large minority residency programs, to partner with larger, more research oriented, local medical schools to provide more advanced training that otherwise would not possible.           ",Fostering Mental Health Research in Psychiatry Residents,7446598,R25MH071735,"['health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Environment ', ' Address ', ' Caring ', ' Doctor of Philosophy ', ' PhD ', ' Ph.D. ', ' Research Training ', ' Underrepresented Minority ', ' underserved minority ', ' under-represented minority ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Fellowship ', ' Fibrinogen ', ' Factor One ', ' Factor I ', ' Coagulation Factor One ', ' Coagulation Factor I ', ' Blood Factor One ', ' Blood Coagulation Factor One ', ' Blood Coagulation Factor I ', ' Journals ', ' Magazine ', ' career ', ' Goals ', ' improved ', ' Housing ', ' Clinical ', ' Biological ', ' psychologic ', ' psychological ', ' Training ', ' literacy ', ' Educational workshop ', ' Workshop ', ' Fostering ', ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mentors ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Collaborations ', ' Physicians ', ' Staging ', ' Psychiatrist ', ' Psychiatry ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Residencies ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Rotation ', ' medical schools ', ' school of medicine ', ' medical college ', ' Evidence Based Medicine ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' Training Programs ', ' Translating ', ' Universities ', ' Mental disorders ', ' psychological disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Drug Formulations ', ' Formulation ', ' experience ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Basic Science ', ' Basic Research ', ' literate ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Minority ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' post-doctoral training ', ' postdoctoral training ', ' Historically Black Colleges and Universities ', ' Historically Black University ', ' Historically Black Institution ', ' Historically Black Colleges ', ' HBCUs ', ' ']",NIMH,MOREHOUSE SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,R25,2008,230000,0.09732233521145747
"The Collaborative Center for Trauma and Mental Health Disparities    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  We propose to establish a five-year, multi-ethnic and multi-disciplinary ""Collaborative Center for Trauma and Mental Health"" (CCTMHD) to promote interdisciplinary research examining the prevalence and impact of traumatic experiences on PTSD, depression and concomitant cognitive/emotional, behavioral, psychological and biological processes in ethnic minority populations. The overarching aim is to inform new strategies to reduce mental health disparities associated with trauma exposure. Multiple sources of acute and chronic stress combine to have a cumulative effect in the lives of ethnic minorities, giving rise to our use of the conceptual framework of allostatic load to (1) describe the socio-cultural context in which violence occurs; (2) examine cultural differences in the appraisal of traumatic events; (3) identify protective and vulnerability factors within ethnic groups; and (4) characterize the expression of mental health symptoms and help-seeking that contribute to mental health disparities. The Center, led by Dr. Gail Wyatt in collaboration with an experienced team of minority mental health researchers includes an Administrative Core, which will coordinate and integrate all Center activities including mentoring of investigators and a Methods & Statistics Core, which will be responsible for providing methodological support to all Center investigators and projects. Project 1 is a 4-year, longitudinal study, ""Intimate Partner Violence and Mental Health Outcomes among Latinas"", led by Dr. M. Rodriguez. He will investigate the longitudinal course of PTSD and depression, attachment and related biological sequelae in an existing cohort of 205 Latina mothers, who vary on intimate partner violence histories. Project 2, ""Disclosure & Appraisal of Child Sexual Abuse (CSA): Relationships with PTSD, Depression, & Associated Biomarkers"" is led by Drs. J. Vargas-Carmona and T. Loeb. This 2-year pilot study focuses on the impact of CSA disclosure and self-blame among 110 Black and Latina women with CSA histories. Project 3, a 2-year pilot study, ""Coping among Ethnic Men Sexually Abused as Children"", is led by Dr. F. Galvan. He will recruit 150 Latino and Black men to examine ethnic differences in coping strategies and their role as possible moderators or mediators of psychological distress, biological effects of childhood sexual trauma and mental health service utilization. This Center will stimulate state-of-the-art research on trauma and mental health disparities, and inform the development of future interventions to close these gaps.        ",The Collaborative Center for Trauma and Mental Health Disparities,7488466,P50MH073453,[''],NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,P50,2008,808074,0.08250169991418697
"National Survey of American Life    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Good mental health is vital for the economic and social well-being of the nation. Mental disorders are highly disabling conditions; psychiatric illness ranks second only to cardiovascular disease in its effects on disability. Despite the prevalence of some psychiatric disorders generally, we do not have a clear understanding of the prevalence and nature of treatment of psychiatric disorders for the American black population. Further the underutilization of outpatient mental health services has been well documented for ethnic minority groups. The correlates of service use and patterns of help-seeking, however, as well as risk and resiliency factors both within and across racial/ethnic groups have been identified as critical areas for future research. The National Survey of American Life (NSAL) is a comprehensive and detailed study of mental disorders and mental health of American adults and adolescents of African and Caribbean black descent. Over the past two years of the current NIMH grant, more than 70 authors from approximately a dozen national and international institutions have worked extensively on NSAL analyses and papers. This competing continuation application requests funds to extend the NSAL for four years to: 1) complete manuscripts that are currently in process; 2) respond to new lines of research raised by prior and ongoing analyses, and to conduct new analyses regarding the nature, extent, and reasons for racial and ethnic disparities in the prevalence rates of mental disorders and treatment for symptoms of psychopathology. These issues will be addressed across race and ethnic groups using the NSAL, the National Latino and Asian American Study (NLAAS); and 3) maintain and implement new training programs for scholars and students interested in using NSAL data. There are four specific aims: 1) Examine mental disorder and mental health among diverse racial/ethnic populations; 2) Investigate correlates of help-seeking behavior and services use among ethnically diverse populations; 3) Identify risk and resilience/stress and stress buffering processes that may differentially influence the psychopathology and well-being of ethnically diverse populations; and, 4) Maintain an efficient and effective training program over the four years that will meet the needs of users of NSAL, including data analysts, data managers, research assistants, and research investigators, both at Michigan and among our wide-spread group of collaborators.           ",National Survey of American Life,7608796,U01MH057716,"['Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Demographic Factors ', ' Provider ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Discrimination (Psychology) ', ' Institution ', ' Economics ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Caring ', ' Social Network ', ' stress buffering ', ' stress management ', ' Aging Process ', ' Aging-Related Process ', ' Data ', ' International ', ' NIH RFA ', ' Request for Applications ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' Update ', ' Rate ', ' Process ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Future ', ' Affect ', ' racial/ethnic difference ', ' Grant ', ' Hand ', ' Health ', ' Area ', ' Acute ', ' Chronic ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' psychological ', ' psychologic ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Adolescent ', ' Link ', ' Immigrations ', ' In-Migration ', ' Training ', ' Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-IV ', ' Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th edition ', ' DSM4 ', ' DSM-IV ', ' mental ', ' Psyche structure ', ' disability ', ' Individual ', ' Funding ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Maintenance ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene Services ', ' Mental Health Services ', ' Michigan ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' NIMH ', ' National Institute of Mental Health (U.S.) ', ' Collaborations ', ' web based ', ' online computer ', ' On-Line Systems ', ' Online Systems ', ' Out-patients ', ' Outpatients ', ' Paper ', ' well-being ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' Primary Care Physician ', ' abnormal psychology ', ' Psychopathology ', ' psychosocial variables ', ' Psychosocial Factor ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Publications ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Condition ', ' Nature ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' social support network ', ' Social support ', ' Life ', ' Specialty ', ' medical specialties ', ' Stress ', ' Students ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Asian Americans ', ' Training Programs ', ' Universities ', ' black carib ', ' black Caribbean ', ' African Caribbean ', ' Work ', ' Severities ', ' Event ', ' Source ', ' Pattern ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' Behavior ', ' psychological disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Mental disorders ', ' interest ', ' Services ', ' American ', ' stressor ', ' Manuscripts ', ' religious ', ' Religion and Spirituality ', ' help seeking ', ' help-seeking behavior ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' social ', ' oriental ', ' Asians ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' Latino ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' diverse populations ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' Sampling ', ' Cultural Assimilation ', ' Acculturation ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Comorbidity ', ' Social Well-Being ', ' resilience ', ' stress resilience ', ' coping ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' Impairment ', ' ethnic minority ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' racial/ethnic ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,U01,2008,21874,0.027212763566355345
"Adaptation of post-disaster mental health training for black communities    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Adaptation and adoption of evidence based mental health strategies has been challenging for those working with subpopulations disproportionately affected by the aftermath of natural disasters and may contribute to the growing racial disparities seen in access to mental health services, diagnosis, and treatment of mental health conditions. Outside assistance teams have faced overwhelming demands for tools that take into account the cultural and ethnic context of mental health conditions and facilitate expedient and cost effective measure to mitigate the mental health effects of disasters. Our proposed post disaster mental health intervention training tool will assist in addressing these challenges and holds promise for delivering effective interventions to those in need of support because it will be developed through an iterative collaborative approach with health providers and black community leaders working in areas in the Southeastern and Gulf states that have experienced the greatest impact of recent hurricanes. We first will conduct thorough needs assessment in coastal and eastern North Carolina and continue to incorporate materials that respond to audience learning needs through implementation testing of materials developed by Dr. Stan Kutcher. This model is based on World Health Organization and NIMH recommended post disaster mental health practices. The novel training program will also include capacity and social capital building techniques and expansion through a train the trainer component. The results of this formative research will be woven into a novel disaster intervention training program that can be successively tailored to other minority groups in high risk areas. The prototype training package will consists of 1) a core knowledge/care competencies manual; 2) clinical provider and community leader trainee toolkits (with testable cooperative learning exercises for 1 completed core competency, a list of resources for practical mental health referral and treatment approaches, and training evaluation pre and post tests, a sample CD rom to test the acceptance of future distance learning using web based format for training components); and 3) a trainer facilitation manual with slide sets and testable instructions for implementing a train the trainer program. We will elaborate a plan for conducting a multi site field evaluation trial. In Phase II we will further develop the training components, including distance learning CD rom and web based instruction based on the Phase I proof of concept evidence. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The disaster mental health training tool that we propose to develop will promote an appropriate and cost effective response to the need to prepare health providers and black community leaders for addressing the adverse mental health consequences to disasters. Through the iterative adaptation of teaching materials to the cultural context of communities of color, we will have a useful tool to address cultural barriers that challenge outsiders in providing mental health services. Expansion to other formats for distance learning of different training components and tailoring for other vulnerable communities will allow local first responders to gain the sustainable skills.                 ",Adaptation of post-disaster mental health training for black communities,7481837,R43MH080520,"['Provider ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disasters ', ' Readiness ', ' Preparedness ', ' Low income ', ' Emergency Situation ', ' Emergencies ', ' Address ', ' Caring ', ' Evidence based practice ', ' social capital ', ' Data ', ' Cognitive ', ' Other Minority ', ' Process ', ' Modification ', ' Exercise ', ' Physical Exercise ', ' Feedback ', ' Adoption ', ' Advisory Committees ', ' Task Forces ', ' Focus Groups ', ' emergency service/first responder ', ' first responder ', ' emergency service responder ', ' emergency service personnel ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Future ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' Affect ', ' base ', ' concept ', ' Goals ', ' improved ', ' Health ', ' Health Personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Hurricane ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' psychologic ', ' psychological ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Psyche structure ', ' mental ', ' Learning ', ' Recovery ', ' Rural ', ' Educational workshop ', ' Workshop ', ' Manuals ', ' Materials Testing ', ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health Services ', ' Mental Hygiene Services ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' National Institute of Mental Health (U.S.) ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' NIMH ', ' Natural Disasters ', ' Educational Intervention ', ' instructional intervention ', ' Training Intervention ', ' Instruction Intervention ', ' Education for Intervention ', ' North Carolina ', ' Online Systems ', ' web based ', ' online computer ', ' On-Line Systems ', ' Pre-Post Tests ', ' tool ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' Qualitative Evaluations ', ' instrument ', ' Condition ', ' Recommendation ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' recruit ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Stress ', ' Educational process of instructing ', ' Teaching ', ' Teaching Materials ', ' Testing ', ' Training Programs ', ' Work ', ' World Health Organization ', ' Slide ', ' Techniques ', ' Mental disorders ', ' psychological disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Benchmarking ', ' Best Practice Analysis ', ' interest ', ' Needs Assessment ', ' experience ', ' Distance Learning ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' member ', ' Measures ', ' psychological distress ', ' acute stress ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Trainers Training ', ' response ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Accounting ', ' Color ', ' Communities ', ' Computer-Assisted Instruction ', ' web-based instruction ', ' internet-assisted education ', ' Computerized Self-Instruction Programs ', ' Computer-based Education ', ' Instruction ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' cost effective ', ' cost-effective ', ' Population ', ' Community Integration ', ' usability ', ' gulf coast ', ' prototype ', ' health training ', ' ']",NIMH,"HERMES, LLC",R43,2008,234702,0.155066486490759
"Mentoring/Career Development in PTSD Services Research    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This revised proposal is resubmitted to request support for B. Christopher Frueh, Ph.D. in his continued efforts to mentor clinical investigators and to conduct patient-oriented mental health services research. His main interest is mental health service delivery to trauma survivors in the public sector, including efforts that will address rural disparities and relevant public policy. He has served as PI on eight federally-funded research grants relevant to this arena, including Mental Health Service Delivery to Trauma Victims (K08; NIMH), Trauma within the Psychiatric Setting (R01; NIMH), and Telepsychiatry Service Delivery to Trauma Victims (R01; AHRQ). Besides his reputation as a quality researcher and his strong track record of funding in mental health services, the candidate has an excellent record of mentorship. He has provided critical mentorship to a large number of successful pre- and post-doctoral psychologists, psychiatry residents, and junior faculty investigators from a range of disciplines (> 25 total mentees) over the past thirteen years. His immediate goals are to continue to mentor junior investigators, and to acquire new skills to assist him in continuing his own patient-oriented mental health services research.

"NLAAS II: Unraveling Differences for Clinical Services    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This continuation application requests three-years of support to investigate differences in the correlates of psychiatric illness and mental health service disparities among Asian Americans and Latinos as compared to non-Latino Whites. We will use recently collected data from the National Latino and Asian American Study (NLAAS), a national psychiatric epidemiologic study conducted to measure psychiatric disorders and mental health service usage in a representative sample of Asians and Latinos, and the National Comorbidity Study Replication (NCS-R). The combined NLAAS/NCS-R data are the best available to address critical questions regarding the level of service disparities, and the identification of service disparities ""hot spots."" In this resubmission, we apply an innovative conceptual framework to organize correlates for psychiatric illness, mental health service use and mental health service disparities, giving attention to health system and contextual factors in addition to traditional individual level factors. Specifically, our aims are to: (1) Use combined data from the NLAAS and the NCS-R to: compare prevalence of psychiatric disorders and mental health service use among Latinos, Asian, and non-Latino Whites; investigate hypotheses related to differences in the correlates of illness and mental health services; and assess bias in disorder prevalence and service use, (2) Apply the IOM definition of disparities to quantify disparities in services utilization and identify potential mechanisms underlying services disparities, and (3) Apply methods from spatial epidemiology to identify ""hot spots"" of mental health service disparities at the MSA level, and investigate health care system factors associated with high and low performing MSAs. This study will provide national baseline data on which to define the progress and measurable targets for mental health service disparity improvements for Latinos and Asian Americans as compared to non-Latino Whites. In addition, it will identify health system factors measured at the community and individual level that mediate disparities and can be targeted by policymakers. Finally, it will provide policymakers with information regarding where in the US mental health service disparities are unusually high. These findings can be used to target resources, develop coherent public policies, and inform guidelines aimed at making mental health prevention and treatment services more responsive and sensitive to the needs of ethnic/racial minorities.

"Center for Research on Mental Health in Social Services    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  In response to the ACISR Program Announcement, we propose to establish the Center for Research to Improve Mental Health Care in the Social Services (C-RIMSS). Our research agenda addresses quality of mental health care in settings with the highest potential to reduce racial and ethnic disparities. Studies will be conducted in social service agencies, where prevalence of mental disorder is high and vulnerable of clients predominate. A cultural exchange perspective informs our work at the mental health-social service intersect, and across the academic-practice divide. Through the work of seven units, our Operations Core will provide an infrastructure for research, methodological advances, and partnerships with community agencies. The Principal Research Core will support pilot studies to address three aims: (1) understand quality of care for mental disorder in the social services from stakeholder perspective; (2) assess practice variation in quality of care for mental disorder and identify provider, client, and system ecostructure and economic influences on that variation; and (3) working ""trench to bench and back to trench,"" test a menu of quality improvements for mental health care in the social services. The Research Methods Core's two units--Qualitative Methods and Statistical Analysis -- will provide ongoing, state of the art support to investigators. The RMC will support projects and provide consultation for stakeholder preference assessment, quality indicators, and organizational research methods. Our outcomes will include completed pilot projects, generation of RO 1, R21, or R34 studies, scientific publications, strengthened agency partnerships and infrastructure for research, and dissemination of findings to academic and stakeholder networks. Improving mental health care to social service clients can increase treatment to persons whose disorder currently goes undetected, improve the quality of evidence-based care to those who are now served poorly, and reduce racial/ethnic disparities in care. Our research agenda is responsive to the recommendation of the President's New Freedom Commission Report on Mental Health to improve the response to mental disorder in readily accessible and low-stigma settings where a high level of risk for mental health problems exists, especially all federally-funded health and human services.

"The Collaborative Center for Trauma and Mental Health Disparities    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  We propose to establish a five-year, multi-ethnic and multi-disciplinary ""Collaborative Center for Trauma and Mental Health"" (CCTMHD) to promote interdisciplinary research examining the prevalence and impact of traumatic experiences on PTSD, depression and concomitant cognitive/emotional, behavioral, psychological and biological processes in ethnic minority populations. The overarching aim is to inform new strategies to reduce mental health disparities associated with trauma exposure. Multiple sources of acute and chronic stress combine to have a cumulative effect in the lives of ethnic minorities, giving rise to our use of the conceptual framework of allostatic load to (1) describe the socio-cultural context in which violence occurs; (2) examine cultural differences in the appraisal of traumatic events; (3) identify protective and vulnerability factors within ethnic groups; and (4) characterize the expression of mental health symptoms and help-seeking that contribute to mental health disparities. The Center, led by Dr. Gail Wyatt in collaboration with an experienced team of minority mental health researchers includes an Administrative Core, which will coordinate and integrate all Center activities including mentoring of investigators and a Methods & Statistics Core, which will be responsible for providing methodological support to all Center investigators and projects. Project 1 is a 4-year, longitudinal study, ""Intimate Partner Violence and Mental Health Outcomes among Latinas"", led by Dr. M. Rodriguez. He will investigate the longitudinal course of PTSD and depression, attachment and related biological sequelae in an existing cohort of 205 Latina mothers, who vary on intimate partner violence histories. Project 2, ""Disclosure & Appraisal of Child Sexual Abuse (CSA): Relationships with PTSD, Depression, & Associated Biomarkers"" is led by Drs. J. Vargas-Carmona and T. Loeb. This 2-year pilot study focuses on the impact of CSA disclosure and self-blame among 110 Black and Latina women with CSA histories. Project 3, a 2-year pilot study, ""Coping among Ethnic Men Sexually Abused as Children"", is led by Dr. F. Galvan. He will recruit 150 Latino and Black men to examine ethnic differences in coping strategies and their role as possible moderators or mediators of psychological distress, biological effects of childhood sexual trauma and mental health service utilization. This Center will stimulate state-of-the-art research on trauma and mental health disparities, and inform the development of future interventions to close these gaps.        ",The Collaborative Center for Trauma and Mental Health Disparities,7689480,P50MH073453,[''],NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,P50,2008,141956,0.08250169991418697
"Cancer prevention, mental health and social capital of segregated Black Americans    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposed dissertation multi-level study will investigate the social determinants of breast and prostate cancer preventive screening behaviors and mental health outcomes on African-American residents of racially, residentially segregated urban neighborhoods of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The Specific Aims of this proposal focus on the following questions: 1. Do different levels of bonding social capital and different measures (structural, cognitive) of social capital predict mental health outcomes and cancer preventive behaviors within racially and residentially segregated urban settings, net of individual-level compositional characteristics (age, gender, socioeconomic position, foreign-born status)? 2. Is the effect of social capital on cancer preventive behaviors and mental health outcomes in segregated communities mediated by neighborhood characteristics (level of poverty, amount of violence, presence of non-acute health care facilities, level of segregation). A mentoring team of experienced investigators has been assembled to pursue this study, including leading national experts on social epidemiology (Ichiro Kawachi), mental health disparities (David Williams), cancer epidemiology (Katrina Armstrong), and demography (Dolores Acevedo-Garcia). The proposed dissertation accords with the National Cancer Institute's mission ""to eliminate suffering and death due to cancer and to preempt cancer at every opportunity"". The knowledge gained from this study can aid in understanding the role of social capital in promoting cancer preventive behaviors in African-Americans - a group with higher cancer mortality rate -- which fits NCI's desire to accelerate progress in cancer prevention and improve early detection and diagnosis. This study will draw on three main sources of data: the 2004 Southeastern Pennsylvania Health Household Survey (SPHHS) administered by the Philadelphia Health Management Corporation data, US Census Data, and local public record. The 2004 version of the SPHHS includes the self-report of mental health conditions, cancer preventive screening behaviors, and social capital measures from the Social Capital Community Benchmark Survey. Presence of block parties will be assessed using data from the City of Philadelphia Department of Streets and presence of non-acute care facilities from the the US Department of Health and Human Services Health Resources and Service Administratrion website. Data will be aggregated and geocoded to segregated areas of Philadelphia County using a novel measure of segregation based on 2000 US Census Data.          ","Cancer prevention, mental health and social capital of segregated Black Americans",7546801,F31CA136236,"['Data Sources ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Demography ', ' Population Studies / Demography ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Preventive ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Caring ', ' social capital ', ' Data ', ' Division of Cancer Control and Population Sciences ', ' DCCPS ', ' National Cancer Institute ', ' NCI Organization ', ' Cancer Control Program Review Group ', ' Cognitive ', ' Low Prevalence ', ' Rate ', ' Characteristics ', ' socioeconomics ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomic ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio economic ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Age ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Health ', ' Health care facility ', ' Healthcare Facility ', ' Health Facilities ', ' Health Resources ', ' Screening for cancer ', ' early cancer detection ', ' Cancer Screening for Patients ', ' Household ', ' Area ', ' Acute ', ' Link ', ' Individual ', ' Trust ', ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mentors ', ' Mission ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Mortality ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' cancer prevention ', ' Object Attachment ', ' Psychological Bonding ', ' Object Relationship ', ' Bonding (Psychology) ', ' Pennsylvania ', ' Philadelphia ', ' Poverty ', ' Exposure to ', ' Condition ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Social Environment ', ' socioenvironment ', ' social context ', ' social climate ', ' Malignant neoplasm of prostate ', ' Malignant prostatic tumor ', ' Prostatic Cancer ', ' Prostate Cancer ', ' Prostate CA ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Prostate ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' United States Dept. of Health and Human Services ', ' United States Department of Health and Human Services ', ' Department of Health and Human Services ', ' Violence ', ' violent behavior ', ' violent ', ' Behavior ', ' Benchmarking ', ' Best Practice Analysis ', ' interest ', ' Physical environment ', ' Services ', ' American ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' early detection ', ' experience ', ' cohesion ', ' Breast ', ' preempt ', ' novel ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Self-Report ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' social ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' Censuses ', ' County ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', ' segregation ', ' Racial Segregation ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Mediating ', ' desire ', ' Cities ', ' cancer epidemiology ', ' Communities ', ' Preventive screening ', ' Outcome ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' racial/ethnic ', ' ']",NCI,HARVARD SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH,F31,2008,35602,0.0740370917425427
"Trauma Interventions for Low-income Women in PrimaryCare DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Trauma exposure and trauma-related mental disorders make substantial contributions to widely recognized health disparities in the U. S. Because low-income populations have little access to mental health specialty care and often find it stigmatizing, and because attention to mental health issues in primary care settings is limited, their trauma-related problems receive little if any professional attention. The goal of the Center for Trauma Interventions in Primary Care (C-TIP) is to develop innovative and sustainable interventions to address the spectrum of trauma-related mental health needs presenting to primary care settings serving low-income, mostly minority populations through academic-community research partnerships with local jurisdictions. To increase the adoption and sustainability of these interventions, the trauma-related services to be developed are being conceptualized in close collaboration with three highly invested community partners: the Department of Health in Prince George's County, MD; the Primary Care Coalition in Montgomery County, MD; and Unity Health Care, Inc. in the District of Columbia. The Center will extend the high quality research our Research Infrastructure Support Program (RISP) has already generated in this under-studied population by active collaboration with new academic partners: Georgetown's School of Nursing and Health Studies and its Department of Family Medicine. The Center's work will be conducted through three cores (Operations, Research Methods, and Principal Research) providing administrative oversight, statistical support, and access to expert advisory groups; innovative methods/research designs integrating perspectives from applied anthropology and public health; and expertise and support for the development of promising research. C-TIP funded research projects include: 1) a series of qualitative ethnographic studies describing relevant dimensions of the health care systems and clinical settings in which the work will take place; 2) a methods study evaluating the feasibility and acceptability of three strategies of recruitment and two strategies of retention of participants to trauma-related intervention research; and 3) a pilot study of a trauma-focused group intervention delivered by nursing personnel. The working partnerships and infrastructure capability that will be continued and fostered through C-TIP will allow us to develop comprehensive trauma intervention models whose translation to settings serving low income individuals we propose to study through an advanced center and other grant mechanisms.

"Racial/Ethnic Disparities and Children's Early Social Emotional Development    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Social emotional development in early childhood serves as the foundation for mental health across the lifespan. Results from a recent nationally-representative study of U.S. kindergarteners show a clear difference in social emotional development by race/ethnicity, with greater percentages of minority children compared to white children entering school with fewer social emotional competencies. These disparities in children's early mental health are particularly concerning given the growing number of minority children in the U.S., coupled with evidence that early social emotional deficits have short-term implications for school readiness and longer- term implications including lower occupational attainment, higher rates of teen pregnancy and depression. While studies have documented racial/ethnic disparities in social emotional development upon children's entry to school, there have been no studies examining racial/ethnic differences in a contemporary, nationally representative sample of children in early childhood and the factors that may account for these disparities. The three specific aims of the proposed study are: 1) examine the extent of racial/ethnic differences in children's social emotional development at 2 years of age; 2) determine whether differences in child characteristics, family demographic characteristics, family context and child care context explain racial/ethnic variation in children's social emotional development at 2 years of age; and 3) determine whether relations among child characteristics, family demographic characteristics, family context, child care context and children's social emotional development vary by race/ethnicity at 2 years of age. Data are from the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study, Birth Cohort (ECLS-B) funded by the U.S. Department of Education in collaboration with the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH).The ECLS-B follows a nationally representative sample of approximately 14,000 children born in 2001. Data include direct measures of social emotional development at 2 years of age and additional measures of parent and child characteristics at 9 months. Regression models will be constructed to examine the direct and indirect relationship between child's race/ethnicity and social emotional outcomes. The proposed dissertation project is highly relevant to NIMH's mission to reduce the burden of mental illness and behavioral disorders through research on mind, brain, and behavior and address the Division of Pediatric Translational Research and Treatment Development's high priority area  delineating mechanisms and processes of neurobehavioral development relevant to understanding pediatric mental disorders with a focus on periods of rapid neurobiological change (e.g., infancy, preschool, adolescent periods), during which the brain is particularly sensitive to contextual influence . Assessing the contribution of factors impacting social emotional development at two years and the pathways by which they operate can provide evidence regarding opportunities for early intervention aimed at reducing disparities in children's mental health.              ",Racial/Ethnic Disparities and Children's Early Social Emotional Development,7488206,R36MH083468,"['Age-Years ', ' Data ', ' Translational Research ', ' translation research enterprise ', ' translation research ', ' Translational Science ', ' Translational Research Enterprise ', ' Rate ', ' Characteristics ', ' Readiness ', ' Preparedness ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Address ', ' Child Mental Health ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Family ', ' Family Characteristics ', ' Social Impacts ', ' Foundations ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' Age Factors ', ' racial/ethnic difference ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Adolescent ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Interview ', ' infancy ', ' infantile ', ' Childhood ', ' pediatric ', ' Numbers ', ' Longevity ', ' lifespan ', ' life span ', ' Length of Life ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' Early Intervention (Education) ', ' Funding ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mission ', ' National Institute of Mental Health (U.S.) ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' NIMH ', ' Neurobiology ', ' neurobiological ', ' Collaborations ', ' Parents ', ' Pregnancy in Adolescence ', ' Underage Pregnancy ', ' Teenage Pregnancy ', ' Teen Pregnancy ', ' Pregnancy in Minors ', ' Adolescent Pregnancy ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Research ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Schools ', ' Nursery Schools ', ' preschool ', ' Investigation ', ' Pattern ', ' Behavior Disorders ', ' behavioral disorder ', ' Mental disorders ', ' psychological disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Occupational ', ' Birth ', ' Parturition ', ' early childhood ', ' cohort ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Disease regression ', ' Academic achievement ', ' social ', ' Measures ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Care ', ' Puericulture ', ' Child Development ', ' Infant and Child Development ', ' Emotional ', ' Parenting behavior ', ' Parenting ', ' Caregivers ', ' Care Givers ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Accounting ', ' neurobehavioral ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' Mind ', ' Coupled ', ' brain behavior ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' racial/ethnic ', ' demographics ', ' therapy development ', ' treatment development ', ' intervention development ', ' develop therapy ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' ']",NIMH,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R36,2008,29735,0.05584437468250692
"Mental Health Literacy Among Korean American Elders    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposed study is written in response to the heightened need for research designed to help reduce mental health disparities. The investigation focuses on one of the fastest growing but understudied and underserved ethnic minority groups: Korean American elders. Building upon our previous findings that Korean American older adults have high levels of mental health problems yet underutilize mental health services, the proposed study conceptualizes low mental health literacy as a major reason for service underutilization and a central focus of intervention efforts. The overall goals are to better understand the levels of mental health literacy manifest in the target population and to develop/test an educational intervention. The proposed study includes three phases: (1) data collection with a mixed methodology including a survey and focus groups; (2) development of an educational intervention program, and (3) pilot testing and evaluation. Survey data drawing on structured questionnaires will be used to assess the level of mental health literacy and to determine facilitators and barriers of mental health literacy. In order to provide a more in-depth assessment of mental health literacy, data from focus groups will also be used. The latter discussions will be conducted with Korean American older adults, their family members, health care professionals, and religious leaders. Various mental health issues and ways to promote community mental health and service utilization will serve as focal points for diverse perspectives. Findings from the survey data and focus groups will guide the development of a culturally appropriate and acceptable educational intervention program. An educational brochure in Korean will be written with the twin goals of increasing mental health literacy and making positive changes in attitudes toward mental disorders and service utilization. We will also adopt a peer-led education strategy where lay peer leaders are trained to deliver an educational session. The session includes not only the brochure but also peer-education and group discussion. The peer-based approach allows greater sensitivity to the unique characteristics of ethnic minority communities, where informal leaders play a significant role. During the third and final phase, an experiment with three randomized conditions (control, general brochure, and peer-led education) will be conducted to explore the effectiveness of the educational brochure and peer-led education strategy. We hypothesize that 1) those in the treatment groups (general brochure and peer-led education) would show increased knowledge of depression and positive changes in attitudes toward mental illness and service use compared to those in the control group, and 2) peer-led education would be more effective than the brochure-only approach. Pilot testing and evaluation will serve as an important means to assess effect size of intervention and feasibility of the program for implementation in a subsequent project. We also hope to use our findings to develop a protocol for application to other ethnic minority groups.      Public Health Relevance: Building upon previous findings that Korean American older adults have high levels of mental health problems yet underutilize mental health services, the proposed study conceptualizes low mental health literacy as a major reason for service underutilization and a central focus of intervention efforts.

"Improving Depression Treatment for Latinas    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Latinos comprise one of the fastest growing racial/ethnic populations in the United States, currently constituting 14% of the total U.S. population. The increasing rate of Latinos will undoubtedly increase the number of people at risk for mental health disorders. Latina women will be at heightened risk since previous studies have found greater lifetime prevalence of mental health disorders, especially depression, in comparison to men. Social capital is a promising construct with which investigators may examine a community's capacity to respond to challenges and promote individual-level health. However, the relation between social capital and mental health in ethnic minority populations remains unclear.

"Addressing Cultural Factors and Mental Health Disparities in Research and Practic    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Abstract. This Conference Grant application is to request funding to support three annual conferences aimed at sharing state of the art scientific research and best professional practices to address the mental health disparities of racial/ethnic minorities and immigrants. The successive themes for the three years are (a) addressing the intersections between race and culture in scientific research and mental health service delivery for children, adolescents, and families; and (b) examination of the intersection of culture, race, and trauma and mental health across the life span; and (c) racial identity and cultural factors in treatment and service delivery (Each conference builds upon the recommendations of Dr. David Satcher's supplemental report, Mental Health: Culture, Race, and Ethnicity; the President's New Freedom Commission on Mental Health Report: Achieving the Promise: Transforming Mental Health Care in America; the mission of NIMH; as well as the longstanding objectives of the Institute for the Study and Promotion of Race and Culture (ISPRC) at Boston College. In an effort to reduce mental health disparities among People of Color relative to non-minorities, each conference involves sharing innovative, pragmatic, and empirically based strategies for delineating and addressing the mental health burdens of ethnic and linguistic minorities. The primary common goals and objectives of each of the conferences are to: (1) Share state of the art mental health theory, research, and practice with respect to the roles of race and culture in the etiology, maintenance, and remediation of mental health disparities; (2) Use strategies to engage scientist- practitioners and mental health service providers in interdisciplinary communication and collaboration to address the role of culture and race in their research, practice, and service delivery. (3) Develop and disseminate information regarding race and culture and mental health disparities. Speakers for the conference will be nationally and internationally acknowledged researchers and clinicians presenting in their areas of expertise via interactive formats. Each of the thematic 2-day conferences will take place at the Diversity Challenge conference at Boston College in successive years, October of 2007, 2008, and 2009. Each thematic conference will be characterized by varied formats consisting of plenary sessions, individual presentations, concurrent workgroups, roundtable discussions, and informational poster and exhibit sessions intended to achieve the stated aims. Proceedings from the conference will be disseminated through published monographs, and on the ISPRC web site. Thematic books based on each conference will be co-edited by the co-PIs. The conference grant addresses mental health disparities of People of Color in the United States. This focus is consistent with the Surgeon General's Supplemental Report on Race, Culture, and Mental Health, the President's New Freedom Commission report, and the mission of NIMH, which identified these populations as being at significant public health risk and called for interventions to eliminate the health disparities.          ",Addressing Cultural Factors and Mental Health Disparities in Research and Practic,7436184,R13MH078714,"['Provider ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Etiology ', ' disease causation ', ' causation ', ' Causality ', ' Address ', ' Caring ', ' Applications Grants ', ' Grant Proposals ', ' Exhibits ', ' Family ', ' Freedom ', ' Liberty ', ' base ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Adolescent ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Institutes ', ' Individual ', ' Linguistics ', ' Linguistic ', ' Longevity ', ' lifespan ', ' life span ', ' Length of Life ', ' Funding ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Maintenance ', ' Americas ', ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health Services ', ' Mental Hygiene Services ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' Mission ', ' National Institute of Mental Health (U.S.) ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' NIMH ', ' Internet ', ' world wide web ', ' web ', ' WWW ', ' Collaborations ', ' Immigrant ', ' Monograph ', ' Professional Practice ', ' health care professional practice ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' Publishing ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' posters ', ' Arts ', ' Scientist ', ' United States ', ' day ', ' college ', ' collegiate ', ' Services ', ' Surgeon ', ' Books ', ' Boston ', ' Reporting ', ' Interdisciplinary Communication ', ' Multidisciplinary Communication ', ' Cross-Disciplinary Communication ', ' Relative (related person) ', ' Relative ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' abstracting ', ' symposium ', ' conference ', ' Proceedings and Conferences ', ' theories ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Color ', ' Minority ', ' remediation ', ' Population ', ' Trauma ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' Proceedings, Conference ', ' ']",NIMH,BOSTON COLLEGE,R13,2008,114945,0.013919371030323162
"Supporting Mental Health of African American Elders    This application is in response to the NIMH program announcement ""Intervention and Practice Research Infrastructure Program"" {IP-RISP; PAR -04-015). We propose a collaborative  partnership between a research center (Center for Applied Research on Aging and Health, CARAH) at Thomas Jefferson University, and a senior center in the Philadelphia Region, Center in the Park (CIP). CIP is a certified senior center. It has received numerous awards for its innovative programming for the 6,000 community-living urban elders it serves; over 85% of whom is African American. Building on our existing collaborative platform, we plan to implement a partner program, entitled ""In Touch: Mind, Body and Spirit"". The overall goal of this program is to create a sustainable infrastructure in a community setting for systematic mental health research, programming and its evaluation and research training that is responsive to the social and cultural tenets of the target group. The partnership is guided by a well-established collaborative model and is based in the tradition of action science in that it seeks to develop a ""community of inquiry"" within a ""community of practice."" It employs multimethodologies to evaluate infrastructure viability and sustainability and generate knowledge that is relevant and useful to the community which CIP serves. The three broad programmatic aims are to: 1) Develop, implement and evaluate a sustainable infrastructure for the In Touch: Mind, Body and Spirit program including a governance structure, and an electronic data management system with outcome reporting capacity and support of field-based clinical research; 2) Implement three exploratory pilot studies to test the infrastructure and advance knowledge of the adaptive mechanisms and mental health needs of older African American men and women with differing functional status; and 3) Develop, implement and evaluate research training activities including experiential and on-site involvement for health professionals (geriatric fellows, students in medicine, nursing, occupational therapy and physical therapy) that are integrated with the pilot research efforts including how to: a) design collaborative-based clinical research, b) identify culturally relevant research questions to advance knowledge on mental health issues of the target population, c) carry out clinical research in mental health and aging in an applied setting; and d) translate evidence-based programs for the target group. The exploratory studies we plan to implement are theoretically-driven. They are designed to identify and understand the broad range of adaptive strategies and self-care practices that afford positive mental health outcomes for older African American men and women experiencing a range of age-related losses. The three exploratory studies logically and incrementally build on the other moving from descriptive to associative to predictive type research questions. These include an: 1) exploration of domains of concern with the aging process and the adaptive and cultural mechanisms for offsetting loss including symptom presentation and treatment seeking for mental health concerns among African American elders; 2) examination of differential patterns of adaptive strategy use and mental health outcomes for African American men and women with different functional status; and 3) evaluation of an intervention protocol to promote positive mental health (self-efficacy, reduced depressive symptoms) among a group of African Americans elders identified at high risk for adverse psychological well-being. Thus, initial studies will form the basis for developing and testing linguistically and culturally appropriate interventions for African American elders with different health profiles as well as the ways in which current evidence-based programs need to be translated to fit this cultural group.

"Advanced Center to Improve Pediatric Mental Health Care (ACIPMHC)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose to establish an Advanced Center to Improve Pediatric Mental Health Care (ACIPMHC) that will be located within the Child and Adolescent Services Research Center (CASRC) at Rady Children's Hospital-San Diego. The ACIPMHC will have strong linkage to the intervention development program at the Center for Research to Practice (CR2P) at the Oregon Social Learning Center (OSLC) and to other intervention and services research programs and networks around the country. The research agenda has a strategic focus on improvement of public pediatric mental health care, primarily in the mental health and child welfare service sectors, through improved integration of evidence-based practice and usual care. The center's program of practice research spans clinical epidemiology studies linked to evidence-based practice, effectiveness, and implementation studies. The research agenda will have a primary focus on effectiveness and equity as two of the six aims for improving health care from the ""Crossing the Quality Chasm"" report. An overarching center perspective of cultural exchange will guide active partnership with major stakeholders in youth mental health care, including youth and family consumers, providers, program and funding managers, system administrators, policy makers, and intervention and services researchers. The Principal Research Core (PRC) will focus on practice research through two developmental studies addressing implementation of two established evidence-based practices. These studies and others to be designed by the center network of investigators will be carried out in community-based mental health and child welfare service settings, building on already developed research-practice relationships. The Research Methods Core (RMC) will advance methods for effectiveness and implementation research through four workgroups focusing on (a) design and analysis, (b) measurement, (c) mixed methods, and (d) economic analyses, as well as one developmental study addressing incorporation of research-based measurement in usual care child welfare practice. The Community Network Core (CNC) will strengthen a multiple sector infrastructure in San Diego County and link research activities to an emerging research network in the State of California that partners with the California Institute of Mental Health, a technical assistance arm of the county mental health directors in California. The Operations Core (OC) will provide leadership and will support activities in the other three cores by extending an effective infrastructure developed through two prior services research center grants and participating as one of six sites in an R-25 training consortium. All cores will advance practice research to inform improvements in mental health care that decrease racial-ethnic disparities.      Operations Core (OC)          ",Advanced Center to Improve Pediatric Mental Health Care (ACIPMHC),7439847,P30MH074678,[''],NIMH,RADY CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL - SAN DIEGO,P30,2008,1618204,0.1443566659711261
"Telemental Health to Improve Mental Health Care and Outcomes for Children in Unde    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The need for new models for delivering mental heath services within primary care (PC) has been recognized for two decades, yet federal funding to address this need has been lacking. Telemental health (TMH) programs are being implemented nationally to address inequities in access to mental health services, but little scientific evidence is available regarding their efficacy, particularly with children. The goal of the proposed research is to test the efficacy of a TMH service delivery model for improving care and outcomes for children with a prevalent psychiatric condition who are treated by primary care physicians (PCPs) in 5 underserved communities in the Pacific Northwest. The research proposed is a randomized controlled trial of PCP care augmented by TMH-delivered evidence- based treatment of children (N=250) 7-11 years old diagnosed with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) versus treatment as usual by the PCP. Hispanic children will comprise 30% of the study sample. The experimental condition will consist of 6 pharmacotherapy sessions delivered by child psychiatrists through videoconferencing in conjunction with the referring PCP who will prescribe medications and 6 sessions of parent behavioral training delivered in-person by a community therapist supervised by a telepsychologist. The control condition will consist of treatment as usual with the PCP augmented by a single telepsychiatric consultation, which is current standard care in the participating communities. For children in both experimental and control conditions, hyperactivity, inattentiveness, oppositionality/defiance, and functional impairment, as well as parental stress, burden, and empowerment will be assessed 5 times from baseline to 25-week follow- up. In the experimental group, adherence to treatment protocols will be carefully monitored for families, telepsychiatrists, local community therapists, and PCPs. If under the experimental delivery model, improvements in clinical outcomes are demonstrated, and if an evidence-based treatment protocol can be implemented with fidelity, then TMH health service delivery models could be deployed with confidence to help rectify the severe geographic maldistribution of pediatric mental health services and to build new models of collaborative care within PC. This telemental health (TMH) investigation holds promise for improving the nation's public health and welfare in three ways. First, TMH offers children and families suffering with emotional and behavioral disorders help that cannot be found locally by redistributing specialty mental health care from urban centers to underserved communities. Second, TMH offers secondary and tertiary prevention by reaching children's in need prior to the full evolution of mental illness and its associated impairments. Third, TMH offers primary care physicians, teachers, and other professionals' assistance in their efforts to care for our nation's children.          ",Telemental Health to Improve Mental Health Care and Outcomes for Children in Unde,7526394,R01MH081997,"['Modeling ', ' Specialist ', ' Third-Party Payer ', ' Quality of Care ', ' QOC ', ' response ', ' social stigma ', ' stigma ', ' Youth ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' functional disability ', ' Functional impairment ', ' Academy ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' patient registry ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' Information Technology ', ' underserved rural area ', ' Underserved Population ', ' underserved people ', ' under served population ', ' novel strategies ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel approaches ', ' new approaches ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' 11 year old ', ' eleven year old ', ' age 11 years ', ' Impairment ', ' clinical effect ', ' service intervention ', ' collaborative care ', ' Computers ', ' Consultations ', ' Control Groups ', ' Data Collection ', ' Decision Making ', ' Healthy People 2010 ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ', ' attention deficit hyperactive disorder ', ' Predominantly Hyperactive-Impulsive Type Hyperactivity Disorder ', ' Predominantly Hyperactive-Impulsive Type Attention-Deficit Disorder ', ' Hyperkinetic Syndrome ', ' Hyperactivity Disorder NOS ', ' ADHD ', ' AD/HD ', ' Pharmacotherapy ', ' Drug Therapy ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' telehealth ', ' Address ', ' Videoconferencing ', ' Videoconferences ', ' Child Mental Health ', ' Symptoms ', ' Caring ', ' Family Physicians ', ' Adherence (attribute) ', ' Adherence ', ' High Prevalence ', ' Improve Access ', ' Monitor ', ' Rate ', ' Evolution ', ' Process ', ' follow-up ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' Behavioral ', ' Family ', ' Guidelines ', ' Foundations ', ' Freedom ', ' Liberty ', ' Future ', ' Affect ', ' Evidence based treatment ', ' Geographic Locations ', ' geographic site ', ' MeSH Descriptors Class 4 ', ' Geographical Location ', ' Geographic Region ', ' Geographic Area ', ' Geography ', ' Standards of Weights and Measures ', ' base ', ' rural area ', ' urban area ', ' Goals ', ' improved ', ' Health ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Health Resources ', ' Health Services ', ' health care service ', ' Psychiatric therapeutic procedure ', ' psychiatric treatment ', ' psychiatric therapy ', ' psychiatric care ', ' Site ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Adolescent ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Randomized Clinical Trials ', ' Institute of Medicine (U.S.) ', ' NAS/IOM ', ' Institute of Medicine ', ' Ensure ', ' Equipment and supply inventories ', ' Inventory ', ' Evaluation ', ' Screening procedure ', ' screenings ', ' screening ', ' Training ', ' teacher ', ' Psyche structure ', ' mental ', ' Childhood ', ' pediatric ', ' pediatrician ', ' Longevity ', ' lifespan ', ' life span ', ' Length of Life ', ' Rural ', ' satisfaction ', ' Funding ', ' Americas ', ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health Services ', ' Mental Hygiene Services ', ' Morbidity -

"Disparities Among Children Served by the CMHS Children's Services Program    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application is submitted by the Johns Hopkins University and ORC Macro in response to PA-04-019, which encourages applications focusing on the Center for Mental Health Services' (CMHS) Comprehensive Community Mental Health Services for Children and Their Families Program. Since 1993, CMHS has provided funding to 121 grantees to develop service systems to provide a comprehensive spectrum of mental health and other support services to children with serious emotional disturbance (SED) and their families. We are proposing to analyze data available from approximately 69,000 youth served and 28,000 youth enrolled in the monitoring component of the study in order to investigate racial/ethnic, gender, and age differences in the characteristics of youth entering the program and disparities in the services received and outcomes. The project has three aims. Aim 1. Describe characteristics of youth at baseline for all 121 Service Programs initiated since 1993 (and any added during the study period) and identify trends in these baseline characteristics across this time period. Aim 2. Investigate the potential disparities at baseline and in treatment outcomes for youth enrolled in the program. Aim 3. Identify the determinants of treatment trajectories and also the determinants of disparities in treatment outcomes over time. We hypothesize that the characteristics of youth served will vary over time and that disparities in outcomes will become less over time. This research will identify gaps in our current services and the extent to which disparities remain a challenge, even in our nation's model program.           ",Disparities Among Children Served by the CMHS Children's Services Program,7479829,R01MH075828,"['Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Emotional Disturbance ', ' Environment ', ' Data ', ' Applications Grants ', ' Grant Proposals ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Monitor ', ' trend ', ' Rate ', ' Characteristics ', ' Exhibits ', ' Family ', ' Family Characteristics ', ' Affect ', ' Geographic Locations ', ' geographic site ', ' MeSH Descriptors Class 4 ', ' Geographical Location ', ' Geographic Region ', ' Geographic Area ', ' Age ', ' base ', ' child mental health service ', ' Goals ', ' improved ', ' Health ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Site ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Adolescent ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Evaluation ', ' Alcohol or Other Drugs use ', ' using substances ', ' substance use ', ' AOD use ', ' Individual ', ' Funding ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health Services ', ' Mental Hygiene Services ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Psychopathology ', ' abnormal psychology ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Research ', ' Appendix ', ' programs ', ' Time ', ' United States Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration ', ' Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration ', ' SAMHSA ', ' Universities ', ' Severities ', ' Source ', ' System ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' size ', ' Mental disorders ', ' psychological disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Services ', ' information gathering ', ' age group ', ' health service demonstration project ', ' racial difference ', ' race differences ', ' age difference ', ' Reporting ', ' Gender ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Behavior ', ' Treatment outcome ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' Youth ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Communities ', ' Community Mental Health Services ', ' care systems ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' racial/ethnic ', ' Computer Systems Development ', ' Congresses ', ' meeting reports ', ' ']",NIMH,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R01,2008,404194,0.04558792375364972
"Innovations in the Measurement of Racial/Ethnic Disparities in Mental Health Care    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Understanding the state of racial/ethnic disparities in mental health care has been limited by a lack of consensus on appropriate methods. The predominant methods used in the literature are to compare unadjusted means, or to use multivariate regression methods to identify the independent association between race and mental health care. In light of the Institute of Medicine (IOM) definition of disparity in quality of health care, as presented in Unequal Treatment, these methods may over- or under-estimate disparities. The IOM defines disparities as all differences except those due to clinical appropriateness, need, and preferences. The objective of this application is to improve the identification of disparities in mental health care by refining and applying methods conceptually grounded in the IOM definition. The research will increase understanding of how the burden of mental illness differs by race/ethnicity. Progress can then be tracked towards the reduction of disparities in mental health care, with the ultimate goal of reducing the burden of mental illness felt by all racial/ethnic groups. The proposed research implements the IOM definition of racial disparities by adjusting for health status while allowing the mediation of socioeconomic status (SES) variables. Two adjustment methods are used: a rank and replace method and a propensity score-based method. These methods are refined and applied to mental health status and utilization measures in commonly used, nationally representative datasets. The specific aims of this proposal are: 1.

"Mental health disparities in low-income populations    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): People living in low-socioeconomic (SES) circumstances are at increased risk for a number of detrimental physical and mental health outcomes, including depression (e.g., Lorant et al., 2003). Although numerous studies confirm the link between SES and depressive symptoms, the mechanisms underlying this association are not clear. What are the factors that explain the disparity in mental health outcomes across levels of SES? The long-term goal of the current research is to address this question. In addition to lacking material resources, low-SES individuals are also more likely to be lacking interpersonal resources compared to more affluent individuals: low-income individuals are less likely to be married, more likely to be in distressed relationships, and less likely to have social support resources (e.g., Conger et al., 1990; White & Rogers, 2000). The current research proposes that this lack of interpersonal resources can help to explain the association between SES and depressive symptoms. Using a large random probability survey dataset (N = 6,012) that oversampled for low-SES individuals and racial/ethnic minorities, the current application will test a mediation model that will help shed light on mental health disparities. The first aim of this research is to explore the mechanisms underlying the association between SES and depressive symptoms, by examining interpersonal factors as potential mediators of this association. As part of this goal, I will examine if interpersonal resources are especially important buffering factors for individuals who are lacking in material resources. The second aim of this research is to evaluate the relative importance of each interpersonal factor (e.g., would it be more helpful to target the amount of social support available to low-SES individuals or promote relationship skills?). The third aim is to examine if the proposed model differs by race/ethnicity. The findings from this research have important public health implications. The proposed model suggests that programs that strengthen low-SES individuals' interpersonal resources (e.g., relationship satisfaction, social support resources) would be a promising avenue for future public health interventions. The proposed research will also provide much-needed data to inform current policies that target interpersonal factors in low-SES populations (e.g., the Healthy Marriage Initiative, 2005). By addressing interpersonal resources in a diverse sample, this study will inform policy-makers seeking alternative routes to promote mental health and reduce depression in disadvantaged communities.          ",Mental health disparities in low-income populations,7540058,F31MH084381,"['Link ', ' Income ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Distress ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Individual ', ' Numbers ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' Love ', ' Low Income Population ', ' Policy Maker ', ' satisfaction ', ' Policies ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Marriage ', ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' Names ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Respondent ', ' Population Policies ', ' Poverty ', ' Probability ', ' Probability Samples ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' Depressed mood ', ' sadness ', ' depressed ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Sampling Studies ', ' Social support ', ' social support network ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Stress ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Source ', ' Route ', ' interest ', ' Services ', ' experience ', ' stressor ', ' intervention program ', ' Buffers ', ' Structure ', ' skills ', ' Mediation ', ' Negotiation ', ' Negotiating ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' Substance abuse problem ', ' substance abuse ', ' abuse of substances ', ' Censuses ', ' Friends ', ' Relative (related person) ', ' Relative ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' depressive symptoms ', ' depressive ', ' depression symptom ', ' Emotional Depression ', ' Hispanics ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Modeling ', ' social stress ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Communities ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Drug abuse ', ' abuses drugs ', ' abuse of drugs ', ' low socioeconomic status ', ' low socioeconomic position ', ' low socio-economic status ', ' low socio-economic position ', ' Low income ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Address ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Social Network ', ' Jail ', ' Data ', ' Rate ', ' Zip Code ', ' socioeconomics ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomic ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio economic ', ' Family ', ' Spouses ', ' Married Persons ', ' Florida ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Future ', ' base ', ' Goals ', ' psychologic ', ' psychological ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,F31,2008,29962,0.02663172199321028

"Testing an IHCA for Guardians of Survivors of Intraparental Homicide    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): About 4000 children per year are stressed when one of their parents is murdered by the other parent, at least as many as are affected by leukemia per year. At this time, there is no tested intervention available for these children or the families struggling to care for them. Intraparental homicide (IPH) is a particularly devastating trauma and stressor for children. In a single act, children usually lose both parent to either death, prison or both. While there are few studies of this phenomenon, the available data indicate that children experience substantial short- and long-term mental health consequences such as post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Findings from prior research by this team indicate that guardians of these children did not know how to help the children. The guardians experience significant stress and disruption in their families, demanding new coping abilities and new support in order for them to adapt. The investigators are completing a study (R01- NR008532) that describes the experiences of these children. The present study builds on the findings of that study. Exhaustive searches of the scientific and clinical literature have uncovered no interventions directed toward these guardians. The present proposal is to test an interactive health communication application (IHCA) as a way of providing information and support to the guardians of these child survivors of IPH. Use of IHCA has been found to be effective for a variety of other health conditions (Murray, Burns, See Tai, Lai, & Nazareth, 2005) such as women with breast cancer and children with asthma and their parents. The IHCA program to be used here will consist of the following components: an Instant Library of articles on topics of interest to these guardians; a resource directory (descriptions and contact information, including web links) of national and local organizations providing victim services, mental health services, parenting support, legal services, faith-based, drug and alcohol, etc. and other organizations; limited access asynchronous chat, allowing for peer-to-peer support in a safe and anonymous format; `Ask an Expert' with expert responses to user questions; and personal stories, text accounts of how others have experienced caring for children bereaved by IPH. The researchers will first refine the IHCA using focus group interviews with guardians of children bereaved by IPH. They will then randomly assign guardians of children bereaved by IPH to the IHCA intervention vs open computer internet use (63 in each group) to determine if the guardians using the IHCA have greater `parenting' capabilities and less `parenting' stress and if the children experience improved behavior and mental health. These findings will then be used at the termination of this project to design a larger, phase III, randomized clinical trial to test the efficacy of this guardian intervention vs. resources available through open internet usage. Project Narrative About 4000 children each year are bereaved by intraparental homicide (IPH) each year, and there are about 70,000 such stressed children currently in the US. The mental health and behavioral consequences of this stress are substantial. These children are disproportionately African American, making this a source of health disparity as well. This proposal therefore offers an opportunity to address both an understudied topic (NINR, 2007) and a substantial health disparity.          ",Testing an IHCA for Guardians of Survivors of Intraparental Homicide,7529974,R21MH082197,"['Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Legal ', ' Elements ', ' Address ', ' Child Mental Health ', ' Caring ', ' Data ', ' Health Communication ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Text ', ' Behavioral ', ' Family ', ' Killings ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Affect ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Health ', ' Homicide ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Randomized Clinical Trials ', ' Survivors ', ' Link ', ' Infant ', ' Interview ', ' leukemia ', ' Blood (Leukemia) ', ' Libraries ', ' Numbers ', ' Literature ', ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health Services ', ' Mental Hygiene Services ', ' Internet ', ' world wide web ', ' web ', ' WWW ', ' Published Directory ', ' Directory ', ' Parents ', ' Prisons ', ' Disruption ', ' Condition ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Safety ', ' programs ', ' Stress ', ' Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders ', ' traumatic neurosis ', ' Posttraumatic Stress Disorders ', ' Posttraumatic Neuroses ', ' Post-Traumatic Neuroses ', ' PTSD ', ' Sudden infant death syndrome ', ' Sudden Unexpected Infant Death ', ' Sudden Infant Death ', ' SIDS ', ' Crib Death ', ' Cot Death ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Asthma ', ' Bronchial Asthma ', ' United States ', ' Woman ', ' Week ', ' Source ', ' Behavior ', ' interest ', ' Services ', ' experience ', ' stressor ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' Burn injury ', ' Burns ', ' Structure ', ' peer ', ' Measures ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Behavior ', ' Child Care ', ' Puericulture ', ' Parenting behavior ', ' Parenting ', ' accomplished suicide ', ' completed suicide ', ' commit suicide ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Family member ', ' Murder ', ' response ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Directories ', ' Accounting ', ' comparison group ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' alcohol and other drug ', ' traumatized children ', ' coping ', ' direct application ', ' Trauma ', ' Computers ', ' Coping Behavior ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA,R21,2008,215888,0.0008514337070368755
"M-RISP at San Diego State University    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  We request funds to continue and expand our very successful M-RISP. Our goal is still to enhance the capacity of SDSU to conduct mental health research that is responsive to NIMH priorities and that leads to applications that can be funded through RO1 and R03 mechanisms. We are dedicated to promoting and supporting high quality mental health research, focused on ethnic disparities. Faculty obtain release time, funded through the M-RISP and matched by the university, through an intramural research competition. Several minority students are supported and assist the faculty. A systematic and extensive plan for educating both M-RISP faculty and students about high quality mental health research is proposed, with the help of collaborators from UCSD. Support for faculty presentations of their research findings will be made available, a brown bag will be established so faculty can receive feedback about their research ideas before implementation, and biostatistical consulting, mentoring, and a mental health colloquium series are included. These activities will 1) increase research collaborations among faculty members at SDSU and research-intensive institutions; 2) establish national and international faculty networks for mental health research; 3) increase the number of faculty members who seek and obtain RO1-level extramural funding; and 4) increase faculty research productivity, as demonstrated by peer-reviewed presentations and publications. The number of ethnic minority investigators who conduct research to address the NIMH priorities and who become funded by NIMH will increase. In addition, three Independent Investigator projects associated with the M-RISP core are proposed. They include: studies examining the effects of marital satisfaction on mental health, the impact of national identification on the mental health of minorities, and the coping strategies employed by minority adolescents and their effects on mental health. All of the independent investigators address current NIMH priorities, and their research is relevant to public health because it will increase the understanding of ethnic differences in the causes and cures of mental health problems. Interventions tailored to help minorities overcome their unique barriers to receiving treatment can be designed better as a result of the proposed research. SDSU will integrate the Career Opportunities in Research (COR) Program withM-RISP.

"Culturally Responsive Person-Centered Care for Psychosis    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Patient-centered care has become increasingly important over the past several decades, though the translation of these principles into clinical practices that customize care on an individual basis have been markedly inconsistent. This gap between principles and practices is especially evident in the context of public sector care for people with psychosis. As documented thoroughly in the Surgeon General's recent report Mental Health: Culture, Race, and Ethnicity (2001), the disenfranchisement of adults with psychosis is further accentuated among ethnic/racial minority communities in urban environments.  The proposed study addresses these health disparities through qualitative and experimental evaluations of two complementary approaches to culturally responsive person-centered care for psychosis. The study has the following three specific aims: 1) to describe perceived barriers to, and benefits of, processes of help-seeking, participation in psychiatric care, and illness self-management efforts among low-income adults of color being treated for psychosis; 2) to evaluate the effectiveness of a facilitated approach to person-centered care with and without the augmentation of a community integration program in increasing customization of care over a 6 and 18-month period of outpatient treatment. Primary outcomes of person centered care are hypothesized to be increases in illness self-management and satisfaction with services, and secondary outcomes to be decreased symptoms and enhanced clinical and functional status and quality of life; and 3) to test a theoretical model that stipulates relationships between ethnic identity, community resources, and degree of cultural responsiveness and collaboration present in relationships between patients and outpatient mental health providers in mediating customization of care among an urban population of low-income adults of color.  By identifying critical factors that promote effective patient-provider partnerships, this project enhances prospects for person-centered care and self-management of psychosis for low-income urban communities of color. If successful in the state of Connecticut, the project will offer a model that then can be replicated throughout the country to enhance care for this historically underserved population.           ",Culturally Responsive Person-Centered Care for Psychosis,7426421,R01MH067687,"['Provider ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Low income ', ' Environment ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Caring ', ' Data ', ' Range ', ' Process ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' base ', ' urban area ', ' Health Personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Housing ', ' Psychiatric therapeutic procedure ', ' psychiatric treatment ', ' psychiatric therapy ', ' psychiatric care ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Medical ', ' Interview ', ' Evaluation ', ' Psyche structure ', ' mental ', ' Individual ', ' satisfaction ', ' Patient-Centered Care ', ' Funding ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Medicine ', ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' Theoretical model ', ' Theoretic Models ', ' Collaborations ', ' Outpatients ', ' Out-patients ', ' Patients ', ' Psychotic Disorders ', ' Psychoses ', ' Public Sector ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Condition ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Social isolation ', ' Stigmata ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Victimization ', ' Testing ', ' Translating ', ' Translations ', ' Unemployment ', ' unemployed ', ' out of work ', ' joblessness ', ' jobless ', ' Urban Population ', ' Investigation ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' Country ', ' Services ', ' preference ', ' Surgeon ', ' American ', ' functional status ', ' mental health center ', ' Participant ', ' help-seeking behavior ', ' help seeking ', ' Reporting ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Mediating ', ' Self Management ', ' Modeling ', ' social stigma ', ' stigma ', ' Color ', ' Communities ', ' Community Mental Health Centers ', ' CMHC ', ' Underserved Population ', ' underserved people ', ' under served population ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Community Integration ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' person centered ', ' Connecticut ', ' ']",NIMH,CONNECTICUT ST DEPT OF MH/ADDICTION SRVS,R01,2008,337392,0.04011383547644064
"Training Future Generations of Mental Health Researchers DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  In order to meet the nation's growing need for researchers in clinical psychiatry, translational neuroscience, and interventions/mental health services research, we propose in this competing renewal of R25 MH60473-06 to continue our Junior Faculty Scholars (JFS) program, designed to assist newly appointed assistant professors earn K23 and K01 awards. Of 22 scholar participants in the program, 16 have submitted K awards, 15 have been reviewed to date, and 13 (86.7%) have been funded (6 on the first submission, 7 on the second submission); this compares with an NIMH-wide success rate of 36% over the past five years. The JFS program encompasses a two-year period of 25% salary support, a weekly research survival skills practicum, mentoring by a senior mental health researcher, availability of seed money support, and access to data management and biostatistical support. Scholars also participate in workshops designed to enhance knowledge of biostatistics, psychiatric genetics, neuroimaging, and mental health interventions and services research.      In order to correct another remediable ""leak"" from the pipeline of new mental health researchers, we also propose to broaden the scope of the current JFS program to assist further development of scholars who have obtained K awards toward two additional career-development objectives: (1) R01 support; and (2) enhanced mentoring skills. We will help Scholars and their Mentors develop intensive long-term mentoring plans to realize these two developmental objectives, thereby enlarging a dedicated cadre of mentors in psychiatric research. At the same time we are committed to maintaining our efforts to help minority researchers (primarily African American) launch and maintain their careers in mental health research, an objective we will pursue in collaboration with the University's new EXPORT Center.      Our Research Education Evaluation plan will track the success of Scholars in competing for research career development (K01 or K23) and subsequent R01 awards (Specific Aim 1) and mid-career independent scientist awards (K02 or K24) (Specific Aim 2); as well as the success of under-represented minority Scholars in garnering career-development and other competitive research support (Specific Aim 3).

"M-RISP at San Francisco State University    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  San Francisco State University (SFSU) requests funds for the renewal, continuation and expansion of our highly successful M-RISP program, currently in the second year of its initial three-year funding. The goal of the program is to enhance the institutional capacity of SFSU by conducting mental health research projects that are responsive to NIMH priorities and can potentially be funded through regular R01 and R03 mechanisms. Situated within an academic institution committed to ethnic diversity and responsive to the needs of ethnic minority communities, our M-RISP program emphasizes research that addresses mental health disparities among ethnic minority groups in the United States. In addition, we aim to increase the number of ethnic minority Principal Investigators funded by NIMH. To achieve these goals, we propose to conduct a set of faculty mentoring, networking, and institutional development activities, many of which have been piloted successfully within our current M-RISP program, including the implementation of structured ""proposal development groups"" and methodological/statistical workshops. Through intramural competitions, we will select 12 junior faculty members and mentor them in the development of mental health research proposals to be submitted extramurally. We will also support the implementation of four new individual faculty projects that address mental health concerns in African American (Dr. Williams), Latino (Dr. Velez), Asian (Dr. AIvarez) and Native American (Dr. Nelson) populations. The results obtained from these four projects will be incorporated as preliminary studies in future R01 submissions by the four investigators.      All activities will be conducted under the direction of Dr. Rafael Diaz, M-RISP Program Director, a developmental psychologist whose research has been funded by different institutes at NIH for the past 10 years. The M-RISP will be co-directed by Dr. John Rogers, a social psychologist and methodologist with ample experience in the use of quantitative and qualitative methodologies, as well as in survey and experimental designs.

"Multi-Method Ethnographic Assessment of Behavioral Health Reform in New Mexico    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The State of New Mexico will implement a major reform in managed mental health service delivery for low-income populations in July 2005. Seventeen state agencies will contract with a single behavioral health organization to oversee the delivery of all public mental health services. This reform is designed to decrease administrative costs and service fragmentation while improving access to culturally relevant, evidence-based mental health services, particularly in rural areas. However, concerns linger that managed mental health care programs may adversely affect access and services for vulnerable populations and may overly burden rural safety-net institutions. The 5-year R01 research project proposed in this application will use a multi-method ethnographic approach to examine: (1) the process of introducing the reform in a rural and multiethnic state and (2) the degree to which the reform results in improved access and quality of care for low-income seriously mentally ill (SMI) patients in public mental health programs and other safety-net institutions.  This longitudinal study has three specific aims: (1) To examine changes in help-seeking behavior, access, and utilization of services by American Indian, Hispanic, and White SMI patients and their social supports (e.g., family and close peers) in three rural and three urban settings before, during, and after the reform. (2) To investigate changes in the work environment, attitudes, and behavior of frontline service providers and staff members of safety-net institutions in the targeted settings before, during, and after the reform. (3) To assess the impacts of the reform on the organization and financial condition of safety-net institutions in the targeted settings and statewide.  Our multi-method ethnographic research strategy will employ both qualitative and quantitative methods in two sets of studies, conducted prior to and after the reform is implemented. The first set, consisting of administrative database reviews and ethnographic interviews and observations with SMI patients and frontline service providers, will describe changes in patterns of mental health care utilization and provider behavior. These studies will occur in three rural counties and three comparison urban counties. The second set, consisting of ethnographic interviews with state policymakers and structured surveys with clinical directors of rural and urban safety-net institutions, will identify changes in service provision for the SMI statewide. This latter statewide component will facilitate linking of the community-level ethnographic data with broader system change.  The proposed ethnographic assessment of New Mexico's reform will offer new practical knowledge, grounded in the actual experiences of diverse stakeholders, that may improve state mental health policy for rural and minority SMI populations. In collaboration with the State of New Mexico, we will assess whether the reform decreases barriers to   care for these underserved groups and how it affects the viability of existing services rendered in safety-net institutions.  This research will fill a gap in research on statewide assessments of public health care initiatives, which do not typically focus on patient help-seeking behavior and the unique access and utilization problems faced by rural, racial and ethnic minorities. Since rural states may turn to the New Mexico reform as a model to reduce administrative costs and service fragmentation and to increase access for the SMI, this research is of great national relevance.

"Cultural Development of an Adolescent Mental Health Quality of Life Instrument    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Improving health related quality of life (HRQOL) is a major goal in the treatment of all chronic illnesses. In addition, there is growing consensus that assessment of quality of life is crucial to provide a complete picture of children's physical and mental health status. To our knowledge there are no HRQOL instruments specifically developed for adolescents with mental health problems. Therefore, the central goal of the proposed application is to develop, test, and validate an adolescent HRQOL instrument for mental health [AQOL-MH) in Spanish and English. This will provide a culturally valid outcome measure that will contribute to reduce mental health care disparities. This instrument will help mental health professionals focus on particular HRQOL domains during the diagnostic process; thereby assisting both patients and providers set, define and evaluate adequate treatment goals. This proposal presents a unique opportunity for a young faculty with extensive experience in behavioral sciences research, to advance her career and obtain independent funding. The ultimate objective of this proposal is to develop ah RO1 application to administer the AQOL-MH to representative clinical samples in order to target its usefulness in evaluating clinical effectiveness in treatment programs and interventions. The specific aims of this proposal are the following:      Aim 1: To develop themes that respond to the construct of quality of life as perceived by adolescents who are receiving services for mental health problems in Puerto Rican and Mexican American, as well as Anglo populations. The development will be achieved using a grounded theory approach with the use of focus groups and in-depth interviews of clinical samples of Latino and US non-Latino youth who are recruited to have one of four prevalent mental disorders; ADHD, Conduct Disorder, Generalized Anxiety, and Depression.      Aim 2: To test the psychometric properties of the measure developed in Aim 1 using clinical and nonclinical samples of youth from Puerto Rico and the US. Psychometric analyses will include assessments of internal structure, tests for differential item functioning across Latino and non-Latino as well as gender groups, and preliminary tests of construct validity.      Aim 3: Test the usefulness of the short-form AQOL-MH for tracking change during the course of service use in evidence based practice among youth with ADHD and Depression disorders in Puerto Rico. To achieve this aim we will recruit 60 youth who begin to receive treatment and we will obtain a baseline and two repeated assessments of HRQOL at six month intervals.          ",Cultural Development of an Adolescent Mental Health Quality of Life Instrument,7498726,SC1HD060888,"['Provider ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ', ' attention deficit hyperactive disorder ', ' Predominantly Hyperactive-Impulsive Type Hyperactivity Disorder ', ' Predominantly Hyperactive-Impulsive Type Attention-Deficit Disorder ', ' Hyperkinetic Syndrome ', ' Hyperactivity Disorder NOS ', ' ADHD ', ' AD/HD ', ' Major Depressive Disorder ', ' major depression ', ' Symptoms ', ' Conduct Disorder ', ' disorders of conduct ', ' disorder of conduct ', ' Caring ', ' Evidence based practice ', ' Data ', ' Range ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Exhibits ', ' Faculty ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Health Professional ', ' Healthcare professional ', ' Health Care Professional ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' career ', ' concept ', ' Goals ', ' improved ', ' Health ', ' Health Status ', ' Level of Health ', ' Depth ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Adolescent ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Interview ', ' Evaluation ', ' disability ', ' Individual ', ' Measurement ', ' Funding ', ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health Services ', ' Mental Hygiene Services ', ' Mexican Americans ', ' Chicanos ', ' Chicanas ', ' Generalized Anxiety Disorder ', ' Persons ', ' Quality-of-Life Assessment ', ' Patients ', ' Psychometrics ', ' Puerto Rican ', ' Puerto Rico ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' instrument ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Condition ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' recruit ', ' Research ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Schools ', ' Consensus ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Treatment Protocols ', ' Treatment Schedule ', ' Treatment Regimen ', ' Asthma ', ' Bronchial Asthma ', ' Hyperactive behavior ', ' Motor Hyperactivity ', ' Hyperkinetic Movements ', ' Hyperkinesis ', ' Hyperkinesia ', ' Hyperactivity ', ' Work ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' Mental disorders ', ' psychological disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Behavioral Sciences ', ' Services ', ' experience ', ' Structure ', ' treatment program ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Categories ', ' Friends ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Generic Drugs ', ' generic ', ' Nonproprietary Drugs ', ' Latino ', ' Outcome Measure ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' chronic disorder ', ' chronic disease/disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Adolescent Development ', ' Treatment Effectiveness ', ' Property ', ' LOINC Axis 2 Property ', ' Youth ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' theories ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' health related quality of life ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Clinical effectiveness ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' ']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF PUERTO RICO MED SCIENCES,SC1,2008,261227,0.056756824954850266
"Diversity Workshop at ENAR DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The purpose of this application is to enhance an ongoing annual workshop on the recruitment, retention, and promotion of biostatisticians of color at the annual meeting of the Eastern North Atlantic Region (ENAR) of the International Biometric Society (IBS), which is the major annual conference for biostatisticians in academia and government. The first enhancement is to add a mental health research focus in a context that stimulates future and current researchers from underrepresented minorities to pursue graduate studies and careers in biostatistics. The second enhancement is to obtain secure, long-term funding for the workshop, which since its inception in 1999 has been minimally funded by a mix of sources. With this Conference Grant, NIMH will provide continuity to the workshop so that it will receive the advanced publicity and planning necessary for drawing the necessary attendees and making the desired impact that is needed in biostatistics and mental health research. More significantly from NIMH's point of view, it will be providing prospective and current biostatisticians exposure to mental health research, which in turn will help increase the number of biostatisticians, in general, and biostatisticians of color in particular, who are committed to mental health research and related areas of biomedical comorbidities. The workshop will target undergraduates with majors in math, statistics, or quantitative psychology, from local Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs), Hispanic-Serving Institutions (HSIs), and Native American Tribal Colleges (TCs), graduate students in biostatistics programs, faculty members at HBCUs, HSIs, and TCs who may serve as advisors and/or mentors to the undergraduates, faculty from graduate biostatistics programs with collaborations in mental health and other biomedical areas, and statistical and mental health representatives from industry and governmental agencies. Through interactive sessions featuring workshop participants, the workshop will offer in-depth coverage of a variety of key topics in three general areas in the context of health promotion (e.g., mental health): (1) the experiences and expectations of graduate biostatistics students of color; (2) career opportunities for persons of color with advanced degrees in biostatistics; and 3) networking among students and professional from academia, industry, and government.

"Trauma and Loss-Related Mental Health Needs of Latina Immigrants in Communities    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The PI, Stacey I. Kaltman, Ph.D., is a clinical psychologist who wishes to gain the skills and knowledge required to be an independent mental health services researcher focused on understanding and ameliorating disparities in access to and use of mental health services among low-income Latino immigrants in the US. The overall goal of this proposal is to gain an understanding of trauma and loss-related mental health needs of Latina immigrants from Central America and begin to develop culturally and linguistically competent services that are acceptable, effective, and accessible. This will be achieved via extensive training in Spanish as well as instruction in public health theory and methods. The specific training goals of the proposal are: 1) to increase cultural and linguistic competence to work with Latina immigrants with trauma exposure; 2) to utilize qualitative research methods to learn from the Latina immigrant's perspective about symptom perception, influences on help-seeking, and characteristics of culturally relevant interventions; 3) to apply formative research to the development and evaluation of community-based interventions; and 4) to enhance quantitative data analysis skills, building toward competence in longitudinal data analysis techniques that will be applied to intervention trials and program evaluations. The primary mentor will be Bonnie L. Green, PhD, with co-mentor Maria Cecilia Zea, PhD. Training will employ a balance of didactic coursework, mentored tutorials and critical discussions, and ongoing participation in research work groups. The research plan includes three studies, which encompass four research aims that relate directly to the training goals: 1) To study trauma and loss exposure and its mental health impact from the perspective of low-income Latina immigrants from Central America in community service settings; 2) To examine the mental and physical health correlates of trauma and loss exposure in a random sample of Central American immigrants who are engaged with community service settings; 3) To understand influences on symptom perception, predictors of help-seeking, and perceptions of culturally relevant trauma and loss-related mental health interventions among Central American immigrants; and 4) To develop and preliminarily pilot an adapted community-based intervention to address the specific trauma and loss-related mental health needs of Central American immigrants.           ",Trauma and Loss-Related Mental Health Needs of Latina Immigrants in Communities,7474596,K23MH077071,"['Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health Services ', ' health care service ', ' Clinical ', ' In-Migration ', ' Immigrations ', ' Training ', ' Psyche structure ', ' mental ', ' Learning ', ' Linguistics ', ' Linguistic ', ' Central American ', "" Women's Group "", ' Female Groups ', ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health Services ', ' Mental Hygiene Services ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' Immigrant ', ' Perception ', ' Poverty ', ' Program Evaluation ', ' Psychologist ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Risk ', ' Social support ', ' social support network ', ' Knowledge ', ' Training Programs ', ' War ', ' Work ', ' Techniques ', ' Country ', ' Services ', ' experience ', ' skills ', ' help-seeking behavior ', ' help seeking ', ' social ', ' Central America ', ' Gender ', ' Intervention Trial ', ' Competence ', ' Hispanics ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Latino ', ' Programmed Learning ', ' Research Methodology ', ' Research Methods ', ' Sampling ', ' Zea ', ' theories ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Communities ', ' Community Services ', ' Latina ', ' Latinas ', ' Qualitative Research ', ' Instruction ', ' neglect ', ' community based evaluation ', ' Trauma ', ' Conflict (Psychology) ', ' Conflict ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Low income ', ' Economics ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Equilibrium ', ' balance function ', ' balance ', ' Doctor of Philosophy ', ' PhD ', ' Ph.D. ', ' High Prevalence ', ' Characteristics ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' base ', ' ']",NIMH,GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY,K23,2008,154091,0.07828981632926012
"A Cross-Cultural, Patient-Centered Approach for Assessing Quality of ADHD Care    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Racial-ethnic disparities in diagnosis and treatment of Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) suggest that all children with ADHD are at risk for poor quality of care. In order to better understand these disparities in ADHD care quality, Dr. Eugenia Chan, a developmental-behavioral pediatrician, is submitting this revised applications for a Mentored Patient-Oriented Career Development Award (K23) to develop a cross-cultural, patient-centered approach for assessing quality of primary care management of children with ADHD. The overall goals are to develop a conceptual understanding of barriers to effective care from patient and family perspectives, to understand how and why these problems vary across cultural groups, and to develop instruments and methods to measure these patient-centered processes of care and to guide interventions to improve clinical care and outcomes for children with ADHD. The specific aims are to (1) develop a patient-centered model of ADHD care quality by investigating similarities and differences in African-American, Chinese-American, and European-American family experiences of ADHD care; (2) develop and validate a parent survey of patient-centered indicators of ADHD care quality that are sensitive to cross-cultural values regarding care for ADHD; and (3) test the survey in a diverse, primary care patient population to assess psychometric properties and identify disparities in patient-centered ADHD care quality. The results of this project will lead directly to future applications to (1) investigate relationships among patient-centered quality assessments, evidence-based quality indicators, and ADHD outcomes, (2) identify disparities in primary care management of ADHD, and (3) develop and implement targeted interventions to improve disparities in quality of ADHD care.

"Addressing Mental Health Services Disparities for Ethnically Diverse Children    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   The proposed study is in response to a Program Announcement entitled, Elimination of Health Disparities through Translation Research (R18). The purpose of the study is to adapt evidence-based interventions for use in urban schools with large numbers of low-income Latino students. The interventions will be delivered within a family-centered system for the delivery of mental health services for children that has the potential to be self- sustaining over time. The interventions, which are based on SW-PBS methodology, would address a range of behavioral disorders and concomitant peer difficulties experienced by children at school and at home. The study will take place in two public schools (K through 5th and K through 8th) in an urban area with high concentrations of low-income Latino families. Data will be collected simultaneously on three ongoing aspects of the project: (a) Development of a data collection system; (b) Improvement of key school systems; (c) Protocol modification and implementation. The proposed study is designed to reach all children attending the participating schools. Aims of the study are: (1) To develop a data collection system for SW-PBS that is useful, efficient, and acceptable; (2) To build the capacity of the school system to support the implementation of SW-PBS; (3) To identify components of SW-PBS primary and secondary tier interventions that need adaptation; (4) To determine the feasibility of implementing SW-PBS interventions in two under-resourced schools; (5) To assess acceptability of Tier 1 and Tier 2 interventions (uptake); and (6) To estimate the health outcome associated with the implementation of the SW-PBS package. Evidence-based intervention packages will be identified and modified based on focus groups, follow-up interviews and brief surveys with 93 parents and 60 teachers. Tier 1 interventions will be implemented first on 1,027 students. Children who do not respond to Tier 1 interventions will be assigned to one or more interventions for Tier 2 or they will be assessed and referred for treatment in the community. It is expected that 154 children will receive Tier 2 interventions in the school and that 63 parents of children in Tier 2 will receive parental skills training at a community center. The proposed study is the result of a partnership between researchers, experts in school-wide positive behavior support (SW-PBS), teaching staff, school administrators, parents/caregivers and community mental health workers. The study addresses a specific goal of Healthy People 2010--reducing or eliminating mental health services disparities among ethnically diverse children. The study may contribute to the development of an efficient and effective system for the delivery of mental health services to low-income, inner-city children and families. Data obtained for this study may contribute to a better understanding of factors that facilitate the adaptation and implementation of evidence-based interventions in under-resourced urban schools. The adapted evidence-based interventions described in this proposal are likely to contribute to a reduction in mental health services disparities among urban ethnically-diverse children. The proposal may also increase research interest in the effectiveness of school-wide positive behavior support (SW-PBS) interventions in under-resourced urban schools.     The adapted evidence-based interventions described in this proposal are likely to contribute to a reduction in mental health services disparities among urban ethnically-diverse children.

"MHREG for Research in Ethnically Diverse Communities    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): As the nation becomes more racially and ethnically diverse, novel approaches to research and research education are needed to decrease the burden of mental illness. Mood disorders are a leading cause of disability and a powerful contributor to mortality, including deaths by suicide. Treatments for mood disorders among Blacks and Latinos require innovative research models responsive to economic disparities, culturally- mediated preferences and expectations of treatment, and the co-morbidities that disproportionately affect people of color such as substance misuse and medical illness. Meeting this scientific and public health challenge requires innovation in the education of clinical scientists. New collaborations involving university and community partners must be developed, given the central roles that community agencies play in the lives of the emerging majority, and the understandable reluctance of many ethnic minorities to seek treatment in the existing specialized mental health care delivery system. The Rochester Program of Research and Innovation in Disparities Education (Rochester PRIDE) is a novel training program designed to inspire and prepare trainees to conduct mental health research in partnership with community agencies. Over the next five years, we will 1) enhance our established research training partnerships with community agencies in a manner that facilitates trainee research, 2) recruit and educate at least 25 trainees from psychology and medicine in a core didactic curriculum that features a new, multidisciplinary seminar titled ""Race, Socioeconomic Status and Health in the Urban Setting"", 3) implement an innovative collaborative mentoring- precepting program that teaches trainees how to develop and implement research in community settings, 4) evaluate PRIDE by monitoring trainee outcomes and by soliciting and reviewing feedback from an external Evaluator, and 5) disseminate our findings by convening symposia and publishing peer-reviewed articles describing program design, implementation, and outcomes. This multidisciplinary research education program will be highly attractive to trainees who seek to gain skills and knowledge to conduct research in real-world settings. Rochester PRIDE will also serve as a model for other mental health training and educational programs designed to meet the nation's changing public health needs. By the end of the Award period, we will have sufficient experience and data to disseminate the program's findings and expand its scope by adding trainees interested in research on children and adolescents. As well, we will consider adding trainees at other developmental levels or from other disciplines.           ",MHREG for Research in Ethnically Diverse Communities,7442274,R25MH074898,"['Educational Curriculum ', ' Curriculum ', ' Discrimination (Psychology) ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Legal ', ' Caribbean natives ', ' Economics ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Elements ', ' Environment ', ' Address ', ' Caring ', ' Data ', ' Research Training ', ' Monitor ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Faculty ', ' Family Practice ', ' family medicine ', ' Feedback ', ' Foundations ', ' Affect ', ' Africa ', ' base ', ' career ', ' Hand ', ' Health Status ', ' Level of Health ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Site ', ' Solid ', ' Clinical ', ' Biological ', ' Medical ', ' Adolescent ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' racism ', ' Caribbean region ', ' West Indies Region ', ' Caribbean Sea Region ', ' Caribbean ', ' Publishing Peer Reviews ', ' Training ', ' disability ', ' Latin America ', ' Learning ', ' Discipline ', ' Numbers ', ' health care service utilization ', ' healthcare utilization ', ' healthcare service utilization ', ' health services utilization ', ' Health Care Utilization ', ' African ', ' Educational workshop ', ' Workshop ', ' Interdisciplinary Study ', ' Multidisciplinary Research ', ' Multidisciplinary Collaboration ', ' Interdisciplinary Research ', ' Battered Women ', ' abuse of women ', ' abuse of females ', ' Abused women ', ' Abused females ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Medicine ', ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health Services ', ' Mental Hygiene Services ', ' Mentors ', ' Mission ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Mortality ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' Epidemiologic Studies ', ' epidemiologic investigation ', ' Epidemiology Research ', ' Epidemiological Studies ', ' Epidemiologic Research ', ' Collaborations ', ' Immigrant ', ' Press Releases ', ' Nuts ', ' Physicians ', ' Play ', ' Poverty ', ' Preventive Medicine ', ' preventative medicine ', ' Psychiatry ', ' Psychologist ', ' Psychology ', ' Clinical Psychology ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' recruit ', ' Nature ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Rest ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Social support ', ' social support network ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Medical Students ', ' Educational process of instructing ', ' Teaching ', ' Scientist ', ' Training Programs ', ' Travel ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' Voice ', ' Work ', ' Automobile Driving ', ' driving ', ' Award ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' Mental disorders ', ' psychological disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Mood Disorders ', ' Affective Disorders ', ' psychosocial ', ' interest ', ' Postdoctoral Fellow ', ' post-doctoral ', ' post-doc ', ' Research Associate ', ' Postdoc ', ' preference ', ' experience ', ' care delivery ', ' knowledge base ', ' knowledgebase ', ' skills ', ' expectation ', ' novel ', ' Prevention strategy ', ' Preventive strategy ', ' research study ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' Relative (related person) ', ' Relative ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Police ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' symposium ', ' conference ', ' Latino ', ' Mediating ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' diverse populations ', ' Research Methodology ', ' Research Methods ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Modeling ', ' desire ', ' Cities ', ' Color ', ' Communities ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Minority ', ' suicidal morbidity ', ' suicide morbidity ', ' suicide death ', ' novel strategies ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel approaches ', ' new approaches ', ' Outcome ', ' Community Integration ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' community based participatory research ', ' health training ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF ROCHESTER,R25,2008,219005,0.029837204674584044
"Exploring Parent & Youth Concepts of Teen Mental Illness in High-Poverty Settings    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This exploratory qualitative study asks: How do youth and their parents in high-poverty urban environments conceptualize, recognize and respond to teen mental health problems? Mental health problems not only take an emotional toll on families, but also can interfere with normal adolescent development, impeding academic success and the establishment of healthy relationships. Yet as many as two-thirds of adolescents experiencing mental health problems, including those with psychiatric disorders, are underserved by the mental health service system. This is especially the case for economically disadvantaged youth, many of whom reside in our nation's inner cities. Building on over a decade of research conducted with New York City schools serving low-income families, this study will use a theoretically and empirically informed qualitative approach to create a rich database of youths' and parents' ""emic"" concepts of teen mental health problems and treatment. Core data collection will consist of semi-structured open-ended interviews with 100 parent-youth dyads. Narratives obtained through open-ended inquiry will further understanding of how families think about and make sense of adolescent mental health problems in their community. Examining parents' and youths' narratives will also help identify where there are barriers, including negative perceptions of and experiences with mental health services, that derail pathways to appropriate treatment. In addition, interviews will use hypothetical vignettes as a common stimulus to elicit norms, attitudes, and beliefs about teen mental health, psychiatric symptoms and illness, and treatment. An initial set of focus groups will conducted to obtain community input on the interview protocol and a final set of focus groups will be conducted to review key findings and their interpretation. The specific aims are to: 1. Elicit youth and parent emic conceptualizations of adolescent mental health problems, warning signs of problems, and beliefs and attitudes about mental illness and its treatment; 2. Identify normative beliefs, attitudes, and behaviors related to self-help practices and help-seeking strategies used by adolescents and parents to address teen mental health problems; 3. Synthesize findings to (a) refine a conceptual model of help seeking for teen problems that can guide future research and (b) contribute to the development of emic-informed strategies for improving teen mental health and mental health education, outreach, and services in high-poverty settings. The long-term goal is to inform culturally-relevant education, outreach and services that support families and improve the functioning and life chances of adolescents who may be experiencing mental health problems. Findings have the potential to provide a fuller understanding of why adolescents in challenging economically disadvantaged settings are underserved and what steps can be taken to remedy ongoing disparities.           ",Exploring Parent & Youth Concepts of Teen Mental Illness in High-Poverty Settings,7388227,R21MH079301,"['Data Collection ', ' mental health education ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Low income ', ' Emotions ', ' Environment ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Feeling hopeless ', ' hopelessness ', ' No hope for the future ', ' Negative about the future ', ' Loss of hope for the future ', ' Feels there is no future ', ' Cannot see a future ', ' Education and Outreach ', ' Tutoring and Outreach ', ' Training and Outreach ', ' Instruction and Outreach ', ' Scheme ', ' Teenagers ', ' teen years ', ' Teen ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Family ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Future ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' Age ', ' base ', ' concept ', ' Goals ', ' improved ', ' Health ', ' Health Surveys ', ' minority health ', ' Family Study ', ' Adolescent ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Ensure ', ' Interview ', ' Evaluation ', ' Stimulus ', ' Premature Mortality ', ' Databases ', ' data repository ', ' clinical data repository ', ' Electronic Database ', ' Electronic Databank ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Funding ', ' male ', ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health Services ', ' Mental Hygiene Services ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' New York City ', ' Parents ', ' Perception ', ' Poverty ', ' Pregnancy in Adolescence ', ' Underage Pregnancy ', ' Teenage Pregnancy ', ' Teen Pregnancy ', ' Pregnancy in Minors ', ' Adolescent Pregnancy ', ' Research ', ' Risk-Taking ', ' Schools ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Suicide ', ' suicidality ', ' intent to die ', ' fatal suicide ', ' fatal attempt ', ' Suicide attempt ', ' suicidal attempt ', ' non fatal attempt ', ' Thinking, function ', ' thoughts ', ' Thinking ', ' Attention ', ' Violence ', ' violent behavior ', ' violent ', ' Attitude ', ' Work ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' System ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' Behavior ', ' Mental disorders ', ' psychological disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Belief ', ' inner city ', ' Services ', ' experience ', ' self help ', ' success ', ' Structure ', ' expectation ', ' Participant ', ' Prevention program ', ' member ', ' help-seeking behavior ', ' help seeking ', ' Categories ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' AIDS/HIV problem ', ' HIV/AIDS problem ', ' HIV/AIDS ', ' AIDS/HIV ', ' Substance abuse problem ', ' substance abuse ', ' abuse of substances ', ' Gender ', ' Generations ', ' psychological distress ', ' Emotional ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' depressive symptoms ', ' depressive ', ' depression symptom ', ' Emotional Depression ', ' Latino ', ' Modeling ', ' Adolescent Development ', ' response ', ' Youth ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Accounting ', ' Communities ', ' health economics ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' improved functioning ', ' Population ', ' ']",NIMH,"EDUCATION DEVELOPMENT CENTER, INC.",R21,2008,124155,0.07478671863483359

"National Survey of American Life    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Good mental health is vital for the economic and social well-being of the nation. Mental disorders are highly disabling conditions; psychiatric illness ranks second only to cardiovascular disease in its effects on disability. Despite the prevalence of some psychiatric disorders generally, we do not have a clear understanding of the prevalence and nature of treatment of psychiatric disorders for the American black population. Further the underutilization of outpatient mental health services has been well documented for ethnic minority groups. The correlates of service use and patterns of help-seeking, however, as well as risk and resiliency factors both within and across racial/ethnic groups have been identified as critical areas for future research. The National Survey of American Life (NSAL) is a comprehensive and detailed study of mental disorders and mental health of American adults and adolescents of African and Caribbean black descent. Over the past two years of the current NIMH grant, more than 70 authors from approximately a dozen national and international institutions have worked extensively on NSAL analyses and papers. This competing continuation application requests funds to extend the NSAL for four years to: 1) complete manuscripts that are currently in process; 2) respond to new lines of research raised by prior and ongoing analyses, and to conduct new analyses regarding the nature, extent, and reasons for racial and ethnic disparities in the prevalence rates of mental disorders and treatment for symptoms of psychopathology. These issues will be addressed across race and ethnic groups using the NSAL, the National Latino and Asian American Study (NLAAS); and 3) maintain and implement new training programs for scholars and students interested in using NSAL data. There are four specific aims: 1) Examine mental disorder and mental health among diverse racial/ethnic populations; 2) Investigate correlates of help-seeking behavior and services use among ethnically diverse populations; 3) Identify risk and resilience/stress and stress buffering processes that may differentially influence the psychopathology and well-being of ethnically diverse populations; and, 4) Maintain an efficient and effective training program over the four years that will meet the needs of users of NSAL, including data analysts, data managers, research assistants, and research investigators, both at Michigan and among our wide-spread group of collaborators.           ",National Survey of American Life,7416605,U01MH057716,"['Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Demographic Factors ', ' Provider ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Discrimination (Psychology) ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Institution ', ' Economics ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Caring ', ' Social Network ', ' stress management ', ' stress buffering ', ' Aging-Related Process ', ' Aging Process ', ' Data ', ' International ', ' Request for Applications ', ' NIH RFA ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Update ', ' Rate ', ' Process ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Future ', ' Affect ', ' racial/ethnic difference ', ' Grant ', ' Hand ', ' Health ', ' Area ', ' Acute ', ' Chronic ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' psychologic ', ' psychological ', ' Adolescent ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Link ', ' In-Migration ', ' Immigrations ', ' Training ', ' DSM-IV ', ' Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-IV ', ' Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th edition ', ' DSM4 ', ' Psyche structure ', ' mental ', ' disability ', ' Individual ', ' Funding ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Maintenance ', ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health Services ', ' Mental Hygiene Services ', ' Michigan ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' National Institute of Mental Health (U.S.) ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' NIMH ', ' Collaborations ', ' Online Systems ', ' web based ', ' online computer ', ' On-Line Systems ', ' Outpatients ', ' Out-patients ', ' Paper ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' well-being ', ' Primary Care Physician ', ' Psychopathology ', ' abnormal psychology ', ' Psychosocial Factor ', ' psychosocial variables ', ' Publications ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Condition ', ' Nature ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Social support ', ' social support network ', ' Life ', ' medical specialties ', ' Specialty ', ' Stress ', ' Students ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Asian Americans ', ' Training Programs ', ' Universities ', ' African Caribbean ', ' black carib ', ' black Caribbean ', ' Work ', ' Severities ', ' Event ', ' Source ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' Behavior ', ' Mental disorders ', ' psychological disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' interest ', ' Services ', ' American ', ' stressor ', ' Manuscripts ', ' Religion and Spirituality ', ' religious ', ' help-seeking behavior ', ' help seeking ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' social ', ' Asians ', ' oriental ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Latino ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' diverse populations ', ' Sampling ', ' Acculturation ', ' Cultural Assimilation ', ' Comorbidity ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Social Well-Being ', ' resilience ', ' stress resilience ', ' coping ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' Impairment ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' racial/ethnic ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,U01,2008,435180,0.027212763566355345
"New Mexico Mental Health Mentorship/Education Program    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The New Mexico Mentorship and Education Program (MEP) focuses on minority mental health issues in primary care settings, especially disparities in mental health outcomes. An intensive, one-week annual training institute introduces mental health services research to minority junior faculty members and graduate students from Southwest institutions. The MEP also enhances ongoing mentorship relationships with outstanding mental health researchers. The NIMH National Advisory Mental Health Council has designated the MEP as a high program priority. By this competitive continuation application, we will strengthen the successful program by expanding it in two important ways: a) By recruiting minority primary care practitioners (PCPs) based at community health centers, the MEP will address the importance of ""translational"" research to bridge the nationally recognized gap between research and real-life practice settings, b) A new component will lead to recruitment of minority researchers and mentors who focus on geriatric mental health services in minority populations.      The MEP's specific aims are as follows: 1) Due to the difficulties that minority junior faculty members, graduate students, and practitioners have experienced in obtaining suitable training that helps them compete for research support, we will teach trainees basic research methods in this field, with an emphasis on how to write proposals and manage funded proposals. 2) To enhance the translation of research into real life practice settings, we will introduce university-based and community-based trainees to important recent findings of mental health services research, with special emphasis on research concerning the disparities in mental health outcomes that affect minority populations of the Southwest. 3) Because of the isolation and marginalization experienced by young minority researchers, we will establish networks among these trainees and nationally prominent research mentors. 4) Recognizing the challenges that minority graduate students, faculty members, and practitioners face in obtaining and retaining work positions that foster research activities, we will help trainees with various aspects of ""career development."" 5) Due to the difficulties of organizing training programs in the many locations where junior minority researchers live and work, we will produce a minority-oriented mental health services research curriculum that is exportable to other educational institutions and primary care practice sites. 6) To facilitate continuity of training and mentoring as junior investigators try to advance in their careers, we will initiate an ongoing sequence of training sessions in mental health services research on an annual basis. 7) Because of the sparse research conducted about the mental health problems of minority elders, we will initiate a new emphasis on mental health services research focusing on the older, minority populations of the Southwest.               ",New Mexico Mental Health Mentorship/Education Program,7494121,R25MH060288,"['Site ', ' Area ', ' Specific qualifier

"Bronx Youth Partnership on Mental Health Disparities    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): For the past two years, AECOM's Preventive Intervention Research Center has been the lead agency for a Bronx community coalition, led by adolescents, ""Albert's Leaders of Tomorrow"" (A.L.O.T.). It used CPBR to identify mental health disparities as the most important to address among minority inner-city adolescents, and with a Coalition of 48 community agencies, it developed BxThunder, a mental health intervention. We plan to conduct a randomized controlled trial of BxThunder in 3 community agencies: Mosholu-Montefiore Community Center, Wildcat Academy, and Citizen's Advice Bureau. BxThunder has three parts: PART I. TEEN is an award-winning positive youth development program that improves mental health and trains teens to be peer educators; PART II. graduates will join ""ALOTMore"" and implement a multimedia workshop in Bronx agencies to teach about mental health and reduce stigma; PART III. teens in BxThunder who need mental health services will receive them on site from clinical psychologists and externs from three community partners, Lehman College CUNY, Wurzweiler School of Social Work, and Ferkauf Graduate School of Psychology. We will conduct an intent-to-treat randomized controlled trial of BxThunder. We will recruit 240 teens at each site (n=720 total), and randomize them to receive BxThunder or standard care. Teens will be interviewed at baseline and 6- and 12-months later. Outcome measures are positive mental health (Resiliency Scales for Adolescents, RSCA; The Self-Perception Profile for Adolescents, SPPA) and psychological symptoms (Youth Self Report, YSR). Among symptomatic teens, we will assess the number of identified youth who received a referral for services; the number of those who implemented the referral; the number who are in or have completed services; and their mental health outcomes (symptoms) after treatment. The Specific Aims are to test the hypotheses that compared to control teens:   (1) teens in BxThunder will experience fewer mental health symptoms;   (2) teens in BxThunder will experience a greater increase in positive mental health;   (3) teens with psychological problems in BxThunder are more likely to have a successful referral for care, and are more likely to complete treatment;   (4) teens in BxThunder with psychological problems will experience a larger reduction in psychological symptoms;   (5) the BxCAM workshop will increase knowledge and decrease stigma among those who attend, as measured by change in pre-test and post-test measures of workshop attendees.   A sustainability project will be designed and implemented by Affinity Health Plan in conjunction with the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene.           ",Bronx Youth Partnership on Mental Health Disparities,7494212,R24MD001784,"['Counseling ', ' Educational Curriculum ', ' Curriculum ',

"Addressing Mental Health Services Disparities for Ethnically Diverse Children    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   The proposed study is in response to a Program Announcement entitled, Elimination of Health Disparities through Translation Research (R18). The purpose of the study is to adapt evidence-based interventions for use in urban schools with large numbers of low-income Latino students. The interventions will be delivered within a family-centered system for the delivery of mental health services for children that has the potential to be self- sustaining over time. The interventions, which are based on SW-PBS methodology, would address a range of behavioral disorders and concomitant peer difficulties experienced by children at school and at home. The study will take place in two public schools (K through 5th and K through 8th) in an urban area with high concentrations of low-income Latino families. Data will be collected simultaneously on three ongoing aspects of the project: (a) Development of a data collection system; (b) Improvement of key school systems; (c) Protocol modification and implementation. The proposed study is designed to reach all children attending the participating schools. Aims of the study are: (1) To develop a data collection system for SW-PBS that is useful, efficient, and acceptable; (2) To build the capacity of the school system to support the implementation of SW-PBS; (3) To identify components of SW-PBS primary and secondary tier interventions that need adaptation; (4) To determine the feasibility of implementing SW-PBS interventions in two under-resourced schools; (5) To assess acceptability of Tier 1 and Tier 2 interventions (uptake); and (6) To estimate the health outcome associated with the implementation of the SW-PBS package. Evidence-based intervention packages will be identified and modified based on focus groups, follow-up interviews and brief surveys with 93 parents and 60 teachers. Tier 1 interventions will be implemented first on 1,027 students. Children who do not respond to Tier 1 interventions will be assigned to one or more interventions for Tier 2 or they will be assessed and referred for treatment in the community. It is expected that 154 children will receive Tier 2 interventions in the school and that 63 parents of children in Tier 2 will receive parental skills training at a community center. The proposed study is the result of a partnership between researchers, experts in school-wide positive behavior support (SW-PBS), teaching staff, school administrators, parents/caregivers and community mental health workers. The study addresses a specific goal of Healthy People 2010--reducing or eliminating mental health services disparities among ethnically diverse children. The study may contribute to the development of an efficient and effective system for the delivery of mental health services to low-income, inner-city children and families. Data obtained for this study may contribute to a better understanding of factors that facilitate the adaptation and implementation of evidence-based interventions in under-resourced urban schools. The adapted evidence-based interventions described in this proposal are likely to contribute to a reduction in mental health services disparities among urban ethnically-diverse children. The proposal may also increase research interest in the effectiveness of school-wide positive behavior support (SW-PBS) interventions in under-resourced urban schools.     The adapted evidence-based interventions described in this proposal are likely to contribute to a reduction in mental health services disparities among urban ethnically-diverse children.

"Social Inequality and Children's Mental Health    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The social gradient in children's mental health is well documented. What is less clear is how social inequalities influence children's development. We propose to examine this question at three levels of analysis. At the neighborhood level, we will assess ecometric properties of the local areas in which children reside and test whether neighborhood-level social processes, such as collective efficacy, mediate the effects of neighborhood poverty on children's mental health. At the family level, we will trace the effects of socioeconomic deprivation on proximal family processes (exposure to violence, food insecurity) and test how stressful early life events may become biologically embedded. At the individual level, we will use a genetically-informative longitudinal design to test the hypothesis that children's perceptions of their social position can help to explain why some children growing up in poverty do versus do not develop health problems. METHOD: We will conduct this research using data from the Environmental Risk (E-Risk) Study. E-Risk is a longitudinal study (from birth to age 12) of a nationally-representative sample of twins born in England and Wales in 1994-1995 (N=2232), selected from a registry created with the UK Office of National Statistics (ONS). We have tracked the children over the first 12 years of their lives, monitoring their development and their environmental exposures, including multiple forms of social inequality. We have gathered data about the children and their families at 6 time points (birth, ages 2, 5, 7, 10, and 12 years). We have also conducted two independent ecometric assessments of the neighborhoods in which the children are growing up, enabling us to study inequalities in children's lives at both the community and family level. INNOVATION AND SIGNIFICANCE: The proposed research has implications both for understanding and reducing health inequalities. At each level of analysis, we adopt a process approach to test how social inequalities influence children's development. At the neighborhood level, we will identify malleable factors for community-level interventions which may be more cost effective and pragmatic than individual-level interventions. At the family level, we will test the direct and indirect contributions of family socio-economic conditions to children's development and identify specific intervention targets for reducing social inequalities in children's mental health. At the individual level, if we discover environmentally-mediated effects between children's subjective social status and their health, the implications would point to children's perceptions of social status as malleable intervention targets and open up a realm of intervention possibilities for empowering children. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: About half of the population variation in children's mental health problems is accounted for by environmental factors, and social inequalities stand out as the most prominent determinants of health in the first decade of life. However, the hope of preventing early- emerging mental health problems requires research to identify the underlying mechanisms by which inequalities affect health. Our proposed research tests how social inequalities affect children's health, aiming to identify malleable intervention targets at the community, family, and individual levels.           Narrative About half of the population variation in children's mental health problems is accounted for by environmental factors, and social inequalities stand out as the most prominent determinants of health in the first decade of life.

"Prevention of marital distress in low-income couples transitioning to parenthood    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Recent research has shown that the quality of marital relationships is inextricably linked to physical and mental health of the individuals in the relationship. Included in the wide-ranging negative health outcomes associated with marital distress, individuals in distressed marriages are at greater risk for mortality relative to spouses in non-distressed marriages (Robles & Kiecolt-Glaser, 2003). The impacts of marital distress do not end with the spouses in the marriage; children of distressed couples who are exposed to characteristically high levels of conflict suffer negative mental and physical health consequences, such as externalizing and internalizing problems, depression, anxiety, and physical problems (El-Sheikh, Hargar, & Whitson, 2001). Recent government initiatives take into account the importance of the marital relationship on children; the Healthy Marriage Initiative (2005) defined a healthy marriage as ""a mutually satisfying relationship that is beneficial to the husband, wife, and children."" The proposed prevention study seeks to intervene with couples during the transition to parenthood, a major life transition when marital satisfaction typically declines (Gottman & Notarius, 2002). A number of programs have been developed to prevent relationship and individual distress, but thus far no studies have examined effects of such programs in low-income couples. Given that low-income couples are at greater risk for a host of intra- and interpersonal problems, and often have unique circumstances and stressors that are not addressed in existing prevention programs (Karney & Bradbury, 2005), this proposal is timely. This study will examine the immediate and longitudinal effectiveness of a brief, cost-effective, preventive intervention designed for low-income couples during the transition to parenthood. Comparing Integrative Behavioral Couple Therapy (Jacobson & Christensen, 1998), an empirically supported treatment for couples, to treatment as usual in obstetrics clinics at a county hospital, this research will examine effects of the intervention on birth and infant health outcomes, as well as individual and relationship distress of the parents in a small sample of couples (N = 40 couples total). This study has important implications for public health. Given policy-makers' aims to support low-income couples in maintaining healthy marriages, it is imperative that interventions be implemented and researched in low-income communities. This study has the potential to inform future interventions and policies that affect low-income couples in particular, thereby improving the health and well-being of both partners and their families. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: My research, coursework, and clinical experiences in psychology have helped me to determine my long-term goal of teaching and conducting clinical research in academia. My training goals for this fellowship are outlined below: 1) My first goal is to gain additional knowledge about cultural factors and mental health in low-income Latino families. I will audit a course in the School of Medicine, ""Hispanic Mental Health Issues and Treatment"" (Psychiatry M231, Prof. Morales), that will increase my knowledge of factors that are particularly important in clinical work with Spanish-speaking couples. Another course I will audit to gain knowledge about mental health disparities is ""Health and Mental Health Disparities from a Psychosocial and Cultural Perspective"" (Psychiatry 264, Prof. Williams). These two courses will give me a better understanding of the population I will work with at Harbor-UCLA and specific contextual factors to focus on in the intervention groups. Furthermore, weekly meetings with Dr. Reina-Patton will help me to apply the knowledge to the population in the intervention at Harbor.             ",Prevention of marital distress in low-income couples transitioning to parenthood,7755135,F31HD062168,"['Couples ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Effectiveness ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Low income ', ' Address ', ' Academia ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' follow-up ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' Behavioral ', ' Family ', ' Fellowship ', ' Spouses ', ' Married Persons ', ' Future ', ' Affect ', ' Gestational Age ', ' Fetal Age ', ' Chronologic Fetal Maturity ', ' base ', ' Goals ', ' Government ', ' improved ', ' Health ', ' County Hospitals ', ' Clinical ', ' psychologic ', ' psychological ', ' Infant Health ', ' Link ', ' Infant ', ' Newborn Infant ', ' newborn human (0-6 weeks) ', ' Newborns ', ' 0-6 weeks old ', ' Training ', ' Psyche structure ', ' mental ', ' Distress ', ' Individual ', ' Low Income Population ', ' Policy Maker ', ' satisfaction ', ' Policies ', ' Husband ', ' Wife ', ' Marital Relationships ', ' Marriage ', ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Mortality ', ' Discipline of obstetrics ', ' Obstetrics ', ' Couples Therapy ', ' Parents ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' well-being ', ' Pregnancy ', ' Gestation ', ' Psychiatry ', ' Psychology ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' Anxiety ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' medical schools ', ' school of medicine ', ' medical college ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Stress ', ' Educational process of instructing ', ' Teaching ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Clinic ', ' physical conditioning ', ' physical health ', ' psychosocial ', ' contextual factors ', ' Application Context ', ' meetings ', ' Birth Weight ', ' Birth ', ' Parturition ', ' experience ', ' stressor ', ' Participant ', ' Prevention program ', ' Prevention ', ' Reporting ', ' Measures ', ' Relative (related person) ', ' Relative ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child health care ', ' Child Health ', ' depressive symptoms ', ' depressive ', ' depression symptom ', ' Emotional Depression ', ' Hispanics ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Latino ', ' Sampling ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Accounting ', ' Communities ', ' cost ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' therapy design ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' public health relevance ', ' group intervention ', ' treatment as usual ', ' usual care ', ' depression ', ' intervention effect ', ' Conflict (Psychology) ', ' Conflict ', ' ']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,F31,2009,30979,0.07062628353791188
"Telemental Health to Improve Mental Health Care and Outcomes for Children in Unde    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The need for new models for delivering mental heath services within primary care (PC) has been recognized for two decades, yet federal funding to address this need has been lacking. Telemental health (TMH) programs are being implemented nationally to address inequities in access to mental health services, but little scientific evidence is available regarding their efficacy, particularly with children. The goal of the proposed research is to test the efficacy of a TMH service delivery model for improving care and outcomes for children with a prevalent psychiatric condition who are treated by primary care physicians (PCPs) in 5 underserved communities in the Pacific Northwest. The research proposed is a randomized controlled trial of PCP care augmented by TMH-delivered evidence- based treatment of children (N=250) 7-11 years old diagnosed with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) versus treatment as usual by the PCP. Hispanic children will comprise 30% of the study sample. The experimental condition will consist of 6 pharmacotherapy sessions delivered by child psychiatrists through videoconferencing in conjunction with the referring PCP who will prescribe medications and 6 sessions of parent behavioral training delivered in-person by a community therapist supervised by a telepsychologist. The control condition will consist of treatment as usual with the PCP augmented by a single telepsychiatric consultation, which is current standard care in the participating communities. For children in both experimental and control conditions, hyperactivity, inattentiveness, oppositionality/defiance, and functional impairment, as well as parental stress, burden, and empowerment will be assessed 5 times from baseline to 25-week follow- up. In the experimental group, adherence to treatment protocols will be carefully monitored for families, telepsychiatrists, local community therapists, and PCPs. If under the experimental delivery model, improvements in clinical outcomes are demonstrated, and if an evidence-based treatment protocol can be implemented with fidelity, then TMH health service delivery models could be deployed with confidence to help rectify the severe geographic maldistribution of pediatric mental health services and to build new models of collaborative care within PC. This telemental health (TMH) investigation holds promise for improving the nation's public health and welfare in three ways. First, TMH offers children and families suffering with emotional and behavioral disorders help that cannot be found locally by redistributing specialty mental health care from urban centers to underserved communities. Second, TMH offers secondary and tertiary prevention by reaching children's in need prior to the full evolution of mental illness and its associated impairments. Third, TMH offers primary care physicians, teachers, and other professionals' assistance in their efforts to care for our nation's children.          ",Telemental Health to Improve Mental Health Care and Outcomes for Children in Unde,7680081,R01MH081997,"['Data Collection ', ' Decision Making ', ' health care delivery ', ' health services delivery ', ' Healthcare Delivery ', ' Health Sciences, Allied and Health Services Delivery ', ' Healthy People 2010 ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ', ' attention deficit hyperactive disorder ', ' Predominantly Hyperactive-Impulsive Type Hyperactivity Disorder ', ' Predominantly Hyperactive-Impulsive Type Attention-Deficit Disorder ', ' Hyperkinetic Syndrome ', ' Hyperactivity Disorder NOS ', ' ADHD ', ' AD/HD ', ' Pharmacotherapy ', ' Drug Therapy ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' telehealth ', ' Address ', ' Videoconferencing ', ' Videoconferences ', ' Child Mental Health ', ' Symptoms ', ' Caring ', ' Family Physicians ', ' Adherence (attribute) ', ' Adherence ', ' High Prevalence ', ' Improve Access ', ' Monitor ', ' Evolution ', ' Process ', ' follow-up ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' Behavioral ', ' Family ', ' Guidelines ', ' Foundations ', ' Freedom ', ' Liberty ', ' Future ', ' Affect ', ' Evidence based treatment ', ' Geographic Locations ', ' geographic site ', ' MeSH Descriptors Class 4 ', ' Geographical Location ', ' Geographic Region ', ' Geographic Area ', ' Geography ', ' base ', ' rural area ', ' urban area ', ' Goals ', ' improved ', ' Health ', ' Health Resources ', ' Health Services ', ' health care service ', ' Psychiatric therapeutic procedure ', ' psychiatric treatment ', ' psychiatric therapy ', ' psychiatric care ', ' Site ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Adolescent ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Randomized Clinical Trials ', ' Institute of Medicine (U.S.) ', ' NAS/IOM ', ' Institute of Medicine ', ' Ensure ', ' Equipment and supply inventories ', ' Inventory ', ' Evaluation ', ' Screening procedure ', ' screenings ', ' screening ', ' Training ', ' teacher ', ' Psyche structure ', ' mental ', ' Childhood ', ' pediatric ', ' pediatrician ', ' Longevity ', ' lifespan ', ' life span ', ' Length of Life ', ' Rural ', ' satisfaction ', ' Funding ', ' Americas ', ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health Services ', ' Mental Hygiene Services ', ' Morbidity -

"National Survey of American Life    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Good mental health is vital for the economic and social well-being of the nation. Mental disorders are highly disabling conditions; psychiatric illness ranks second only to cardiovascular disease in its effects on disability. Despite the prevalence of some psychiatric disorders generally, we do not have a clear understanding of the prevalence and nature of treatment of psychiatric disorders for the American black population. Further the underutilization of outpatient mental health services has been well documented for ethnic minority groups. The correlates of service use and patterns of help-seeking, however, as well as risk and resiliency factors both within and across racial/ethnic groups have been identified as critical areas for future research. The National Survey of American Life (NSAL) is a comprehensive and detailed study of mental disorders and mental health of American adults and adolescents of African and Caribbean black descent. Over the past two years of the current NIMH grant, more than 70 authors from approximately a dozen national and international institutions have worked extensively on NSAL analyses and papers. This competing continuation application requests funds to extend the NSAL for four years to: 1) complete manuscripts that are currently in process; 2) respond to new lines of research raised by prior and ongoing analyses, and to conduct new analyses regarding the nature, extent, and reasons for racial and ethnic disparities in the prevalence rates of mental disorders and treatment for symptoms of psychopathology. These issues will be addressed across race and ethnic groups using the NSAL, the National Latino and Asian American Study (NLAAS); and 3) maintain and implement new training programs for scholars and students interested in using NSAL data. There are four specific aims: 1) Examine mental disorder and mental health among diverse racial/ethnic populations; 2) Investigate correlates of help-seeking behavior and services use among ethnically diverse populations; 3) Identify risk and resilience/stress and stress buffering processes that may differentially influence the psychopathology and well-being of ethnically diverse populations; and, 4) Maintain an efficient and effective training program over the four years that will meet the needs of users of NSAL, including data analysts, data managers, research assistants, and research investigators, both at Michigan and among our wide-spread group of collaborators.           ",National Survey of American Life,7627239,U01MH057716,"['Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Demographic Factors ', ' Provider ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Discrimination (Psychology) ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Institution ', ' Economics ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Social Network ', ' stress management ', ' stress buffering ', ' Aging-Related Process ', ' Aging Process ', ' Data ', ' International ', ' Request for Applications ', ' NIH RFA ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Update ', ' Process ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Future ', ' Affect ', ' racial/ethnic difference ', ' Grant ', ' Hand ', ' Area ', ' Acute ', ' Chronic ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' psychologic ', ' psychological ', ' Adolescent ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Link ', ' In-Migration ', ' Immigrations ', ' Training ', ' DSM-IV ', ' Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-IV ', ' Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th edition ', ' DSM4 ', ' Psyche structure ', ' mental ', ' disability ', ' web site ', ' website ', ' Individual ', ' Funding ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Maintenance ', ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health Services ', ' Mental Hygiene Services ', ' Michigan ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' National Institute of Mental Health (U.S.) ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' NIMH ', ' Collaborations ', ' Online Systems ', ' web based ', ' online computer ', ' On-Line Systems ', ' Outpatients ', ' Out-patients ', ' Paper ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' well-being ', ' Primary Care Physician ', ' Psychopathology ', ' abnormal psychology ', ' Psychosocial Factor ', ' psychosocial variables ', ' Publications ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Nature ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Social support ', ' social support network ', ' Life ', ' medical specialties ', ' Specialty ', ' Stress ', ' Students ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Asian Americans ', ' Training Programs ', ' Universities ', ' African Caribbean ', ' black carib ', ' black Caribbean ', ' Work ', ' Severities ', ' Event ', ' Source ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' Behavior ', ' Mental disorders ', ' psychological disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' physical conditioning ', ' physical health ', ' interest ', ' meetings ', ' Services ', ' American ', ' stressor ', ' Manuscripts ', ' Religion and Spirituality ', ' religious ', ' help-seeking behavior ', ' help seeking ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' social ', ' Asians ', ' oriental ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Latino ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' diverse populations ', ' Sampling ', ' Acculturation ', ' Cultural Assimilation ', ' Comorbidity ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Social Well-Being ', ' resilience ', ' stress resilience ', ' coping ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' Impairment ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' racial/ethnic ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,U01,2009,555220,0.027212763566355345
"Adaptation of post-disaster mental health training for black communities    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Adaptation and adoption of evidence based mental health strategies has been challenging for those working with subpopulations disproportionately affected by the aftermath of natural disasters and may contribute to the growing racial disparities seen in access to mental health services, diagnosis, and treatment of mental health conditions. Outside assistance teams have faced overwhelming demands for tools that take into account the cultural and ethnic context of mental health conditions and facilitate expedient and cost effective measure to mitigate the mental health effects of disasters. Our proposed post disaster mental health intervention training tool will assist in addressing these challenges and holds promise for delivering effective interventions to those in need of support because it will be developed through an iterative collaborative approach with health providers and black community leaders working in areas in the Southeastern and Gulf states that have experienced the greatest impact of recent hurricanes. We first will conduct thorough needs assessment in coastal and eastern North Carolina and continue to incorporate materials that respond to audience learning needs through implementation testing of materials developed by Dr. Stan Kutcher. This model is based on World Health Organization and NIMH recommended post disaster mental health practices. The novel training program will also include capacity and social capital building techniques and expansion through a train the trainer component. The results of this formative research will be woven into a novel disaster intervention training program that can be successively tailored to other minority groups in high risk areas. The prototype training package will consists of 1) a core knowledge/care competencies manual; 2) clinical provider and community leader trainee toolkits (with testable cooperative learning exercises for 1 completed core competency, a list of resources for practical mental health referral and treatment approaches, and training evaluation pre and post tests, a sample CD rom to test the acceptance of future distance learning using web based format for training components); and 3) a trainer facilitation manual with slide sets and testable instructions for implementing a train the trainer program. We will elaborate a plan for conducting a multi site field evaluation trial. In Phase II we will further develop the training components, including distance learning CD rom and web based instruction based on the Phase I proof of concept evidence. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The disaster mental health training tool that we propose to develop will promote an appropriate and cost effective response to the need to prepare health providers and black community leaders for addressing the adverse mental health consequences to disasters. Through the iterative adaptation of teaching materials to the cultural context of communities of color, we will have a useful tool to address cultural barriers that challenge outsiders in providing mental health services. Expansion to other formats for distance learning of different training components and tailoring for other vulnerable communities will allow local first responders to gain the sustainable skills.                 ",Adaptation of post-disaster mental health training for black communities,7628667,R43MH080520,"['Trainers Training ', ' response ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Accounting ', ' Color ', ' Communities ', ' Computer-Assisted Instruction ', ' web-based instruction ', ' internet-assisted education ', ' Computerized Self-Instruction Programs ', ' Computer-based Education ', ' Instruction ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' cost effective ', ' cost-effective ', ' Population ', ' Community Integration ', ' usability ', ' gulf coast ', ' prototype ', ' health training ', ' high risk ', ' public health relevance ', ' effective intervention ', ' evidence base ', ' Provider ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disasters ', ' Readiness ', ' Preparedness ', ' Low income ', ' Emergency Situation ', ' Emergencies ', ' Address ', ' Caring ', ' Evidence based practice ', ' social capital ', ' Data ', ' Cognitive ', ' Process ', ' Modification ', ' Exercise ', ' Physical Exercise ', ' Feedback ', ' Adoption ', ' Advisory Committees ', ' Task Forces ', ' Focus Groups ', ' emergency service/first responder ', ' first responder ', ' emergency service responder ', ' emergency service personnel ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Future ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' Affect ', ' base ', ' Goals ', ' improved ', ' Health ', ' Health Personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Health Services Needs ', ' Hurricane ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' psychologic ', ' psychological ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Psyche structure ', ' mental ', ' Learning ', ' Recovery ', ' Rural ', ' Educational workshop ', ' Workshop ', ' Manuals ', ' Materials Testing ', ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health Services ', ' Mental Hygiene Services ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' National Institute of Mental Health (U.S.) ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' NIMH ', ' Natural Disasters ', ' Educational Intervention ', ' instructional intervention ', ' Training Intervention ', ' Instruction Intervention ', ' Education for Intervention ', ' North Carolina ', ' Online Systems ', ' web based ', ' online computer ', ' On-Line Systems ', ' Pre-Post Tests ', ' tool ', ' Qualitative Evaluations ', ' instrument ', ' Recommendation ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' recruit ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Stress ', ' Educational process of instructing ', ' Teaching ', ' Teaching Materials ', ' Testing ', ' Training Programs ', ' Work ', ' World Health Organization ', ' Slide ', ' Techniques ', ' Mental disorders ', ' psychological disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Benchmarking ', ' Best Practice Analysis ', ' interest ', ' Needs Assessment ', ' experience ', ' Distance Learning ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' member ', ' Measures ', ' psychological distress ', ' acute stress ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' ']",NIMH,"HERMES, LLC",R43,2009,253462,0.155066486490759
"Mentoring Institute for HIV and Mental Health Related Research of the University     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal aims to: establish a long-term mentoring program that will attract (6) junior faculty and graduate students from the academic programs or professional schools in PR into HIV and Mental Health Research. These are: the University of Puerto Rico (several Campuses and Centers), the Ponce School of Medicine (including the Clinical Psychology program) and the Universidad Central del Caribe School of Medicine; to encourage and facilitate the development of their career plans with the specific goal of HIV and Mental Health Research and the eventual application for NIH funding and to focus the research and educational activities on HIV and Health Disparities related to Mental Health as the overarching theme of the Institute. The need for collaborative research justifies targeting the development and diversification of the Mental Health and Drug Abuse HIV/AIDS research workforce as is the title of this PAR. The focus of this Institute will be in precisely the establishment of multi-institutional, multi-disciplinary and inter-disciplinary teams and collaborations. There is a need to create a culture of collaboration and this mentorship institute through its PI and key personnel will make sure that the process is ongoing.      The Institute's research-education mentoring program is based on a competency development model. Mentors are expected to offer their scholarly, analytic and unique expertise in order to enable, empower, and inspire the participants in the acquisition of the core and cross-cutting competencies. Six core areas of competencies have been identified as essential to pursue a systematic and integrated approach to research. These are conceptualization, research design, implementation, analysis, dissemination, and expansion. All the participants, independently of the stage of their research development, need to be exposed continuously to cross-cutting knowledge and skills. They should acquire new knowledge related to HIV, mental health, and health disparities.

"COPE/Healthy Lifestyles for Teens: A School-Based RCT    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):        The prevention and treatment of obesity and mental health disorders in adolescence are two major public health problems in the United States (U.S.) today. The incidence of adolescents who are overweight or obese has increased dramatically over the past 20 years, with approximately 17.1 percent of teens now being overweight or obese. Furthermore, approximately 15 million children and adolescents (25 percent) in the U.S. have a mental health problem that is interfering with their functioning at home or at school, but less than 25 percent of those affected receive any treatment for these disorders. The prevalence rates of obesity and mental health problems are even higher in Hispanic teens, with studies suggesting that the two conditions often coexist in many youth. However, despite the rapidly increasing incidence of these two public health problems with their related health disparities and adverse health outcomes, there has been a paucity of theory- based intervention studies conducted with adolescents in high schools to improve their healthy lifestyle behaviors as well as their physical and mental health outcomes. Unfortunately, physical and mental health services continue to be largely separated instead of integrated in the nation's healthcare system, which often leads to inadequate identification and treatment of these significant adolescent health problems.  Therefore, the goal of the proposed randomized controlled trial is to test the efficacy of the COPE (Creating Opportunities for Personal Empowerment)/Healthy Lifestyles TEEN (Thinking, Feeling, Emotions & Exercise) Program, an educational and cognitive-behavioral skills building intervention guided by cognitive behavior theory, on the healthy lifestyle behaviors and depressive symptoms of 800 culturally diverse adolescents enrolled in Phoenix, Arizona high schools. The specific aims of the study are to: (1) Use a randomized controlled trial to test the short- and more long-term efficacy of the COPE TEEN Program on key outcomes, including healthy lifestyles behaviors, depressive symptoms and body mass index percentage, (2) Examine the role of cognitive beliefs and perceived difficulty in leading a healthy lifestyle in mediating the effects of COPE on healthy lifestyle behaviors and depressive symptoms; and (3) Explore variables that may moderate the effects of the intervention on healthy lifestyle behaviors and depressive symptoms, including race/ethnicity, gender, SES, acculturation, and parental healthy lifestyle beliefs and behaviors. Six prior pilot studies support the need for this full scale clinical trial and the use of cognitive-behavioral skills building in promoting healthy lifestyles beliefs, behaviors and optimal mental health in teens.  This study is consistent with the NIH roadmap and goals of improving people's health and preventing the onset of disease and disability as well as promoting the highest level of health in a vulnerable population.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:       The prevention and treatment of obesity and mental health disorders in adolescence are two major public health problems in the United States today. To address the increasing incidence and adverse health outcomes associated with both obesity and mental health problems, a theory-based 15 session intervention program entitled COPE (Creating Opportunities for Personal Empowerment)/Healthy Lifestyles TEEN (Thinking, Feeling, Emotions & Exercise), will be delivered within high school health classes in order to improve the physical and mental health outcomes of 800 culturally diverse adolescents (14 to 16 years of age).              PROJECT NARRATIVE  The prevention and treatment of obesity and mental health disorders in adolescence are two major public health problems in the United States today.

"Idaho Partnership for Hispanic Mental Health    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The primary goal of the Idaho Partnership for Hispanic Mental Health phase one planning project is to reduce disparities in mental health treatment among Hispanics in southwest Idaho, who are primarily an immigrant population of Mexican origin. The project's first step will be to conduct a community assessment which will: 1) further knowledge about Hispanics' perceptions and beliefs about mental illness, and behaviors and preferences regarding mental health treatment, and 2) assess southwest Idaho's mental health provider organizations' knowledge, attitudes, and practices regarding their services to Hispanic individuals, and gaps in service access and provision for Hispanics. As barriers to Hispanics access and use of mental health services are already well-documented, the purpose of this community assessment will be to inform the improvement of mental health service delivery. The project will use a community-based participatory research approach. Project partners include Mountain States Group, the University of Washington, Centro de Comunidad y Justicia, Dr. Al Sanchez (Hispanic mental health consultant), and an existing Hispanic Health Community Advisory Board. Strong equitable partnerships between the research organizations and the Hispanic community have already been established. All have participated in formulating the proposal's research design, which includes semi-structured interviews with 240 adult Hispanics residing in southwest Idaho, and open-ended interviews with 35 southwest Idaho mental health services providers. The project's data findings, supplemented by secondary data research, will be used to prioritize infrastructure development and capacity building actions to respond to Hispanics' mental health service needs. The research and community partners will form two specific action plans, one for implementing community-based and culturally appropriate mental health services interventions, and a second for conducting mental health service provider training to improve their understanding, skills, policies, and practices in working with the Hispanic community. Phase one activities will lead to the submission of a full research proposal to implement the recommendations.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  To work effectively, health care providers need to understand the differences in how various populations in the United States perceive mental health and mental illness and treatment services (Healthy People 2010). The Idaho Partnership for Hispanic Mental Health will contribute to the understanding of Hispanics' perceptions and beliefs about mental illness and mental health treatment. Findings will be used to improve the cultural relevance, responsiveness, and accessibility of community-based mental health services for southwest Idaho Hispanics.              PUBLIC HEALTH IMPORTANCE To work effectively, health care providers need to understand the differences in how various populations in the United States perceive mental health and mental illness and treatment services (Healthy People 2010).

"The Collaborative Center for Trauma and Mental Health Disparities    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  We propose to establish a five-year, multi-ethnic and multi-disciplinary ""Collaborative Center for Trauma and Mental Health"" (CCTMHD) to promote interdisciplinary research examining the prevalence and impact of traumatic experiences on PTSD, depression and concomitant cognitive/emotional, behavioral, psychological and biological processes in ethnic minority populations. The overarching aim is to inform new strategies to reduce mental health disparities associated with trauma exposure. Multiple sources of acute and chronic stress combine to have a cumulative effect in the lives of ethnic minorities, giving rise to our use of the conceptual framework of allostatic load to (1) describe the socio-cultural context in which violence occurs; (2) examine cultural differences in the appraisal of traumatic events; (3) identify protective and vulnerability factors within ethnic groups; and (4) characterize the expression of mental health symptoms and help-seeking that contribute to mental health disparities. The Center, led by Dr. Gail Wyatt in collaboration with an experienced team of minority mental health researchers includes an Administrative Core, which will coordinate and integrate all Center activities including mentoring of investigators and a Methods & Statistics Core, which will be responsible for providing methodological support to all Center investigators and projects. Project 1 is a 4-year, longitudinal study, ""Intimate Partner Violence and Mental Health Outcomes among Latinas"", led by Dr. M. Rodriguez. He will investigate the longitudinal course of PTSD and depression, attachment and related biological sequelae in an existing cohort of 205 Latina mothers, who vary on intimate partner violence histories. Project 2, ""Disclosure & Appraisal of Child Sexual Abuse (CSA): Relationships with PTSD, Depression, & Associated Biomarkers"" is led by Drs. J. Vargas-Carmona and T. Loeb. This 2-year pilot study focuses on the impact of CSA disclosure and self-blame among 110 Black and Latina women with CSA histories. Project 3, a 2-year pilot study, ""Coping among Ethnic Men Sexually Abused as Children"", is led by Dr. F. Galvan. He will recruit 150 Latino and Black men to examine ethnic differences in coping strategies and their role as possible moderators or mediators of psychological distress, biological effects of childhood sexual trauma and mental health service utilization. This Center will stimulate state-of-the-art research on trauma and mental health disparities, and inform the development of future interventions to close these gaps.        ",The Collaborative Center for Trauma and Mental Health Disparities,7690207,P50MH073453,[''],NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,P50,2009,783107,0.08250169991418697
"Testing an IHCA for Guardians of Survivors of Intraparental Homicide    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): About 4000 children per year are stressed when one of their parents is murdered by the other parent, at least as many as are affected by leukemia per year. At this time, there is no tested intervention available for these children or the families struggling to care for them. Intraparental homicide (IPH) is a particularly devastating trauma and stressor for children. In a single act, children usually lose both parent to either death, prison or both. While there are few studies of this phenomenon, the available data indicate that children experience substantial short- and long-term mental health consequences such as post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Findings from prior research by this team indicate that guardians of these children did not know how to help the children. The guardians experience significant stress and disruption in their families, demanding new coping abilities and new support in order for them to adapt. The investigators are completing a study (R01- NR008532) that describes the experiences of these children. The present study builds on the findings of that study. Exhaustive searches of the scientific and clinical literature have uncovered no interventions directed toward these guardians. The present proposal is to test an interactive health communication application (IHCA) as a way of providing information and support to the guardians of these child survivors of IPH. Use of IHCA has been found to be effective for a variety of other health conditions (Murray, Burns, See Tai, Lai, & Nazareth, 2005) such as women with breast cancer and children with asthma and their parents. The IHCA program to be used here will consist of the following components: an Instant Library of articles on topics of interest to these guardians; a resource directory (descriptions and contact information, including web links) of national and local organizations providing victim services, mental health services, parenting support, legal services, faith-based, drug and alcohol, etc. and other organizations; limited access asynchronous chat, allowing for peer-to-peer support in a safe and anonymous format; `Ask an Expert' with expert responses to user questions; and personal stories, text accounts of how others have experienced caring for children bereaved by IPH. The researchers will first refine the IHCA using focus group interviews with guardians of children bereaved by IPH. They will then randomly assign guardians of children bereaved by IPH to the IHCA intervention vs open computer internet use (63 in each group) to determine if the guardians using the IHCA have greater `parenting' capabilities and less `parenting' stress and if the children experience improved behavior and mental health. These findings will then be used at the termination of this project to design a larger, phase III, randomized clinical trial to test the efficacy of this guardian intervention vs. resources available through open internet usage. Project Narrative About 4000 children each year are bereaved by intraparental homicide (IPH) each year, and there are about 70,000 such stressed children currently in the US. The mental health and behavioral consequences of this stress are substantial. These children are disproportionately African American, making this a source of health disparity as well. This proposal therefore offers an opportunity to address both an understudied topic (NINR, 2007) and a substantial health disparity.          ",Testing an IHCA for Guardians of Survivors of Intraparental Homicide,7642397,R21MH082197,"['Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Legal ', ' Elements ', ' Address ', ' Child Mental Health ', ' Caring ', ' Data ', ' Health Communication ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Text ', ' Behavioral ', ' Family ', ' Killings ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Affect ', ' base ', ' Group Interviews ', ' improved ', ' Health ', ' Homicide ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Randomized Clinical Trials ', ' Survivors ', ' Link ', ' Infant ', ' Interview ', ' leukemia ', ' Blood (Leukemia) ', ' Libraries ', ' Literature ', ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health Services ', ' Mental Hygiene Services ', ' Internet ', ' world wide web ', ' web ', ' WWW ', ' Published Directory ', ' Directory ', ' Parents ', ' Prisons ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Safety ', ' programs ', ' Stress ', ' Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders ', ' traumatic neurosis ', ' Posttraumatic Stress Disorders ', ' Posttraumatic Neuroses ', ' Post-Traumatic Neuroses ', ' PTSD ', ' Sudden infant death syndrome ', ' Sudden Unexpected Infant Death ', ' Sudden Infant Death ', ' SIDS ', ' Crib Death ', ' Cot Death ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Asthma ', ' Bronchial Asthma ', ' United States ', ' Woman ', ' Source ', ' Behavior ', ' interest ', ' Services ', ' experience ', ' stressor ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' Burn injury ', ' Burns ', ' Structure ', ' peer ', ' Measures ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Behavior ', ' Child Care ', ' Puericulture ', ' Parenting behavior ', ' Parenting ', ' accomplished suicide ', ' completed suicide ', ' commit suicide ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Family member ', ' Murder ', ' response ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Directories ', ' Accounting ', ' comparison group ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' alcohol and other drug ', ' traumatized children ', ' coping ', ' direct application ', ' Trauma ', ' group intervention ', ' efficacy testing ', ' Computers ', ' Coping Behavior ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA,R21,2009,179906,0.0008514337070368755
"Mental Health Communication in Elderly Primary Care Visits and Economic Outcomes The medical office visit is the foundation of medical care and one of the most important professional activities of primary care physicians who are often the only source of mental health services for older adults. Evidence continues to show that the gap between science and clinical practice remains wide: as many as one half of older adults with a recognized mental disorder fail to receive any mental health services, and even fewer receive evidence-based treatments. Racial minority patients fare even worse. It is an urgent public health concern that such a high proportion of patients needing mental health services are without access to evidence-based care and that racial disparities in access to quality mental health care persist despite advancements in efficacious treatments for mental illnesses. Direct observation of how patients and physicians interact has led to research findings that are straightforward and easily understood by the public and policymakers. It offers a new perspective to study physicians' work and patients' contributions with potentially important new insights. We propose to leverage the infrastructure and data afforded by an ongoing NIH- funded study which is audio-recording 800 annual physical exam visits (checkups designed for physicians to comprehensively review their patients' health) among socioeconomically diverse older adults in a large integrated delivery system, the Henry Ford Health System, in Detroit Michigan and its surrounding suburbs. The proposed study is within the scope of the economics of mental health. We plan to apply mixed methods approach and combine perspectives from mental health services research with behavioral economics, communication research, and statistics. We will use data from audio-recordings, administrative benefits, medication dispensing, claims and encounter records, and surveys of patients and physicians to address the Specific Aims of our study: Aim 1: Examine the productivity of physician-patient communication by linking elements of quality of communication on mental health in the context of busy clinics and competing demands from co-morbidities in routine annual checkups with intermediate outcomes such as patient's satisfaction and treatment adherence and distal clinical and economic outcomes including service use and costs. Aim 2: Testing for racial disparities in communication content and time using the definition proposed by the Institute of Medicine in Unequal Treatment. We will first qualitatively compare the content and time devoted to mental health and physical health communications between racially concordant and discordant patient-physician pairs. We will assess the contribution of factors that are germane to the practice environment and malleable to policy, e.g., length of visit, co-location of mental and physical health providers to observed disparities. At the completion of the study, we seek to formulate concrete recommendations about specific organizational or clinical interventions that can address these national priorities: translating evidence to practice and eliminating disparities.

"Reducing Ethnic and Racial Bias in Screening for Psychiatric Disorders in Adolesc    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposal, entitled ""Reducing Ethnic and Racial Bias in Screening for Psychiatric Disorders in Adolescents"" is designed to improve the effectiveness of identification, referral and screening for mental health disorders potentially associated with ethnic/racial disparities in adolescents' receipt of mental health care. For racial and ethnic minority youth, there is a great disparity in the receipt of mental health services and, as a result, these youth are more likely to experience persistent impairment from psychiatric disorders. Preliminary data on referrals for mental health treatment appear to indicate that minority children are under-identified for services by their schools and families, the two major referral sources. The research to be generated can help us achieve needed enhancement in school screening, a previously under-funded area of health services research in general, and comparative effectiveness research more specifically. This project provides the opportunity to support the analysis and dissemination of data from the National Comorbidity Survey Adolescent Supplement (NCS-A), the most comprehensive national data available to study screening and referral patterns for ethnic/racial minority children. We propose four specific aims that allow us to examine a broad range of possible causes for under- recognition and lack of treatment for ethic and racial minority youth as well as alternative methods for enhancing screening tools used to assess them. Aim 1 intends to determine whether schools are equally likely to encourage parents of ethnic/racial minority youth who have psychiatric disorders to seek services for their child as they are to encourage non-Latino white parents, and whether school, community, and family characteristics explain any disparities in referral. Aim 2 then tries to identify ethnic/racial differences in parents' assessment of youth with psychiatric disorders associated with ethnic/racial disparities in service access. Aim 3 plans to evaluate meaning and response bias in the screening questions used to assess major depression and generalized anxiety disorders in non-Latino white and racial/ethnic minority adolescents. Finally in Aim 4, we compare the accuracy of predictions of mood and anxiety disorders using screening scales specific to blacks, to Latinos or to whites, with universalistic screening scales, in order to help improve detection for ethnic and racial minorities, and to determine if the scales should be group-specific or universal. Study results will be distilled to provide basic information about biases in the identification, referral and screening process by schools, and factors that influence whether parents identify ""mental health problems"" and follow-up on service referrals. Findings will be disseminated through a website for teachers and school mental health service providers, via newsletters of professional organizations, and by submission to annual conventions of school- based practitioners, thus bringing critical information to those most poised to affect change. The proposed research is designed to improve the effectiveness of identification, referral and screening for mental health disorders potentially associated with ethnic/racial disparities in adolescent receipt of mental health care. Using data from the National Comorbidity Survey Adolescent Supplement (NCS-A), the most comprehensive national data available to study screening and referral patterns for ethnic/racial minority children, we propose four specific aims that allow us to examine a broad range of possible causes for under- recognition and lack of treatment for ethic and racial minority youth as well as alternative methods for enhancing screening tools used to assess them. The project intends to distill and disseminate research results to those most poised to affect change, including creating a list of basic information about biases in the identification, referral and screening process by schools, and factors that influence whether parents identify ""mental health problems"" and follow-up on referrals for services, thus working towards the goal of diminishing the impact of early onset disorders and preventing the development of comorbid and more serious mental health problems.               PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research is designed to improve the effectiveness of identification, referral and screening for mental health disorders potentially associated with ethnic/racial disparities in adolescent receipt of mental health care.

"New Mexico Mental Health Mentorship/Education Program    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The New Mexico Mentorship and Education Program (MEP) focuses on minority mental health issues in primary care settings, especially disparities in mental health outcomes. An intensive, one-week annual training institute introduces mental health services research to minority junior faculty members and graduate students from Southwest institutions. The MEP also enhances ongoing mentorship relationships with outstanding mental health researchers. The NIMH National Advisory Mental Health Council has designated the MEP as a high program priority. By this competitive continuation application, we will strengthen the successful program by expanding it in two important ways: a) By recruiting minority primary care practitioners (PCPs) based at community health centers, the MEP will address the importance of ""translational"" research to bridge the nationally recognized gap between research and real-life practice settings, b) A new component will lead to recruitment of minority researchers and mentors who focus on geriatric mental health services in minority populations.      The MEP's specific aims are as follows: 1) Due to the difficulties that minority junior faculty members, graduate students, and practitioners have experienced in obtaining suitable training that helps them compete for research support, we will teach trainees basic research methods in this field, with an emphasis on how to write proposals and manage funded proposals. 2) To enhance the translation of research into real life practice settings, we will introduce university-based and community-based trainees to important recent findings of mental health services research, with special emphasis on research concerning the disparities in mental health outcomes that affect minority populations of the Southwest. 3) Because of the isolation and marginalization experienced by young minority researchers, we will establish networks among these trainees and nationally prominent research mentors. 4) Recognizing the challenges that minority graduate students, faculty members, and practitioners face in obtaining and retaining work positions that foster research activities, we will help trainees with various aspects of ""career development."" 5) Due to the difficulties of organizing training programs in the many locations where junior minority researchers live and work, we will produce a minority-oriented mental health services research curriculum that is exportable to other educational institutions and primary care practice sites. 6) To facilitate continuity of training and mentoring as junior investigators try to advance in their careers, we will initiate an ongoing sequence of training sessions in mental health services research on an annual basis. 7) Because of the sparse research conducted about the mental health problems of minority elders, we will initiate a new emphasis on mental health services research focusing on the older, minority populations of the Southwest.               ",New Mexico Mental Health Mentorship/Education Program,7690191,R25MH060288,"['Writing ', ' Frequencies (time pattern)

"National Survey of Behavioral Health Providers to the Deaf and Hard of Hearing    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this R03 application is to capitalize on the experience of organizations that provide mental health services to deaf and hard-of-hearing persons by means of a national survey of the characteristics, operations and outreach strategies of these organizations. Deaf and hard-of-hearing persons routinely face many serious obstacles to obtaining mental health services, and consequently have disproportionately low use of these services despite at least equal rates of mental illness. We seek to begin to address these disparities by understanding the clinic and systems issues, and by eliciting the best practices of providers in service and outreach to these vulnerable populations. The specific aims of our study are: a) to undertake a national survey of organizations that provide mental health services to deaf and hard-of-hearing persons, focusing on structural and process domains of care; b) to describe differences in the number and characteristics of agencies by region and to delineate differences in service development and outreach strategies between organizations in urban and rural settings; and c) to elicit information from these organizations about barriers to mental health care for deaf and hard-of-hearing persons and prevalent practice patterns in the local healthcare environment. We plan to accomplish these specific aims by implementing a multimodal survey designed to collect information from these organizations on client characteristics, structural features and processes of care, barriers to treatment, and the local service environment. In order to increase both response rates and cultural sensitivity to the Deaf culture, the survey will be collected using paper, web-based, telephone, and videophone using American Sign Language. The survey will be directed at key informants for 267 organizations providing mental health services to deaf and hard-of-hearing persons, identified through two nationwide directories of specialized providers and recruited through telephone contact. Analysis of survey results will guide the development of evidence-based programs to improve service delivery and efforts to rigorously test new treatment models for these patients.           Relevance The public health significance of this work is that limited access to quality mental health services is a serious public health problem for persons who are deaf or hard-of-hearing. Improving services for these vulnerable populations requires serious study of the structure and process of care that is currently in place, to define an evidence base that can inform appropriate strategies for service development, intervention and outreach.",National Survey of Behavioral Health Providers to the Deaf and Hard of Hearing,7660058,R03HS016554,[''],AHRQ,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R03,2009,62327,0.11599030006949536
"Trauma and Loss-Related Mental Health Needs of Latina Immigrants in Communities    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The PI, Stacey I. Kaltman, Ph.D., is a clinical psychologist who wishes to gain the skills and knowledge required to be an independent mental health services researcher focused on understanding and ameliorating disparities in access to and use of mental health services among low-income Latino immigrants in the US. The overall goal of this proposal is to gain an understanding of trauma and loss-related mental health needs of Latina immigrants from Central America and begin to develop culturally and linguistically competent services that are acceptable, effective, and accessible. This will be achieved via extensive training in Spanish as well as instruction in public health theory and methods.

"Culture, Context, and Mexican American Mental Health    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal seeks 5 years of continued support for a longitudinal study of processes that contribute to the high levels of psychopathology experienced by Mexican American youth. Consistent with priorities in the NIMH Strategic Plan (2008), this study is designed to (1) chart mental illness trajectories of Mexican American youth, (2) increase our capacity to predict who in this population is at risk for mental illness by identifying individual, environmental, and social factors that contribute to both risk and resilience processes, (3) identify contributors to the mental health disparities experienced by Mexican Americans, and (4) provide a scientific foundation for the design of the next generation of preventive interventions for this population. Beginning with a diverse sample of 750 Mexican American families, this study tests hypotheses regarding how interactions of individuals' cultural orientations with characteristics of family, community, peer, and school contexts contribute to the mental health burden of this population. A unique aspect of this study is the assessment of cultural orientation (i.e., degree of endorsement of traditional Mexican cultural values and degree of endorsement of U.S. cultural values) of children and parents as well as the degree to which communities and schools support these cultural traditions. Children and their parents were assessed initially when children were in 5th and 7th grades. Results supported the specific aims: (1) changes in children's and parents' cultural orientations are related to greater risk for mental health disorders; (2) family characteristics, such as parent-child conflict, mediate the relation between cultural orientation mismatches and children's psychopathology; and (3) child and parent cultural orientations buffer relations between common risk factors (e.g., economic hardship) and children's mental health. The proposed continuation will assess this sample of children and their parents as youth experience the rapid developmental changes of middle adolescence (grades 10 and 12) when rates of psychopathology accelerate. The specific aims remain: (1) cultural mismatches between children and family, community, and school contexts will be related to risk for psychopathology; (2) family and peer group processes will mediate relations between cultural mismatches and psychopathology; and (3) cultural orientations of children and their parents will moderate relations between risk factors and psychopathology. Longitudinal tests of these aims will provide a strong foundation for the next generation of prevention programs to reduce mental health disparities for Mexican Americans. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This longitudinal study of 750 Mexican American adolescents and their parents is important from a public health standpoint because of the mental health disparities Mexican American adolescents experience, and the limited knowledge about factors that contribute to these disparities. This study is designed to (1) chart mental illness trajectories of Mexican American youth, (2) increase our capacity to predict who in this population is at risk for mental illness by identifying individual, environmental, and social factors that contribute to both risk and resilience processes, (3) identify contributors to the mental health disparities experienced by Mexican Americans, and (4) provide a firm scientific foundation for the design of the next generation of preventive interventions for this population in order to reduce the individual, family, and societal burden of psychopathology within this population.           NARRATIVE This longitudinal study of 750 Mexican American adolescents and their parents is important from a public health standpoint because of the mental health disparities Mexican American adolescents experience, and the limited knowledge about factors that contribute to these disparities.

"Supporting Mental Health of African American Elders    This application is in response to the NIMH program announcement ""Intervention and Practice Research Infrastructure Program"" {IP-RISP; PAR -04-015). We propose a collaborative  partnership between a research center (Center for Applied Research on Aging and Health, CARAH) at Thomas Jefferson University, and a senior center in the Philadelphia Region, Center in the Park (CIP). CIP is a certified senior center. It has received numerous awards for its innovative programming for the 6,000 community-living urban elders it serves; over 85% of whom is African American. Building on our existing collaborative platform, we plan to implement a partner program, entitled ""In Touch: Mind, Body and Spirit"". The overall goal of this program is to create a sustainable infrastructure in a community setting for systematic mental health research, programming and its evaluation and research training that is responsive to the social and cultural tenets of the target group. The partnership is guided by a well-established collaborative model and is based in the tradition of action science in that it seeks to develop a ""community of inquiry"" within a ""community of practice."" It employs multimethodologies to evaluate infrastructure viability and sustainability and generate knowledge that is relevant and useful to the community which CIP serves. The three broad programmatic aims are to: 1) Develop, implement and evaluate a sustainable infrastructure for the In Touch: Mind, Body and Spirit program including a governance structure, and an electronic data management system with outcome reporting capacity and support of field-based clinical research; 2) Implement three exploratory pilot studies to test the infrastructure and advance knowledge of the adaptive mechanisms and mental health needs of older African American men and women with differing functional status; and 3) Develop, implement and evaluate research training activities including experiential and on-site involvement for health professionals (geriatric fellows, students in medicine, nursing, occupational therapy and physical therapy) that are integrated with the pilot research efforts including how to: a) design collaborative-based clinical research, b) identify culturally relevant research questions to advance knowledge on mental health issues of the target population, c) carry out clinical research in mental health and aging in an applied setting; and d) translate evidence-based programs for the target group. The exploratory studies we plan to implement are theoretically-driven. They are designed to identify and understand the broad range of adaptive strategies and self-care practices that afford positive mental health outcomes for older African American men and women experiencing a range of age-related losses. The three exploratory studies logically and incrementally build on the other moving from descriptive to associative to predictive type research questions. These include an: 1) exploration of domains of concern with the aging process and the adaptive and cultural mechanisms for offsetting loss including symptom presentation and treatment seeking for mental health concerns among African American elders; 2) examination of differential patterns of adaptive strategy use and mental health outcomes for African American men and women with different functional status; and 3) evaluation of an intervention protocol to promote positive mental health (self-efficacy, reduced depressive symptoms) among a group of African Americans elders identified at high risk for adverse psychological well-being. Thus, initial studies will form the basis for developing and testing linguistically and culturally appropriate interventions for African American elders with different health profiles as well as the ways in which current evidence-based programs need to be translated to fit this cultural group.

"MHREG for Research in Ethnically Diverse Communities    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): As the nation becomes more racially and ethnically diverse, novel approaches to research and research education are needed to decrease the burden of mental illness. Mood disorders are a leading cause of disability and a powerful contributor to mortality, including deaths by suicide. Treatments for mood disorders among Blacks and Latinos require innovative research models responsive to economic disparities, culturally- mediated preferences and expectations of treatment, and the co-morbidities that disproportionately affect people of color such as substance misuse and medical illness. Meeting this scientific and public health challenge requires innovation in the education of clinical scientists. New collaborations involving university and community partners must be developed, given the central roles that community agencies play in the lives of the emerging majority, and the understandable reluctance of many ethnic minorities to seek treatment in the existing specialized mental health care delivery system. The Rochester Program of Research and Innovation in Disparities Education (Rochester PRIDE) is a novel training program designed to inspire and prepare trainees to conduct mental health research in partnership with community agencies. Over the next five years, we will 1) enhance our established research training partnerships with community agencies in a manner that facilitates trainee research, 2) recruit and educate at least 25 trainees from psychology and medicine in a core didactic curriculum that features a new, multidisciplinary seminar titled ""Race, Socioeconomic Status and Health in the Urban Setting"", 3) implement an innovative collaborative mentoring- precepting program that teaches trainees how to develop and implement research in community settings, 4) evaluate PRIDE by monitoring trainee outcomes and by soliciting and reviewing feedback from an external Evaluator, and 5) disseminate our findings by convening symposia and publishing peer-reviewed articles describing program design, implementation, and outcomes. This multidisciplinary research education program will be highly attractive to trainees who seek to gain skills and knowledge to conduct research in real-world settings. Rochester PRIDE will also serve as a model for other mental health training and educational programs designed to meet the nation's changing public health needs. By the end of the Award period, we will have sufficient experience and data to disseminate the program's findings and expand its scope by adding trainees interested in research on children and adolescents. As well, we will consider adding trainees at other developmental levels or from other disciplines.           ",MHREG for Research in Ethnically Diverse Communities,7640942,R25MH074898,"['racism ', ' Caribbean region ', ' West Indies Region ', ' Caribbean Sea Region ', ' Caribbean ', ' Publishing Peer Reviews ', ' Training ', ' disability ', ' Latin America ', ' Learning ', ' web site ', ' website ', ' Discipline ', ' health care service utilization ', ' healthcare utilization ', ' healthcare service utilization ', ' health services utilization ', ' Health Care Utilization ', ' African ', ' Educational workshop ', ' Workshop ', ' Interdisciplinary Study ', ' Multidisciplinary Research ', ' Multidisciplinary Collaboration ', ' Interdisciplinary Research ', ' Battered Women ', ' abuse of women ', ' abuse of females ', ' Abused women ', ' Abused females ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Medicine ', ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health Services ', ' Mental Hygiene Services ', ' Mentors ', ' Mission ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Mortality ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' Epidemiologic Studies ', ' epidemiologic investigation ', ' Epidemiology Research ', ' Epidemiological Studies ', ' Epidemiologic Research ', ' Collaborations ', ' Immigrant ', ' Press Releases ', ' Nuts ', ' Physicians ', ' Play ', ' Poverty ', ' Preventive Medicine ', ' preventative medicine ', ' Psychiatry ', ' Psychologist ', ' Psychology ', ' Clinical Psychology ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' recruit ', ' Nature ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Rest ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Social support ', ' social support network ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Medical Students ', ' Educational process of instructing ', ' Teaching ', ' Scientist ', ' Training Programs ', ' Travel ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' Voice ', ' Work ', ' Automobile Driving ', ' driving ', ' Award ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' Mental disorders ', ' psychological disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Mood Disorders ', ' Affective Disorders ', ' psychosocial ', ' interest ', ' meetings ', ' Postdoctoral Fellow ', ' post-doctoral ', ' post-doc ', ' Research Associate ', ' Postdoc ', ' preference ', ' experience ', ' care delivery ', ' knowledge base ', ' knowledgebase ', ' skills ', ' expectation ', ' novel ', ' Prevention strategy ', ' Preventive strategy ', ' research study ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' Relative (related person) ', ' Relative ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Police ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' symposium ', ' conference ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Latino ', ' Mediating ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' diverse populations ', ' Research Methodology ', ' Research Methods ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Modeling ', ' Cities ', ' Color ', ' Communities ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Minority ', ' suicidal morbidity ', ' suicide morbidity ', ' suicide death ', ' novel strategies ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel approaches ', ' new approaches ', ' Outcome ', ' Community Integration ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' community based participatory research ', ' health training ', ' clinical care ', ' community setting ', ' Educational Curriculum ', ' Curriculum ', ' health care delivery ', ' health services delivery ', ' Healthcare Delivery ', ' Health Sciences, Allied and Health Services Delivery ', ' Discrimination (Psychology) ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Legal ', ' Economics ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Elements ', ' Environment ', ' Address ', ' Ethics ', ' ethical ', ' Data ', ' Research Training ', ' Monitor ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Faculty ', ' Family Practice ', ' family medicine ', ' Feedback ', ' Foundations ', ' Affect ', ' Africa ', ' base ', ' career ', ' Hand ', ' Health ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Site ', ' Solid ', ' Clinical ', ' Biological ', ' Medical ', ' Adolescent ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF ROCHESTER,R25,2009,220506,0.029837204674584044
"Racial/Ethnic Disparities and Children's Early Social Emotional Development    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Social emotional development in early childhood serves as the foundation for mental health across the lifespan. Results from a recent nationally-representative study of U.S. kindergarteners show a clear difference in social emotional development by race/ethnicity, with greater percentages of minority children compared to white children entering school with fewer social emotional competencies. These disparities in children's early mental health are particularly concerning given the growing number of minority children in the U.S., coupled with evidence that early social emotional deficits have short-term implications for school readiness and longer- term implications including lower occupational attainment, higher rates of teen pregnancy and depression. While studies have documented racial/ethnic disparities in social emotional development upon children's entry to school, there have been no studies examining racial/ethnic differences in a contemporary, nationally representative sample of children in early childhood and the factors that may account for these disparities. The three specific aims of the proposed study are: 1) examine the extent of racial/ethnic differences in children's social emotional development at 2 years of age; 2) determine whether differences in child characteristics, family demographic characteristics, family context and child care context explain racial/ethnic variation in children's social emotional development at 2 years of age; and 3) determine whether relations among child characteristics, family demographic characteristics, family context, child care context and children's social emotional development vary by race/ethnicity at 2 years of age. Data are from the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study, Birth Cohort (ECLS-B) funded by the U.S. Department of Education in collaboration with the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH).The ECLS-B follows a nationally representative sample of approximately 14,000 children born in 2001. Data include direct measures of social emotional development at 2 years of age and additional measures of parent and child characteristics at 9 months. Regression models will be constructed to examine the direct and indirect relationship between child's race/ethnicity and social emotional outcomes. The proposed dissertation project is highly relevant to NIMH's mission to reduce the burden of mental illness and behavioral disorders through research on mind, brain, and behavior and address the Division of Pediatric Translational Research and Treatment Development's high priority area  delineating mechanisms and processes of neurobehavioral development relevant to understanding pediatric mental disorders with a focus on periods of rapid neurobiological change (e.g., infancy, preschool, adolescent periods), during which the brain is particularly sensitive to contextual influence .

"A Cross-Cultural, Patient-Centered Approach for Assessing Quality of ADHD Care    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Racial-ethnic disparities in diagnosis and treatment of Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) suggest that all children with ADHD are at risk for poor quality of care. In order to better understand these disparities in ADHD care quality, Dr. Eugenia Chan, a developmental-behavioral pediatrician, is submitting this revised applications for a Mentored Patient-Oriented Career Development Award (K23) to develop a cross-cultural, patient-centered approach for assessing quality of primary care management of children with ADHD. The overall goals are to develop a conceptual understanding of barriers to effective care from patient and family perspectives, to understand how and why these problems vary across cultural groups, and to develop instruments and methods to measure these patient-centered processes of care and to guide interventions to improve clinical care and outcomes for children with ADHD. The specific aims are to (1) develop a patient-centered model of ADHD care quality by investigating similarities and differences in African-American, Chinese-American, and European-American family experiences of ADHD care; (2) develop and validate a parent survey of patient-centered indicators of ADHD care quality that are sensitive to cross-cultural values regarding care for ADHD; and (3) test the survey in a diverse, primary care patient population to assess psychometric properties and identify disparities in patient-centered ADHD care quality. The results of this project will lead directly to future applications to (1) investigate relationships among patient-centered quality assessments, evidence-based quality indicators, and ADHD outcomes, (2) identify disparities in primary care management of ADHD, and (3) develop and implement targeted interventions to improve disparities in quality of ADHD care. The candidate has demonstrated skills as a developmental- behavioral pediatrician and junior health services researcher. The multidisciplinary education plan focuses on acquiring strong theoretical background and skills in qualitative methods, culture and disparities in mental health, advanced biostatistics, and measurement-based quality assessment and quality improvement. With an outstanding team of mentors and consultants, Dr. Chan's detailed, focused education and research plan will enable her to achieve her long-term goal of becoming a successful independent investigator devoted to understanding and reducing disparities in quality of care for children with mental health conditions.           ","A Cross-Cultural, Patient-Centered Approach for Assessing Quality of ADHD Care",7563236,K23MH079214,"['Provider ', ' Eugenia ', ' Syzygium ', ' Caryophyllus ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ', ' attention deficit hyperactive disorder ', ' Predominantly Hyperactive-Impulsive Type Hyperactivity Disorder ', ' Predominantly Hyperactive-Impulsive Type Attention-Deficit Disorder ', ' Hyperkinetic Syndrome ', ' Hyperactivity Disorder NOS ', ' ADHD ', ' AD/HD ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Caring ', ' Qualitative Methods ', ' K-Series Research Career Programs ', ' Research Career Program ', ' K-Awards ', ' Career Development Programs K-Series ', ' Career Development Awards and Programs ', ' Career Development Awards ', ' Cognitive ', ' Process ', ' socioeconomics ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomic ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio economic ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Behavioral ', ' Family ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Future ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' base ', ' Goals ', ' improved ', ' Health Personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Health Services ', ' health care service ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Interview ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Life Experience ', ' pediatrician ', ' European ', ' Measurement ', ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' Parents ', ' Patients ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Primary Care ', ' Psychometrics ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' instrument ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Risk ', ' School Teachers ', ' Consensus ', ' programs ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Testing ', ' Principal Component Analysis ', ' Principal Component Analyses ', ' Quality Indicator ', ' Biometry ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Biometrics ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' Maintenance Therapy ', ' Structure ', ' skills ', ' Participant ', ' help-seeking behavior ', ' help seeking ', ' cultural values ', ' Prevention ', ' Reporting ', ' Measures ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Chinese American ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Modeling ', ' Property ', ' LOINC Axis 2 Property ', ' Quality of Care ', ' QOC ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' education planning ', ' Communities ', ' cost ', ' willingness ', ' Outcome ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' patient oriented ', ' patient centered ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' clinical care ', ' evidence base ', ' patient population ', ' Confidentiality ', ' information privacy ', ' Consultations ', ' ']",NIMH,BOSTON CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL,K23,2009,179800,0.051098306228628126
"Mental Health Literacy Among Korean American Elders    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposed study is written in response to the heightened need for research designed to help reduce mental health disparities. The investigation focuses on one of the fastest growing but understudied and underserved ethnic minority groups: Korean American elders. Building upon our previous findings that Korean American older adults have high levels of mental health problems yet underutilize mental health services, the proposed study conceptualizes low mental health literacy as a major reason for service underutilization and a central focus of intervention efforts. The overall goals are to better understand the levels of mental health literacy manifest in the target population and to develop/test an educational intervention. The proposed study includes three phases: (1) data collection with a mixed methodology including a survey and focus groups; (2) development of an educational intervention program, and (3) pilot testing and evaluation. Survey data drawing on structured questionnaires will be used to assess the level of mental health literacy and to determine facilitators and barriers of mental health literacy. In order to provide a more in-depth assessment of mental health literacy, data from focus groups will also be used. The latter discussions will be conducted with Korean American older adults, their family members, health care professionals, and religious leaders. Various mental health issues and ways to promote community mental health and service utilization will serve as focal points for diverse perspectives. Findings from the survey data and focus groups will guide the development of a culturally appropriate and acceptable educational intervention program. An educational brochure in Korean will be written with the twin goals of increasing mental health literacy and making positive changes in attitudes toward mental disorders and service utilization. We will also adopt a peer-led education strategy where lay peer leaders are trained to deliver an educational session. The session includes not only the brochure but also peer-education and group discussion. The peer-based approach allows greater sensitivity to the unique characteristics of ethnic minority communities, where informal leaders play a significant role. During the third and final phase, an experiment with three randomized conditions (control, general brochure, and peer-led education) will be conducted to explore the effectiveness of the educational brochure and peer-led education strategy. We hypothesize that 1) those in the treatment groups (general brochure and peer-led education) would show increased knowledge of depression and positive changes in attitudes toward mental illness and service use compared to those in the control group, and 2) peer-led education would be more effective than the brochure-only approach. Pilot testing and evaluation will serve as an important means to assess effect size of intervention and feasibility of the program for implementation in a subsequent project. We also hope to use our findings to develop a protocol for application to other ethnic minority groups.      Public Health Relevance: Building upon previous findings that Korean American older adults have high levels of mental health problems yet underutilize mental health services, the proposed study conceptualizes low mental health literacy as a major reason for service underutilization and a central focus of intervention efforts.

"Multi-Method Ethnographic Assessment of Behavioral Health Reform in New Mexico    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The State of New Mexico will implement a major reform in managed mental health service delivery for low-income populations in July 2005. Seventeen state agencies will contract with a single behavioral health organization to oversee the delivery of all public mental health services. This reform is designed to decrease administrative costs and service fragmentation while improving access to culturally relevant, evidence-based mental health services, particularly in rural areas. However, concerns linger that managed mental health care programs may adversely affect access and services for vulnerable populations and may overly burden rural safety-net institutions. The 5-year R01 research project proposed in this application will use a multi-method ethnographic approach to examine: (1) the process of introducing the reform in a rural and multiethnic state and (2) the degree to which the reform results in improved access and quality of care for low-income seriously mentally ill (SMI) patients in public mental health programs and other safety-net institutions.  This longitudinal study has three specific aims: (1) To examine changes in help-seeking behavior, access, and utilization of services by American Indian, Hispanic, and White SMI patients and their social supports (e.g., family and close peers) in three rural and three urban settings before, during, and after the reform. (2) To investigate changes in the work environment, attitudes, and behavior of frontline service providers and staff members of safety-net institutions in the targeted settings before, during, and after the reform. (3) To assess the impacts of the reform on the organization and financial condition of safety-net institutions in the targeted settings and statewide.  Our multi-method ethnographic research strategy will employ both qualitative and quantitative methods in two sets of studies, conducted prior to and after the reform is implemented. The first set, consisting of administrative database reviews and ethnographic interviews and observations with SMI patients and frontline service providers, will describe changes in patterns of mental health care utilization and provider behavior. These studies will occur in three rural counties and three comparison urban counties. The second set, consisting of ethnographic interviews with state policymakers and structured surveys with clinical directors of rural and urban safety-net institutions, will identify changes in service provision for the SMI statewide. This latter statewide component will facilitate linking of the community-level ethnographic data with broader system change.  The proposed ethnographic assessment of New Mexico's reform will offer new practical knowledge, grounded in the actual experiences of diverse stakeholders, that may improve state mental health policy for rural and minority SMI populations. In collaboration with the State of New Mexico, we will assess whether the reform decreases barriers to   care for these underserved groups and how it affects the viability of existing services rendered in safety-net institutions.  This research will fill a gap in research on statewide assessments of public health care initiatives, which do not typically focus on patient help-seeking behavior and the unique access and utilization problems faced by rural, racial and ethnic minorities. Since rural states may turn to the New Mexico reform as a model to reduce administrative costs and service fragmentation and to increase access for the SMI, this research is of great national relevance.

"Fostering Mental Health Research in Psychiatry Residents    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There is a critical lack of minority physician scientists engaged in and leading mental health clinical research. The proposed research educational program addresses this gap in targeting primarily minority psychiatry residents attending a small HBCU medical school, Morehouse School of Medicine, and partners - for the fourth year research elective - with the much larger, research oriented, Department of Psychiatry of Emory University School of Medicine. The proposed program permeates the four-year residency training program. By the end of the second year, the residents are becoming competent in evidence-based medicine principles, are research literate, and have participated in ongoing research projects. Collaboration with Emory assures a wide variety of experienced investigators with sponsored research, augmented by Morehouse's own resources, from which the PGY IV resident can select a mentor and research project. In addition to traditional research training subjects, this directly addresses cultural competency in mental health research, including bioethical, biological and psychological issues of minority populations in research content and conduct, and as a means to decreasing mental health disparities. The program will also facilitate a bridge to postdoctoral training and mentoring. Furthermore, the practice of mentoring others will be instilled in the participants, and they will be encouraged to mentor those in earlier years of training. The specific aims include: support educational experiences relevant to conducting mental health related clinical research that will attract, train and further career development of primarily under-represented minority physician scientists; provide mentored clinical research opportunities that will encourage physician scientists to embark on research projects directly applicable to clinical practice and transitional research; assure the training and experience necessary to progress to the next step of the participants careers, either by entering a research postdoctoral fellowship or by joining an existing research environment; and establish the feasibility of a paradigm of smaller medical schools, especially those with large minority residency programs, to partner with larger, more research oriented, local medical schools to provide more advanced training that otherwise would not possible.           ",Fostering Mental Health Research in Psychiatry Residents,7653713,R25MH071735,"['Psychiatrist ', ' Psychiatry ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Residencies ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Rotation ', ' medical schools ', ' school of medicine ', ' medical college ', ' Evidence Based Medicine ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' Training Programs ', ' Translating ', ' Universities ', ' Mental disorders ', ' psychological disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Drug Formulations ', ' Formulation ', ' experience ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Basic Science ', ' Basic Research ', ' literate ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' career development ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Minority ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' post-doctoral training ', ' postdoctoral training ', ' Historically Black Colleges and Universities ', ' Historically Black University ', ' Historically Black Institution ', ' Historically Black Colleges ', ' HBCUs ', ' clinical practice ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Environment ', ' Address ', ' Doctor of Philosophy ', ' PhD ', ' Ph.D. ', ' Research Training ', ' Underrepresented Minority ', ' underserved minority ', ' under-represented minority ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Fellowship ', ' Fibrinogen ', ' Factor One ', ' Factor I ', ' Coagulation Factor One ', ' Coagulation Factor I ', ' Blood Factor One ', ' Blood Coagulation Factor One ', ' Blood Coagulation Factor I ', ' Journals ', ' Magazine ', ' career ', ' Goals ', ' improved ', ' Housing ', ' Clinical ', ' Biological ', ' psychologic ', ' psychological ', ' Training ', ' literacy ', ' Educational workshop ', ' Workshop ', ' Fostering ', ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mentors ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Collaborations ', ' Physicians ', ' Staging ', ' ']",NIMH,MOREHOUSE SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,R25,2009,234400,0.09732233521145747
"Bronx Youth Partnership on Mental Health Disparities    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): For the past two years, AECOM's Preventive Intervention Research Center has been the lead agency for a Bronx community coalition, led by adolescents, ""Albert's Leaders of Tomorrow"" (A.L.O.T.). It used CPBR to identify mental health disparities as the most important to address among minority inner-city adolescents, and with a Coalition of 48 community agencies, it developed BxThunder, a mental health intervention. We plan to conduct a randomized controlled trial of BxThunder in 3 community agencies: Mosholu-Montefiore Community Center, Wildcat Academy, and Citizen's Advice Bureau. BxThunder has three parts: PART I. TEEN is an award-winning positive youth development program that improves mental health and trains teens to be peer educators; PART II. graduates will join ""ALOTMore"" and implement a multimedia workshop in Bronx agencies to teach about mental health and reduce stigma; PART III. teens in BxThunder who need mental health services will receive them on site from clinical psychologists and externs from three community partners, Lehman College CUNY, Wurzweiler School of Social Work, and Ferkauf Graduate School of Psychology. We will conduct an intent-to-treat randomized controlled trial of BxThunder. We will recruit 240 teens at each site (n=720 total), and randomize them to receive BxThunder or standard care. Teens will be interviewed at baseline and 6- and 12-months later. Outcome measures are positive mental health (Resiliency Scales for Adolescents, RSCA; The Self-Perception Profile for Adolescents, SPPA) and psychological symptoms (Youth Self Report, YSR). Among symptomatic teens, we will assess the number of identified youth who received a referral for services; the number of those who implemented the referral; the number who are in or have completed services; and their mental health outcomes (symptoms) after treatment. The Specific Aims are to test the hypotheses that compared to control teens:   (1) teens in BxThunder will experience fewer mental health symptoms;   (2) teens in BxThunder will experience a greater increase in positive mental health;   (3) teens with psychological problems in BxThunder are more likely to have a successful referral for care, and are more likely to complete treatment;   (4) teens in BxThunder with psychological problems will experience a larger reduction in psychological symptoms;   (5) the BxCAM workshop will increase knowledge and decrease stigma among those who attend, as measured by change in pre-test and post-test measures of workshop attendees.   A sustainability project will be designed and implemented by Affinity Health Plan in conjunction with the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene.           ",Bronx Youth Partnership on Mental Health Disparities,7633371,R24MD001784,"['Counseling ', ' Curriculum ', ' Educational Curriculum ',

"Addressing Cultural Factors and Mental Health Disparities in Research and Practic    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Abstract. This Conference Grant application is to request funding to support three annual conferences aimed at sharing state of the art scientific research and best professional practices to address the mental health disparities of racial/ethnic minorities and immigrants. The successive themes for the three years are (a) addressing the intersections between race and culture in scientific research and mental health service delivery for children, adolescents, and families; and (b) examination of the intersection of culture, race, and trauma and mental health across the life span; and (c) racial identity and cultural factors in treatment and service delivery (Each conference builds upon the recommendations of Dr. David Satcher's supplemental report, Mental Health: Culture, Race, and Ethnicity; the President's New Freedom Commission on Mental Health Report: Achieving the Promise: Transforming Mental Health Care in America; the mission of NIMH; as well as the longstanding objectives of the Institute for the Study and Promotion of Race and Culture (ISPRC) at Boston College. In an effort to reduce mental health disparities among People of Color relative to non-minorities, each conference involves sharing innovative, pragmatic, and empirically based strategies for delineating and addressing the mental health burdens of ethnic and linguistic minorities. The primary common goals and objectives of each of the conferences are to: (1) Share state of the art mental health theory, research, and practice with respect to the roles of race and culture in the etiology, maintenance, and remediation of mental health disparities; (2) Use strategies to engage scientist- practitioners and mental health service providers in interdisciplinary communication and collaboration to address the role of culture and race in their research, practice, and service delivery.

Speakers for the conference will be nationally and internationally acknowledged researchers and clinicians presenting in their areas of expertise via interactive formats. Each of the thematic 2-day conferences will take place at the Diversity Challenge conference at Boston College in successive years, October of 2007, 2008, and 2009. Each thematic conference will be characterized by varied formats consisting of plenary sessions, individual presentations, concurrent workgroups, roundtable discussions, and informational poster and exhibit sessions intended to achieve the stated aims. Proceedings from the conference will be disseminated through published monographs, and on the ISPRC web site. Thematic books based on each conference will be co-edited by the co-PIs. The conference grant addresses mental health disparities of People of Color in the United States. This focus is consistent with the Surgeon General's Supplemental Report on Race, Culture, and Mental Health, the President's New Freedom Commission report, and the mission of NIMH, which identified these populations as being at significant public health risk and called for interventions to eliminate the health disparities.          ",Addressing Cultural Factors and Mental Health Disparities in Research and Practic,7623218,R13MH078714,"['health care delivery ', ' health services delivery ', ' Healthcare Delivery ', ' Health Sciences, Allied and Health Services Delivery ', ' Provider ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Etiology ', ' disease causation ', ' causation ', ' Causality ', ' Address ', ' Applications Grants ', ' Grant Proposals ', ' Exhibits ', ' Family ', ' Freedom ', ' Liberty ', ' base ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Area ', ' Adolescent ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Institutes ', ' web site ', ' website ', ' Individual ', ' Linguistics ', ' Linguistic ', ' Longevity ', ' lifespan ', ' life span ', ' Length of Life ', ' Funding ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Maintenance ', ' Americas ', ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health Services ', ' Mental Hygiene Services ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' Mission ', ' National Institute of Mental Health (U.S.) ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' NIMH ', ' Collaborations ', ' Immigrant ', ' Monograph ', ' Professional Practice ', ' health care professional practice ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' Publishing ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' posters ', ' Arts ', ' Scientist ', ' United States ', ' college ', ' collegiate ', ' Services ', ' Surgeon ', ' Books ', ' Boston ', ' Reporting ', ' Interdisciplinary Communication ', ' Multidisciplinary Communication ', ' Cross-Disciplinary Communication ', ' Relative (related person) ', ' Relative ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' abstracting ', ' symposium ', ' conference ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' theories ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Color ', ' Minority ', ' remediation ', ' Population ', ' Trauma ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' ']",NIMH,BOSTON COLLEGE,R13,2009,118481,0.013919371030323162
"Advanced Center to Improve Pediatric Mental Health Care (ACIPMHC)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose to establish an Advanced Center to Improve Pediatric Mental Health Care (ACIPMHC) that will be located within the Child and Adolescent Services Research Center (CASRC) at Rady Children's Hospital-San Diego. The ACIPMHC will have strong linkage to the intervention development program at the Center for Research to Practice (CR2P) at the Oregon Social Learning Center (OSLC) and to other intervention and services research programs and networks around the country. The research agenda has a strategic focus on improvement of public pediatric mental health care, primarily in the mental health and child welfare service sectors, through improved integration of evidence-based practice and usual care. The center's program of practice research spans clinical epidemiology studies linked to evidence-based practice, effectiveness, and implementation studies. The research agenda will have a primary focus on effectiveness and equity as two of the six aims for improving health care from the ""Crossing the Quality Chasm"" report. An overarching center perspective of cultural exchange will guide active partnership with major stakeholders in youth mental health care, including youth and family consumers, providers, program and funding managers, system administrators, policy makers, and intervention and services researchers. The Principal Research Core (PRC) will focus on practice research through two developmental studies addressing implementation of two established evidence-based practices. These studies and others to be designed by the center network of investigators will be carried out in community-based mental health and child welfare service settings, building on already developed research-practice relationships. The Research Methods Core (RMC) will advance methods for effectiveness and implementation research through four workgroups focusing on (a) design and analysis, (b) measurement, (c) mixed methods, and (d) economic analyses, as well as one developmental study addressing incorporation of research-based measurement in usual care child welfare practice. The Community Network Core (CNC) will strengthen a multiple sector infrastructure in San Diego County and link research activities to an emerging research network in the State of California that partners with the California Institute of Mental Health, a technical assistance arm of the county mental health directors in California. The Operations Core (OC) will provide leadership and will support activities in the other three cores by extending an effective infrastructure developed through two prior services research center grants and participating as one of six sites in an R-25 training consortium. All cores will advance practice research to inform improvements in mental health care that decrease racial-ethnic disparities.      Operations Core (OC)          ",Advanced Center to Improve Pediatric Mental Health Care (ACIPMHC),7620074,P30MH074678,[''],NIMH,RADY CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL - SAN DIEGO,P30,2009,1816369,0.1443566659711261
"Innovations in the Measurement of Racial/Ethnic Disparities in Mental Health Care    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Understanding the state of racial/ethnic disparities in mental health care has been limited by a lack of consensus on appropriate methods. The predominant methods used in the literature are to compare unadjusted means, or to use multivariate regression methods to identify the independent association between race and mental health care. In light of the Institute of Medicine (IOM) definition of disparity in quality of health care, as presented in Unequal Treatment, these methods may over- or under-estimate disparities. The IOM defines disparities as all differences except those due to clinical appropriateness, need, and preferences. The objective of this application is to improve the identification of disparities in mental health care by refining and applying methods conceptually grounded in the IOM definition. The research will increase understanding of how the burden of mental illness differs by race/ethnicity. Progress can then be tracked towards the reduction of disparities in mental health care, with the ultimate goal of reducing the burden of mental illness felt by all racial/ethnic groups. The proposed research implements the IOM definition of racial disparities by adjusting for health status while allowing the mediation of socioeconomic status (SES) variables. Two adjustment methods are used: a rank and replace method and a propensity score-based method. These methods are refined and applied to mental health status and utilization measures in commonly used, nationally representative datasets. The specific aims of this proposal are: 1. To refine empirical methods concordant to the IOM definition of racial disparities, and apply these methods to assess the current state of black-white and Hispanic-white disparities in mental health services utilization. 2. To develop recommendations for the use of IOM-concordant methods in different data contexts. Capitalizing on the strengths of the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS) and the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS), apply sensitivity analyses to assess the validity of these methods in calculating disparities when using different dependent variables and datasets.          ",Innovations in the Measurement of Racial/Ethnic Disparities in Mental Health Care,7576871,R03MH082312,"['Time ', ' Work ', ' Mental disorders ', ' psychological disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' surgery ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' preference ', ' Exclusion ', ' Mediation ', ' Negotiation ', ' Negotiating ', ' racial difference ', ' race differences ', ' Categories ', ' Reporting ', ' Measures ', ' United States Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality ', ' United States Agency for Health Care Policy and Research ', ' Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality ', ' Agency for Health Care Policy and Research ', ' AHRQ ', ' AHCPR ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Hispanics ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Research Methodology ', ' Research Methods ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Climate ', ' climatic ', ' Meteorological Climate ', ' cost ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' racial/ethnic ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' Data Sources ', ' Discrimination (Psychology) ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Legal ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Data ', ' National Health Interview Survey ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Characteristics ', ' Expenditure ', ' Future ', ' base ', ' racial/ethnic difference ', ' Goals ', ' improved ', ' Health ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' healthcare service availability ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare access availability ', ' health services availability ', ' health care service availability ', ' health care service access ', ' health care availability ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Availability of Health Services ', ' Accessibility of health care ', ' Access to Healthcare ', ' Access to Health Care ', ' Access to Care ', ' Health Status ', ' Level of Health ', ' Health Status Indicators ', ' Health Status Index ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' Non-linear Models ', ' Nonlinear Models ', ' Income ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Institute of Medicine (U.S.) ', ' NAS/IOM ', ' Institute of Medicine ', ' Health Insurance ', ' Interview ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Individual ', ' health care service utilization ', ' healthcare utilization ', ' healthcare service utilization ', ' health services utilization ', ' Health Care Utilization ', ' Literature ', ' Policies ', ' Measurement ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health Services ', ' Mental Hygiene Services ', ' Methods ', ' Prejudice ', ' tool ', ' Publishing ', ' health care quality ', ' healthcare quality ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Socioeconomic Factors ', ' Consensus ', ' Patient Preferences ', ' Insurance Coverage ', ' Insurance Status ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' ']",NIMH,CAMBRIDGE HEALTH ALLIANCE,R03,2009,85881,0.1540629087506816
"HIV Intervention Science Training Program  for Underserved Investigators     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal responds to PAS-06-447 entitled Mentoring Programs to Diversify Mental Health HIV/AIDS Research Workforce through Innovative Educational Initiatives that highlights a need to ""develop new and improved research mentorship for racial/ethnic minority (REM) individuals focused on HIV/AIDS disparities issues and/or to establish a network of senior mentors for REM mentees."" This application proposes to develop and facilitate the growth of a new cadre-4 per year for a total of 12-of REM scientists capable of serving as PIs on extramurally funded studies in the areas of HIV prevention research on the co-occurring problems of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), trauma and related mental health issues among REM groups and on the design of HIV culturally-congruent prevention interventions to address these co-occurring problems that reflect and drive health disparities.

"Improving Depression Treatment for Latinas    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Latinos comprise one of the fastest growing racial/ethnic populations in the United States, currently constituting 14% of the total U.S. population. The increasing rate of Latinos will undoubtedly increase the number of people at risk for mental health disorders. Latina women will be at heightened risk since previous studies have found greater lifetime prevalence of mental health disorders, especially depression, in comparison to men. Social capital is a promising construct with which investigators may examine a community's capacity to respond to challenges and promote individual-level health. However, the relation between social capital and mental health in ethnic minority populations remains unclear. Obtaining or expanding social capital, especially for marginalized communities, may therefore improve mental health outcomes. The proposed study will investigate the construct of social capital among Latina women of Mexican descent. Specifically, the qualitative phase will provide a description of the construct of social capital and how it operates among this population, while the quantitative phase will investigate the mental health and access to care outcomes of social capital and test a hypothesized model.          ",Improving Depression Treatment for Latinas,7677987,F31MH078318,"['health inequalities ', ' Cross-Sectional Studies ', ' Disease Frequency Surveys ', ' Cross-Sectional Survey ', ' Cross-Sectional Analyses ', ' Cross Sectional Analysis ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Economics ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Educational Status ', ' training status ', ' training level ', ' training achievement ', ' educational level ', ' Educational Achievement ', ' Environment ', ' Preventive ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Caring ', ' social capital ', ' Data ', ' Information Resources ', ' knowledge resources ', ' knowledge resource ', ' information resource ', ' Face ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Family ', ' Fellowship ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Foundations ', ' Geographic Locations ', ' geographic site ', ' MeSH Descriptors Class 4 ', ' Geographical Location ', ' Geographic Region ', ' Geographic Area ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Health ', ' Health Services ', ' health care service ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' healthcare service availability ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare access availability ', ' health services availability ', ' health care service availability ', ' health care service access ', ' health care availability ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Availability of Health Services ', ' Accessibility of health care ', ' Access to Healthcare ', ' Access to Health Care ', ' Access to Care ', ' Health Status ', ' Level of Health ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Man (Taxonomy) ', ' Phase ', ' In-Migration ', ' Immigrations ', ' Income ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Interview ', ' caucasian American ', ' white American ', ' Language ', ' residence ', ' Individual ', ' Literature ', ' Mexican ', ' Inequality ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Methods ', ' Theoretical model ', ' Theoretic Models ', ' Names ', ' National Health Insurance ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Poverty ', ' Puerto Rican ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Social support ', ' social support network ', ' Life ', ' Insurance Coverage ', ' Insurance Status ', ' statistics ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Testing ', ' United States ', ' Woman ', ' Wood material ', ' Wood ', ' Work ', ' Mental disorders ', ' psychological disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' experience ', ' metropolitan ', ' Structure ', ' Capital ', ' social ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', ' segregation ', ' Racial Segregation ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Hispanics ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Latino ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Modeling ', ' Uninsured ', ' Acculturation ', ' Cultural Assimilation ', ' Communities ', ' Latina ', ' Latinas ', ' Qualitative Research ', ' rapid growth ', ' Social Well-Being ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' racial/ethnic ', ' evidence base ', ' depression ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,F31,2009,1928,0.07087163453644434

"Mental Health Services in the Education Sector: Effectiveness and Systemic Impact    DESCRIPTION (provided by candidate): The majority of youth in need of mental health interventions do not receive any services (Kataoka et al., 2002). This problem is particularly notable among low socioeconomic (SES) and ethnic minority youth, who are most likely to experience mental health problems, least likely to receive services, and are consequently more likely to suffer the deleterious effects of mental health problems (US DHHS, 2001). School-based prevention and intervention programs represent one of the most promising opportunities for reducing identified service gaps and disparities among youth because of the nearly universal nature of primary and secondary education. As the most common point of entry into a fragmented mental health system, efforts to improve school-based services and understand their implications for future care carry profound implications for overall public health (Farmer et al., 2003). The current application is designed to provide training in the skills necessary to build a long-term program of research investigating the role of school-based programs in addressing the unmet mental health needs of diverse groups of youth. My overarching goal is to move toward an independent research career in which I will apply sophisticated research methodologies to the study and remediation of mental health gaps and disparities and apply the findings to the development of a service delivery model. To accomplish these goals, I will engage in an intensive training experience that will combine individual mentorship, coursework, and field experiences. This training will inform and shape the analyses of a set of research questions pertaining to mental health service utilization and form the basis for a Career Development grant application. The primary research component of this project will take advantage of a rich, existing data set from a school-based prevention program for adolescent depression, the High School Transition Study (HSTS; McCauley et al., 2008), to conduct analyses beyond the scope of the original study. The proposed project will allow me to build expertise in the analysis of school-related factors that influence program effectiveness and to gain knowledge about the assessment of program impact on mental health service utilization across service sectors (e.g., specialty mental health, primary care, education). Results will provide information about how school-based interventions fit into the overall service delivery system, and their potential for reducing disparities in access to services and youth outcomes. My specific research aims include using the ethnically and socioeconomically diverse HSTS sample to explore how students' school attachment and support mediate intervention outcome and to examine the impact of HSTS program participation on the mental health service utilization of different groups of youth.           ",Mental Health Services in the Education Sector: Effectiveness and Systemic Impact,7745703,F32MH086978,"['Effectiveness ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Address ', ' Health system ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Caring ', ' Effectiveness of Interventions ', ' Applications Grants ', ' Grant Proposals ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Principal Investigator ', ' socioeconomics ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomic ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio economic ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Future ', ' Affect ', ' base ', ' career ', ' Goals ', ' improved ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' healthcare service availability ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare access availability ', ' health services availability ', ' health care service availability ', ' health care service access ', ' health care availability ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Availability of Health Services ', ' Accessibility of health care ', ' Access to Healthcare ', ' Access to Health Care ', ' Access to Care ', ' Adolescent ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Rods (Retina) ', ' rod cell ', ' retinal rods ', ' Rods (Eye) ', ' Rod Photoreceptors ', ' Rod ', ' Ice ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' health care service utilization ', ' healthcare utilization ', ' healthcare service utilization ', ' health services utilization ', ' Health Care Utilization ', ' satisfaction ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health Services ', ' Mental Hygiene Services ', ' Mentorship ', ' Parents ', ' Perception ', ' Shapes ', ' Program Effectiveness ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' Nature ', ' Research ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' School Health Services ', ' School-Based Services ', ' Schools ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' medical specialties ', ' Specialty ', ' Students ', ' Time ', ' Severities ', ' System ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' Services ', ' experience ', ' high school ', ' intervention program ', ' skills ', ' Participant ', ' Prevention program ', ' Reporting ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', ' depressive symptoms ', ' depressive ', ' depression symptom ', ' Emotional Depression ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Mediating ', ' Research Methodology ', ' Research Methods ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' career development ', ' Youth ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' remediation ', ' Outcome ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' demographics ', ' depression ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,F32,2009,45218,0.15962993737421097
"Mentoring Institute for HIV and Mental Health Related Research of the University     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal aims to: establish a long-term mentoring program that will attract (6) junior faculty and graduate students from the academic programs or professional schools in PR into HIV and Mental Health Research. These are: the University of Puerto Rico (several Campuses and Centers), the Ponce School of Medicine (including the Clinical Psychology program) and the Universidad Central del Caribe School of Medicine; to encourage and facilitate the development of their career plans with the specific goal of HIV and Mental Health Research and the eventual application for NIH funding and to focus the research and educational activities on HIV and Health Disparities related to Mental Health as the overarching theme of the Institute. The need for collaborative research justifies targeting the development and diversification of the Mental Health and Drug Abuse HIV/AIDS research workforce as is the title of this PAR. The focus of this Institute will be in precisely the establishment of multi-institutional, multi-disciplinary and inter-disciplinary teams and collaborations. There is a need to create a culture of collaboration and this mentorship institute through its PI and key personnel will make sure that the process is ongoing.      The Institute's research-education mentoring program is based on a competency development model. Mentors are expected to offer their scholarly, analytic and unique expertise in order to enable, empower, and inspire the participants in the acquisition of the core and cross-cutting competencies. Six core areas of competencies have been identified as essential to pursue a systematic and integrated approach to research. These are conceptualization, research design, implementation, analysis, dissemination, and expansion.

"Evaluating Effectiveness of a Statewide Public Mental Health Re-entry Program    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   This application addresses broad Challenge Area (09) Health Disparities and specific Challenge Topic, 09-MH-101: Validating Models of Community Re-entry Programs for Prisoners with Mental Disorders. Abstract The purpose of this study is to combine existing administrative databases to evaluate the effectiveness of a statewide re-entry program for people with mental illness exiting corrections. The Massachusetts Department of Mental Health (DMH) Forensic Transition Team (FTT), a case management based re-entry program, has been in existence for over 10 years. Although there have been descriptive studies documenting favorable short-term outcomes, a rigorous scientific evaluation of the FTT program using matched controls has not been done. The goals of the proposed study are two-fold: (1) to evaluate the effectiveness of the FTT program in reducing recidivism, and (2) to assess whether the program's benefits are likely to outweigh the costs using a comparative economic analysis. The study design is retrospective with the comparative analysis based on a case-control framework. Individuals with serious mental illness who re-entered the community after incarceration but were not eligible for FTT program form the control group. The controls are matched based on propensity scores selected from demographic, mental health and criminal history variables. We will conduct both ""between"" and ""within"" group analysis of the FTT program to understand disparities in community re-entry outcomes. To accomplish the objectives of the study we will merge existing administrative data for the years 2007 - 2010 from state agencies with which FTT clients have significant contact. These agencies include the Department of Mental Health, Department of Correction, Hamden and Suffolk County Houses of Correction, Department of Public Health Bureau of Substance Abuse Services providing substance abuse services, and publicly available data from the Criminal Offender Record Information system, the state's official electronic arrest record repository. Major strengths and innovations of the proposed application are: (a) existing databases which can be harmonized to answer research questions; (b) evaluation of a unique state-wide re-entry program serving voluntary participants that has been in existence for over 10 years; and (c) the use of comparative economics. This application addresses the emerging public mental health crisis of truncated continuity of care for individuals with severe mental illness involved in the criminal justice system in general and exiting corrections in particular.

"Disentangling Disparities in Trauma and Mental Health Service Use    DESCRIPTION (provided by the applicant): Post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is associated with a wide range of negative long-term consequences, including problems with interpersonal relationships, higher rates of unhealthy behaviors, physical problems, and mortality (Tanielian & Jaycox, 2008). Although everyone is at some risk of exposure to traumatic events that precipitate PTSD, a burgeoning literature suggests there are significant disparities in PTSD risk, especially for racial-ethnic minorities (e.g., Pole et al., 2008) and women (e.g., Olff et al., 2007; Tolin & Foa, 2006). For example, Latinos are thought to be at both high risk of trauma and PTSD (Eisenman et al., 2008). Women have both a higher overall prevalence of PTSD (10.4% vs. 5.0%) and are much more likely to develop PTSD in response to particular traumas like physical assault (Kessler et al., 1995). Individuals with PTSD report more barriers to care than those without the disorder (Amaya- Jackson et al., 1999), and certain subgroups may experience more barriers than others (Boscarino et al., 2005; Jaycox et al., 2004). Despite the availability of effective treatments for PTSD (Foa et al., 2000; Ursano et al., 2004; VA/DoD 2004; NICE, 2005), including pharmacological treatment, psychotherapeutic treatment, and education and support services, many do not seek treatment or they substantially delay treatment seeking. Even when those with PTSD do receive care, it may be inadequate (Frueh et al., 2006; Wang, Lane et al., 2005). Yet, little is known about racial-ethnic and gender variation in trauma and mental health service use. This study seeks to 1) identify where needs are greatest by examining racial-ethnic and gender disparities in exposure to trauma and development of PTSD; 2) examine racial-ethnic and gender disparities in access to mental health care by exploring perceived barriers to mental health care for those with PTSD; and 3) describe mental health service utilization patterns among racial-ethnic and gender groups with PTSD. The study is guided by Ronald Andersen's (1995) Behavioral Model of Health Services Use and employs the Collaborative Psychiatric Epidemiology Surveys data. These data contain 20,013 diagnostic interviews, and 1,194 of those interviewed met criteria for PTSD at some point in their lives. This is the first national data with enough power to investigate cultural influences on mental health (Colpe et al., 2004), and no studies have yet been published that focus on PTSD in the combined data. Eliminating health disparities is a fundamental goal of public health research and one of the main focuses of Healthy People 2010. This research aims to alleviate racial-ethnic and gender disparities in posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) by exploring variation in trauma exposure and subsequent PTSD, barriers to mental health care, and differences in utilization of mental health services. Findings from this research will help alleviate disparities in PTSD by identifying populations with higher burdens, better targeting and improving the outcomes of prevention and intervention, preparing providers to better care for populations experiencing disparities, and suggesting implications for funding that addresses health disparities.            Project Narrative Eliminating health disparities is a fundamental goal of public health research and one of the main focuses of Healthy People 2010.

"Cultural Development of an Adolescent Mental Health Quality of Life Instrument    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Improving health related quality of life (HRQOL) is a major goal in the treatment of all chronic illnesses. In addition, there is growing consensus that assessment of quality of life is crucial to provide a complete picture of children's physical and mental health status. To our knowledge there are no HRQOL instruments specifically developed for adolescents with mental health problems. Therefore, the central goal of the proposed application is to develop, test, and validate an adolescent HRQOL instrument for mental health [AQOL-MH) in Spanish and English. This will provide a culturally valid outcome measure that will contribute to reduce mental health care disparities. This instrument will help mental health professionals focus on particular HRQOL domains during the diagnostic process; thereby assisting both patients and providers set, define and evaluate adequate treatment goals. This proposal presents a unique opportunity for a young faculty with extensive experience in behavioral sciences research, to advance her career and obtain independent funding. The ultimate objective of this proposal is to develop ah RO1 application to administer the AQOL-MH to representative clinical samples in order to target its usefulness in evaluating clinical effectiveness in treatment programs and interventions. The specific aims of this proposal are the following:      Aim 1: To develop themes that respond to the construct of quality of life as perceived by adolescents who are receiving services for mental health problems in Puerto Rican and Mexican American, as well as Anglo populations. The development will be achieved using a grounded theory approach with the use of focus groups and in-depth interviews of clinical samples of Latino and US non-Latino youth who are recruited to have one of four prevalent mental disorders; ADHD, Conduct Disorder, Generalized Anxiety, and Depression.      Aim 2: To test the psychometric properties of the measure developed in Aim 1 using clinical and nonclinical samples of youth from Puerto Rico and the US. Psychometric analyses will include assessments of internal structure, tests for differential item functioning across Latino and non-Latino as well as gender groups, and preliminary tests of construct validity.      Aim 3: Test the usefulness of the short-form AQOL-MH for tracking change during the course of service use in evidence based practice among youth with ADHD and Depression disorders in Puerto Rico. To achieve this aim we will recruit 60 youth who begin to receive treatment and we will obtain a baseline and two repeated assessments of HRQOL at six month intervals.          ",Cultural Development of an Adolescent Mental Health Quality of Life Instrument,7689199,SC1HD060888,"['Provider ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ', ' attention deficit hyperactive disorder ', ' Predominantly Hyperactive-Impulsive Type Hyperactivity Disorder ', ' Predominantly Hyperactive-Impulsive Type Attention-Deficit Disorder ', ' Hyperkinetic Syndrome ', ' Hyperactivity Disorder NOS ', ' ADHD ', ' AD/HD ', ' Major Depressive Disorder ', ' major depression ', ' Symptoms ', ' Conduct Disorder ', ' disorders of conduct ', ' disorder of conduct ', ' Caring ', ' Evidence based practice ', ' Data ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Exhibits ', ' Faculty ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Health Professional ', ' Healthcare professional ', ' Health Care Professional ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' career ', ' Goals ', ' improved ', ' Health ', ' Health Status ', ' Level of Health ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Adolescent ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Interview ', ' Evaluation ', ' disability ', ' Individual ', ' Measurement ', ' Funding ', ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health Services ', ' Mental Hygiene Services ', ' Mexican Americans ', ' Chicanos ', ' Chicanas ', ' Generalized Anxiety Disorder ', ' Persons ', ' Quality-of-Life Assessment ', ' Patients ', ' Psychometrics ', ' Puerto Rican ', ' Puerto Rico ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Anxiety ', ' instrument ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' recruit ', ' Research ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Schools ', ' Consensus ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Treatment Protocols ', ' Treatment Schedule ', ' Treatment Regimen ', ' Asthma ', ' Bronchial Asthma ', ' Hyperactive behavior ', ' Motor Hyperactivity ', ' Hyperkinetic Movements ', ' Hyperkinesis ', ' Hyperkinesia ', ' Hyperactivity ', ' Work ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' Mental disorders ', ' psychological disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Behavioral Sciences ', ' Services ', ' experience ', ' Structure ', ' treatment program ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Categories ', ' Friends ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Generic Drugs ', ' generic ', ' Nonproprietary Drugs ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Latino ', ' Outcome Measure ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' chronic disorder ', ' chronic disease/disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Adolescent Development ', ' Treatment Effectiveness ', ' Property ', ' LOINC Axis 2 Property ', ' Youth ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' theories ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' health related quality of life ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Clinical effectiveness ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' depression ', ' ']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF PUERTO RICO MED SCIENCES,SC1,2009,225000,0.056756824954850266

Based on the CBPR principle, we will maintain: (a) mutual respect and trust; (b) team-work and equitable participation; (c) co- learning and collective capacity-building; (d) power-sharing and co-ownership of research; (e) a community- oriented bottom-up approach (rather than a top/university-down approach); (f) the integration and synthesis of expertise and resources of CBPR team members; (g) the sustainable development of partnership; (h) a trans- disciplinary and cross-domain approach that overrides the academic-community-practice boundaries; and (i) collective empowerment and proactive actions toward social change. This partnership, along with our Advisory Council including other stakeholders (e.g., culture and mental health advocates), will guide our team to conduct mixed-method studies. First, we will conduct a pilot survey study with CDGPMI (n = 112) to collect preliminary baseline data on the association of leisure behavior (as a context for active living) with recovery, health, and life quality. Then, we will conduct an in-depth multiple case study, using periodical interviews and photovoice with African, Hispanic, Asian, and Caucasian Americans with mental illness (n = 40) who are purposefully chosen based on the survey study findings. This case study will give voices to those individuals about recovery-oriented health and life-quality promotion through active living (with emphasis on actively engaged leisure) from a holistic and ecological perspective, by recognizing cultural, environmental, and mental health care factors, as well as secondary conditions (e.g., social isolation, obesity). Interviews with primary support/care-givers for these individuals will also be conducted to gain additional outsider perspectives. The case-study findings will guide us to develop a CBPR-informed and evidence-based conceptual framework that identifies key personal, social, cultural, and environmental (including mental health care systems) pathways through which active living mediates the processes toward recovery and the promotion of health and life quality for CDGPMI (particularly, through enjoyable and meaningful leisure behavior). This R21 project will lead to our R01 to develop and test/evaluate a recovery-focused active-living and health/life-quality-promotion intervention program for CDGPMI. Our overall research program is relevant to the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH)'s mission to reduce the burden of mental illness through improving health behaviors and daily functioning of persons with mental disorders (with emphasis on active living and its role in promoting recovery, health, and life quality), and deliver more effective personalized mental health care across diverse populations. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: A major contribution of this research is that the project will generate rich and in-depth data/evidence from a culturally diverse sample of urban-dwelling individuals with mental illness based on their lived experiences and perspectives to better conceptualize the roles of active living (particularly, active leisure involvements) in the processes toward their recovery and the promotion of health and life quality. This new data/evidence will extend and advance the existing knowledge in the literature about recovery and health/life-quality promotion among individuals with mental illness by better articulating the mediating roles of active living in the pathways toward recovery-oriented health/life-quality promotion. Importantly, our overall research program links and integrates the domain of recovery and mental health/illness research with the domain of active living and health/life-quality promotion research conceptually, methodologically, and practically. The knowledge/evidence generated from our research will be translated to person-centered, holistic, and strengths-based mental health care practices in communities through the form of a recovery-focused active-living, health-promotion, and life- quality-enhancement intervention program.              Project Narrative A major contribution of this research is that the project will generate rich and in-depth data/evidence from a culturally diverse sample of urban-dwelling individuals with mental illness based on their lived experiences and perspectives to better conceptualize the roles of active living (particularly, active leisure involvements) in the processes toward their recovery and the promotion of health and life quality.

"Mental health disparities in low-income populations    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): People living in low-socioeconomic (SES) circumstances are at increased risk for a number of detrimental physical and mental health outcomes, including depression (e.g., Lorant et al., 2003). Although numerous studies confirm the link between SES and depressive symptoms, the mechanisms underlying this association are not clear. What are the factors that explain the disparity in mental health outcomes across levels of SES? The long-term goal of the current research is to address this question. In addition to lacking material resources, low-SES individuals are also more likely to be lacking interpersonal resources compared to more affluent individuals: low-income individuals are less likely to be married, more likely to be in distressed relationships, and less likely to have social support resources (e.g., Conger et al., 1990; White & Rogers, 2000). The current research proposes that this lack of interpersonal resources can help to explain the association between SES and depressive symptoms. Using a large random probability survey dataset (N = 6,012) that oversampled for low-SES individuals and racial/ethnic minorities, the current application will test a mediation model that will help shed light on mental health disparities. The first aim of this research is to explore the mechanisms underlying the association between SES and depressive symptoms, by examining interpersonal factors as potential mediators of this association. As part of this goal, I will examine if interpersonal resources are especially important buffering factors for individuals who are lacking in material resources. The second aim of this research is to evaluate the relative importance of each interpersonal factor (e.g., would it be more helpful to target the amount of social support available to low-SES individuals or promote relationship skills?). The third aim is to examine if the proposed model differs by race/ethnicity. The findings from this research have important public health implications. The proposed model suggests that programs that strengthen low-SES individuals' interpersonal resources (e.g., relationship satisfaction, social support resources) would be a promising avenue for future public health interventions. The proposed research will also provide much-needed data to inform current policies that target interpersonal factors in low-SES populations (e.g., the Healthy Marriage Initiative, 2005). By addressing interpersonal resources in a diverse sample, this study will inform policy-makers seeking alternative routes to promote mental health and reduce depression in disadvantaged communities.          ",Mental health disparities in low-income populations,7658762,F31MH084381,"['health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Drug abuse ', ' abuses drugs ', ' abuse of drugs ', ' low socioeconomic status ', ' low socioeconomic position ', ' low socio-economic status ', ' low socio-economic position ', ' Low income ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Address ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Social Network ', ' Jail ', ' Data ', ' socioeconomics ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomic ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio economic ', ' Family ', ' Spouses ', ' Married Persons ', ' Florida ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Future ', ' base ', ' Goals ', ' psychologic ', ' psychological ', ' Link ', ' Income ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Distress ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Individual ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' Low Income Population ', ' Policy Maker ', ' satisfaction ', ' Policies ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Marriage ', ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' Names ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Respondent ', ' Population Policies ', ' Poverty ', ' Probability ', ' Probability Samples ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Sampling Studies ', ' Social support ', ' social support network ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Stress ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Source ', ' Route ', ' interest ', ' Services ', ' experience ', ' stressor ', ' intervention program ', ' Buffers ', ' Structure ', ' skills ', ' Mediation ', ' Negotiation ', ' Negotiating ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' Substance abuse problem ', ' substance abuse ', ' abuse of substances ', ' Censuses ', ' Friends ', ' Relative (related person) ', ' Relative ', ' Code ', ' Coding System ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' depressive symptoms ', ' depressive ', ' depression symptom ', ' Emotional Depression ', ' Hispanics ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Modeling ', ' social stress ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Communities ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' high risk ', ' loved ones ', ' depression ', ' depressed ', ' policy implication ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,F31,2009,30515,0.02663172199321028
"The Collaborative Center for Trauma and Mental Health Disparities We propose to establish a five-year, multi-ethnic and multi-disciplinary ""Collaborative Center for Trauma and Mental Health"" (CCTMHD) to promote interdisciplinary research examining the prevalence and impact of traumatic experiences on PTSD, depression and concomitant cognitive/emotional, behavioral, psychological and biological processes in ethnic minority populations. The overarching aim is to inform new strategies to reduce mental health disparities associated with trauma exposure. Multiple sources of acute and chronic stress combine to have a cumulative effect in the lives of ethnic minorities, giving rise to our use of the conceptual framework of allostatic load to (1) describe the socio-cultural context in which violence occurs; (2) examine cultural differences in the appraisal of traumatic events; (3) identify protective and vulnerability factors within ethnic groups; and (4) characterize the expression of mental health symptoms and help-seeking that contribute to mental health disparities. The Center, led by Dr. Gail Wyatt in collaboration with an experienced team of minority mental health researchers includes an Administrative Core, which will coordinate and integrate all Center activities including mentoring of investigators and a Methods & Statistics Core, which will be responsible for providing methodological support to all Center investigators and projects. Project 1 is a 4-year, longitudinal study, ""Intimate Partner Violence and Mental Health Outcomes among Latinas"", led by Dr. M. Rodriguez. He will investigate the longitudinal course of PTSD and depression, attachment and related biological sequelae in an existing cohort of 205 Latina mothers, who vary on intimate partner violence histories. Project 2, ""Disclosure & Appraisal of Child Sexual Abuse (CSA): Relationships with PTSD, Depression, & Associated Biomarkers"" is led by Drs. J. Vargas-Carmona and T. Loeb. This 2-year pilot study focuses on the impact of CSA disclosure and self-blame among 110 Black and Latina women with CSA histories. Project 3, a 2-year pilot study, ""Coping among Ethnic Men Sexually Abused as Children"", is led by Dr. F. Galvan. He will recruit 150 Latino and Black men to examine ethnic differences in coping strategies and their role as possible moderators or mediators of psychological distress, biological effects of childhood sexual trauma and mental health service utilization. This Center will stimulate state-of-the-art research on trauma and mental health disparities, and inform the development of future interventions to close these gaps.

"Addressing Mental Health Services Disparities for Ethnically Diverse Children    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   The proposed study is in response to a Program Announcement entitled, Elimination of Health Disparities through Translation Research (R18). The purpose of the study is to adapt evidence-based interventions for use in urban schools with large numbers of low-income Latino students. The interventions will be delivered within a family-centered system for the delivery of mental health services for children that has the potential to be self- sustaining over time. The interventions, which are based on SW-PBS methodology, would address a range of behavioral disorders and concomitant peer difficulties experienced by children at school and at home. The study will take place in two public schools (K through 5th and K through 8th) in an urban area with high concentrations of low-income Latino families. Data will be collected simultaneously on three ongoing aspects of the project: (a) Development of a data collection system; (b) Improvement of key school systems; (c) Protocol modification and implementation. The proposed study is designed to reach all children attending the participating schools. Aims of the study are: (1) To develop a data collection system for SW-PBS that is useful, efficient, and acceptable; (2) To build the capacity of the school system to support the implementation of SW-PBS; (3) To identify components of SW-PBS primary and secondary tier interventions that need adaptation; (4) To determine the feasibility of implementing SW-PBS interventions in two under-resourced schools; (5) To assess acceptability of Tier 1 and Tier 2 interventions (uptake); and (6) To estimate the health outcome associated with the implementation of the SW-PBS package. Evidence-based intervention packages will be identified and modified based on focus groups, follow-up interviews and brief surveys with 93 parents and 60 teachers. Tier 1 interventions will be implemented first on 1,027 students. Children who do not respond to Tier 1 interventions will be assigned to one or more interventions for Tier 2 or they will be assessed and referred for treatment in the community. It is expected that 154 children will receive Tier 2 interventions in the school and that 63 parents of children in Tier 2 will receive parental skills training at a community center. The proposed study is the result of a partnership between researchers, experts in school-wide positive behavior support (SW-PBS), teaching staff, school administrators, parents/caregivers and community mental health workers. The study addresses a specific goal of Healthy People 2010--reducing or eliminating mental health services disparities among ethnically diverse children. The study may contribute to the development of an efficient and effective system for the delivery of mental health services to low-income, inner-city children and families. Data obtained for this study may contribute to a better understanding of factors that facilitate the adaptation and implementation of evidence-based interventions in under-resourced urban schools. The adapted evidence-based interventions described in this proposal are likely to contribute to a reduction in mental health services disparities among urban ethnically-diverse children. The proposal may also increase research interest in the effectiveness of school-wide positive behavior support (SW-PBS) interventions in under-resourced urban schools.     The adapted evidence-based interventions described in this proposal are likely to contribute to a reduction in mental health services disparities among urban ethnically-diverse children.

"MHREG for Research in Ethnically Diverse Communities    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): As the nation becomes more racially and ethnically diverse, novel approaches to research and research education are needed to decrease the burden of mental illness. Mood disorders are a leading cause of disability and a powerful contributor to mortality, including deaths by suicide. Treatments for mood disorders among Blacks and Latinos require innovative research models responsive to economic disparities, culturally- mediated preferences and expectations of treatment, and the co-morbidities that disproportionately affect people of color such as substance misuse and medical illness. Meeting this scientific and public health challenge requires innovation in the education of clinical scientists. New collaborations involving university and community partners must be developed, given the central roles that community agencies play in the lives of the emerging majority, and the understandable reluctance of many ethnic minorities to seek treatment in the existing specialized mental health care delivery system. The Rochester Program of Research and Innovation in Disparities Education (Rochester PRIDE) is a novel training program designed to inspire and prepare trainees to conduct mental health research in partnership with community agencies. Over the next five years, we will 1) enhance our established research training partnerships with community agencies in a manner that facilitates trainee research, 2) recruit and educate at least 25 trainees from psychology and medicine in a core didactic curriculum that features a new, multidisciplinary seminar titled ""Race, Socioeconomic Status and Health in the Urban Setting"", 3) implement an innovative collaborative mentoring- precepting program that teaches trainees how to develop and implement research in community settings, 4) evaluate PRIDE by monitoring trainee outcomes and by soliciting and reviewing feedback from an external Evaluator, and 5) disseminate our findings by convening symposia and publishing peer-reviewed articles describing program design, implementation, and outcomes. This multidisciplinary research education program will be highly attractive to trainees who seek to gain skills and knowledge to conduct research in real-world settings. Rochester PRIDE will also serve as a model for other mental health training and educational programs designed to meet the nation's changing public health needs. By the end of the Award period, we will have sufficient experience and data to disseminate the program's findings and expand its scope by adding trainees interested in research on children and adolescents. As well, we will consider adding trainees at other developmental levels or from other disciplines.           ",MHREG for Research in Ethnically Diverse Communities,7885268,R25MH074898,"['Outcome ', ' Community Integration ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' community based participatory research ', ' health training ', ' clinical care ', ' community setting ', ' Educational Curriculum ', ' Curriculum ', ' health care delivery ', ' health services delivery ', ' Healthcare Delivery ', ' Health Sciences, Allied and Health Services Delivery ', ' Discrimination (Psychology) ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Legal ', ' Economics ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Elements ', ' Environment ', ' Address ', ' Ethics ', ' ethical ', ' Data ', ' Research Training ', ' Monitor ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Faculty ', ' Family Practice ', ' family medicine ', ' Feedback ', ' Foundations ', ' Affect ', ' Africa ', ' base ', ' career ', ' Hand ', ' Health ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Site ', ' Solid ', ' Clinical ', ' Biological ', ' Medical ', ' Adolescent ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' racism ', ' Caribbean region ', ' West Indies Region ', ' Caribbean Sea Region ', ' Caribbean ', ' Publishing Peer Reviews ', ' Training ', ' disability ', ' Latin America ', ' Learning ', ' web site ', ' website ', ' Discipline ', ' health care service utilization ', ' healthcare utilization ', ' healthcare service utilization ', ' health services utilization ', ' Health Care Utilization ', ' African ', ' Educational workshop ', ' Workshop ', ' Interdisciplinary Study ', ' Multidisciplinary Research ', ' Multidisciplinary Collaboration ', ' Interdisciplinary Research ', ' Battered Women ', ' abuse of women ', ' abuse of females ', ' Abused women ', ' Abused females ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Medicine ', ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health Services ', ' Mental Hygiene Services ', ' Mentors ', ' Mission ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Mortality ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' Epidemiologic Studies ', ' epidemiologic investigation ', ' Epidemiology Research ', ' Epidemiological Studies ', ' Epidemiologic Research ', ' Collaborations ', ' Immigrant ', ' Press Releases ', ' Nuts ', ' Physicians ', ' Play ', ' Poverty ', ' Preventive Medicine ', ' preventative medicine ', ' Psychiatry ', ' Psychologist ', ' Psychology ', ' Clinical Psychology ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' recruit ', ' Nature ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Rest ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Social support ', ' social support network ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Medical Students ', ' Educational process of instructing ', ' Teaching ', ' Scientist ', ' Training Programs ', ' Travel ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' Voice ', ' Work ', ' Automobile Driving ', ' driving ', ' Award ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' Mental disorders ', ' psychological disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Mood Disorders ', ' Affective Disorders ', ' psychosocial ', ' interest ', ' meetings ', ' Postdoctoral Fellow ', ' post-doctoral ', ' post-doc ', ' Research Associate ', ' Postdoc ', ' preference ', ' experience ', ' care delivery ', ' knowledge base ', ' knowledgebase ', ' skills ', ' expectation ', ' novel ', ' Prevention strategy ', ' Preventive strategy ', ' research study ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' Relative (related person) ', ' Relative ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Police ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' symposium ', ' conference ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Latino ', ' Mediating ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' diverse populations ', ' Research Methodology ', ' Research Methods ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Modeling ', ' Cities ', ' Color ', ' Communities ', ' Comorbidity ', ' co-morbidity ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Minority ', ' suicidal morbidity ', ' suicide morbidity ', ' suicide death ', ' novel strategies ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel approaches ', ' new approaches ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF ROCHESTER,R25,2010,216112,0.029837204674584044
"Center for Mental Health Services in Pediatric Primary Care    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Mission: The center seeks sustainable ways to increase primary care providers' capacity to improve function, reduce distress, and prevent disability among children with mental health problems. Background: The mental health issues treated in pediatric primary care are characterized by high prevalence and a preponderance of children with impairment but without a diagnosis. Parent distress frequently complicates children's mental health problems and requires simultaneous attention. The ability to engage families around their needs promotes access to treatment and contributes to reducing ethnic (disparities. Goal and specific aims: The Center will develop an evidence-based model for mental health in primary care that 1) applies to the range of problems seen in primary care, 2) engages existing skills and knowledge of families and pediatric providers, and 3) results in sustainable increases in the mental health treatment capacity of primary care. Its specific aims are to: 1) adapt Wagner's Chronic Care Model (CCM) of primary care mental health service to include treatment based on ""common factors"" and ""common treatment elements.""; la) within the CCM's 5 domains, address priority research needs related to the impact of common factors and their implementation in office practice; lb) develop packages of practical interventions, built around domains of the adapted CCM, for larger scale trials in pediatric primary care; 2) develop measurements, study designs and analytic methods to efficiently assess outcomes in community settings; and 3) stimulate innovation in pediatric mental health services through multidisciplinary and community-academic collaboration, attracting new and diverse scholars and providing a resource for scientists, policy makers, and advocates. Methods: The Center's faculty is a team of pediatricians, psychologists, psychiatrists, and other scholars from six institutions that include rural, suburban, and urban settings. Their work is informed by ties to the American Academy of Pediatrics' Task Force on Mental Health and leaders in state mental health policy. Guidance and focus come from a community advisory committee and a national scientific advisory board. Research Methods Core studies address priority questions about the evidence base for common factors, the burden of mental health care, and feasible clinical data systems. Principal Research Core studies test complementary common factors approaches for children with anxiety problems. The Operations Core promotes recruiting underrepresented trainees, meaningful community interaction, quality control, and innovative study design.             The Center's work develops a model of mental health prevention and treatment that can be practically implemented in pediatric primary care.

"Social Inequality and Children's Mental Health    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The social gradient in children's mental health is well documented. What is less clear is how social inequalities influence children's development. We propose to examine this question at three levels of analysis. At the neighborhood level, we will assess ecometric properties of the local areas in which children reside and test whether neighborhood-level social processes, such as collective efficacy, mediate the effects of neighborhood poverty on children's mental health. At the family level, we will trace the effects of socioeconomic deprivation on proximal family processes (exposure to violence, food insecurity) and test how stressful early life events may become biologically embedded. At the individual level, we will use a genetically-informative longitudinal design to test the hypothesis that children's perceptions of their social position can help to explain why some children growing up in poverty do versus do not develop health problems. METHOD: We will conduct this research using data from the Environmental Risk (E-Risk) Study. E-Risk is a longitudinal study (from birth to age 12) of a nationally-representative sample of twins born in England and Wales in 1994-1995 (N=2232), selected from a registry created with the UK Office of National Statistics (ONS). We have tracked the children over the first 12 years of their lives, monitoring their development and their environmental exposures, including multiple forms of social inequality. We have gathered data about the children and their families at 6 time points (birth, ages 2, 5, 7, 10, and 12 years). We have also conducted two independent ecometric assessments of the neighborhoods in which the children are growing up, enabling us to study inequalities in children's lives at both the community and family level. INNOVATION AND SIGNIFICANCE: The proposed research has implications both for understanding and reducing health inequalities. At each level of analysis, we adopt a process approach to test how social inequalities influence children's development. At the neighborhood level, we will identify malleable factors for community-level interventions which may be more cost effective and pragmatic than individual-level interventions. At the family level, we will test the direct and indirect contributions of family socio-economic conditions to children's development and identify specific intervention targets for reducing social inequalities in children's mental health. At the individual level, if we discover environmentally-mediated effects between children's subjective social status and their health, the implications would point to children's perceptions of social status as malleable intervention targets and open up a realm of intervention possibilities for empowering children. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: About half of the population variation in children's mental health problems is accounted for by environmental factors, and social inequalities stand out as the most prominent determinants of health in the first decade of life. However, the hope of preventing early- emerging mental health problems requires research to identify the underlying mechanisms by which inequalities affect health. Our proposed research tests how social inequalities affect children's health, aiming to identify malleable intervention targets at the community, family, and individual levels.           Narrative About half of the population variation in children's mental health problems is accounted for by environmental factors, and social inequalities stand out as the most prominent determinants of health in the first decade of life.

"Improving Mental Health Services for Low-Income Latinos in Primary Care IMPROVING MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES FOR LOW-INCOME LATINOS IN PRIMARY CARE  Building community capacity to deliver accessible mental health services to Latino Immigrants is much needed.  Latinos in the US are less likely to utilize mental health services than non-Latino Whites, and they are less likely to receive guideline-concordant care, with disparities increasing.  The Community Academic Partnership for Mental Health (CAP-MH) seeks to address these concerns by strengthening an existing partnership between the Center for Trauma and the Community (CTC) in the Psychiatry Department at Georgetown Medical School, and the Primary Care Coalition (PCC) of Montgomery County, to support the timely development and evaluation of culturally competent, trauma-sensitive, and innovative interventions to improve patient mental health.  A major goal of this project is to integrate clinical research into the clinical care process at the community clinic level.  Thus, PCC¿s electronic medical record (EMR) will be improved by upgrading the mental health section, including the addition of custom data elements required for specific research protocol interventions, and essential functionalities, including improved data summary functions. Once the EMR has been upgraded, a naturalistic evaluation of the Montgomery Cares Behavioral Health Program (MCBHP) will be conducted, comparing clinics with and without the program.  The study aims include, 1) To evaluate the extent of implementation of the ongoing MCBHP via examination of MCBHP-related process parameters, including extent of guideline-concordant care provision; 2) To evaluate the effectiveness of the MCBHP on mental health outcomes (depression, anxiety); and, 3) among the subset of patients with comorbid chronic health conditions (diabetes, hypertension, obesity), to evaluate the effectiveness of the MCBHP on mental health, health behaviors, and health-related outcomes. Background support work will include interviews and focus groups with providers and other staff, whose input will be used to help design flexible aspects of the EMR and the study. This partnership will begin to serve as a laboratory for community-informed intervention development to improve services, and ultimately the health, of a large underserved minority population. Narrative (for the lay public) Latino populations have difficulty accessing culturally sensitive mental health services.  The proposed project will address these disparities by building the community¿s capacity to develop and study mental health services for the Latino community in a primary care service provider organization in Montgomery County, MD. A study of a clinical program that is already delivering mental health services in the community will be evaluated, with clinicians and staff providing input to help us design the study.

"Prevention of marital distress in low-income couples transitioning to parenthood    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Recent research has shown that the quality of marital relationships is inextricably linked to physical and mental health of the individuals in the relationship. Included in the wide-ranging negative health outcomes associated with marital distress, individuals in distressed marriages are at greater risk for mortality relative to spouses in non-distressed marriages (Robles & Kiecolt-Glaser, 2003). The impacts of marital distress do not end with the spouses in the marriage; children of distressed couples who are exposed to characteristically high levels of conflict suffer negative mental and physical health consequences, such as externalizing and internalizing problems, depression, anxiety, and physical problems (El-Sheikh, Hargar, & Whitson, 2001). Recent government initiatives take into account the importance of the marital relationship on children; the Healthy Marriage Initiative (2005) defined a healthy marriage as ""a mutually satisfying relationship that is beneficial to the husband, wife, and children."" The proposed prevention study seeks to intervene with couples during the transition to parenthood, a major life transition when marital satisfaction typically declines (Gottman & Notarius, 2002). A number of programs have been developed to prevent relationship and individual distress, but thus far no studies have examined effects of such programs in low-income couples. Given that low-income couples are at greater risk for a host of intra- and interpersonal problems, and often have unique circumstances and stressors that are not addressed in existing prevention programs (Karney & Bradbury, 2005), this proposal is timely. This study will examine the immediate and longitudinal effectiveness of a brief, cost-effective, preventive intervention designed for low-income couples during the transition to parenthood. Comparing Integrative Behavioral Couple Therapy (Jacobson & Christensen, 1998), an empirically supported treatment for couples, to treatment as usual in obstetrics clinics at a county hospital, this research will examine effects of the intervention on birth and infant health outcomes, as well as individual and relationship distress of the parents in a small sample of couples (N = 40 couples total). This study has important implications for public health. Given policy-makers' aims to support low-income couples in maintaining healthy marriages, it is imperative that interventions be implemented and researched in low-income communities. This study has the potential to inform future interventions and policies that affect low-income couples in particular, thereby improving the health and well-being of both partners and their families. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: My research, coursework, and clinical experiences in psychology have helped me to determine my long-term goal of teaching and conducting clinical research in academia. My training goals for this fellowship are outlined below: 1) My first goal is to gain additional knowledge about cultural factors and mental health in low-income Latino families. I will audit a course in the School of Medicine, ""Hispanic Mental Health Issues and Treatment"" (Psychiatry M231, Prof. Morales), that will increase my knowledge of factors that are particularly important in clinical work with Spanish-speaking couples. Another course I will audit to gain knowledge about mental health disparities is ""Health and Mental Health Disparities from a Psychosocial and Cultural Perspective"" (Psychiatry 264, Prof. Williams). These two courses will give me a better understanding of the population I will work with at Harbor-UCLA and specific contextual factors to focus on in the intervention groups. Furthermore, weekly meetings with Dr. Reina-Patton will help me to apply the knowledge to the population in the intervention at Harbor.             ",Prevention of marital distress in low-income couples transitioning to parenthood,8080807,F31HD062168,"['medical schools ', ' school of medicine ', ' medical college ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Stress ', ' Educational process of instructing ', ' Teaching ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Clinic ', ' physical conditioning ', ' physical health ', ' psychosocial ', ' contextual factors ', ' Application Context ', ' meetings ', ' Birth Weight ', ' Birth ', ' Parturition ', ' experience ', ' stressor ', ' Participant ', ' Prevention program ', ' Prevention ', ' Reporting ', ' Measures ', ' Relative (related person) ', ' Relative ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child health care ', ' Child Health ', ' depressive symptoms ', ' depressive ', ' depression symptom ', ' Emotional Depression ', ' Hispanics ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Latino ', ' Sampling ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Couples ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Effectiveness ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Low income ', ' Address ', ' Academia ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' follow-up ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' Behavioral ', ' Family ', ' Fellowship ', ' Spouses ', ' Married Persons ', ' Future ', ' Affect ', ' Gestational Age ', ' Fetal Age ', ' Chronologic Fetal Maturity ', ' base ', ' Goals ', ' Government ', ' improved ', ' Health ', ' County Hospitals ', ' Clinical ', ' psychologic ', ' psychological ', ' Infant Health ', ' Link ', ' Infant ', ' Newborn Infant ', ' newborn human (0-6 weeks) ', ' Newborns ', ' 0-6 weeks old ', ' Training ', ' Psyche structure ', ' mental ', ' Distress ', ' Individual ', ' Low Income Population ', ' Policy Maker ', ' satisfaction ', ' Policies ', ' Husband ', ' Wife ', ' Marital Relationships ', ' Marriage ', ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Mortality ', ' Discipline of obstetrics ', ' Obstetrics ', ' Couples Therapy ', ' Parents ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' well-being ', ' Pregnancy ', ' Gestation ', ' Psychiatry ', ' Psychology ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' Anxiety ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Accounting ', ' Communities ', ' cost ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' therapy design ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' public health relevance ', ' group intervention ', ' treatment as usual ', ' usual care ', ' intervention effect ', ' Conflict (Psychology) ', ' Conflict ', ' ']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,F31,2010,31444,0.07062628353791188
"Cultural Development of an Adolescent Mental Health Quality of Life Instrument    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Improving health related quality of life (HRQOL) is a major goal in the treatment of all chronic illnesses. In addition, there is growing consensus that assessment of quality of life is crucial to provide a complete picture of children's physical and mental health status. To our knowledge there are no HRQOL instruments specifically developed for adolescents with mental health problems. Therefore, the central goal of the proposed application is to develop, test, and validate an adolescent HRQOL instrument for mental health [AQOL-MH) in Spanish and English. This will provide a culturally valid outcome measure that will contribute to reduce mental health care disparities. This instrument will help mental health professionals focus on particular HRQOL domains during the diagnostic process; thereby assisting both patients and providers set, define and evaluate adequate treatment goals. This proposal presents a unique opportunity for a young faculty with extensive experience in behavioral sciences research, to advance her career and obtain independent funding. The ultimate objective of this proposal is to develop ah RO1 application to administer the AQOL-MH to representative clinical samples in order to target its usefulness in evaluating clinical effectiveness in treatment programs and interventions. The specific aims of this proposal are the following:      Aim 1: To develop themes that respond to the construct of quality of life as perceived by adolescents who are receiving services for mental health problems in Puerto Rican and Mexican American, as well as Anglo populations. The development will be achieved using a grounded theory approach with the use of focus groups and in-depth interviews of clinical samples of Latino and US non-Latino youth who are recruited to have one of four prevalent mental disorders; ADHD, Conduct Disorder, Generalized Anxiety, and Depression.      Aim 2: To test the psychometric properties of the measure developed in Aim 1 using clinical and nonclinical samples of youth from Puerto Rico and the US. Psychometric analyses will include assessments of internal structure, tests for differential item functioning across Latino and non-Latino as well as gender groups, and preliminary tests of construct validity.      Aim 3: Test the usefulness of the short-form AQOL-MH for tracking change during the course of service use in evidence based practice among youth with ADHD and Depression disorders in Puerto Rico. To achieve this aim we will recruit 60 youth who begin to receive treatment and we will obtain a baseline and two repeated assessments of HRQOL at six month intervals.          ",Cultural Development of an Adolescent Mental Health Quality of Life Instrument,7932169,SC1HD060888,"['Symptoms ', ' Conduct Disorder ', ' disorders of conduct ', ' disorder of conduct ', ' Caring ', ' Evidence based practice ', ' Data ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Exhibits ', ' Faculty ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Health Professional ', ' Healthcare professional ', ' Health Care Professional ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' career ', ' Goals ', ' improved ', ' Health ', ' Health Status ', ' Level of Health ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Adolescent ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Interview ', ' Evaluation ', ' disability ', ' Individual ', ' Measurement ', ' Funding ', ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health Services ', ' Mental Hygiene Services ', ' Mexican Americans ', ' Chicanos ', ' Chicanas ', ' Generalized Anxiety Disorder ', ' Persons ', ' Quality-of-Life Assessment ', ' Patients ', ' Psychometrics ', ' Puerto Rican ', ' Puerto Rico ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Anxiety ', ' instrument ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' recruit ', ' Research ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Schools ', ' Consensus ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Treatment Protocols ', ' Treatment Schedule ', ' Treatment Regimen ', ' Asthma ', ' Bronchial Asthma ', ' Hyperactive behavior ', ' Motor Hyperactivity ', ' Hyperkinetic Movements ', ' Hyperkinesis ', ' Hyperkinesia ', ' Hyperactivity ', ' Work ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' Mental disorders ', ' psychological disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Behavioral Sciences ', ' Services ', ' experience ', ' Structure ', ' treatment program ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Categories ', ' Friends ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Generic Drugs ', ' generic ', ' Nonproprietary Drugs ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Latino ', ' Outcome Measure ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' chronic disorder ', ' chronic disease/disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Adolescent Development ', ' Treatment Effectiveness ', ' Property ', ' LOINC Axis 2 Property ', ' Youth ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' theories ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' health related quality of life ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Clinical effectiveness ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' Provider ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ', ' attention deficit hyperactive disorder ', ' Predominantly Hyperactive-Impulsive Type Hyperactivity Disorder ', ' Predominantly Hyperactive-Impulsive Type Attention-Deficit Disorder ', ' Hyperkinetic Syndrome ', ' Hyperactivity Disorder NOS ', ' ADHD ', ' AD/HD ', ' Major Depressive Disorder ', ' major depression ', ' ']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF PUERTO RICO MED SCIENCES,SC1,2010,222750,0.056756824954850266
"Behavioral Health Screening in the Medical Home: Enhancing Cultural Competence    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Universal behavioral health screening in the pediatric medical home has the potential to reduce racial and ethnic mental health disparities as standardized tools can systematically identify all children with elevated problem behaviors and referrals can be made. Even when referrals are made, however, mental health services tend to be underutilized, particularly by racial and ethnic minority families and families raising very young children. Therefore, the first aim of the proposed research is to explore, within the context of the medical home, predictors of family follow-up with an on-site behavioral health consultant upon referral. Several factors, including child and family characteristics, parental depression, and parental worry about child behavior, will be explored as predictors (N=2000 parents of children under the age of 5 years). At least part of the disconnect between screening and referral practices and engagement in services may stem from cultural and linguistic barriers between providers and families. Thus, the second aim of the proposed research is to develop and evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness of a cultural competency intervention module to improve pediatric provider use of and comfort with behavioral health screening across racial and ethnic minorities. An intervention module that targets cultural and linguistic barriers to behavioral health screening will be developed and presented to providers in several primary care pediatric sites following a brief screening compliance training. While focusing on broadly defined cultural and linguistic competency, the training will emphasize issues relevant to working with Hispanic families given their growing population and documented disparities in preventive screening, referrals, and mental health care. Extant training programs will be adapted based on individual interviews and focus groups with pediatric providers and parents. It is hypothesized that pediatric provider training will result in improvements in screening completion rates across ethnically and racially diverse families, as well as providers' self- reported knowledge, beliefs, and attitudes toward screening and referral practices with racial and ethnic minorities.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The proposed research will contribute to (a) a better understanding of universal behavioral health screening practices within the pediatric medical home; and (b) ways of ensuring that screening practices serve their intended purpose of linking families, particularly underserved racial and ethnic minority families, with needed services. This research will help to elucidate barriers to behavioral health screening and referral practices within the pediatric medical home and explore avenues for improving these practices and reducing racial and ethnic disparities in mental health care.           ",Behavioral Health Screening in the Medical Home: Enhancing Cultural Competence,7811241,F31HD063344,"['Provider ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Roter ', ' Caring ', ' Effectiveness of Interventions ', ' Characteristics ', ' sex ', ' follow-up ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' Family ', ' Family Characteristics ', ' Federal Government ', ' National Government ', ' Guidelines ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Freedom ', ' Liberty ', ' Age ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Health Services ', ' health care service ', ' minority health ', ' Huntington Disease ', ' Progressive Chorea, Hereditary, Chronic (Huntington) ', ' Huntingtons Disease ', "" Huntington's Disease Pathway "", "" Huntington's Disease "", "" Huntington's "", ' Huntington Chorea ', ' Site ', ' Medical ', ' Link ', ' Ensure ', ' Interview ', ' Screening procedure ', ' screenings ', ' screening ', ' Training ', ' Language ', ' Childhood ', ' pediatric ', ' post intervention ', ' Individual ', ' Linguistics ', ' Linguistic ', ' pediatrician ', ' Literature ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Medical Records ', ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health Services ', ' Mental Hygiene Services ', ' Problem behavior ', ' behavioral problem ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' Parents ', ' Patients ', ' Pediatrics ', ' Physicians ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Primary Care ', ' tool ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Research ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Knowledge ', ' Insurance Coverage ', ' Insurance Status ', ' programs ', ' Time ', ' Training Programs ', ' Translating ', ' United States Dept. of Health and Human Services ', ' United States Department of Health and Human Services ', ' Department of Health and Human Services ', ' Attitude ', ' Work ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' Belief ', ' Visit ', ' Services ', ' American ', ' early childhood ', ' cultural competence ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Self-Report ', ' Categories ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Behavior ', ' Child health care ', ' Child Health ', ' brief intervention ', ' brief treatment ', ' brief therapy ', ' falls ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Hispanics ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Modeling ', ' behavioral health ', ' theories ', ' Academy ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Communication ', ' Preventive screening ', ' Underserved Population ', ' underserved people ', ' under served population ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' 5 year old ', ' five year old ', ' age 5 years ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' racial/ethnic ', ' stem ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' public health relevance ', ' brief screening ', ' Consultations ', ' ']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF MASSACHUSETTS BOSTON,F31,2010,29644,0.03797443409223083
"National Survey of Behavioral Health Providers to the Deaf and Hard of Hearing    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this R03 application is to capitalize on the experience of organizations that provide mental health services to deaf and hard-of-hearing persons by means of a national survey of the characteristics, operations and outreach strategies of these organizations. Deaf and hard-of-hearing persons routinely face many serious obstacles to obtaining mental health services, and consequently have disproportionately low use of these services despite at least equal rates of mental illness. We seek to begin to address these disparities by understanding the clinic and systems issues, and by eliciting the best practices of providers in service and outreach to these vulnerable populations. The specific aims of our study are: a) to undertake a national survey of organizations that provide mental health services to deaf and hard-of-hearing persons, focusing on structural and process domains of care; b) to describe differences in the number and characteristics of agencies by region and to delineate differences in service development and outreach strategies between organizations in urban and rural settings; and c) to elicit information from these organizations about barriers to mental health care for deaf and hard-of-hearing persons and prevalent practice patterns in the local healthcare environment. We plan to accomplish these specific aims by implementing a multimodal survey designed to collect information from these organizations on client characteristics, structural features and processes of care, barriers to treatment, and the local service environment. In order to increase both response rates and cultural sensitivity to the Deaf culture, the survey will be collected using paper, web-based, telephone, and videophone using American Sign Language. The survey will be directed at key informants for 267 organizations providing mental health services to deaf and hard-of-hearing persons, identified through two nationwide directories of specialized providers and recruited through telephone contact. Analysis of survey results will guide the development of evidence-based programs to improve service delivery and efforts to rigorously test new treatment models for these patients.           Relevance The public health significance of this work is that limited access to quality mental health services is a serious public health problem for persons who are deaf or hard-of-hearing. Improving services for these vulnerable populations requires serious study of the structure and process of care that is currently in place, to define an evidence base that can inform appropriate strategies for service development, intervention and outreach.",National Survey of Behavioral Health Providers to the Deaf and Hard of Hearing,7772316,R03HS016554,[''],AHRQ,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R03,2010,36890,0.11599030006949536
"Cancer prevention, mental health and social capital of segregated Black Americans    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposed dissertation multi-level study will investigate the social determinants of breast and prostate cancer preventive screening behaviors and mental health outcomes on African-American residents of racially, residentially segregated urban neighborhoods of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The Specific Aims of this proposal focus on the following questions: 1. Do different levels of bonding social capital and different measures (structural, cognitive) of social capital predict mental health outcomes and cancer preventive behaviors within racially and residentially segregated urban settings, net of individual-level compositional characteristics (age, gender, socioeconomic position, foreign-born status)? 2. Is the effect of social capital on cancer preventive behaviors and mental health outcomes in segregated communities mediated by neighborhood characteristics (level of poverty, amount of violence, presence of non-acute health care facilities, level of segregation). A mentoring team of experienced investigators has been assembled to pursue this study, including leading national experts on social epidemiology (Ichiro Kawachi), mental health disparities (David Williams), cancer epidemiology (Katrina Armstrong), and demography (Dolores Acevedo-Garcia). The proposed dissertation accords with the National Cancer Institute's mission ""to eliminate suffering and death due to cancer and to preempt cancer at every opportunity"". The knowledge gained from this study can aid in understanding the role of social capital in promoting cancer preventive behaviors in African-Americans - a group with higher cancer mortality rate -- which fits NCI's desire to accelerate progress in cancer prevention and improve early detection and diagnosis. This study will draw on three main sources of data: the 2004 Southeastern Pennsylvania Health Household Survey (SPHHS) administered by the Philadelphia Health Management Corporation data, US Census Data, and local public record. The 2004 version of the SPHHS includes the self-report of mental health conditions, cancer preventive screening behaviors, and social capital measures from the Social Capital Community Benchmark Survey. Presence of block parties will be assessed using data from the City of Philadelphia Department of Streets and presence of non-acute care facilities from the the US Department of Health and Human Services Health Resources and Service Administratrion website. Data will be aggregated and geocoded to segregated areas of Philadelphia County using a novel measure of segregation based on 2000 US Census Data.

"M-RISP at San Diego State University    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  We request funds to continue and expand our very successful M-RISP. Our goal is still to enhance the capacity of SDSU to conduct mental health research that is responsive to NIMH priorities and that leads to applications that can be funded through RO1 and R03 mechanisms. We are dedicated to promoting and supporting high quality mental health research, focused on ethnic disparities. Faculty obtain release time, funded through the M-RISP and matched by the university, through an intramural research competition. Several minority students are supported and assist the faculty. A systematic and extensive plan for educating both M-RISP faculty and students about high quality mental health research is proposed, with the help of collaborators from UCSD. Support for faculty presentations of their research findings will be made available, a brown bag will be established so faculty can receive feedback about their research ideas before implementation, and biostatistical consulting, mentoring, and a mental health colloquium series are included. These activities will 1) increase research collaborations among faculty members at SDSU and research-intensive institutions; 2) establish national and international faculty networks for mental health research; 3) increase the number of faculty members who seek and obtain RO1-level extramural funding; and 4) increase faculty research productivity, as demonstrated by peer-reviewed presentations and publications. The number of ethnic minority investigators who conduct research to address the NIMH priorities and who become funded by NIMH will increase. In addition, three Independent Investigator projects associated with the M-RISP core are proposed. They include: studies examining the effects of marital satisfaction on mental health, the impact of national identification on the mental health of minorities, and the coping strategies employed by minority adolescents and their effects on mental health. All of the independent investigators address current NIMH priorities, and their research is relevant to public health because it will increase the understanding of ethnic differences in the causes and cures of mental health problems. Interventions tailored to help minorities overcome their unique barriers to receiving treatment can be designed better as a result of the proposed research. SDSU will integrate the Career Opportunities in Research (COR) Program withM-RISP.

"A Cross-Cultural, Patient-Centered Approach for Assessing Quality of ADHD Care    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Racial-ethnic disparities in diagnosis and treatment of Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) suggest that all children with ADHD are at risk for poor quality of care. In order to better understand these disparities in ADHD care quality, Dr. Eugenia Chan, a developmental-behavioral pediatrician, is submitting this revised applications for a Mentored Patient-Oriented Career Development Award (K23) to develop a cross-cultural, patient-centered approach for assessing quality of primary care management of children with ADHD. The overall goals are to develop a conceptual understanding of barriers to effective care from patient and family perspectives, to understand how and why these problems vary across cultural groups, and to develop instruments and methods to measure these patient-centered processes of care and to guide interventions to improve clinical care and outcomes for children with ADHD. The specific aims are to (1) develop a patient-centered model of ADHD care quality by investigating similarities and differences in African-American, Chinese-American, and European-American family experiences of ADHD care; (2) develop and validate a parent survey of patient-centered indicators of ADHD care quality that are sensitive to cross-cultural values regarding care for ADHD; and (3) test the survey in a diverse, primary care patient population to assess psychometric properties and identify disparities in patient-centered ADHD care quality. The results of this project will lead directly to future applications to (1) investigate relationships among patient-centered quality assessments, evidence-based quality indicators, and ADHD outcomes, (2) identify disparities in primary care management of ADHD, and (3) develop and implement targeted interventions to improve disparities in quality of ADHD care. The candidate has demonstrated skills as a developmental- behavioral pediatrician and junior health services researcher. The multidisciplinary education plan focuses on acquiring strong theoretical background and skills in qualitative methods, culture and disparities in mental health, advanced biostatistics, and measurement-based quality assessment and quality improvement.

"Can Medicaid Benefits Reduce Access Disparities for Minority Children & Youth?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The study goal is to examine the aggressive enforcement of Medicaid's (Medi-Cal's) Early Periodic Screening Diagnosis and Treatment program (EPSDT) to learn whether reducing important structural barriers to public mental health care by providing generous financing, increasing treatment capacity, and engaging with community-based programs and organizations will bring about the desired policy effect of equalizing spending and treatment patterns among low-income white and ethnic minority children and youth.  Study aims are: 1) Estimate the extent to which California's EPSDT mental health program expansion reduced disparities in spending for African American, Latino and Native American Medi-Cal enrolled children and youth. Determine how much reduction in spending disparities was immediate and how much it constituted minority-white convergence in trends. 2) Estimate the extent to which California's enforcement of EPSDT mental health services reduced disparities in access (measured by overall penetration rates; outpatient treatment penetration rates; and crisis treatment penetration rates) for African American, Latino and Native American Medi-Cal enrolled children and youth. Determine how much reduction in access disparities was immediate and how much it constituted minority-white convergence in trends. 3) Estimate for each dependent measure described in 1 and 2 above the extent to which reduced minority-white disparities was associated with: a) increases in total provider supply and Spanish-speaking provider supply; and b) increased engagement with community-based organizations including those with an ethnic minority focus.  Using panel data multivariate regression methods in a kind of ""interrupted time-series"" approach (Shadish, Cook & Campbell, 2002), we control for factors correlated with aggressive EPSDT enforcement that could confound our assessment of its impact on cost and access disparities. We will observe costs and penetration rates before and after EPSDT enforcement over 48 quarters (July 1992 - June 2004) and across the 57 California county mental health plans. Since our focus is on changes in disparities between ethnic minorities and whites over time, any potential confounds must differentially affect ethnic minorities or whites to influence study results. To further test hypotheses, we contrast disparities in sub-samples minimally affected by, and unaffected by, EPSDT enforcement. Medi-Cal Specialty Mental Health Claims data and Medi-Cal enrollment data obtained from the California Department of Mental Health will be used.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The lack of mental health access and treatment for children and adolescents is a serious public health problem raised by the Surgeon General in his 2000 report. Low access is especially pronounced among ethnic minority populations for whom mental illness is becoming a significant problem: in May 2007, the CDC issued a report stating that suicide was the fourth leading cause of death among youth, and that the highest rates have occurred among minority populations1. The proposed study will provide information for policymakers and administrators to understand the conditions under which existing financing and delivery systems can be levered to rapidly expand access and improve care for these children and youth. 1 Bernard SJ, Paulozzi LJ, Wallace DL; Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) (2007).

"Mental Health Communication in Elderly Primary Care Visits and Economic Outcomes The medical office visit is the foundation of medical care and one of the most important professional activities of primary care physicians who are often the only source of mental health services for older adults. Evidence continues to show that the gap between science and clinical practice remains wide: as many as one half of older adults with a recognized mental disorder fail to receive any mental health services, and even fewer receive evidence-based treatments. Racial minority patients fare even worse. It is an urgent public health concern that such a high proportion of patients needing mental health services are without access to evidence-based care and that racial disparities in access to quality mental health care persist despite advancements in efficacious treatments for mental illnesses. Direct observation of how patients and physicians interact has led to research findings that are straightforward and easily understood by the public and policymakers. It offers a new perspective to study physicians' work and patients' contributions with potentially important new insights. We propose to leverage the infrastructure and data afforded by an ongoing NIH- funded study which is audio-recording 800 annual physical exam visits (checkups designed for physicians to comprehensively review their patients' health) among socioeconomically diverse older adults in a large integrated delivery system, the Henry Ford Health System, in Detroit Michigan and its surrounding suburbs. The proposed study is within the scope of the economics of mental health. We plan to apply mixed methods approach and combine perspectives from mental health services research with behavioral economics, communication research, and statistics. We will use data from audio-recordings, administrative benefits, medication dispensing, claims and encounter records, and surveys of patients and physicians to address the Specific Aims of our study: Aim 1: Examine the productivity of physician-patient communication by linking elements of quality of communication on mental health in the context of busy clinics and competing demands from co-morbidities in routine annual checkups with intermediate outcomes such as patient's satisfaction and treatment adherence and distal clinical and economic outcomes including service use and costs. Aim 2: Testing for racial disparities in communication content and time using the definition proposed by the Institute of Medicine in Unequal Treatment. We will first qualitatively compare the content and time devoted to mental health and physical health communications between racially concordant and discordant patient-physician pairs. We will assess the contribution of factors that are germane to the practice environment and malleable to policy, e.g., length of visit, co-location of mental and physical health providers to observed disparities. At the completion of the study, we seek to formulate concrete recommendations about specific organizational or clinical interventions that can address these national priorities: translating evidence to practice and eliminating disparities.

It is an urgent public health concern that such a high proportion of patients needing mental health services are without access to evidence- based care and that racial disparities in access to quality mental health care persist despite advancements in efficacious treatments for mental illnesses.",Mental Health Communication in Elderly Primary Care Visits and Economic Outcomes,8103654,R01MH081098,"['treatment planning ', ' Patient observation ', ' Watchful Waiting ', ' social ', ' Measures ', ' Code ', ' Coding System ', ' abstracting ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Treatment Cost ', ' response ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Communication ', ' Comorbidity ', ' co-morbidity ', ' cost ', ' time use ', ' effectiveness research ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Minority ', ' biopsychosocial ', ' Outcome ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' comparative effectiveness ', ' economic outcome ', ' evidence base ', ' treatment adherence ', ' clinical practice ', ' cost effectiveness ', ' Data Sources ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Compliance behavior ', ' therapy cooperation ', ' therapy compliance ', ' patient adherence ', ' compliance cooperation ', ' Treatment Compliance ', ' Patient Cooperation ', ' Patient Compliance ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Economics ', ' Elements ', ' Empathy ', ' Environment ', ' Address ', ' Length ', ' Preventive ', ' Health system ', ' Caring ', ' Adherence (attribute) ', ' Adherence ', ' Cost Effectiveness Analysis ', ' cost-effectiveness analysis ', ' cost-effective analysis ', ' cost efficient analysis ', ' cost effective analysis ', ' Cost Effective Analyses ', ' Data ', ' Health Communication ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Communication Research ', ' Process ', ' socioeconomics ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomic ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio economic ', ' Behavioral ', ' Journals ', ' Magazine ', ' Foundations ', ' Output ', ' Evidence based treatment ', ' base ', ' communication behavior ', ' suburb ', ' suburbia ', ' suburban ', ' Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health Personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Health Services ', ' health care service ', ' Health Services for the Aged ', ' health services for seniors ', ' health services for older people ', ' health services for older adults ', ' Health Services for the Elderly ', ' Geriatric Health Services ', ' Health Services Research ', ' services research ', ' Medical Care Research ', ' Healthcare Research ', ' Health Services Evaluation ', ' Health Care Research ', ' Health Status ', ' Level of Health ', ' Distal ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' psychologic ', ' psychological ', ' Link ', ' Institute of Medicine (U.S.) ', ' NAS/IOM ', ' Institute of Medicine ', ' Psyche structure ', ' mental ', ' insight ', ' Trust ', ' Databases ', ' data repository ', ' clinical data repository ', ' Electronic Database ', ' Electronic Databank ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Policies ', ' Funding ', ' American Medical Association ', ' Malpractice ', ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health Services ', ' Mental Hygiene Services ', ' Methods ', ' Michigan ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Integrated Delivery Systems ', ' Office Visits ', ' physician office visit ', ' Patient Participation ', ' Client satisfaction ', ' Patient Satisfaction ', ' Patients ', ' Perception ', ' Physicians ', ' Primary Care Physician ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Primary Care ', ' Probability ', ' Productivity ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Recommendation ', ' Records ', ' Research ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Science ', ' statistics ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' Work ', ' Dimensions ', ' Clinic ', ' Source ', ' Location ', ' Behavior ', ' Mental disorders ', ' psychological disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' physical conditioning ', ' physical health ', ' interest ', ' Visit ', ' Services ', ' checkup examination ', ' checkup ', ' Check-up ', ' ']",NIMH,PALO ALTO MEDICAL FOUNDATION RES INST,R01,2010,544771,0.07592504094192744
"Mental Health Services in the Education Sector: Effectiveness and Systemic Impact    DESCRIPTION (provided by candidate): The majority of youth in need of mental health interventions do not receive any services (Kataoka et al., 2002). This problem is particularly notable among low socioeconomic (SES) and ethnic minority youth, who are most likely to experience mental health problems, least likely to receive services, and are consequently more likely to suffer the deleterious effects of mental health problems (US DHHS, 2001). School-based prevention and intervention programs represent one of the most promising opportunities for reducing identified service gaps and disparities among youth because of the nearly universal nature of primary and secondary education. As the most common point of entry into a fragmented mental health system, efforts to improve school-based services and understand their implications for future care carry profound implications for overall public health (Farmer et al., 2003). The current application is designed to provide training in the skills necessary to build a long-term program of research investigating the role of school-based programs in addressing the unmet mental health needs of diverse groups of youth. My overarching goal is to move toward an independent research career in which I will apply sophisticated research methodologies to the study and remediation of mental health gaps and disparities and apply the findings to the development of a service delivery model. To accomplish these goals, I will engage in an intensive training experience that will combine individual mentorship, coursework, and field experiences. This training will inform and shape the analyses of a set of research questions pertaining to mental health service utilization and form the basis for a Career Development grant application. The primary research component of this project will take advantage of a rich, existing data set from a school-based prevention program for adolescent depression, the High School Transition Study (HSTS; McCauley et al., 2008), to conduct analyses beyond the scope of the original study. The proposed project will allow me to build expertise in the analysis of school-related factors that influence program effectiveness and to gain knowledge about the assessment of program impact on mental health service utilization across service sectors (e.g., specialty mental health, primary care, education). Results will provide information about how school-based interventions fit into the overall service delivery system, and their potential for reducing disparities in access to services and youth outcomes. My specific research aims include using the ethnically and socioeconomically diverse HSTS sample to explore how students' school attachment and support mediate intervention outcome and to examine the impact of HSTS program participation on the mental health service utilization of different groups of youth.           ",Mental Health Services in the Education Sector: Effectiveness and Systemic Impact,7901362,F32MH086978,"['Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Address ', ' Health system ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Caring ', ' Effectiveness of Interventions ', ' Applications Grants ', ' Grant Proposals ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Principal Investigator ', ' socioeconomics ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomic ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio economic ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Future ', ' Affect ', ' base ', ' career ', ' Goals ', ' improved ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' healthcare service availability ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare access availability ', ' health services availability ', ' health care service availability ', ' health care service access ', ' health care availability ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Availability of Health Services ', ' Accessibility of health care ', ' Access to Healthcare ', ' Access to Health Care ', ' Access to Care ', ' Adolescent ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Rods (Retina) ', ' rod cell ', ' retinal rods ', ' Rods (Eye) ', ' Rod Photoreceptors ', ' Rod ', ' Ice ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' health care service utilization ', ' healthcare utilization ', ' healthcare service utilization ', ' health services utilization ', ' Health Care Utilization ', ' satisfaction ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health Services ', ' Mental Hygiene Services ', ' Mentorship ', ' Parents ', ' Perception ', ' Shapes ', ' Program Effectiveness ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' Nature ', ' Research ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' School Health Services ', ' School-Based Services ', ' Schools ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' medical specialties ', ' Specialty ', ' Students ', ' Time ', ' Severities ', ' System ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' Services ', ' experience ', ' high school ', ' intervention program ', ' skills ', ' Participant ', ' Prevention program ', ' Reporting ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', ' depressive symptoms ', ' depressive ', ' depression symptom ', ' Emotional Depression ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Mediating ', ' Research Methodology ', ' Research Methods ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' career development ', ' Youth ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' remediation ', ' Outcome ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' demographics ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,F32,2010,47606,0.15962993737421097
"Telemental Health Improve Mental Health Care Outcomes Children Underserved Areas    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The need for new models for delivering mental heath services within primary care (PC) has been recognized for two decades, yet federal funding to address this need has been lacking. Telemental health (TMH) programs are being implemented nationally to address inequities in access to mental health services, but little scientific evidence is available regarding their efficacy, particularly with children. The goal of the proposed research is to test the efficacy of a TMH service delivery model for improving care and outcomes for children with a prevalent psychiatric condition who are treated by primary care physicians (PCPs) in 5 underserved communities in the Pacific Northwest. The research proposed is a randomized controlled trial of PCP care augmented by TMH-delivered evidence- based treatment of children (N=250) 7-11 years old diagnosed with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) versus treatment as usual by the PCP. Hispanic children will comprise 30% of the study sample. The experimental condition will consist of 6 pharmacotherapy sessions delivered by child psychiatrists through videoconferencing in conjunction with the referring PCP who will prescribe medications and 6 sessions of parent behavioral training delivered in-person by a community therapist supervised by a telepsychologist. The control condition will consist of treatment as usual with the PCP augmented by a single telepsychiatric consultation, which is current standard care in the participating communities. For children in both experimental and control conditions, hyperactivity, inattentiveness, oppositionality/defiance, and functional impairment, as well as parental stress, burden, and empowerment will be assessed 5 times from baseline to 25-week follow- up. In the experimental group, adherence to treatment protocols will be carefully monitored for families, telepsychiatrists, local community therapists, and PCPs. If under the experimental delivery model, improvements in clinical outcomes are demonstrated, and if an evidence-based treatment protocol can be implemented with fidelity, then TMH health service delivery models could be deployed with confidence to help rectify the severe geographic maldistribution of pediatric mental health services and to build new models of collaborative care within PC. This telemental health (TMH) investigation holds promise for improving the nation's public health and welfare in three ways. First, TMH offers children and families suffering with emotional and behavioral disorders help that cannot be found locally by redistributing specialty mental health care from urban centers to underserved communities. Second, TMH offers secondary and tertiary prevention by reaching children's in need prior to the full evolution of mental illness and its associated impairments. Third, TMH offers primary care physicians, teachers, and other professionals' assistance in their efforts to care for our nation's children.          ",Telemental Health Improve Mental Health Care

"COPE/Healthy Lifestyles for Teens: A School-Based RCT    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):        The prevention and treatment of obesity and mental health disorders in adolescence are two major public health problems in the United States (U.S.) today. The incidence of adolescents who are overweight or obese has increased dramatically over the past 20 years, with approximately 17.1 percent of teens now being overweight or obese. Furthermore, approximately 15 million children and adolescents (25 percent) in the U.S. have a mental health problem that is interfering with their functioning at home or at school, but less than 25 percent of those affected receive any treatment for these disorders. The prevalence rates of obesity and mental health problems are even higher in Hispanic teens, with studies suggesting that the two conditions often coexist in many youth. However, despite the rapidly increasing incidence of these two public health problems with their related health disparities and adverse health outcomes, there has been a paucity of theory- based intervention studies conducted with adolescents in high schools to improve their healthy lifestyle behaviors as well as their physical and mental health outcomes. Unfortunately, physical and mental health services continue to be largely separated instead of integrated in the nation's healthcare system, which often leads to inadequate identification and treatment of these significant adolescent health problems.  Therefore, the goal of the proposed randomized controlled trial is to test the efficacy of the COPE (Creating Opportunities for Personal Empowerment)/Healthy Lifestyles TEEN (Thinking, Feeling, Emotions & Exercise) Program, an educational and cognitive-behavioral skills building intervention guided by cognitive behavior theory, on the healthy lifestyle behaviors and depressive symptoms of 800 culturally diverse adolescents enrolled in Phoenix, Arizona high schools. The specific aims of the study are to: (1) Use a randomized controlled trial to test the short- and more long-term efficacy of the COPE TEEN Program on key outcomes, including healthy lifestyles behaviors, depressive symptoms and body mass index percentage, (2) Examine the role of cognitive beliefs and perceived difficulty in leading a healthy lifestyle in mediating the effects of COPE on healthy lifestyle behaviors and depressive symptoms; and (3) Explore variables that may moderate the effects of the intervention on healthy lifestyle behaviors and depressive symptoms, including race/ethnicity, gender, SES, acculturation, and parental healthy lifestyle beliefs and behaviors. Six prior pilot studies support the need for this full scale clinical trial and the use of cognitive-behavioral skills building in promoting healthy lifestyles beliefs, behaviors and optimal mental health in teens.  This study is consistent with the NIH roadmap and goals of improving people's health and preventing the onset of disease and disability as well as promoting the highest level of health in a vulnerable population.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:       The prevention and treatment of obesity and mental health disorders in adolescence are two major public health problems in the United States today. To address the increasing incidence and adverse health outcomes associated with both obesity and mental health problems, a theory-based 15 session intervention program entitled COPE (Creating Opportunities for Personal Empowerment)/Healthy Lifestyles TEEN (Thinking, Feeling, Emotions & Exercise), will be delivered within high school health classes in order to improve the physical and mental health outcomes of 800 culturally diverse adolescents (14 to 16 years of age).              PROJECT NARRATIVE  The prevention and treatment of obesity and mental health disorders in adolescence are two major public health problems in the United States today.

The proposed research educational program addresses this gap in targeting primarily minority psychiatry residents attending a small HBCU medical school, Morehouse School of Medicine, and partners - for the fourth year research elective - with the much larger, research oriented, Department of Psychiatry of Emory University School of Medicine. The proposed program permeates the four-year residency training program. By the end of the second year, the residents are becoming competent in evidence-based medicine principles, are research literate, and have participated in ongoing research projects. Collaboration with Emory assures a wide variety of experienced investigators with sponsored research, augmented by Morehouse's own resources, from which the PGY IV resident can select a mentor and research project. In addition to traditional research training subjects, this directly addresses cultural competency in mental health research, including bioethical, biological and psychological issues of minority populations in research content and conduct, and as a means to decreasing mental health disparities. The program will also facilitate a bridge to postdoctoral training and mentoring. Furthermore, the practice of mentoring others will be instilled in the participants, and they will be encouraged to mentor those in earlier years of training. The specific aims include: support educational experiences relevant to conducting mental health related clinical research that will attract, train and further career development of primarily under-represented minority physician scientists; provide mentored clinical research opportunities that will encourage physician scientists to embark on research projects directly applicable to clinical practice and transitional research; assure the training and experience necessary to progress to the next step of the participants careers, either by entering a research postdoctoral fellowship or by joining an existing research environment; and establish the feasibility of a paradigm of smaller medical schools, especially those with large minority residency programs, to partner with larger, more research oriented, local medical schools to provide more advanced training that otherwise would not possible.           ",Fostering Mental Health Research in Psychiatry Residents,7916366,R25MH071735,"['Training ', ' literacy ', ' Educational workshop ', ' Workshop ', ' Fostering ', ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mentors ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Collaborations ', ' Physicians ', ' Staging ', ' Psychiatrist ', ' Psychiatry ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Residencies ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Rotation ', ' medical schools ', ' school of medicine ', ' medical college ', ' Evidence Based Medicine ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' Training Programs ', ' Translating ', ' Universities ', ' Mental disorders ', ' psychological disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Drug Formulations ', ' Formulation ', ' experience ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Basic Science ', ' Basic Research ', ' literate ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' career development ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Minority ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' post-doctoral training ', ' postdoctoral training ', ' Historically Black Colleges and Universities ', ' Historically Black University ', ' Historically Black Institution ', ' Historically Black Colleges ', ' HBCUs ', ' clinical practice ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Environment ', ' Address ', ' Doctor of Philosophy ', ' PhD ', ' Ph.D. ', ' Research Training ', ' Underrepresented Minority ', ' underserved minority ', ' under-represented minority ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Fellowship ', ' Fibrinogen ', ' Factor One ', ' Factor I ', ' Coagulation Factor One ', ' Coagulation Factor I ', ' Blood Factor One ', ' Blood Coagulation Factor One ', ' Blood Coagulation Factor I ', ' Journals ', ' Magazine ', ' career ', ' Goals ', ' improved ', ' Housing ', ' Clinical ', ' Biological ', ' psychologic ', ' psychological ', ' ']",NIMH,MOREHOUSE SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,R25,2010,235891,0.09732233521145747
"Advanced Center to Improve Pediatric Mental Health Care (ACIPMHC) We propose to establish an Advanced Center to Improve Pediatric Mental Health Care (ACIPMHC) that will be located within the Child and Adolescent Services Research Center (CASRC) at Rady Children's Hospital-San Diego. The ACIPMHC will have strong linkage to the intervention development program at the Center for Research to Practice (CR2P) at the Oregon Social Learning Center (OSLC) and to other intervention and services research programs and networks around the country. The research agenda has a strategic focus on improvement of public pediatric mental health care, primarily in the mental health and child welfare service sectors, through improved integration of evidence-based practice and usual care. The center's program of practice research spans clinical epidemiology studies linked to evidence-based practice, effectiveness, and implementation studies. The research agenda will have a primary focus on effectiveness and equity as two of the six aims for improving health care from the ""Crossing the Quality Chasm"" report. An overarching center perspective of cultural exchange will guide active partnership with major stakeholders in youth mental health care, including youth and family consumers, providers, program and funding managers, system administrators, policy makers, and intervention and services researchers.   The Principal Research Core (PRC) will focus on practice research through two developmental studies addressing implementation of two established evidence-based practices. These studies and others to be designed by the center network of investigators will be carried out in community-based mental health and child welfare service settings, building on already developed research-practice relationships. The Research Methods Core (RMC) will advance methods for effectiveness and implementation research through four workgroups focusing on (a) design and analysis, (b) measurement, (c) mixed methods, and (d) economic analyses, as well as one developmental study addressing incorporation of research-based measurement in usual care child welfare practice.

"Idaho Partnership for Hispanic Mental Health    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The primary goal of the Idaho Partnership for Hispanic Mental Health phase one planning project is to reduce disparities in mental health treatment among Hispanics in southwest Idaho, who are primarily an immigrant population of Mexican origin. The project's first step will be to conduct a community assessment which will: 1) further knowledge about Hispanics' perceptions and beliefs about mental illness, and behaviors and preferences regarding mental health treatment, and 2) assess southwest Idaho's mental health provider organizations' knowledge, attitudes, and practices regarding their services to Hispanic individuals, and gaps in service access and provision for Hispanics. As barriers to Hispanics access and use of mental health services are already well-documented, the purpose of this community assessment will be to inform the improvement of mental health service delivery. The project will use a community-based participatory research approach. Project partners include Mountain States Group, the University of Washington, Centro de Comunidad y Justicia, Dr. Al Sanchez (Hispanic mental health consultant), and an existing Hispanic Health Community Advisory Board. Strong equitable partnerships between the research organizations and the Hispanic community have already been established. All have participated in formulating the proposal's research design, which includes semi-structured interviews with 240 adult Hispanics residing in southwest Idaho, and open-ended interviews with 35 southwest Idaho mental health services providers. The project's data findings, supplemented by secondary data research, will be used to prioritize infrastructure development and capacity building actions to respond to Hispanics' mental health service needs. The research and community partners will form two specific action plans, one for implementing community-based and culturally appropriate mental health services interventions, and a second for conducting mental health service provider training to improve their understanding, skills, policies, and practices in working with the Hispanic community. Phase one activities will lead to the submission of a full research proposal to implement the recommendations.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  To work effectively, health care providers need to understand the differences in how various populations in the United States perceive mental health and mental illness and treatment services (Healthy People 2010).

"Evaluating Effectiveness of a Statewide Public Mental Health Re-entry Program    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   This application addresses broad Challenge Area (09) Health Disparities and specific Challenge Topic, 09-MH-101: Validating Models of Community Re-entry Programs for Prisoners with Mental Disorders. Abstract The purpose of this study is to combine existing administrative databases to evaluate the effectiveness of a statewide re-entry program for people with mental illness exiting corrections. The Massachusetts Department of Mental Health (DMH) Forensic Transition Team (FTT), a case management based re-entry program, has been in existence for over 10 years. Although there have been descriptive studies documenting favorable short-term outcomes, a rigorous scientific evaluation of the FTT program using matched controls has not been done. The goals of the proposed study are two-fold: (1) to evaluate the effectiveness of the FTT program in reducing recidivism, and (2) to assess whether the program's benefits are likely to outweigh the costs using a comparative economic analysis. The study design is retrospective with the comparative analysis based on a case-control framework. Individuals with serious mental illness who re-entered the community after incarceration but were not eligible for FTT program form the control group. The controls are matched based on propensity scores selected from demographic, mental health and criminal history variables. We will conduct both ""between"" and ""within"" group analysis of the FTT program to understand disparities in community re-entry outcomes. To accomplish the objectives of the study we will merge existing administrative data for the years 2007 - 2010 from state agencies with which FTT clients have significant contact. These agencies include the Department of Mental Health, Department of Correction, Hamden and Suffolk County Houses of Correction, Department of Public Health Bureau of Substance Abuse Services providing substance abuse services, and publicly available data from the Criminal Offender Record Information system, the state's official electronic arrest record repository. Major strengths and innovations of the proposed application are: (a) existing databases which can be harmonized to answer research questions; (b) evaluation of a unique state-wide re-entry program serving voluntary participants that has been in existence for over 10 years; and (c) the use of comparative economics. This application addresses the emerging public mental health crisis of truncated continuity of care for individuals with severe mental illness involved in the criminal justice system in general and exiting corrections in particular.

"Reducing Ethnic and Racial Bias in Screening for Psychiatric Disorders in Adolesc    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposal, entitled ""Reducing Ethnic and Racial Bias in Screening for Psychiatric Disorders in Adolescents"" is designed to improve the effectiveness of identification, referral and screening for mental health disorders potentially associated with ethnic/racial disparities in adolescents' receipt of mental health care. For racial and ethnic minority youth, there is a great disparity in the receipt of mental health services and, as a result, these youth are more likely to experience persistent impairment from psychiatric disorders. Preliminary data on referrals for mental health treatment appear to indicate that minority children are under-identified for services by their schools and families, the two major referral sources. The research to be generated can help us achieve needed enhancement in school screening, a previously under-funded area of health services research in general, and comparative effectiveness research more specifically. This project provides the opportunity to support the analysis and dissemination of data from the National Comorbidity Survey Adolescent Supplement (NCS-A), the most comprehensive national data available to study screening and referral patterns for ethnic/racial minority children. We propose four specific aims that allow us to examine a broad range of possible causes for under- recognition and lack of treatment for ethic and racial minority youth as well as alternative methods for enhancing screening tools used to assess them. Aim 1 intends to determine whether schools are equally likely to encourage parents of ethnic/racial minority youth who have psychiatric disorders to seek services for their child as they are to encourage non-Latino white parents, and whether school, community, and family characteristics explain any disparities in referral. Aim 2 then tries to identify ethnic/racial differences in parents' assessment of youth with psychiatric disorders associated with ethnic/racial disparities in service access. Aim 3 plans to evaluate meaning and response bias in the screening questions used to assess major depression and generalized anxiety disorders in non-Latino white and racial/ethnic minority adolescents. Finally in Aim 4, we compare the accuracy of predictions of mood and anxiety disorders using screening scales specific to blacks, to Latinos or to whites, with universalistic screening scales, in order to help improve detection for ethnic and racial minorities, and to determine if the scales should be group-specific or universal. Study results will be distilled to provide basic information about biases in the identification, referral and screening process by schools, and factors that influence whether parents identify ""mental health problems"" and follow-up on service referrals. Findings will be disseminated through a website for teachers and school mental health service providers, via newsletters of professional organizations, and by submission to annual conventions of school- based practitioners, thus bringing critical information to those most poised to affect change. The proposed research is designed to improve the effectiveness of identification, referral and screening for mental health disorders potentially associated with ethnic/racial disparities in adolescent receipt of mental health care. Using data from the National Comorbidity Survey Adolescent Supplement (NCS-A), the most comprehensive national data available to study screening and referral patterns for ethnic/racial minority children, we propose four specific aims that allow us to examine a broad range of possible causes for under- recognition and lack of treatment for ethic and racial minority youth as well as alternative methods for enhancing screening tools used to assess them.

"Culture, Context, and Mexican American Mental Health    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal seeks 5 years of continued support for a longitudinal study of processes that contribute to the high levels of psychopathology experienced by Mexican American youth. Consistent with priorities in the NIMH Strategic Plan (2008), this study is designed to (1) chart mental illness trajectories of Mexican American youth, (2) increase our capacity to predict who in this population is at risk for mental illness by identifying individual, environmental, and social factors that contribute to both risk and resilience processes, (3) identify contributors to the mental health disparities experienced by Mexican Americans, and (4) provide a scientific foundation for the design of the next generation of preventive interventions for this population. Beginning with a diverse sample of 750 Mexican American families, this study tests hypotheses regarding how interactions of individuals' cultural orientations with characteristics of family, community, peer, and school contexts contribute to the mental health burden of this population. A unique aspect of this study is the assessment of cultural orientation (i.e., degree of endorsement of traditional Mexican cultural values and degree of endorsement of U.S. cultural values) of children and parents as well as the degree to which communities and schools support these cultural traditions. Children and their parents were assessed initially when children were in 5th and 7th grades. Results supported the specific aims: (1) changes in children's and parents' cultural orientations are related to greater risk for mental health disorders; (2) family characteristics, such as parent-child conflict, mediate the relation between cultural orientation mismatches and children's psychopathology; and (3) child and parent cultural orientations buffer relations between common risk factors (e.g., economic hardship) and children's mental health. The proposed continuation will assess this sample of children and their parents as youth experience the rapid developmental changes of middle adolescence (grades 10 and 12) when rates of psychopathology accelerate. The specific aims remain: (1) cultural mismatches between children and family, community, and school contexts will be related to risk for psychopathology; (2) family and peer group processes will mediate relations between cultural mismatches and psychopathology; and (3) cultural orientations of children and their parents will moderate relations between risk factors and psychopathology. Longitudinal tests of these aims will provide a strong foundation for the next generation of prevention programs to reduce mental health disparities for Mexican Americans. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This longitudinal study of 750 Mexican American adolescents and their parents is important from a public health standpoint because of the mental health disparities Mexican American adolescents experience, and the limited knowledge about factors that contribute to these disparities. This study is designed to (1) chart mental illness trajectories of Mexican American youth, (2) increase our capacity to predict who in this population is at risk for mental illness by identifying individual, environmental, and social factors that contribute to both risk and resilience processes, (3) identify contributors to the mental health disparities experienced by Mexican Americans, and (4) provide a firm scientific foundation for the design of the next generation of preventive interventions for this population in order to reduce the individual, family, and societal burden of psychopathology within this population.           NARRATIVE This longitudinal study of 750 Mexican American adolescents and their parents is important from a public health standpoint because of the mental health disparities Mexican American adolescents experience, and the limited knowledge about factors that contribute to these disparities.

"Multi-Method Ethnographic Assessment of Behavioral Health Reform in New Mexico    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The State of New Mexico will implement a major reform in managed mental health service delivery for low-income populations in July 2005. Seventeen state agencies will contract with a single behavioral health organization to oversee the delivery of all public mental health services. This reform is designed to decrease administrative costs and service fragmentation while improving access to culturally relevant, evidence-based mental health services, particularly in rural areas. However, concerns linger that managed mental health care programs may adversely affect access and services for vulnerable populations and may overly burden rural safety-net institutions. The 5-year R01 research project proposed in this application will use a multi-method ethnographic approach to examine: (1) the process of introducing the reform in a rural and multiethnic state and (2) the degree to which the reform results in improved access and quality of care for low-income seriously mentally ill (SMI) patients in public mental health programs and other safety-net institutions.  This longitudinal study has three specific aims: (1) To examine changes in help-seeking behavior, access, and utilization of services by American Indian, Hispanic, and White SMI patients and their social supports (e.g., family and close peers) in three rural and three urban settings before, during, and after the reform. (2) To investigate changes in the work environment, attitudes, and behavior of frontline service providers and staff members of safety-net institutions in the targeted settings before, during, and after the reform. (3) To assess the impacts of the reform on the organization and financial condition of safety-net institutions in the targeted settings and statewide.  Our multi-method ethnographic research strategy will employ both qualitative and quantitative methods in two sets of studies, conducted prior to and after the reform is implemented. The first set, consisting of administrative database reviews and ethnographic interviews and observations with SMI patients and frontline service providers, will describe changes in patterns of mental health care utilization and provider behavior. These studies will occur in three rural counties and three comparison urban counties. The second set, consisting of ethnographic interviews with state policymakers and structured surveys with clinical directors of rural and urban safety-net institutions, will identify changes in service provision for the SMI statewide. This latter statewide component will facilitate linking of the community-level ethnographic data with broader system change.  The proposed ethnographic assessment of New Mexico's reform will offer new practical knowledge, grounded in the actual experiences of diverse stakeholders, that may improve state mental health policy for rural and minority SMI populations. In collaboration with the State of New Mexico, we will assess whether the reform decreases barriers to   care for these underserved groups and how it affects the viability of existing services rendered in safety-net institutions.  This research will fill a gap in research on statewide assessments of public health care initiatives, which do not typically focus on patient help-seeking behavior and the unique access and utilization problems faced by rural, racial and ethnic minorities. Since rural states may turn to the New Mexico reform as a model to reduce administrative costs and service fragmentation and to increase access for the SMI, this research is of great national relevance.

"CBPR on Active Living and Recovery for Racial/Ethnic Groups with Mental Illness    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project uses community-based participatory research (CBPR) to examine the pathways of active living toward recovery and the promotion of health and life quality for urban-dwelling culturally diverse groups of people with mental illness (CDGPMI). Our pre-application community-based work has led to a formal partnership agreement with various community partners representing mental health advocacy, mental health care and research, and mental health policy-making at local, regional, or national levels. Based on the CBPR principle, we will maintain: (a) mutual respect and trust; (b) team-work and equitable participation; (c) co- learning and collective capacity-building; (d) power-sharing and co-ownership of research; (e) a community- oriented bottom-up approach (rather than a top/university-down approach); (f) the integration and synthesis of expertise and resources of CBPR team members; (g) the sustainable development of partnership; (h) a trans- disciplinary and cross-domain approach that overrides the academic-community-practice boundaries; and (i) collective empowerment and proactive actions toward social change. This partnership, along with our Advisory Council including other stakeholders (e.g., culture and mental health advocates), will guide our team to conduct mixed-method studies. First, we will conduct a pilot survey study with CDGPMI (n = 112) to collect preliminary baseline data on the association of leisure behavior (as a context for active living) with recovery, health, and life quality. Then, we will conduct an in-depth multiple case study, using periodical interviews and photovoice with African, Hispanic, Asian, and Caucasian Americans with mental illness (n = 40) who are purposefully chosen based on the survey study findings. This case study will give voices to those individuals about recovery-oriented health and life-quality promotion through active living (with emphasis on actively engaged leisure) from a holistic and ecological perspective, by recognizing cultural, environmental, and mental health care factors, as well as secondary conditions (e.g., social isolation, obesity). Interviews with primary support/care-givers for these individuals will also be conducted to gain additional outsider perspectives. The case-study findings will guide us to develop a CBPR-informed and evidence-based conceptual framework that identifies key personal, social, cultural, and environmental (including mental health care systems) pathways through which active living mediates the processes toward recovery and the promotion of health and life quality for CDGPMI (particularly, through enjoyable and meaningful leisure behavior). This R21 project will lead to our R01 to develop and test/evaluate a recovery-focused active-living and health/life-quality-promotion intervention program for CDGPMI. Our overall research program is relevant to the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH)'s mission to reduce the burden of mental illness through improving health behaviors and daily functioning of persons with mental disorders (with emphasis on active living and its role in promoting recovery, health, and life quality), and deliver more effective personalized mental health care across diverse populations. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: A major contribution of this research is that the project will generate rich and in-depth data/evidence from a culturally diverse sample of urban-dwelling individuals with mental illness based on their lived experiences and perspectives to better conceptualize the roles of active living (particularly, active leisure involvements) in the processes toward their recovery and the promotion of health and life quality. This new data/evidence will extend and advance the existing knowledge in the literature about recovery and health/life-quality promotion among individuals with mental illness by better articulating the mediating roles of active living in the pathways toward recovery-oriented health/life-quality promotion. Importantly, our overall research program links and integrates the domain of recovery and mental health/illness research with the domain of active living and health/life-quality promotion research conceptually, methodologically, and practically. The knowledge/evidence generated from our research will be translated to person-centered, holistic, and strengths-based mental health care practices in communities through the form of a recovery-focused active-living, health-promotion, and life- quality-enhancement intervention program.              Project Narrative A major contribution of this research is that the project will generate rich and in-depth data/evidence from a culturally diverse sample of urban-dwelling individuals with mental illness based on their lived experiences and perspectives to better conceptualize the roles of active living (particularly, active leisure involvements) in the processes toward their recovery and the promotion of health and life quality.

"Bronx Youth Partnership on Mental Health Disparities    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): For the past two years, AECOM's Preventive Intervention Research Center has been the lead agency for a Bronx community coalition, led by adolescents, ""Albert's Leaders of Tomorrow"" (A.L.O.T.). It used CPBR to identify mental health disparities as the most important to address among minority inner-city adolescents, and with a Coalition of 48 community agencies, it developed BxThunder, a mental health intervention. We plan to conduct a randomized controlled trial of BxThunder in 3 community agencies: Mosholu-Montefiore Community Center, Wildcat Academy, and Citizen's Advice Bureau. BxThunder has three parts: PART I. TEEN is an award-winning positive youth development program that improves mental health and trains teens to be peer educators; PART II. graduates will join ""ALOTMore"" and implement a multimedia workshop in Bronx agencies to teach about mental health and reduce stigma; PART III. teens in BxThunder who need mental health services will receive them on site from clinical psychologists and externs from three community partners, Lehman College CUNY, Wurzweiler School of Social Work, and Ferkauf Graduate School of Psychology. We will conduct an intent-to-treat randomized controlled trial of BxThunder. We will recruit 240 teens at each site (n=720 total), and randomize them to receive BxThunder or standard care. Teens will be interviewed at baseline and 6- and 12-months later. Outcome measures are positive mental health (Resiliency Scales for Adolescents, RSCA; The Self-Perception Profile for Adolescents, SPPA) and psychological symptoms (Youth Self Report, YSR). Among symptomatic teens, we will assess the number of identified youth who received a referral for services; the number of those who implemented the referral; the number who are in or have completed services; and their mental health outcomes (symptoms) after treatment. The Specific Aims are to test the hypotheses that compared to control teens:   (1) teens in BxThunder will experience fewer mental health symptoms;   (2) teens in BxThunder will experience a greater increase in positive mental health;   (3) teens with psychological problems in BxThunder are more likely to have a successful referral for care, and are more likely to complete treatment;   (4) teens in BxThunder with psychological problems will experience a larger reduction in psychological symptoms;   (5) the BxCAM workshop will increase knowledge and decrease stigma among those who attend, as measured by change in pre-test and post-test measures of workshop attendees.   A sustainability project will be designed and implemented by Affinity Health Plan in conjunction with the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene.           ",Bronx Youth Partnership on Mental Health Disparities,7779521,R24MD001784,"['Counseling ', ' Educational Curriculum ', ' Curriculum ',

"Feasible Delivery of CBT for Rural Latino Youth with Anxiety    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Children with anxiety disorders are often characterized by an unmet need for treatment however, in special populations such as Latino and rural youth, such disparities are compounded by the effects of culture and geographic isolation. More specifically, barriers related to language, stigma, and access often lead to lower rates of utilization and poorer outcomes among children in need of mental health services (Alvidrez and Azocar, 1999; McCabe et al., 2002; Myers et al., 2008; Vega et al., 2001). These findings are disappointing given abundant data supporting the effectiveness of cognitive behavior and behavior therapies for children with anxiety disorders (Barrett et al., 1996; Beidel et al., 2007; Kendall & Southam-Gerow, 1996; Walkup et al., 2008). Efforts to examine feasible methods to deliver evidence-based treatments to children with anxiety disorders are critical in order to extend quality care to underserved groups. The goal of this R34 is to address these disparities, by translating and tailoring an existing child anxiety cognitive behavior therapy program (The Cool Kids Outreach Program; Lyneham and Rapee, 2006), to fit the needs of Spanish-speaking rural families and examining the feasibility, acceptability, tolerability and safety of implementing this intervention using varying modes of delivery. Qualitative methodologies which include focus groups with bicultural and bilingual mental health providers and individual interviews with rural Latino parents will be used to examine the acceptability and cultural appropriateness of the intervention. Using these findings and other extant literature, an expert panel guided by a cultural adaptation framework (Lau, 2006), will determine the extent to which tailoring of the Cool Kids Outreach Program is necessary. Next, a pilot study for children (age 8-13) with anxiety disorders (i.e., separation anxiety disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, social anxiety disorder, and specific phobias) will be conducted and 40 children will be randomized to two service delivery modes which represent varying levels of therapist contact: 1) 20 families will be randomized to a telephone-based, therapist- supported CBT program, and; 2) 20 families will be randomized to a more minimal contact bilbiotherapy condition (primarily CBT self-help materials). All families will be recruited from primary care settings, given its defacto mental health service status. Feasibility and clinical outcomes will be measured at baseline, midtreatment and post-treatment. Additionally, during exit interviews, participants (as well as those who may have dropped out of the program) will be asked to discuss the perceived usefulness, acceptability, and impact of the intervention. This pilot study will provide important data regarding the feasibility, acceptability, tolerability and safety of the intervention conditions as well as the opportunity to pilot procedures that will be used in a larger effectiveness trial with rural Latino youth.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This R34 proposal will incorporate the perspectives of family and community mental health providers, to tailor, as necessary, an evidence based treatment for child anxiety disorders, in order to meet the needs of a hard-to- reach group (i.e., rural Latino youth). The pilot study will examine the feasibility of new modes of service delivery (e.g., a minimal therapist contact, self-help program, and a more intensive therapist supported, telephone-based approach) that may ultimately improve access to evidence based treatments and mental health outcomes among underserved groups.

"Understanding Mechanisms of Mental Health Care Disparities    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Racial/ethnic disparities in mental health care, in relative terms, exceed disparities in many other areas of health care services, with African-Americans and Hispanics accessing mental health care at only half the rate of non-Hispanic Whites, even after accounting for mental health status. These disparities in service use likely contribute to the greater persistence, severity, and disease burden of mental disorder among African- Americans and Latinos. In this proposed study, we fulfill a need for direct, easily understandable information about the mechanisms underlying disparities in mental health care services. We improve upon previous research by assessing racial/ethnic disparities in episodes of care rather than cross-sectional data, allowing us to understand factors related to initiation, duration, intensity, and quality of care that are more closely linked with the actual behaviors of patients and providers. In addition, we propose the first comprehensive look at the contribution of geographic disparities to racial/ethnic disparities in mental health care, distinguishing disparities due to the state and neighborhood where an individual lives from disparities due to individual characteristics and identifying area-level characteristics that are amenable to policy change. Finally, we develop, in collaboration with policymakers, a mental health care disparities index that provides an easy to understand state-by-state comparison of mental health care disparities to directly inform policymakers' disparities reduction interventions. Our specific aims are to:     1. Assess disparities in initiation, intensity, duration, and quality of mental health  care episodes     2. Assess role of geography in disparities identifying area-level correlates of mental  health service use     3. Develop indices of disparities in states' mental health care expenditure and quality.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: In this project, we attempt to identify and understand the underlying mechanisms driving racial/ethnic disparities in mental health care episodes. Our focus in this project is to use state-of-the-art methods of disparity research, improving upon previous studies by incorporating longitudinal and neighborhood-level data on mental health care treatment. We aim to translate our findings to provide directly useable information to policymakers on how to reduce mental health care disparities, including the development of a mental health care disparities index, a state-by-state comparison of disparities in mental health care expenditures and quality.              Project Narrative In this project, we attempt to identify and understand the underlying mechanisms driving racial/ethnic disparities in mental health care episodes.

"Understanding Health Disparities in the Progression of Type 2 Diabetes    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): It is well-established that modifiable, lifestyle-related behaviors including smoking, alcohol, diet, and physical activity greatly contribute to the risk of most common physical health conditions. The recent, almost epidemic increase in the prevalence of diseases associated with these health behaviors, especially hypertension, type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease (CVD), and growing disparities in the burden of these conditions across racial and ethnic groups, highlights the urgency of developing effective prevention strategies - however, few intervention studies have produced long-term changes in lifestyle and behaviors. Addressing an omission in existing behavioral intervention models, we propose that what is needed is an examination of behavioral change in the context of the interrelationships among health behaviors, sources of and coping responses to chronic stress, and their influence on physical and mental health. This proposal is motivated by a robust literature that indicates blacks in the US are more likely to engage in poor health behaviors (i.e., tobacco smoking, diets high in fat and carbohydrates, excessive alcohol use) and, expectedly, experience disproportionate burdens of common physical health conditions associated with these behaviors, including CVD and diabetes, relative to non-Hispanic whites - paradoxically, however, population-based and clinic studies have consistently found that blacks, in comparison to whites, have the same or lower rates of most mental disorders, even while experiencing higher rates of psychological distress. We theorize that a defined set of health-related stress-coping strategies (i.e., tobacco smoking, diets high in fat and carbohydrates, excessive alcohol use, etc) have a two-pronged effect that helps to account for this counterintuitive patterning. First, we suggest that these behaviors act on the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and related stress- hormonal systems which influences the subjective experience and development of stress-associated psychiatric disorder. Second, we believe that the effects of these poor behaviors on pathophysiology, combined with direct effects of stressful living conditions over the life-course, contribute to disproportionate burden of chronic physical health problems among blacks. Succinctly, we propose that blacks and other individuals from highly stressed populations ""buy"" their relative, comparatively positive rates of mental disorders at the expense of their deteriorating physical health. Therefore, this framework suggests that adherence to traditional preventative care, specifically involving changes in behavioral lifestyle, can lead to a perverse result: improvements in physical health but worsening of mental health. We will extend this line of research and assess the effect of traditional preventative care among three categories of type 2 diabetes patients: 1) pre- or borderline; 2) early onset; and, 3) poorly-controlled. In the proposed accelerated longitudinal design we will examine the inter-relationships among stress, health behaviors, and physical and mental health at three distinct points of diabetes progression.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Type 2 diabetes and its associated risk factors such as hypertension and heart disease continue to top the domestic and international public health agendas. The diagnoses of these conditions are invariably followed by recommendations for extensive behavioral modifications. In all cases rates of long-term adherence to recommended healthy behavioral changes are spotty at best, both intra-and inter-individually. We believe that physical and mental health disparities are linked to the lack of behavioral change adherence. The findings of this study will help anticipate, understand, and identify informal and formal programs and public health policies needed to address the physical and mental health challenges facing the growing epidemic of related cardiovascular and metabolic disorders in the U.S. and other developed and developing countries.             Type 2 diabetes and its associated risk factors such as hypertension and heart disease continue to top the domestic and international public health agendas.

"The Recognition and Referral of Mental Disorders within Religious Congregations    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Religious congregations are often the first and only point of contact for help with mental health problems. As community gatekeepers, religious congregations can play a powerful role in linking individuals to needed mental health treatment. However, religious congregations often do not know when, how, or where to consult with mental health providers. Thus, although recognized as invaluable counterparts that can connect informal and formal systems of care, religious congregations remain a grossly untapped resource, particularly for underserved ethnic minority populations for whom there are significant disparities in access, use, and quality of mental health care. A more standardized process on how to enhance religious congregations' recognition of mental disorders and collaboration with mental health providers is needed. As an initial step, the proposed study aims to lay the foundation for an intervention that enhances congregational practices around mental health screening, referral, and consultation. The proposed study would be carried out in collaboration with a faith-based partner, West Angeles Church of God in Christ, which has over 24,000 congregants and is one of the largest Black ""mega-churches"" in the nation. Situated in South Los Angeles, West Angeles has extensive interactions with health, social welfare, and community organizations and provides more than 80 programs to enhance the community. West Angeles seeks to build the capacity of other congregations to engage in similar collaborative relationships and helps lead the Faith-based Community Collaborative, a network of over 300 local religious congregations. The proposed study has the following specific aims:  (1) Describe the range of congregational practices in addressing mental disorders  (2) Identify factors associated with religious congregations' receptivity to mental health screening, referral,  and consultation  (3) Develop a preliminary protocol to enhance the capacity of religious congregations' engagement in  mental health screening, referral, and collaboration For Aim 1, we will conduct focus groups with key stakeholders from a purposeful sample of religious congregations with varying organizational characteristics. For Aim 2, we will conduct a survey with the Collaborative to test hypotheses about predictors of receptivity to mental health screening, referral, and collaboration. For Aim 3, a subset of the Collaborative will convene as a workgroup to develop a preliminary intervention aimed at enhancing RCs mental health screening, referral, and consultation, based upon findings from Aims 1 and 2 and from the literature on quality improvement collaborative care mental health interventions. Using adapted modified Delphi methods, the Collaborative will review the preliminary plan, provide feedback, make revisions, and obtain consensus on a final set of recommendations that will be presented at stakeholder feedback sessions in preparation for future wide-scale implementation efforts.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Religious congregations are often the first and only point of contact for help with mental disorders. As community gatekeepers, religious congregations can play a powerful role in linking individuals to needed treatment, particularly for ethnic minorities who continue to experience significant disparities in mental health care access and utilization.

The proposed study would lay the groundwork for a preliminary intervention aimed at enhancing religious congregations' capacity to engage in mental health screening, referral, and collaboration.

"Supplement to the Center for Culture, Trauma, and Mental Health Disparities    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We are requesting supplemental funding to conduct secondary analyses of data collected and integrated from 5 studies nearing completion in the Collaborative Center for Trauma and Mental Health Disparities at UCLA (MH07345). Analyses will be based on comprehensive assessments of psychosocial factors relevant for mental health and related biological health risk indexes from 598 African American and Latino men and women. Using a sophisticated set of secondary data analytic techniques, we will describe mental health outcomes as they are predicted by a set of composite indexes of risks and resources over the life-course that may promote resilience and/or vulnerabilities in individuals at high risk. Domains include: (1) cumulative psychosocial burden of acute trauma and chronic psychosocial adversities in childhood and adulthood, (2) the cumulative burden of biological health risk indicators (BHRI) of allostatic load that are predicted to result from cumulative childhood and adulthood burdens of trauma and adversities, and (3) proposed protective resources (i.e. ethnic identify, religious well-being) that may moderate the relationships between cumulative psychosocial burden, cumulative BHRI burden and a composite mental health status index (i.e. depression/PTSD) in African Americans and Latinos. Analyses will be conducted on a sample of 598 adult African American and Latino men and women, including 228 African Americans (63 women, 165 men) and 370 Latinos (220 women, 150 men). Data were collected using laptops equipped with the Audio Computer-Assisted Self-Interview (ACASI) system augmented by private face to face interviews. Univariate and multivariate statistical methods will be used to develop predictor, moderator and mental health outcomes and to test a hypothesized predictive model of mental health status in this high-risk and understudied sample. This comprehensive, life-course approach offers a unique opportunity to identify multiple cumulative contributors to mental health disparities over time.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  We expect that our results will inform the value of using composite indexes of risk and resilience in estimating risk for mental health outcomes, identify potential ethnic and gender differences in vulnerability and resilience factors in predicting these outcomes, and identify possible targets for future intervention research to reduce racial/ethnic mental health disparities.               We expect that our results will inform the value of using composite indexes of risk and resilience in estimating risk for mental health outcomes, identify potential ethnic and gender differences in vulnerability and resilience factors in predicting these outcomes, and identify possible targets for future intervention research to reduce racial/ethnic mental health disparities.            ","Supplement to the Center for Culture, Trauma, and Mental Health Disparities",8137434,P50MH073453,"['Chronic stress ', ' ethnic difference ', ' Latino ', ' life course ', ' Life Cycle ', ' Life Cycle Stages ', ' sexual dimorphism (noncellular) ', ' gender difference ', ' Sex Differences ', ' Sex Characteristics ', ' Health Status ', ' Level of Health ', ' resilience ', ' traumatic neurosis ', ' Posttraumatic Stress Disorders ', ' Posttraumatic Neuroses ', ' Post-Traumatic Neuroses ', ' PTSD ', ' Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders ', ' computer based prediction ', ' predictive modeling ', ' interventions research ', ' intervention research ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' high risk ', ' Time ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Techniques ', ' Acute ', ' racial/ethnic ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' Outcome ', ' Individual ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' Data ', ' Testing ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Risk ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Woman ', ' Interview ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Biological ', ' indexing ', ' base ', ' Modeling ', ' Health ', ' Population ', ' Future ', ' computer aided ', ' Computer Assisted ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' youngster ', ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' well-being ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' Chronic ', ' Trauma ', ' Funding ', ' Event ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' Poverty ', ' Sampling ', ' psychosocial ', ' Risk Estimate ', ' laptop ', ' religious ', ' Religion and Spirituality ', ' trauma centers ', ' juvenile sex abuse ', ' childhood sexual abuse ', ' Molestation, Sexual, Child ', ' Child Sexual Abuse ', ' allostatic load ', ' critical developmental period ', ' Health Status Indicators ', ' Health Status Index ', ' psychosocial variables ', ' Psychosocial Factor ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,P50,2011,183868,0.1026214696930168
"Prevention of marital distress in low-income couples transitioning to parenthood    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Recent research has shown that the quality of marital relationships is inextricably linked to physical and mental health of the individuals in the relationship. Included in the wide-ranging negative health outcomes associated with marital distress, individuals in distressed marriages are at greater risk for mortality relative to spouses in non-distressed marriages (Robles & Kiecolt-Glaser, 2003). The impacts of marital distress do not end with the spouses in the marriage; children of distressed couples who are exposed to characteristically high levels of conflict suffer negative mental and physical health consequences, such as externalizing and internalizing problems, depression, anxiety, and physical problems (El-Sheikh, Hargar, & Whitson, 2001). Recent government initiatives take into account the importance of the marital relationship on children; the Healthy Marriage Initiative (2005) defined a healthy marriage as ""a mutually satisfying relationship that is beneficial to the husband, wife, and children."" The proposed prevention study seeks to intervene with couples during the transition to parenthood, a major life transition when marital satisfaction typically declines (Gottman & Notarius, 2002). A number of programs have been developed to prevent relationship and individual distress, but thus far no studies have examined effects of such programs in low-income couples. Given that low-income couples are at greater risk for a host of intra- and interpersonal problems, and often have unique circumstances and stressors that are not addressed in existing prevention programs (Karney & Bradbury, 2005), this proposal is timely. This study will examine the immediate and longitudinal effectiveness of a brief, cost-effective, preventive intervention designed for low-income couples during the transition to parenthood. Comparing Integrative Behavioral Couple Therapy (Jacobson & Christensen, 1998), an empirically supported treatment for couples, to treatment as usual in obstetrics clinics at a county hospital, this research will examine effects of the intervention on birth and infant health outcomes, as well as individual and relationship distress of the parents in a small sample of couples (N = 40 couples total). This study has important implications for public health. Given policy-makers' aims to support low-income couples in maintaining healthy marriages, it is imperative that interventions be implemented and researched in low-income communities. This study has the potential to inform future interventions and policies that affect low-income couples in particular, thereby improving the health and well-being of both partners and their families. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: My research, coursework, and clinical experiences in psychology have helped me to determine my long-term goal of teaching and conducting clinical research in academia. My training goals for this fellowship are outlined below: 1) My first goal is to gain additional knowledge about cultural factors and mental health in low-income Latino families. I will audit a course in the School of Medicine, ""Hispanic Mental Health Issues and Treatment"" (Psychiatry M231, Prof. Morales), that will increase my knowledge of factors that are particularly important in clinical work with Spanish-speaking couples.

"Telemental Health to Improve Mental Health Care and Outcomes for Children in Unde    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The need for new models for delivering mental heath services within primary care (PC) has been recognized for two decades, yet federal funding to address this need has been lacking. Telemental health (TMH) programs are being implemented nationally to address inequities in access to mental health services, but little scientific evidence is available regarding their efficacy, particularly with children. The goal of the proposed research is to test the efficacy of a TMH service delivery model for improving care and outcomes for children with a prevalent psychiatric condition who are treated by primary care physicians (PCPs) in 5 underserved communities in the Pacific Northwest. The research proposed is a randomized controlled trial of PCP care augmented by TMH-delivered evidence- based treatment of children (N=250) 7-11 years old diagnosed with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) versus treatment as usual by the PCP. Hispanic children will comprise 30% of the study sample. The experimental condition will consist of 6 pharmacotherapy sessions delivered by child psychiatrists through videoconferencing in conjunction with the referring PCP who will prescribe medications and 6 sessions of parent behavioral training delivered in-person by a community therapist supervised by a telepsychologist. The control condition will consist of treatment as usual with the PCP augmented by a single telepsychiatric consultation, which is current standard care in the participating communities. For children in both experimental and control conditions, hyperactivity, inattentiveness, oppositionality/defiance, and functional impairment, as well as parental stress, burden, and empowerment will be assessed 5 times from baseline to 25-week follow- up. In the experimental group, adherence to treatment protocols will be carefully monitored for families, telepsychiatrists, local community therapists, and PCPs. If under the experimental delivery model, improvements in clinical outcomes are demonstrated, and if an evidence-based treatment protocol can be implemented with fidelity, then TMH health service delivery models could be deployed with confidence to help rectify the severe geographic maldistribution of pediatric mental health services and to build new models of collaborative care within PC. This telemental health (TMH) investigation holds promise for improving the nation's public health and welfare in three ways. First, TMH offers children and families suffering with emotional and behavioral disorders help that cannot be found locally by redistributing specialty mental health care from urban centers to underserved communities. Second, TMH offers secondary and tertiary prevention by reaching children's in need prior to the full evolution of mental illness and its associated impairments. Third, TMH offers primary care physicians, teachers, and other professionals' assistance in their efforts to care for our nation's children.

"Culture, Context, and Mexican American Mental Health ABSTRACT  This proposal seeks 5 years of continued support for a longitudinal study of processes that contribute to the  high levels of psychopathology experienced by Mexican American youth. Consistent with priorities in the NIMH  Strategic Plan (2008), this study is designed to (1) chart mental illness trajectories of Mexican American youth,  (2) increase our capacity to predict who in this population is at risk for mental illness by identifying individual,  environmental, and social factors that contribute to both risk and resilience processes, (3) identify contributors  to the mental health disparities experienced by Mexican Americans, and (4) provide a scientific foundation for  the design of the next generation of preventive interventions for this population. Beginning with a diverse  sample of 750 Mexican American families, this study tests hypotheses regarding how interactions of  individuals' cultural orientations with characteristics of family, community, peer, and school contexts contribute  to the mental health burden of this population. A unique aspect of this study is the assessment of cultural  orientation (i.e., degree of endorsement of traditional Mexican cultural values and degree of endorsement of  U.S. cultural values) of children and parents as well as the degree to which communities and schools support  these cultural traditions. Children and their parents were assessed initially when children were in 5th and 7th  grades. Results supported the specific aims: (1) changes in children's and parents' cultural orientations are  related to greater risk for mental health disorders; (2) family characteristics, such as parent-child conflict,  mediate the relation between cultural orientation mismatches and children's psychopathology; and (3) child  and parent cultural orientations buffer relations between common risk factors (e.g., economic hardship) and  children's mental health. The proposed continuation will assess this sample of children and their parents as  youth experience the rapid developmental changes of middle adolescence (grades 10 and 12) when rates of  psychopathology accelerate. The specific aims remain: (1) cultural mismatches between children and family,  community, and school contexts will be related to risk for psychopathology; (2) family and peer group  processes will mediate relations between cultural mismatches and psychopathology; and (3) cultural  orientations of children and their parents will moderate relations between risk factors and psychopathology.  Longitudinal tests of these aims will provide a strong foundation for the next generation of prevention programs  to reduce mental health disparities for Mexican Americans. NARRATIVE  This longitudinal study of 750 Mexican American adolescents and their parents is important from a public  health standpoint because of the mental health disparities Mexican American adolescents experience, and the  limited knowledge about factors that contribute to these disparities. This study is designed to (1) chart mental  illness trajectories of Mexican American youth, (2) increase our capacity to predict who in this population is at  risk for mental illness by identifying individual, environmental, and social factors that contribute to both risk and  resilience processes, (3) identify contributors to the mental health disparities experienced by Mexican  Americans, and (4) provide a firm scientific foundation for the design of the next generation of preventive  interventions for this population in order to reduce the individual, family, and societal burden of  psychopathology within this population.","Culture, Context, and Mexican American Mental Health",8240265,R01MH068920,"['early adolescence ', ' Child Mental Health ', ' malleable risk ', ' girls ', ' Relative Risks ', ' deviant ', ' deviancy ', ' Parent-Child Relations ', ' parent offspring interaction ', ' parent child interaction ', ' Parent-Child Relationship ', ' Family Study ', ' Mexican Americans ', ' Chicanos ', ' Chicanas ', ' Mainstreaming (Education) ', ' achievement Mainstream Education ', ' Mainstreaming ', ' Educational Mainstreaming ', ' Foundations ', ' Left ', ' next generation ', ' Immigrant ', ' peer ', ' Individual ', ' Grant ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Adolescence ', ' teenage ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Sampling ', ' psychologic ', ' psychological ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Adherence (attribute) ', ' Adherence ', ' Source ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' recruit ', ' Outcome ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' CDC ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Phase ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' Site ', ' social ', ' experience ', ' Behavior ', ' Characteristics ', ' Communities ', ' Prevention program ', ' rural area ', ' Performance ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Schools ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Measures ', ' Drug usage ', ' drug use ', ' Persons ', ' Youth ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Social support ', ' social support network ', ' Prevalence ', ' Economics ', ' Income ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Mexican ', ' inner city ', ' cohesion ', ' Acculturation ', ' Cultural Assimilation ', ' Social Class ', ' Censuses ', ' resilience ', ' Psychopathology ', ' abnormal psychology ', ' high school ', ' boys ', ' Employment ', ' National Institute of Drug Abuse ', ' National Institute on Drug Abuse ', ' NIDA ', ' contextual factors ', ' Application Context ', ' Family Characteristics ', ' Biogenesis ', ' Origin of Life ', ' Developmental Process ', ' Parenting behavior ', ' Parenting ', ' National Institute of Mental Health (U.S.) ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' NIMH ', ' Belief ', ' time use ', ' Gender Role ', ' Sex Roles ', ' Low income ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' therapy design ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' Mental disorders ', ' psychological disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Conflict (Psychology) ', ' Conflict ', ' Strategic Planning ', ' Records ', ' teacher ', ' Buffers ', ' Substance abuse problem ', ' substance abuse ', ' abuse of substances ', ' Conduct Disorder ', ' disorders of conduct ', ' disorder of conduct ', ' Mediating ', ' Link ', ' Research ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Event ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' meetings ', ' Adolescent ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Process ', ' Data ', ' Knowledge ', ' Environment ', ' Research Design ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Risk ', ' Parents ', ' success ', ' Modeling ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Population ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' cultural values ', ' Family ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' Group Processes ', ' social group process ', ' Social Change ', ' Social transformation ', ' Social modification ', ' Peer Group ', ' suburb ', ' suburbia ', ' suburban ', ' Cultural Characteristics ', ' ']",NIMH,ARIZONA STATE UNIVERSITY-TEMPE CAMPUS,R01,2011,50456,0.05000922608620424
"Development of an international cultural neuroscience consortium    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): By 2050, nearly one in five Americans (19%) will be an immigrant, including Hispanics, Blacks and Asians, compared with one in eight (12%) in 2005 (Pew Research Center, 2008). Prior research indicates the prevalence of population mental health disparities across ethnic and racial minority groups. The Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies (2009) estimates that eliminating racial/ethnic minority health disparities would have reduced indirect costs in the United States associated with illness and premature death by more than $1 trillion between 2003 and 2006 alone. Given this increase in cultural diversity within the United States and the existence of costly population health disparities across cultural groups, it is essential to develop a more sophisticated understanding of how culture affects basic psychological and biological mechanisms underlying mental health across diverse communities as well as how such basic research in culture and health can be translated in applied settings to reduce population health disparities in quality and access to treatment for illness.  The goal of the proposed grant is to implement a series of scientific meetings and infrastructural initiatives to create interdisciplinary teams of basic behavioral and social scientists that adopt a cultural neuroscience approach to addressing questions central to culture and health, particularly global mental health and population mental health disparities. Our goal is to create and sustain an international, interdisciplinary community of scientists that will allow for the acceleration, expansion, and strengthening of the scope of investigation in the emerging field of cultural neuroscience as well as to increase the sophistication of theoretical, methodological, and analytical approaches in cultural neuroscience.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of the proposed grant is to implement a series of scientific meetings and infrastructural initiatives to create interdisciplinary teams of behavioral and social scientists that adopt a cultural neuroscience approach to addressing questions central to culture and health, particularly global mental health and population mental health disparities.            The goal of the proposed grant is to implement a series of scientific meetings and infrastructural initiatives to create interdisciplinary teams of behavioral and social scientists that adopt a cultural neuroscience approach to addressing questions central to culture and health, particularly global mental health and population mental health disparities.          ",Development of an international cultural neuroscience consortium,8205636,R13DA033065,"['Immigrant ', ' Indirect Costs ', ' Facilities and Administrative Costs ', ' Psychology ', ' Videoconferences ', ' Fertility/Fertilization ', ' Fertilization ', ' racial/ethnic ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' Neurosciences ', ' prematurity ', ' premature ', ' social ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Behavioral ', ' Research ', ' Emotional ', ' United States ', ' Prevalence ', ' Address ', ' Personality ', ' Biological ', ' member ', ' Travel ', ' Health ', ' Scientist ', ' Goals ', ' conference ', ' symposium ', ' website ', ' web site ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' healthcare service availability ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare access availability ', ' health services availability ', ' health care service availability ', ' health care service access ', ' health care availability ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Availability of Health Services ', ' Accessibility of health care ', ' Access to Healthcare ', ' Access to Health Care ', ' Access to Care ', ' Investigation ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Multidisciplinary Research ', ' Multidisciplinary Collaboration ', ' Interdisciplinary Research ', ' Interdisciplinary Study ', ' Adopted ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Affect ', ' Communities ', ' Grant ', ' novel ', ' International ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Societies ', ' Series ', ' psychological ', ' psychologic ', ' meetings ', ' Translating ', ' Collaborations ', ' psychological disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Articulation ', ' Joints ', ' Basic Research ', ' Basic Science ', ' American ', ' Mental Hygiene Services ', ' Mental Health Services ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Hispanics ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' QOC ', ' Quality of Care ', ' Population ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Social Psychology ', ' Neurosciences Research ', ' working group ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Faculty ', ' Students ', ' Acceleration ', ' oriental ', ' Asians ', ' population health ', ' Economics ', ' affective neuroscience ', ' Videoconferencing ', ' minority health ', ' social neuroscience ', ' Multiculturalism ', ' Cultural Diversity ', ' Basic Behavioral and Social Science Research ', ' ']",NIDA,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY,R13,2011,50000,0.10080106188072521
"Bronx Youth Partnership on Mental Health Disparities    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): For the past two years, AECOM's Preventive Intervention Research Center has been the lead agency for a Bronx community coalition, led by adolescents, ""Albert's Leaders of Tomorrow"" (A.L.O.T.). It used CPBR to identify mental health disparities as the most important to address among minority inner-city adolescents, and with a Coalition of 48 community agencies, it developed BxThunder, a mental health intervention. We plan to conduct a randomized controlled trial of BxThunder in 3 community agencies: Mosholu-Montefiore Community Center, Wildcat Academy, and Citizen's Advice Bureau. BxThunder has three parts: PART I. TEEN is an award-winning positive youth development program that improves mental health and trains teens to be peer educators; PART II. graduates will join ""ALOTMore"" and implement a multimedia workshop in Bronx agencies to teach about mental health and reduce stigma; PART III. teens in BxThunder who need mental health services will receive them on site from clinical psychologists and externs from three community partners, Lehman College CUNY, Wurzweiler School of Social Work, and Ferkauf Graduate School of Psychology. We will conduct an intent-to-treat randomized controlled trial of BxThunder. We will recruit 240 teens at each site (n=720 total), and randomize them to receive BxThunder or standard care. Teens will be interviewed at baseline and 6- and 12-months later. Outcome measures are positive mental health (Resiliency Scales for Adolescents, RSCA; The Self-Perception Profile for Adolescents, SPPA) and psychological symptoms (Youth Self Report, YSR). Among symptomatic teens, we will assess the number of identified youth who received a referral for services; the number of those who implemented the referral; the number who are in or have completed services; and their mental health outcomes (symptoms) after treatment. The Specific Aims are to test the hypotheses that compared to control teens:   (1) teens in BxThunder will experience fewer mental health symptoms;   (2) teens in BxThunder will experience a greater increase in positive mental health;   (3) teens with psychological problems in BxThunder are more likely to have a successful referral for care, and are more likely to complete treatment;   (4) teens in BxThunder with psychological problems will experience a larger reduction in psychological symptoms;   (5) the BxCAM workshop will increase knowledge and decrease stigma among those who attend, as measured by change in pre-test and post-test measures of workshop attendees.   A sustainability project will be designed and implemented by Affinity Health Plan in conjunction with the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene.           ",Bronx Youth Partnership on Mental Health Disparities,8034380,R24MD001784,"['Psychology ', ' Pre-Post Tests ', ' health training ', '

"Behavioral Health Screening in the Medical Home: Enhancing Cultural Competence    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Universal behavioral health screening in the pediatric medical home has the potential to reduce racial and ethnic mental health disparities as standardized tools can systematically identify all children with elevated problem behaviors and referrals can be made. Even when referrals are made, however, mental health services tend to be underutilized, particularly by racial and ethnic minority families and families raising very young children. Therefore, the first aim of the proposed research is to explore, within the context of the medical home, predictors of family follow-up with an on-site behavioral health consultant upon referral. Several factors, including child and family characteristics, parental depression, and parental worry about child behavior, will be explored as predictors (N=2000 parents of children under the age of 5 years). At least part of the disconnect between screening and referral practices and engagement in services may stem from cultural and linguistic barriers between providers and families. Thus, the second aim of the proposed research is to develop and evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness of a cultural competency intervention module to improve pediatric provider use of and comfort with behavioral health screening across racial and ethnic minorities. An intervention module that targets cultural and linguistic barriers to behavioral health screening will be developed and presented to providers in several primary care pediatric sites following a brief screening compliance training. While focusing on broadly defined cultural and linguistic competency, the training will emphasize issues relevant to working with Hispanic families given their growing population and documented disparities in preventive screening, referrals, and mental health care. Extant training programs will be adapted based on individual interviews and focus groups with pediatric providers and parents. It is hypothesized that pediatric provider training will result in improvements in screening completion rates across ethnically and racially diverse families, as well as providers' self- reported knowledge, beliefs, and attitudes toward screening and referral practices with racial and ethnic minorities.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The proposed research will contribute to (a) a better understanding of universal behavioral health screening practices within the pediatric medical home; and (b) ways of ensuring that screening practices serve their intended purpose of linking families, particularly underserved racial and ethnic minority families, with needed services. This research will help to elucidate barriers to behavioral health screening and referral practices within the pediatric medical home and explore avenues for improving these practices and reducing racial and ethnic disparities in mental health care.           ",Behavioral Health Screening in the Medical Home: Enhancing Cultural Competence,8222809,F31HD063344,"['Linguistics ', ' Linguistic ', ' brief intervention ', ' brief treatment ', ' brief therapy ', ' 5 year old ', ' five year old ', ' age 5 years ', ' Roter ', ' Age ', ' Caring ', ' Time ', ' Provider ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Services ', ' Population ', ' sex ', ' Modeling ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Self-Report ', ' tool ', ' Ensure ', ' Consultations ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' early childhood ', ' American ', ' improved ', ' base ', ' Outcome ', ' Minority ', ' theories ', ' Parents ', ' Literature ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Medical ', ' Family ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' Knowledge ', ' Work ', ' Communication ', ' Physicians ', ' Guidelines ', ' Site ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Patients ', ' Link ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' stem ', ' Risk Factors ', ' follow-up ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' Categories ', ' Child health care ', ' Child Health ', ' Characteristics ', ' Training ', ' Screening procedure ', ' screenings ', ' screening ', ' programs ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Freedom ', ' Liberty ', ' Attitude ', ' Translating ', ' Individual ', ' Research ', ' Medical Records ', ' Insurance Coverage ', ' Insurance Status ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' Underserved Population ', ' underserved people ', ' under served population ', ' Huntington Disease ', ' Progressive Chorea, Hereditary, Chronic (Huntington) ', ' Huntingtons Disease ', "" Huntington's Disease Pathway "", "" Huntington's Disease "", "" Huntington's "", ' Huntington Chorea ', ' Child Behavior ', ' Academy ', ' Pediatrics ', ' Effectiveness of Interventions ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Primary Care ', ' Family Characteristics ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' racial/ethnic ', ' post intervention ', ' Problem behavior ', ' behavioral problem ', ' behavioral health ', ' public health relevance ', ' Language ', ' Training Programs ', ' Mental Health Services ', ' Mental Hygiene Services ', ' Belief ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Interview ', ' Hispanics ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Childhood ', ' pediatric ', ' Health Services ', ' health care service ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Visit ', ' United States Dept. of Health and Human Services ', ' United States Department of Health and Human Services ', ' Department of Health and Human Services ', ' falls ', ' pediatrician ', ' Federal Government ', ' National Government ', ' brief screening ', ' Preventive screening ', ' minority health ', ' cultural competence ', ' ']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF MASSACHUSETTS BOSTON,F31,2011,28909,0.03797443409223083
"Environmental health disparities research in NOCEMHD DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this application is to establish the Contextual Health Disparities-Core (COHD) in the Northern Manhattan Center of Excellence in Minority Health and Health Disparities at Columbia University (NOCEMHD) in response to RFA-MD-11-008, ""Limited Competition: NIMHD Revision Applications to Support Environmental Health Disparities Research (P60)."" The COHD will be established through a partnership with the Center for Study of Social Inequalities and Health (CSSIH) at the Mailman School of Public Health (MSPH), (director, Bruce Link, PhD). The leader of the COHD will be Dr. Link. The co-leader of this core will be Dr. Dana March. Research in NOCEMHD has focused on cohort studies and clinical trials examining determinants of minority health at the individual level, particularly in our focus areas of cardiovascular conditions (diabetes, hypertension), mental health (cognition, depression), and their coexistence. However, environmental factors interact with individual level factors to determine health outcomes in cardiovascular conditions and mental health. We refer to these factors as Health Disparity Environmental Factors (HDEF). We will collect a battery of validated measures of these HDEF used by the CSSIH in 4 ongoing NOCEMHD studies: The Northern Manhattan Study of Metabolism and Mental Health (NOMEM), The Northern Manhattan Community Outreach Project (NOCHOP), The Northern Manhattan Caregiver Intervention Project (NOCIP), and The Counseling Adults to Control Hypertension Study . (COACH). NOMEM is a cohort study. COACH, NOCHOP, and NOCIP are clinical trials. Our specific aims (SA) are: SA 1: To examine in NOMEM cross-sectional analyses the respective contributions of HDEF at the national, state, city, neighborhood, and individual levels to proximal behavioral and biological risk and protective factors for diabetes and depression in a midlife Hispanic population; SA2: To examine how HDEF at the national, state, city, neighborhood, and individual levels modify the response to the community-based interventions in COACH, NOCHOP, and NOCIP. The rich data collected with support from this application will be part of our data and biospecimen repository (DBR) managed by the NOCEMHD Research Core.

"Cultural Development of an Adolescent Mental Health Quality of Life Instrument    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Improving health related quality of life (HRQOL) is a major goal in the treatment of all chronic illnesses. In addition, there is growing consensus that assessment of quality of life is crucial to provide a complete picture of children's physical and mental health status. To our knowledge there are no HRQOL instruments specifically developed for adolescents with mental health problems. Therefore, the central goal of the proposed application is to develop, test, and validate an adolescent HRQOL instrument for mental health [AQOL-MH) in Spanish and English. This will provide a culturally valid outcome measure that will contribute to reduce mental health care disparities. This instrument will help mental health professionals focus on particular HRQOL domains during the diagnostic process; thereby assisting both patients and providers set, define and evaluate adequate treatment goals. This proposal presents a unique opportunity for a young faculty with extensive experience in behavioral sciences research, to advance her career and obtain independent funding. The ultimate objective of this proposal is to develop ah RO1 application to administer the AQOL-MH to representative clinical samples in order to target its usefulness in evaluating clinical effectiveness in treatment programs and interventions. The specific aims of this proposal are the following:      Aim 1: To develop themes that respond to the construct of quality of life as perceived by adolescents who are receiving services for mental health problems in Puerto Rican and Mexican American, as well as Anglo populations. The development will be achieved using a grounded theory approach with the use of focus groups and in-depth interviews of clinical samples of Latino and US non-Latino youth who are recruited to have one of four prevalent mental disorders; ADHD, Conduct Disorder, Generalized Anxiety, and Depression.      Aim 2: To test the psychometric properties of the measure developed in Aim 1 using clinical and nonclinical samples of youth from Puerto Rico and the US. Psychometric analyses will include assessments of internal structure, tests for differential item functioning across Latino and non-Latino as well as gender groups, and preliminary tests of construct validity.      Aim 3: Test the usefulness of the short-form AQOL-MH for tracking change during the course of service use in evidence based practice among youth with ADHD and Depression disorders in Puerto Rico. To achieve this aim we will recruit 60 youth who begin to receive treatment and we will obtain a baseline and two repeated assessments of HRQOL at six month intervals.          ",Cultural Development of an Adolescent Mental Health Quality of Life Instrument,8132871,SC1HD060888,"['racial and ethnic disparities ', ' Generic Drugs ', ' generic ', ' Nonproprietary Drugs ', ' Behavioral Sciences ', ' Mental Health Services ', ' Mental Hygiene Services ', ' Population ', ' Caring ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Evidence based practice ', ' Knowledge ', ' instrument ', ' Psychometrics ', ' Clinical ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Services ', ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Symptoms ', ' Treatment Protocols ', ' Treatment Schedule ', ' Treatment Regimen ', ' Health ', ' Sampling ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Testing ', ' Outcome ', ' Process ', ' Schools ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Research ', ' Measures ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Anxiety ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Evaluation ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Life ', ' Exhibits ', ' theories ', ' Measurement ', ' Faculty ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' Provider ', ' Categories ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' improved ', ' career ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' recruit ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' chronic disorder ', ' chronic disease/disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Adolescent ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Property ', ' LOINC Axis 2 Property ', ' Data ', ' Individual ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' experience ', ' Patients ', ' Structure ', ' Mental disorders ', ' psychological disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Chronic ', ' Goals ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Work ', ' Modeling ', ' Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ', ' attention deficit hyperactive disorder ', ' Predominantly Hyperactive-Impulsive Type Hyperactivity Disorder ', ' Predominantly Hyperactive-Impulsive Type Attention-Deficit Disorder ', ' Hyperkinetic Syndrome ', ' Hyperactivity Disorder NOS ', ' ADHD ', ' AD/HD ', ' physical conditioning ', ' physical health ', ' Friends ', ' Mexican Americans ', ' Chicanos ', ' Chicanas ', ' treatment program ', ' Health Status ', ' Level of Health ', ' Treatment Effectiveness ', ' health related quality of life ', ' Gender ', ' Latino ', ' disability ', ' Consensus ', ' Health Professional ', ' Healthcare professional ', ' Health Care Professional ', ' Major Depressive Disorder ', ' major depression ', ' Asthma ', ' Bronchial Asthma ', ' Persons ', ' Outcome Measure ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Interview ', ' Youth ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Funding ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Time ', ' Adolescent Development ', ' Clinical effectiveness ', ' Puerto Rico ', ' Generalized Anxiety Disorder ', ' Conduct Disorder ', ' disorders of conduct ', ' disorder of conduct ', ' Quality-of-Life Assessment ', ' Puerto Rican ', ' ']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF PUERTO RICO MED SCIENCES,SC1,2011,285120,0.056756824954850266
"A novel post-disaster mental health training for black communities    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The disparities in disaster-related mental health problems highlight the highlighted the need for local pre-disaster planning in black communities living in high stress areas. Training in Post Disaster Mental Health in Black Communities is a train the trainer, group-level intervention designed to improve the local disaster mental health readiness. HERMES' Phase I study developed a training package based on needs assessment. The results indicate that the training of both clinical providers and community leaders is a promising model for integrating culturally appropriate mental health in local response strategies.

"Telemental Health to Improve Mental Health Care and Outcomes for Children in Unde    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The need for new models for delivering mental heath services within primary care (PC) has been recognized for two decades, yet federal funding to address this need has been lacking. Telemental health (TMH) programs are being implemented nationally to address inequities in access to mental health services, but little scientific evidence is available regarding their efficacy, particularly with children. The goal of the proposed research is to test the efficacy of a TMH service delivery model for improving care and outcomes for children with a prevalent psychiatric condition who are treated by primary care physicians (PCPs) in 5 underserved communities in the Pacific Northwest. The research proposed is a randomized controlled trial of PCP care augmented by TMH-delivered evidence- based treatment of children (N=250) 7-11 years old diagnosed with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) versus treatment as usual by the PCP. Hispanic children will comprise 30% of the study sample. The experimental condition will consist of 6 pharmacotherapy sessions delivered by child psychiatrists through videoconferencing in conjunction with the referring PCP who will prescribe medications and 6 sessions of parent behavioral training delivered in-person by a community therapist supervised by a telepsychologist. The control condition will consist of treatment as usual with the PCP augmented by a single telepsychiatric consultation, which is current standard care in the participating communities. For children in both experimental and control conditions, hyperactivity, inattentiveness, oppositionality/defiance, and functional impairment, as well as parental stress, burden, and empowerment will be assessed 5 times from baseline to 25-week follow- up. In the experimental group, adherence to treatment protocols will be carefully monitored for families, telepsychiatrists, local community therapists, and PCPs. If under the experimental delivery model, improvements in clinical outcomes are demonstrated, and if an evidence-based treatment protocol can be implemented with fidelity, then TMH health service delivery models could be deployed with confidence to help rectify the severe geographic maldistribution of pediatric mental health services and to build new models of collaborative care within PC. This telemental health (TMH) investigation holds promise for improving the nation's public health and welfare in three ways. First, TMH offers children and families suffering with emotional and behavioral disorders help that cannot be found locally by redistributing specialty mental health care from urban centers to underserved communities. Second, TMH offers secondary and tertiary prevention by reaching children's in need prior to the full evolution of mental illness and its associated impairments. Third, TMH offers primary care physicians, teachers, and other professionals' assistance in their efforts to care for our nation's children.          ",Telemental Health to Improve Mental Health

"Trauma and Loss-Related Mental Health Needs of Latina Immigrants in Communities    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The PI, Stacey I. Kaltman, Ph.D., is a clinical psychologist who wishes to gain the skills and knowledge required to be an independent mental health services researcher focused on understanding and ameliorating disparities in access to and use of mental health services among low-income Latino immigrants in the US. The overall goal of this proposal is to gain an understanding of trauma and loss-related mental health needs of Latina immigrants from Central America and begin to develop culturally and linguistically competent services that are acceptable, effective, and accessible. This will be achieved via extensive training in Spanish as well as instruction in public health theory and methods. The specific training goals of the proposal are: 1) to increase cultural and linguistic competence to work with Latina immigrants with trauma exposure; 2) to utilize qualitative research methods to learn from the Latina immigrant's perspective about symptom perception, influences on help-seeking, and characteristics of culturally relevant interventions; 3) to apply formative research to the development and evaluation of community-based interventions; and 4) to enhance quantitative data analysis skills, building toward competence in longitudinal data analysis techniques that will be applied to intervention trials and program evaluations. The primary mentor will be Bonnie L. Green, PhD, with co-mentor Maria Cecilia Zea, PhD. Training will employ a balance of didactic coursework, mentored tutorials and critical discussions, and ongoing participation in research work groups. The research plan includes three studies, which encompass four research aims that relate directly to the training goals: 1) To study trauma and loss exposure and its mental health impact from the perspective of low-income Latina immigrants from Central America in community service settings; 2) To examine the mental and physical health correlates of trauma and loss exposure in a random sample of Central American immigrants who are engaged with community service settings; 3) To understand influences on symptom perception, predictors of help-seeking, and perceptions of culturally relevant trauma and loss-related mental health interventions among Central American immigrants; and 4) To develop and preliminarily pilot an adapted community-based intervention to address the specific trauma and loss-related mental health needs of Central American immigrants.           ",Trauma and Loss-Related Mental Health Needs of Latina Immigrants in Communities,8100403,K23MH077071,"['In-Migration ', ' Immigrations ', ' Intervention Trial ', ' Linguistics ', ' Linguistic ', ' Latino ', ' Instruction ', ' neglect ', ' Conflict (Psychology) ', ' Conflict ', ' Doctor of Philosophy ', ' PhD ', ' Ph.D. ', ' Poverty ', ' High Prevalence ', ' Low income ', ' Gender ', ' Psychologist ', ' Hispanics ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Perception ', ' Mental Health Services ', ' Mental Hygiene Services ', ' intervention program ', ' Competence ', ' Programmed Learning ', ' community setting ', ' Research Methodology ', ' Research Methods ', ' physical conditioning ', ' physical health ', ' Qualitative Research ', ' Communities ', ' Economics ', ' Woman ', ' War ', ' Work ', ' Symptoms ', ' social ', ' Methods ', ' base ', ' Techniques ', ' Equilibrium ', ' balance function ', ' balance ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' theories ', ' Mentors ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Risk ', ' Training ', ' Health Services ', ' health care service ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Services ', ' Immigrant ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Data Analysis ', ' experience ', ' Goals ', ' Characteristics ', ' Social support ', ' social support network ', ' Trauma ', ' Research ', ' Training Programs ', ' Clinical ', ' Address ', ' skills ', ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' working group ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Sampling ', ' Learning ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Knowledge ', ' Country ', ' Zea ', ' Program Evaluation ', ' community based evaluation ', ' help-seeking behavior ', ' help seeking ', ' Community Services ', ' Latina ', ' Latinas ', ' Central American ', ' Central America ', ' ']",NIMH,GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY,K23,2011,164471,0.07828981632926012
"Mental Health Services in the Education Sector: Effectiveness and Systemic Impact    DESCRIPTION (provided by candidate): The majority of youth in need of mental health interventions do not receive any services (Kataoka et al., 2002). This problem is particularly notable among low socioeconomic (SES) and ethnic minority youth, who are most likely to experience mental health problems, least likely to receive services, and are consequently more likely to suffer the deleterious effects of mental health problems (US DHHS, 2001). School-based prevention and intervention programs represent one of the most promising opportunities for reducing identified service gaps and disparities among youth because of the nearly universal nature of primary and secondary education. As the most common point of entry into a fragmented mental health system, efforts to improve school-based services and understand their implications for future care carry profound implications for overall public health (Farmer et al., 2003). The current application is designed to provide training in the skills necessary to build a long-term program of research investigating the role of school-based programs in addressing the unmet mental health needs of diverse groups of youth. My overarching goal is to move toward an independent research career in which I will apply sophisticated research methodologies to the study and remediation of mental health gaps and disparities and apply the findings to the development of a service delivery model. To accomplish these goals, I will engage in an intensive training experience that will combine individual mentorship, coursework, and field experiences. This training will inform and shape the analyses of a set of research questions pertaining to mental health service utilization and form the basis for a Career Development grant application. The primary research component of this project will take advantage of a rich, existing data set from a school-based prevention program for adolescent depression, the High School Transition Study (HSTS; McCauley et al., 2008), to conduct analyses beyond the scope of the original study. The proposed project will allow me to build expertise in the analysis of school-related factors that influence program effectiveness and to gain knowledge about the assessment of program impact on mental health service utilization across service sectors (e.g., specialty mental health, primary care, education). Results will provide information about how school-based interventions fit into the overall service delivery system, and their potential for reducing disparities in access to services and youth outcomes. My specific research aims include using the ethnically and socioeconomically diverse HSTS sample to explore how students' school attachment and support mediate intervention outcome and to examine the impact of HSTS program participation on the mental health service utilization of different groups of youth.           ",Mental Health Services in the Education Sector: Effectiveness and Systemic Impact,8078945,F32MH086978,"['Effectiveness of Interventions ', ' Prevention program ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' Research Methodology ', ' Research Methods ', ' Mentorship ', ' satisfaction ', ' Youth ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' demographics ', ' Perception ', ' Health system ', ' depressive symptoms ', ' depressive ', ' depression symptom ', ' Emotional Depression ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Research ', ' Mediating ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Affect ', ' Knowledge ', ' Adolescent ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Time ', ' remediation ', ' Nature ', ' Outcome ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' medical specialties ', ' Specialty ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Shapes ', ' socioeconomics ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomic ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio economic ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' intervention program ', ' career ', ' Principal Investigator ', ' Schools ', ' Parents ', ' Participant ', ' Severities ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' programs ', ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Students ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Gender ', ' skills ', ' Goals ', ' Future ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Sampling ', ' Modeling ', ' Reporting ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Address ', ' Individual ', ' Applications Grants ', ' Grant Proposals ', ' Measures ', ' System ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' Services ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' experience ', ' Training ', ' Caring ', ' career development ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' healthcare service availability ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare access availability ', ' health services availability ', ' health care service availability ', ' health care service access ', ' health care availability ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Availability of Health Services ', ' Accessibility of health care ', ' Access to Healthcare ', ' Access to Health Care ', ' Access to Care ', ' School Health Services ', ' School-Based Services ', ' Ice ', ' Program Effectiveness ', ' Mental Health Services ', ' Mental Hygiene Services ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Primary Care ', ' health care service utilization ', ' healthcare utilization ', ' healthcare service utilization ', ' health services utilization ', ' Health Care Utilization ', ' high school ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,F32,2011,50502,0.15962993737421097
"M-RISP at San Diego State University    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  We request funds to continue and expand our very successful M-RISP. Our goal is still to enhance the capacity of SDSU to conduct mental health research that is responsive to NIMH priorities and that leads to applications that can be funded through RO1 and R03 mechanisms. We are dedicated to promoting and supporting high quality mental health research, focused on ethnic disparities. Faculty obtain release time, funded through the M-RISP and matched by the university, through an intramural research competition. Several minority students are supported and assist the faculty. A systematic and extensive plan for educating both M-RISP faculty and students about high quality mental health research is proposed, with the help of collaborators from UCSD. Support for faculty presentations of their research findings will be made available, a brown bag will be established so faculty can receive feedback about their research ideas before implementation, and biostatistical consulting, mentoring, and a mental health colloquium series are included. These activities will 1) increase research collaborations among faculty members at SDSU and research-intensive institutions; 2) establish national and international faculty networks for mental health research; 3) increase the number of faculty members who seek and obtain RO1-level extramural funding; and 4) increase faculty research productivity, as demonstrated by peer-reviewed presentations and publications. The number of ethnic minority investigators who conduct research to address the NIMH priorities and who become funded by NIMH will increase. In addition, three Independent Investigator projects associated with the M-RISP core are proposed. They include: studies examining the effects of marital satisfaction on mental health, the impact of national identification on the mental health of minorities, and the coping strategies employed by minority adolescents and their effects on mental health. All of the independent investigators address current NIMH priorities, and their research is relevant to public health because it will increase the understanding of ethnic differences in the causes and cures of mental health problems. Interventions tailored to help minorities overcome their unique barriers to receiving treatment can be designed better as a result of the proposed research. SDSU will integrate the Career Opportunities in Research (COR) Program withM-RISP.

"Can Medicaid Benefits Reduce Access Disparities for Minority Children & Youth?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The study goal is to examine the aggressive enforcement of Medicaid's (Medi-Cal's) Early Periodic Screening Diagnosis and Treatment program (EPSDT) to learn whether reducing important structural barriers to public mental health care by providing generous financing, increasing treatment capacity, and engaging with community-based programs and organizations will bring about the desired policy effect of equalizing spending and treatment patterns among low-income white and ethnic minority children and youth.  Study aims are: 1) Estimate the extent to which California's EPSDT mental health program expansion reduced disparities in spending for African American, Latino and Native American Medi-Cal enrolled children and youth. Determine how much reduction in spending disparities was immediate and how much it constituted minority-white convergence in trends. 2) Estimate the extent to which California's enforcement of EPSDT mental health services reduced disparities in access (measured by overall penetration rates; outpatient treatment penetration rates; and crisis treatment penetration rates) for African American, Latino and Native American Medi-Cal enrolled children and youth. Determine how much reduction in access disparities was immediate and how much it constituted minority-white convergence in trends. 3) Estimate for each dependent measure described in 1 and 2 above the extent to which reduced minority-white disparities was associated with: a) increases in total provider supply and Spanish-speaking provider supply; and b) increased engagement with community-based organizations including those with an ethnic minority focus.  Using panel data multivariate regression methods in a kind of ""interrupted time-series"" approach (Shadish, Cook & Campbell, 2002), we control for factors correlated with aggressive EPSDT enforcement that could confound our assessment of its impact on cost and access disparities. We will observe costs and penetration rates before and after EPSDT enforcement over 48 quarters (July 1992 - June 2004) and across the 57 California county mental health plans. Since our focus is on changes in disparities between ethnic minorities and whites over time, any potential confounds must differentially affect ethnic minorities or whites to influence study results. To further test hypotheses, we contrast disparities in sub-samples minimally affected by, and unaffected by, EPSDT enforcement. Medi-Cal Specialty Mental Health Claims data and Medi-Cal enrollment data obtained from the California Department of Mental Health will be used.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The lack of mental health access and treatment for children and adolescents is a serious public health problem raised by the Surgeon General in his 2000 report. Low access is especially pronounced among ethnic minority populations for whom mental illness is becoming a significant problem: in May 2007, the CDC issued a report stating that suicide was the fourth leading cause of death among youth, and that the highest rates have occurred among minority populations1. The proposed study will provide information for policymakers and administrators to understand the conditions under which existing financing and delivery systems can be levered to rapidly expand access and improve care for these children and youth. 1 Bernard SJ, Paulozzi LJ, Wallace DL; Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) (2007).

"Culture, Context, and Mexican American Mental Health    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal seeks 5 years of continued support for a longitudinal study of processes that contribute to the high levels of psychopathology experienced by Mexican American youth. Consistent with priorities in the NIMH Strategic Plan (2008), this study is designed to (1) chart mental illness trajectories of Mexican American youth, (2) increase our capacity to predict who in this population is at risk for mental illness by identifying individual, environmental, and social factors that contribute to both risk and resilience processes, (3) identify contributors to the mental health disparities experienced by Mexican Americans, and (4) provide a scientific foundation for the design of the next generation of preventive interventions for this population. Beginning with a diverse sample of 750 Mexican American families, this study tests hypotheses regarding how interactions of individuals' cultural orientations with characteristics of family, community, peer, and school contexts contribute to the mental health burden of this population. A unique aspect of this study is the assessment of cultural orientation (i.e., degree of endorsement of traditional Mexican cultural values and degree of endorsement of U.S. cultural values) of children and parents as well as the degree to which communities and schools support these cultural traditions. Children and their parents were assessed initially when children were in 5th and 7th grades. Results supported the specific aims: (1) changes in children's and parents' cultural orientations are related to greater risk for mental health disorders; (2) family characteristics, such as parent-child conflict, mediate the relation between cultural orientation mismatches and children's psychopathology; and (3) child and parent cultural orientations buffer relations between common risk factors (e.g., economic hardship) and children's mental health. The proposed continuation will assess this sample of children and their parents as youth experience the rapid developmental changes of middle adolescence (grades 10 and 12) when rates of psychopathology accelerate. The specific aims remain: (1) cultural mismatches between children and family, community, and school contexts will be related to risk for psychopathology; (2) family and peer group processes will mediate relations between cultural mismatches and psychopathology; and (3) cultural orientations of children and their parents will moderate relations between risk factors and psychopathology. Longitudinal tests of these aims will provide a strong foundation for the next generation of prevention programs to reduce mental health disparities for Mexican Americans. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This longitudinal study of 750 Mexican American adolescents and their parents is important from a public health standpoint because of the mental health disparities Mexican American adolescents experience, and the limited knowledge about factors that contribute to these disparities. This study is designed to (1) chart mental illness trajectories of Mexican American youth, (2) increase our capacity to predict who in this population is at risk for mental illness by identifying individual, environmental, and social factors that contribute to both risk and resilience processes, (3) identify contributors to the mental health disparities experienced by Mexican Americans, and (4) provide a firm scientific foundation for the design of the next generation of preventive interventions for this population in order to reduce the individual, family, and societal burden of psychopathology within this population.          NARRATIVE  This longitudinal study of 750 Mexican American adolescents and their parents is important from a public  health standpoint because of the mental health disparities Mexican American adolescents experience, and the  limited knowledge about factors that contribute to these disparities.

"Social Inequality and Children's Mental Health    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The social gradient in children's mental health is well documented. What is less clear is how social inequalities influence children's development. We propose to examine this question at three levels of analysis. At the neighborhood level, we will assess ecometric properties of the local areas in which children reside and test whether neighborhood-level social processes, such as collective efficacy, mediate the effects of neighborhood poverty on children's mental health. At the family level, we will trace the effects of socioeconomic deprivation on proximal family processes (exposure to violence, food insecurity) and test how stressful early life events may become biologically embedded. At the individual level, we will use a genetically-informative longitudinal design to test the hypothesis that children's perceptions of their social position can help to explain why some children growing up in poverty do versus do not develop health problems. METHOD: We will conduct this research using data from the Environmental Risk (E-Risk) Study. E-Risk is a longitudinal study (from birth to age 12) of a nationally-representative sample of twins born in England and Wales in 1994-1995 (N=2232), selected from a registry created with the UK Office of National Statistics (ONS). We have tracked the children over the first 12 years of their lives, monitoring their development and their environmental exposures, including multiple forms of social inequality. We have gathered data about the children and their families at 6 time points (birth, ages 2, 5, 7, 10, and 12 years). We have also conducted two independent ecometric assessments of the neighborhoods in which the children are growing up, enabling us to study inequalities in children's lives at both the community and family level. INNOVATION AND SIGNIFICANCE: The proposed research has implications both for understanding and reducing health inequalities. At each level of analysis, we adopt a process approach to test how social inequalities influence children's development. At the neighborhood level, we will identify malleable factors for community-level interventions which may be more cost effective and pragmatic than individual-level interventions. At the family level, we will test the direct and indirect contributions of family socio-economic conditions to children's development and identify specific intervention targets for reducing social inequalities in children's mental health. At the individual level, if we discover environmentally-mediated effects between children's subjective social status and their health, the implications would point to children's perceptions of social status as malleable intervention targets and open up a realm of intervention possibilities for empowering children. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: About half of the population variation in children's mental health problems is accounted for by environmental factors, and social inequalities stand out as the most prominent determinants of health in the first decade of life. However, the hope of preventing early- emerging mental health problems requires research to identify the underlying mechanisms by which inequalities affect health. Our proposed research tests how social inequalities affect children's health, aiming to identify malleable intervention targets at the community, family, and individual levels.          Narrative  About half of the population variation in children's mental health problems is accounted for  by environmental factors, and social inequalities stand out as the most prominent  determinants of health in the first decade of life.

"A Cross-Cultural, Patient-Centered Approach for Assessing Quality of ADHD Care    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Racial-ethnic disparities in diagnosis and treatment of Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) suggest that all children with ADHD are at risk for poor quality of care. In order to better understand these disparities in ADHD care quality, Dr. Eugenia Chan, a developmental-behavioral pediatrician, is submitting this revised applications for a Mentored Patient-Oriented Career Development Award (K23) to develop a cross-cultural, patient-centered approach for assessing quality of primary care management of children with ADHD. The overall goals are to develop a conceptual understanding of barriers to effective care from patient and family perspectives, to understand how and why these problems vary across cultural groups, and to develop instruments and methods to measure these patient-centered processes of care and to guide interventions to improve clinical care and outcomes for children with ADHD. The specific aims are to (1) develop a patient-centered model of ADHD care quality by investigating similarities and differences in African-American, Chinese-American, and European-American family experiences of ADHD care; (2) develop and validate a parent survey of patient-centered indicators of ADHD care quality that are sensitive to cross-cultural values regarding care for ADHD; and (3) test the survey in a diverse, primary care patient population to assess psychometric properties and identify disparities in patient-centered ADHD care quality. The results of this project will lead directly to future applications to (1) investigate relationships among patient-centered quality assessments, evidence-based quality indicators, and ADHD outcomes, (2) identify disparities in primary care management of ADHD, and (3) develop and implement targeted interventions to improve disparities in quality of ADHD care. The candidate has demonstrated skills as a developmental- behavioral pediatrician and junior health services researcher.

"Rural Parents' Perceived Stigma of Mental Health Services for Their Children    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Stigma has been widely cited as the most significant barrier to individuals seeking mental health services (e.g., President's New Freedom Commission on Mental Health, Report of Surgeon General on Mental Health) and it is often identified as a particularly salient concern for those living in rural areas (e.g., Bray, Enright, & Easling, 2004; deGruy, 1997; Jameson & Blank, 2007). Despite these statements, little empirical work has been conducted, particularly with regard to children. The purpose of the proposed project is to examine rural parents' perceived stigma regarding seeking mental health services for their children using the R21 Exploratory/ Developmental Grant mechanism (PA-10-069). This project addresses the NIMH Strategic Plan to strengthen the public health impact of NIMH-supported research by identifying barriers to the implementation of current knowledge (Objective 4). Specific aims are: 1) to examine rural parents' perceived stigma around seeking mental health services for their child; 2) to validate a new measure assessing parents' perceived stigma about seeking mental health services for their child; and 3) to explore the relations between parents' perceived stigma of mental health service seeking and their willingness to seek both traditional and innovative (e.g., integrated care, telehealth, etc.) mental health services. These relations will be tested in the context of a theoretical model that considers: 1) established factors affecting perceived stigma and service- seeking (e.g. caregiver strain, other barriers to rural care access) and 2) developmental, experiential, and demographic factors (e.g., past experiences with mental health services, age, gender, religiosity). Participants will be the parents of 350 children who have borderline or higher parent ratings on a measure of psychosocial concerns. Parents will complete a newly- developed measure regarding their perceived stigma of seeking mental health services for their child as well as a variety of other measures included to validate the primary measure and explore a theoretical model in which perceived stigma impacts willingness to seek traditional versus innovative services. The results of this study will inform the field about the role of stigma in service seeking for rural Appalachian parents. The study will serve as a platform for future research examining and comparing other contexts (i.e., urban and other rural settings) as well as experimentally examining the impact of innovative services on perceived stigma and service use.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed study will examine parents' perceived stigma around seeking mental health services for their children including both traditional and innovative service mechanisms (e.g., integrated care, telehealth, etc.). Results will inform the field about the attitudes of parents in rural Appalachia and provide information about the role of stigma in the context of other, well- established factors influencing help-seeking. These findings will serve as a platform for developing service delivery mechanisms that decrease stigma as a barrier to treatment (i.e., translating evidence-based treatment), particularly in rural communities.           The proposed study will examine parents' perceived stigma around seeking mental health services for their children including both traditional and innovative service mechanisms (e.g., integrated care, telehealth, etc.).

"Understanding Health Disparities in the Progression of Type 2 Diabetes    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): It is well-established that modifiable, lifestyle-related behaviors including smoking, alcohol, diet, and physical activity greatly contribute to the risk of most common physical health conditions. The recent, almost epidemic increase in the prevalence of diseases associated with these health behaviors, especially hypertension, type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease (CVD), and growing disparities in the burden of these conditions across racial and ethnic groups, highlights the urgency of developing effective prevention strategies - however, few intervention studies have produced long-term changes in lifestyle and behaviors. Addressing an omission in existing behavioral intervention models, we propose that what is needed is an examination of behavioral change in the context of the interrelationships among health behaviors, sources of and coping responses to chronic stress, and their influence on physical and mental health. This proposal is motivated by a robust literature that indicates blacks in the US are more likely to engage in poor health behaviors (i.e., tobacco smoking, diets high in fat and carbohydrates, excessive alcohol use) and, expectedly, experience disproportionate burdens of common physical health conditions associated with these behaviors, including CVD and diabetes, relative to non-Hispanic whites - paradoxically, however, population-based and clinic studies have consistently found that blacks, in comparison to whites, have the same or lower rates of most mental disorders, even while experiencing higher rates of psychological distress. We theorize that a defined set of health-related stress-coping strategies (i.e., tobacco smoking, diets high in fat and carbohydrates, excessive alcohol use, etc) have a two-pronged effect that helps to account for this counterintuitive patterning. First, we suggest that these behaviors act on the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and related stress- hormonal systems which influences the subjective experience and development of stress-associated psychiatric disorder. Second, we believe that the effects of these poor behaviors on pathophysiology, combined with direct effects of stressful living conditions over the life-course, contribute to disproportionate burden of chronic physical health problems among blacks. Succinctly, we propose that blacks and other individuals from highly stressed populations ""buy"" their relative, comparatively positive rates of mental disorders at the expense of their deteriorating physical health. Therefore, this framework suggests that adherence to traditional preventative care, specifically involving changes in behavioral lifestyle, can lead to a perverse result: improvements in physical health but worsening of mental health. We will extend this line of research and assess the effect of traditional preventative care among three categories of type 2 diabetes patients: 1) pre- or borderline; 2) early onset; and, 3) poorly-controlled. In the proposed accelerated longitudinal design we will examine the inter-relationships among stress, health behaviors, and physical and mental health at three distinct points of diabetes progression.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Type 2 diabetes and its associated risk factors such as hypertension and heart disease continue to top the domestic and international public health agendas. The diagnoses of these conditions are invariably followed by recommendations for extensive behavioral modifications. In all cases rates of long-term adherence to recommended healthy behavioral changes are spotty at best, both intra-and inter-individually. We believe that physical and mental health disparities are linked to the lack of behavioral change adherence. The findings of this study will help anticipate, understand, and identify informal and formal programs and public health policies needed to address the physical and mental health challenges facing the growing epidemic of related cardiovascular and metabolic disorders in the U.S. and other developed and developing countries.             Type 2 diabetes and its associated risk factors such as hypertension and heart disease continue to top the domestic and international public health agendas.

"Understanding Mechanisms of Mental Health Care Disparities    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Racial/ethnic disparities in mental health care, in relative terms, exceed disparities in many other areas of health care services, with African-Americans and Hispanics accessing mental health care at only half the rate of non-Hispanic Whites, even after accounting for mental health status. These disparities in service use likely contribute to the greater persistence, severity, and disease burden of mental disorder among African- Americans and Latinos. In this proposed study, we fulfill a need for direct, easily understandable information about the mechanisms underlying disparities in mental health care services. We improve upon previous research by assessing racial/ethnic disparities in episodes of care rather than cross-sectional data, allowing us to understand factors related to initiation, duration, intensity, and quality of care that are more closely linked with the actual behaviors of patients and providers. In addition, we propose the first comprehensive look at the contribution of geographic disparities to racial/ethnic disparities in mental health care, distinguishing disparities due to the state and neighborhood where an individual lives from disparities due to individual characteristics and identifying area-level characteristics that are amenable to policy change. Finally, we develop, in collaboration with policymakers, a mental health care disparities index that provides an easy to understand state-by-state comparison of mental health care disparities to directly inform policymakers' disparities reduction interventions. Our specific aims are to:     1. Assess disparities in initiation, intensity, duration, and quality of mental health  care episodes     2. Assess role of geography in disparities identifying area-level correlates of mental  health service use     3. Develop indices of disparities in states' mental health care expenditure and quality.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: In this project, we attempt to identify and understand the underlying mechanisms driving racial/ethnic disparities in mental health care episodes.

"Center for Mental Health Services in Pediatric Primary Care    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Mission: The center seeks sustainable ways to increase primary care providers' capacity to improve function, reduce distress, and prevent disability among children with mental health problems. Background: The mental health issues treated in pediatric primary care are characterized by high prevalence and a preponderance of children with impairment but without a diagnosis. Parent distress frequently complicates children's mental health problems and requires simultaneous attention. The ability to engage families around their needs promotes access to treatment and contributes to reducing ethnic (disparities. Goal and specific aims: The Center will develop an evidence-based model for mental health in primary care that 1) applies to the range of problems seen in primary care, 2) engages existing skills and knowledge of families and pediatric providers, and 3) results in sustainable increases in the mental health treatment capacity of primary care. Its specific aims are to: 1) adapt Wagner's Chronic Care Model (CCM) of primary care mental health service to include treatment based on ""common factors"" and ""common treatment elements.""; la) within the CCM's 5 domains, address priority research needs related to the impact of common factors and their implementation in office practice; lb) develop packages of practical interventions, built around domains of the adapted CCM, for larger scale trials in pediatric primary care; 2) develop measurements, study designs and analytic methods to efficiently assess outcomes in community settings; and 3) stimulate innovation in pediatric mental health services through multidisciplinary and community-academic collaboration, attracting new and diverse scholars and providing a resource for scientists, policy makers, and advocates. Methods: The Center's faculty is a team of pediatricians, psychologists, psychiatrists, and other scholars from six institutions that include rural, suburban, and urban settings. Their work is informed by ties to the American Academy of Pediatrics' Task Force on Mental Health and leaders in state mental health policy. Guidance and focus come from a community advisory committee and a national scientific advisory board. Research Methods Core studies address priority questions about the evidence base for common factors, the burden of mental health care, and feasible clinical data systems. Principal Research Core studies test complementary common factors approaches for children with anxiety problems. The Operations Core promotes recruiting underrepresented trainees, meaningful community interaction, quality control, and innovative study design.             The Center's work develops a model of mental health prevention and treatment that can be practically implemented in pediatric primary care. The model has the potential to make care available to populations that currently have limited access to specialized mental health services.

"Improving Mental Health Services for Low-Income Latinos in Primary Care IMPROVING MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES FOR LOW-INCOME LATINOS IN PRIMARY CARE  Building community capacity to deliver accessible mental health services to Latino Immigrants is much needed.  Latinos in the US are less likely to utilize mental health services than non-Latino Whites, and they are less likely to receive guideline-concordant care, with disparities increasing.  The Community Academic Partnership for Mental Health (CAP-MH) seeks to address these concerns by strengthening an existing partnership between the Center for Trauma and the Community (CTC) in the Psychiatry Department at Georgetown Medical School, and the Primary Care Coalition (PCC) of Montgomery County, to support the timely development and evaluation of culturally competent, trauma-sensitive, and innovative interventions to improve patient mental health.  A major goal of this project is to integrate clinical research into the clinical care process at the community clinic level.  Thus, PCC¿s electronic medical record (EMR) will be improved by upgrading the mental health section, including the addition of custom data elements required for specific research protocol interventions, and essential functionalities, including improved data summary functions. Once the EMR has been upgraded, a naturalistic evaluation of the Montgomery Cares Behavioral Health Program (MCBHP) will be conducted, comparing clinics with and without the program.  The study aims include, 1) To evaluate the extent of implementation of the ongoing MCBHP via examination of MCBHP-related process parameters, including extent of guideline-concordant care provision; 2) To evaluate the effectiveness of the MCBHP on mental health outcomes (depression, anxiety); and, 3) among the subset of patients with comorbid chronic health conditions (diabetes, hypertension, obesity), to evaluate the effectiveness of the MCBHP on mental health, health behaviors, and health-related outcomes. Background support work will include interviews and focus groups with providers and other staff, whose input will be used to help design flexible aspects of the EMR and the study. This partnership will begin to serve as a laboratory for community-informed intervention development to improve services, and ultimately the health, of a large underserved minority population. Narrative (for the lay public) Latino populations have difficulty accessing culturally sensitive mental health services.  The proposed project will address these disparities by building the community¿s capacity to develop and study mental health services for the Latino community in a primary care service provider organization in Montgomery County, MD. A study of a clinical program that is already delivering mental health services in the community will be evaluated, with clinicians and staff providing input to help us design the study.

The ACIPMHC will have strong linkage to the intervention development program at the Center for Research to Practice (CR2P) at the Oregon Social Learning Center (OSLC) and to other intervention and services research programs and networks around the country. The research agenda has a strategic focus on improvement of public pediatric mental health care, primarily in the mental health and child welfare service sectors, through improved integration of evidence-based practice and usual care. The center's program of practice research spans clinical epidemiology studies linked to evidence-based practice, effectiveness, and implementation studies. The research agenda will have a primary focus on effectiveness and equity as two of the six aims for improving health care from the ""Crossing the Quality Chasm"" report. An overarching center perspective of cultural exchange will guide active partnership with major stakeholders in youth mental health care, including youth and family consumers, providers, program and funding managers, system administrators, policy makers, and intervention and services researchers.   The Principal Research Core (PRC) will focus on practice research through two developmental studies addressing implementation of two established evidence-based practices. These studies and others to be designed by the center network of investigators will be carried out in community-based mental health and child welfare service settings, building on already developed research-practice relationships. The Research Methods Core (RMC) will advance methods for effectiveness and implementation research through four workgroups focusing on (a) design and analysis, (b) measurement, (c) mixed methods, and (d) economic analyses, as well as one developmental study addressing incorporation of research-based measurement in usual care child welfare practice. The Community Network Core (CNC) will strengthen a multiple sector infrastructure in San Diego County and link research activities to an emerging research network in the State of California that partners with the California Institute of Mental Health, a technical assistance arm of the county mental health directors in California. The Operations Core (OC) will provide leadership and will support activities in the other three cores by extending an effective infrastructure developed through two prior services research center grants and participating as one of six sites in an R-25 training consortium. All cores will advance practice research to inform improvements in mental health care that decrease racial-ethnic disparities.

"Research Training: Socio-Economics of Mental Health Service Delivery in SE Europe    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The University of California, Berkeley and Babes-Bolyai University, Cluj, Romania, propose to provide advanced, multidisciplinary research training to outstanding pre- and post-doctoral economists, psychiatrists, sociologists, clinicians, and mental health professionals from South Eastern Europe (SEE) in the latest research methods and issues regarding the economic and social factors that influence or drive the delivery of mental health care services. We propose to build upon the successful ""Finance and Mental Health Services Training in Czech Republic/Central Europe (5-D43-TW005810-10). Prof. Richard Scheffler, University of California, Berkeley, has been the PI and co-Director of this program for the past ten years. The other co-Director has been Prof. Martin Potucek, Charles University, Prague. During its span, the program has trained over sixty people from Bulgaria, Croatia, Czech Republic, Romania, and Slovakia. The past 5 years of the program has been highly successful by all measures, with over 72 publications and 3 books by its trainees. The PI of our new application will be Prof. Scheffler. Because the Czech Republic is now a high-income economy, we will replace Charles University with a new partner. We propose that the new partner be the new School of Public Health at Babes-Bolyai University (http://www.publichealth.ro/), Cluj-Napoca, Romania. SPH- BBU will serve as the hub of the program in Europe, attracting and screening candidates, and fostering their subsequent career development. Berkeley will continue to be the primary training site, providing senior faculty to mentor the trainees as they take classes, participate in seminars, and engage in research projects in their home countries. The new co-Director will be Razvan Chereches, MD, Ph.D., Babes-Bolyai University. Dr. Chereches has himself been a trainee and a project leader in our previous program. He has also participated in other NIH programs: University of Iowa International Training and Research in Occupational and Environmental Health Program, Fogarty International Center - D43 TW000621; Minority Health and Health Disparities International Research and Training, Fogarty International Center- T37 MD001453-05; and University of Iowa International Collaborative Trauma and Injury Prevention Research and Training Program, Fogarty International Center - D43 TW007261. Just as the previous program expanded from the Czech Republic into four other countries in the region, we intend to start from Romania and Bulgaria, and expand into other LMICs in SEE. The countries of interest currently include Albania, Moldova, and Serbia, but other countries of the former Yugoslavia will also be considered.

"COPE/Healthy Lifestyles for Teens: A School-Based RCT    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):        The prevention and treatment of obesity and mental health disorders in adolescence are two major public health problems in the United States (U.S.) today. The incidence of adolescents who are overweight or obese has increased dramatically over the past 20 years, with approximately 17.1 percent of teens now being overweight or obese. Furthermore, approximately 15 million children and adolescents (25 percent) in the U.S. have a mental health problem that is interfering with their functioning at home or at school, but less than 25 percent of those affected receive any treatment for these disorders. The prevalence rates of obesity and mental health problems are even higher in Hispanic teens, with studies suggesting that the two conditions often coexist in many youth. However, despite the rapidly increasing incidence of these two public health problems with their related health disparities and adverse health outcomes, there has been a paucity of theory- based intervention studies conducted with adolescents in high schools to improve their healthy lifestyle behaviors as well as their physical and mental health outcomes. Unfortunately, physical and mental health services continue to be largely separated instead of integrated in the nation's healthcare system, which often leads to inadequate identification and treatment of these significant adolescent health problems.  Therefore, the goal of the proposed randomized controlled trial is to test the efficacy of the COPE (Creating Opportunities for Personal Empowerment)/Healthy Lifestyles TEEN (Thinking, Feeling, Emotions & Exercise) Program, an educational and cognitive-behavioral skills building intervention guided by cognitive behavior theory, on the healthy lifestyle behaviors and depressive symptoms of 800 culturally diverse adolescents enrolled in Phoenix, Arizona high schools. The specific aims of the study are to: (1) Use a randomized controlled trial to test the short- and more long-term efficacy of the COPE TEEN Program on key outcomes, including healthy lifestyles behaviors, depressive symptoms and body mass index percentage, (2) Examine the role of cognitive beliefs and perceived difficulty in leading a healthy lifestyle in mediating the effects of COPE on healthy lifestyle behaviors and depressive symptoms; and (3) Explore variables that may moderate the effects of the intervention on healthy lifestyle behaviors and depressive symptoms, including race/ethnicity, gender, SES, acculturation, and parental healthy lifestyle beliefs and behaviors. Six prior pilot studies support the need for this full scale clinical trial and the use of cognitive-behavioral skills building in promoting healthy lifestyles beliefs, behaviors and optimal mental health in teens.  This study is consistent with the NIH roadmap and goals of improving people's health and preventing the onset of disease and disability as well as promoting the highest level of health in a vulnerable population.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:       The prevention and treatment of obesity and mental health disorders in adolescence are two major public health problems in the United States today. To address the increasing incidence and adverse health outcomes associated with both obesity and mental health problems, a theory-based 15 session intervention program entitled COPE (Creating Opportunities for Personal Empowerment)/Healthy Lifestyles TEEN (Thinking, Feeling, Emotions & Exercise), will be delivered within high school health classes in order to improve the physical and mental health outcomes of 800 culturally diverse adolescents (14 to 16 years of age).              PROJECT NARRATIVE  The prevention and treatment of obesity and mental health disorders in adolescence are two major public health problems in the United States today.

"Feasible Delivery of CBT for Rural Latino Youth with Anxiety    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Children with anxiety disorders are often characterized by an unmet need for treatment however, in special populations such as Latino and rural youth, such disparities are compounded by the effects of culture and geographic isolation. More specifically, barriers related to language, stigma, and access often lead to lower rates of utilization and poorer outcomes among children in need of mental health services (Alvidrez and Azocar, 1999; McCabe et al., 2002; Myers et al., 2008; Vega et al., 2001). These findings are disappointing given abundant data supporting the effectiveness of cognitive behavior and behavior therapies for children with anxiety disorders (Barrett et al., 1996; Beidel et al., 2007; Kendall & Southam-Gerow, 1996; Walkup et al., 2008). Efforts to examine feasible methods to deliver evidence-based treatments to children with anxiety disorders are critical in order to extend quality care to underserved groups. The goal of this R34 is to address these disparities, by translating and tailoring an existing child anxiety cognitive behavior therapy program (The Cool Kids Outreach Program; Lyneham and Rapee, 2006), to fit the needs of Spanish-speaking rural families and examining the feasibility, acceptability, tolerability and safety of implementing this intervention using varying modes of delivery. Qualitative methodologies which include focus groups with bicultural and bilingual mental health providers and individual interviews with rural Latino parents will be used to examine the acceptability and cultural appropriateness of the intervention. Using these findings and other extant literature, an expert panel guided by a cultural adaptation framework (Lau, 2006), will determine the extent to which tailoring of the Cool Kids Outreach Program is necessary. Next, a pilot study for children (age 8-13) with anxiety disorders (i.e., separation anxiety disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, social anxiety disorder, and specific phobias) will be conducted and 40 children will be randomized to two service delivery modes which represent varying levels of therapist contact: 1) 20 families will be randomized to a telephone-based, therapist- supported CBT program, and; 2) 20 families will be randomized to a more minimal contact bilbiotherapy condition (primarily CBT self-help materials). All families will be recruited from primary care settings, given its defacto mental health service status. Feasibility and clinical outcomes will be measured at baseline, midtreatment and post-treatment. Additionally, during exit interviews, participants (as well as those who may have dropped out of the program) will be asked to discuss the perceived usefulness, acceptability, and impact of the intervention. This pilot study will provide important data regarding the feasibility, acceptability, tolerability and safety of the intervention conditions as well as the opportunity to pilot procedures that will be used in a larger effectiveness trial with rural Latino youth.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This R34 proposal will incorporate the perspectives of family and community mental health providers, to tailor, as necessary, an evidence based treatment for child anxiety disorders, in order to meet the needs of a hard-to- reach group (i.e., rural Latino youth). The pilot study will examine the feasibility of new modes of service delivery (e.g., a minimal therapist contact, self-help program, and a more intensive therapist supported, telephone-based approach) that may ultimately improve access to evidence based treatments and mental health outcomes among underserved groups. These findings will ultimately inform a larger program of research focusing on effectiveness and dissemination efforts for children with anxiety disorders, using service delivery approaches that allow for the personalization of mental health care.              Project Narrative This R34 proposal will incorporate the perspectives of family and community mental health providers, to tailor, as necessary, an evidence based treatment for child anxiety disorders, in order to meet the needs of a hard-to- reach group (i.e., rural Latino youth).

"Implementing Health Care Interventions for Hispanics with Serious Mental Illness    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Compared to majority whites with serious mental illness (SMI; e.g., schizophrenia), racial/ethnic minorities with SMI are at higher risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD). Although promising treatments (e.g., care manager interventions) exist to improve the health of people with SMI, limited attention has been paid to the process of making these interventions culturally relevant to Hispanics with SMI and to promote their use in the public mental health system. The objective of this Mentored Research Scientist Development Award (K01) is to prepare the candidate to become an independent investigator in implementation research to address the disparities in physical health care faced by underserved minorities with SMI. A mentoring team, led by Drs. Lewis-Fernandez and Druss, will guide the candidate in achieving the following training objectives: 1) obtain training in implementation research, focusing on community-based participatory research (CBPR) approaches as a translational strategy; 2) develop expertise on the integration of physical and mental health care for people with SMI; 3) acquire new skills in using intervention mapping and qualitative methods to inform intervention research; and 4) obtain training in clinical trial methodology and longitudinal data analysis. The application integrates course work, mentorship from established investigators, and mentored research activities. The research plan uses a collaborative intervention planning framework that blends principles of CBPR and intervention mapping to modify and assess the feasibility and acceptability of an existing care manager intervention. This 12-month intervention focuses on improving patient activation and the coordination of medical care between outpatient mental health clinics and primary care. The proposed project uses a multiphase approach supported by the candidate's training plan. In Phase 1, a community advisory board composed of researchers and stakeholders will be assembled to learn and review the intervention and make initial modifications. During Phase 2, qualitative methods - patient focus groups and stakeholder interviews - will be used to ensure that the modifications are acceptable to all stakeholders. In Phase 3, results from Phase 2 are used to further modify the intervention, develop an implementation plan, and train two care managers on the modified intervention. Phase 4 consists of a 12-month open pilot study (N = 30) to assess the feasibility and acceptability of the modified intervention and explore its effect. Lastly, Phase 5 will focus on analysis of pilot study data and preparation of an R01 proposal. The research plan will yield pilot data for a subsequent R01 to conduct a randomized controlled trial to test the effectiveness and implementation of the modified intervention.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This K01 prepares the candidate to develop an independent program of research focused on the implementation of integrated physical and mental health services in the public mental health system to improve the physical health and wellness of underserved minorities with SMI. This project responds to objectives 3 and 4 of the NIMH Strategic Plan which call for the development of better interventions that incorporate the needs of diverse people with mental illness and ensures the translation of research findings into clinical practice to enhance NIMH's public health mission.                 This K01 prepares the candidate to develop an independent program of research focused on the implementation of integrated physical and mental health services in the public mental health system to improve the physical health and wellness of underserved minorities with SMI.

"Implementation of a Measurement Feedback System in School Mental Health     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This Mentored Career Development Award (K08) is designed to provide intensive training in developing a strong program of research that investigates the adaptation and implementation of health information technologies within the school context to increase the availability of high-quality mental health interventions for underserved youth and families. A field of implementation science has recently emerged to address the significant gap between the proliferation of evidence-based practices (EBP) for treating youth mental health problems and their use in usual care treatment settings. Nowhere is this gap more apparent than in schools. Schools provide the bulk of youth mental health services (>70%) and effectively reduce service access disparities by ethnicity and socioeconomic status. Nevertheless, implementation research focused on the school context has been disproportionately limited. To address these gaps and advance implementation science, the candidate's long term career objective is to develop effective methods for promoting the use of EBP among mental health providers in educational settings. Standardized assessment (SA) of psychiatric symptoms is a cornerstone of all EBP and has been significantly associated with improvements in treatment- related outcome. Nevertheless, SA is infrequently utilized by school-based providers, resulting in sub-optimal care. Measurement feedback systems (MFS) use the results of SA to deliver information to clinicians about client progress, represent a structured way to introduce SA into service systems, and have the potential to support effective, client-centered care. The candidate's immediate focus is therefore to increase clinicians' administration of SA tools and incorporation of SA feedback into routine practice through the development of a MFS and an accompanying contextualized adaptation process that are designed specifically for schools.  The current K08 Award will uniquely position the candidate to advance this research agenda. His background includes specialized training in child clinical psychology, evidence-based assessment and intervention approaches, research on school-based mental health, mental health services research, and collaboration with community stakeholders. To more effectively bridge the gap between typical and optimal mental health care in schools, he seeks to extend his training to include: (1) design of healthcare technologies that are user-friendly and contextually appropriate, (2) experience with theory and methods to support innovation uptake/implementation in schools, (3) advanced statistics and research methodology, and (4) advanced academic writing. The University of Washington is an outstanding environment in which to engage in the interdisciplinary training required to achieve these training goals. The candidate's primary mentors-Drs. Elizabeth McCauley and Jurgen Unutzer have combined expertise in the assessment and treatment of adolescent psychopathology, training with school-based providers, development of computer products to support evidence-based service delivery, implementation science, and the development and dissemination of measurement feedback tools for client progress monitoring. Additional local and national consultants will contribute expertise in implementation research for youth/family services, user-centered design, school-based mental health, community service provision, decision support tools for youth treatment providers, cultural diversity and mental health care, mental health policy, and qualitative and mixed methods research.  The proposed project draws on the training and expertise above to develop and evaluate a contextually- adapted, web-based MFS for use in school-based health centers (SBHCs) through a series of qualitative, quantitative, and mixed methods research aims. The University of Washington Care Management Tracking System is a MFS, developed by Dr. Unutzer, previously found to result in improved care, symptom reductions, and increased functioning among patients. The current study proposes to use SBHC clinician focus groups and direct clinician feedback to adapt this MFS for use by SBHC clinicians. The candidate's prior research has revealed that SBHC providers infrequently utilize SA measures, but supports the feasibility of using structured, computerized methods to increase SA administration. A sample of SBHC clinicians (n = 20) and youth (n = 64, Aim 3) will participate in the project to advance the following Research Aims: (1) evaluate the SBHC context to inform MFS adaptation; (2) assess the adaptation's effectiveness in context; (3) evaluate the system impact on clinician behavior and youth outcomes; and (4) assess the added utility of providing academic data to school clinicians for use in progress monitoring. SBHC clinicians will provide feedback on the optimal design of the MFS and use it to track outcomes among youth experiencing depression and anxiety. Aims 1 and 2 will be evaluated descriptively, using existing benchmarks when applicable. Aim 3 will be tested experimentally via a small-scale randomized trial in which clinicians (and a subset of their caseloads) will be randomized to one of two conditions: (a) use of the school MFS to monitor progress using SA or (b) assessment as usual. Aim 4 will be tested using the MFS, with randomization of youth to two conditions: (a) clinicians receive the results of SA and students' school attendance data from the MFS or (b) data include SA results only. Based on the results of this work, a R01 grant application will be submitted to investigate the larger-scale implementation of the school MFS and contextualized adaptation process among a range of school service delivery models, allowing for more thorough evaluation of its impact on clinician behavior and student functioning.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Evidence-based mental health services are infrequently provided by school-based clinicians, resulting in sub- optimal outcomes for the ""safety net"" populations most likely to receive care in that setting (i.e., low- socioeconomic status, ethnic minority youth). By identifying innovative health technologies that systematically support the implementation of evidence-based practices and adapting them for use in schools, the proposed research and training carries considerable potential to enhance the availability of high-quality care for underserved youth, thereby more effectively alleviating symptoms and promoting functioning across domains.                  Evidence-based mental health services are infrequently provided by school-based clinicians, resulting in sub- optimal outcomes for the ""safety net"" populations most likely to receive care in that setting (i.e., low- socioeconomic status, ethnic minority youth).

"Patient Navigation for Depressed Mothers in Head Start - An Engagement Strategy     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Maternal depression disproportionately affects low-income and minority women and has substantial negative impacts on their children. Among these women, myriad cultural, psychological and logistic barriers impede engagement with mental health services, resulting in disparities in access to care. In 2009, the Institute of Medicine (IOM) published a landmark report, Depression in Parents, Parenting, and Children, in which it recognized engagement with care to be a substantial hurdle to better outcomes, and called for interventions that link screening efforts to treatment plans, and that take place in community-based, family-focused venues. Consistent with this report, our research group obtained an R01 award (R01MH091871) in 2010 to conduct a randomized trial of a maternal depression prevention intervention in Head Start - a federally funded preschool program that provides services for ~1 million children of low-income families across the US. In this ongoing study, Head Start mothers are enrolled based on their risk for developing major depressive episode (MDE); those in MDE are deliberately excluded and referred to more definitive care. This R21 proposes to enroll those women excluded from the prevention trial in an adjunct pilot study - the principal goal of which is to develop Patient Navigation as a model to promote engagement with depression care. Patient Navigation is a lay-delivered case management approach that focuses on overcoming logistical hurdles to care, such as transportation, language barriers or insurance complexities, during a defined episode. However, because engaging with mental health care requires addressing additional cultural and psychological barriers, we believe that traditional Navigation models will be insufficient for this purpose. We will thus train our navigators in the 'Engagement Interview,' an empirically-supported technique, in which interviewers facilitate client-focused exploration of life experiences, shared decision making, and goal setting as a way to build motivation to seek treatment. We propose a two-arm, 60-subject pilot study, within which we will: field test study mechanics, including the acceptabiliy of randomization among Head Start mothers in MDE; use quality improvement methods to optimize intervention delivery; and obtain empiric estimates of study parameters to inform the planning of an appropriately powered RCT. Although Patient Navigation has emerging evidence among adult cancer patients for promoting timely use of diagnostic services, it has yet to be studied as a mechanism to promote engagement with mental health care. Studying engagement in the child-focused Head Start setting offers the further possibility of learning how such a community-based setting - with its emphasis on children and family - can be leveraged to help mothers in MDE seek care. Such knowledge will inform the development of a subsequent trial of the intervention model. Our ultimate goal is model dissemination at the national level through Head Start and a reduction in disparities in access to mental health care.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Maternal depression disproportionately affects low-income and minority women and has substantial negative impacts on their children.

By embedding theory-based engagement strategies in the navigation model, we aim to improve engagement with mental health services, and thereby improve outcomes for both depressed mothers and their children.                  Maternal depression disproportionately affects low-income and minority women and has substantial negative impacts on their children.

"A Multi-channel Web Platform to Provide Holistic Care to Underserved Consumers     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Significant obstacles exist in care delivery that prevents meaningful utilization of mental health services by consumers who experience health disparities. Specifically, individuals facing isolation due to linguistic, literacy, or cultural bariers often face challenges in procuring mental health care. These challenges are in part due to the medical and mental systems' present lack of integration and failure to take into account the importance of social cohesion when delivering care. Addressing these gaps in the healthcare industry, the objective of this proposal is to create a dynamic communication platform that uses multi-channel message delivery to (i) provide culturally competent, language-concordant mental health content to consumers facing health disparities; (ii) empower providers to integrate medical and mental health care, both through shared message delivery and integration with electronic medical record (EMR) systems; and (iii) strengthen social cohesion by connecting isolated clients not only to physical and mental health message campaigns but also to community resources and peer supports critical to augmenting social well-being. The goal of Phase I is to create a series of depression and anxiety Messages and to assess whether they influence health knowledge and attitudinal change among mental health consumer participants and the suitability of the proposed technology for mental health and social service sectors. During Phase II, we will build the fully functional web-based communication platform, which will include a peer counseling function and integration with EMR systems. We will populate the integrated system with several hundred mental health and social support audio, text, and email messages in English, Spanish, and Mandarin. The project will culminate in two six-month summative evaluations with institutional and community service providers to assess the effectiveness of the proposed technology in increasing access to information about mental health and social supports, improving service and clinical outcomes, and enhancing quality of care and social cohesion for consumers who face disparities in access to mental health services.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Multi-channel communication platforms are a promising solution to the problem of uneven access to medical, mental, and social services experienced by those experiencing health disparities. The proposed project-the development of an integrated, web-based communication platform targeting mental health and social cohesion-will employ messaging including Interactive Voice Response (IVR), text, and email to (i) disseminate language-concordant, culturally competent messages; (ii) facilitate care integration between medical, mental health, and social service fields; and (iii) enrich social cohesion by connecting clients to providers between appointments, to community resources, and to peer supports. Providing such personalized, accessible care will ameliorate the present knowledge and access gaps among isolated and underserved communities and will improve health outcomes by connecting individuals to critical health services and community support networks.              Multi-channel communication platforms are a promising solution to the problem of uneven access to medical, mental, and social services experienced by those experiencing health disparities.

"Regional Network for Mental Health Research in Latin America DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overriding objective of our Hub for Latin America (HLA) is to improve the condition of people with severe mental disorders in Latin America. We propose to do so by making a focused contribution to narrowing the ""mental health gap"". Our long-term goal is to improve health services for people with severe mental disorders until they are equivalent to the best health services offered to people with highly prioritized general health conditions. We envision an integrated system of primary care and secondary mental health services that we refer to as Community Health Care for individuals with Severe Mental Disorders (CHC-SMD). We adopt a multi-pronged approach that is tailored to the distinctive context of the urban areas of Latin America. Our goals for the 5-year grant period are to launch strategic initiatives that will generate significant progress toward CHC-SMD in this region, and to build a platform for ongoing progress over a longer time period.    The HLA brings together key researchers and stakeholders from six cities across Latin America (Santiago, Chile; Rio de Janeiro, Brazil; Buenos Aires, Cordoba, Neuquen, Argentina; Medellin, Colombia) with researchers in New York City in a concerted effort to make progress toward a shared vision of CHC-SMD. The Components are designed to be synergistic so that the impact of the whole HLA is greater than the sum of its parts. The Research Component, for example, proposes to pilot a regional randomized controlled trial (RCT). In order for the HLA to proceed as planned to conduct a full scale regional RCT, the Capacity Building Component will need to train leaders at the HLA sites to conduct RCTs and coordinate regional studies. At the same time, the pilot RCT will help generate this capacity by providing practical experience in RCTs and regional studies.    Our overall specific aims are (a) to deploy and evaluate task shifting approaches that can accelerate progress toward CHC-SMD; (b) to train young leaders with the capacities required to generate ongoing progress toward CHC-SMD; and (c) to bring together multiple stakeholders to contribute to implementing and shaping CHC-SMD. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Within Latin American cities people with severe mental disorders are a vulnerable population whose lives are often characterized by extreme poverty, social exclusion from education, employment, and participation in civil society, multiple traumas including violence and abuse, reduced access to health care and high mortality rates. Equitable development, as endorsed by international conventions, requires the inclusion of this vulnerable population in the benefits of development and the protection of their civil and human rights. The overriding objective of our Hub for Latin America (HLA) is to improve the condition of this vulnerable group through an integrated system of primary care and secondary mental health services tailored to the distinctive context of the urban areas of Latin America.",Regional Network for Mental Health Research in Latin America,8335431,U19MH095718,"['Argentina ', ' psychological disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Brazil ', ' Chile ', ' Cities ', ' Civil Rights ', ' Colombia ', ' Communities ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Complement ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Employment ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' health care service ', ' Health Services ', ' healthcare service availability ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare access availability ', ' health services availability ', ' health care service availability ', ' health care service access ', ' health care availability ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Availability of Health Services ', ' Accessibility of health care ', ' Access to Healthcare ', ' Access to Health Care ', ' Access to Care ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' Human Rights ', ' Latin America ', ' Leadership ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene Services ', ' Mental Health Services ', ' Mortality ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Multiple Wounds ', ' Multiple Injuries ', ' Multiple Trauma ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' New York City ', ' Poverty ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Primary Care ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Psychiatry ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Strikes ', ' Employee Strikes ', ' Time ', ' Universities ', ' violent behavior ', ' violent ', ' Violence ', ' visual function ', ' Sight ', ' Vision ', ' Community Health Care ', ' Community Healthcare ', ' urban area ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' Shapes ', ' programs ', ' Adopted ', ' Complex ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' Country ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' Exclusion ', ' social inequality ', ' social ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' Institution ', ' International ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Sum ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' public health relevance ', ' civil society ', ' ']",NIMH,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,U19,2012,713585,0.05596283974428328
"Behavioral Health Screening in the Medical Home: Enhancing Cultural Competence    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Universal behavioral health screening in the pediatric medical home has the potential to reduce racial and ethnic mental health disparities as standardized tools can systematically identify all children with elevated problem behaviors and referrals can be made. Even when referrals are made, however, mental health services tend to be underutilized, particularly by racial and ethnic minority families and families raising very young children. Therefore, the first aim of the proposed research is to explore, within the context of the medical home, predictors of family follow-up with an on-site behavioral health consultant upon referral. Several factors, including child and family characteristics, parental depression, and parental worry about child behavior, will be explored as predictors (N=2000 parents of children under the age of 5 years). At least part of the disconnect between screening and referral practices and engagement in services may stem from cultural and linguistic barriers between providers and families. Thus, the second aim of the proposed research is to develop and evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness of a cultural competency intervention module to improve pediatric provider use of and comfort with behavioral health screening across racial and ethnic minorities. An intervention module that targets cultural and linguistic barriers to behavioral health screening will be developed and presented to providers in several primary care pediatric sites following a brief screening compliance training. While focusing on broadly defined cultural and linguistic competency, the training will emphasize issues relevant to working with Hispanic families given their growing population and documented disparities in preventive screening, referrals, and mental health care. Extant training programs will be adapted based on individual interviews and focus groups with pediatric providers and parents. It is hypothesized that pediatric provider training will result in improvements in screening completion rates across ethnically and racially diverse families, as well as providers' self- reported knowledge, beliefs, and attitudes toward screening and referral practices with racial and ethnic minorities.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The proposed research will contribute to (a) a better understanding of universal behavioral health screening practices within the pediatric medical home; and (b) ways of ensuring that screening practices serve their intended purpose of linking families, particularly underserved racial and ethnic minority families, with needed services. This research will help to elucidate barriers to behavioral health screening and referral practices within the pediatric medical home and explore avenues for improving these practices and reducing racial and ethnic disparities in mental health care.

"Multiple-Impact Effectiveness of a State Supported Employment Policy Initiative    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose an observational study to examine a broad range of impacts produced by a state policy initiative that increased accessibility and availability of the evidence-based individual placement and support (IPS) model of supported-employment (SE) services for persons with severe mental illness (SMI) in Maryland. We will study the experience of Maryland's public mental health system (PMHS) in facilitating the diffusion of IPS-SE services in the state. Our research exploits inter-temporal and geographic variations in accessibility and availability of IPS-SE services 1) over time in the period 2002-2010 and 2) across geographic areas of Maryland. We also examine variations across providers in fidelity to the IPS-SE model. We propose to study the observed effectiveness of this state policy initiative in its actual operation and impact. This study will extend evaluative research on IPS-SE beyond the current focus on efficacy/effectiveness in small-scale RCT trials of a limited number of sites. We also propose to combine data from multiple public sector databases to expand the range of SE impacts studied, beyond the current research focus on employment outcomes, to include impacts on mental health status, and on mental health and somatic health treatment costs.  The policy initiative that promoted the implementation and diffusion of IPS-SE services, undertaken by the Maryland Mental Hygiene Administration (MHA), began as a pilot project in 2002. MHA provided funding for training service providers and for monitoring providers for fidelity with the IPS-SE model. Beginning in 2006, financial incentives were given to providers for offering IPS-SE services, and for meeting fidelity benchmarks.  This MHA initiative increased accessibility and availability of IPS-SE services for persons with SMI, with major increases, occurring in the period from 2004 to 2010, that also varied by geographic area. We plan to use data on individuals with SMI from several large, defined cohorts 1) of Maryland Medicaid recipients and 2) of other non-Medicaid-covered users of PMHS services, followed over the 2002-2010 period. Using these data, we will assess the impacts of the MHA policy initiative on (1) the take-up rate of IPS-SE services, (2) disparities by race and ethnicity in the rate of IPS-SE service use, (3) the mental health status of IPS-SE users relative to non-users, (4) costs of treatment for mental health specialty services and other health services for users vs. non-users of IPS-SE services, and (5) employment and earnings of users vs. non-users of IPS-SE services. We also will examine the impact of varying IPS-SE provider fidelity levels on these outcomes.  A variety of regression analysis methods are proposed for estimating these policy impacts, including instrumental variables-generalized method of moments (IV-GMM) procedures, reduced-form regression models, models based on pooling of data on individuals over time, and analyses based on sequences of cross- sectional regressions. We propose IV-GMM methods to account for unobservable factors influencing selection into use of IPS-SE services, as well as tests for our assumption of endogeneity of the indicator of IPS-SE use.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This proposal addresses one the focus areas Healthy People 2010 that is proposed to be retained for Health People 2020: Increase the proportion of persons with serious mental illness (SMI) who are employed.

"Implementing Health Care Interventions for Hispanics with Serious Mental Illness    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Compared to majority whites with serious mental illness (SMI; e.g., schizophrenia), racial/ethnic minorities with SMI are at higher risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD). Although promising treatments (e.g., care manager interventions) exist to improve the health of people with SMI, limited attention has been paid to the process of making these interventions culturally relevant to Hispanics with SMI and to promote their use in the public mental health system. The objective of this Mentored Research Scientist Development Award (K01) is to prepare the candidate to become an independent investigator in implementation research to address the disparities in physical health care faced by underserved minorities with SMI. A mentoring team, led by Drs. Lewis-Fernandez and Druss, will guide the candidate in achieving the following training objectives: 1) obtain training in implementation research, focusing on community-based participatory research (CBPR) approaches as a translational strategy; 2) develop expertise on the integration of physical and mental health care for people with SMI; 3) acquire new skills in using intervention mapping and qualitative methods to inform intervention research; and 4) obtain training in clinical trial methodology and longitudinal data analysis. The application integrates course work, mentorship from established investigators, and mentored research activities. The research plan uses a collaborative intervention planning framework that blends principles of CBPR and intervention mapping to modify and assess the feasibility and acceptability of an existing care manager intervention. This 12-month intervention focuses on improving patient activation and the coordination of medical care between outpatient mental health clinics and primary care. The proposed project uses a multiphase approach supported by the candidate's training plan. In Phase 1, a community advisory board composed of researchers and stakeholders will be assembled to learn and review the intervention and make initial modifications. During Phase 2, qualitative methods - patient focus groups and stakeholder interviews - will be used to ensure that the modifications are acceptable to all stakeholders. In Phase 3, results from Phase 2 are used to further modify the intervention, develop an implementation plan, and train two care managers on the modified intervention. Phase 4 consists of a 12-month open pilot study (N = 30) to assess the feasibility and acceptability of the modified intervention and explore its effect. Lastly, Phase 5 will focus on analysis of pilot study data and preparation of an R01 proposal. The research plan will yield pilot data for a subsequent R01 to conduct a randomized controlled trial to test the effectiveness and implementation of the modified intervention.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This K01 prepares the candidate to develop an independent program of research focused on the implementation of integrated physical and mental health services in the public mental health system to improve the physical health and wellness of underserved minorities with SMI. This project responds to objectives 3 and 4 of the NIMH Strategic Plan which call for the development of better interventions that incorporate the needs of diverse people with mental illness and ensures the translation of research findings into clinical practice to enhance NIMH's public health mission.

"Culture, Context, and Mexican American Mental Health ABSTRACT  This proposal seeks 5 years of continued support for a longitudinal study of processes that contribute to the  high levels of psychopathology experienced by Mexican American youth. Consistent with priorities in the NIMH  Strategic Plan (2008), this study is designed to (1) chart mental illness trajectories of Mexican American youth,  (2) increase our capacity to predict who in this population is at risk for mental illness by identifying individual,  environmental, and social factors that contribute to both risk and resilience processes, (3) identify contributors  to the mental health disparities experienced by Mexican Americans, and (4) provide a scientific foundation for  the design of the next generation of preventive interventions for this population. Beginning with a diverse  sample of 750 Mexican American families, this study tests hypotheses regarding how interactions of  individuals' cultural orientations with characteristics of family, community, peer, and school contexts contribute  to the mental health burden of this population. A unique aspect of this study is the assessment of cultural  orientation (i.e., degree of endorsement of traditional Mexican cultural values and degree of endorsement of  U.S. cultural values) of children and parents as well as the degree to which communities and schools support  these cultural traditions. Children and their parents were assessed initially when children were in 5th and 7th  grades. Results supported the specific aims: (1) changes in children's and parents' cultural orientations are  related to greater risk for mental health disorders; (2) family characteristics, such as parent-child conflict,  mediate the relation between cultural orientation mismatches and children's psychopathology; and (3) child  and parent cultural orientations buffer relations between common risk factors (e.g., economic hardship) and  children's mental health. The proposed continuation will assess this sample of children and their parents as  youth experience the rapid developmental changes of middle adolescence (grades 10 and 12) when rates of  psychopathology accelerate. The specific aims remain: (1) cultural mismatches between children and family,  community, and school contexts will be related to risk for psychopathology; (2) family and peer group  processes will mediate relations between cultural mismatches and psychopathology; and (3) cultural  orientations of children and their parents will moderate relations between risk factors and psychopathology.  Longitudinal tests of these aims will provide a strong foundation for the next generation of prevention programs  to reduce mental health disparities for Mexican Americans. NARRATIVE  This longitudinal study of 750 Mexican American adolescents and their parents is important from a public  health standpoint because of the mental health disparities Mexican American adolescents experience, and the  limited knowledge about factors that contribute to these disparities. This study is designed to (1) chart mental  illness trajectories of Mexican American youth, (2) increase our capacity to predict who in this population is at  risk for mental illness by identifying individual, environmental, and social factors that contribute to both risk and  resilience processes, (3) identify contributors to the mental health disparities experienced by Mexican  Americans, and (4) provide a firm scientific foundation for the design of the next generation of preventive  interventions for this population in order to reduce the individual, family, and societal burden of  psychopathology within this population.","Culture, Context, and Mexican American Mental Health",8257563,R01MH068920,"['drug use ', ' Drug usage ', ' Immigrant ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Knowledge ', ' Event ', ' Source ', ' Application Context ', ' contextual factors ', ' meetings ', ' inner city ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' success ', ' cohesion ', ' high school ', ' Prevention program ', ' peer ', ' deviancy ', ' deviant ', ' cultural values ', ' social ', ' substance abuse ', ' abuse of substances ', ' Substance abuse problem ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' boys ', ' girls ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Low income ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Child Mental Health ', ' Adherence ', ' Adherence (attribute) ', ' Data ', ' Developmental Process ', ' National Institute on Drug Abuse ', ' NIDA ', ' National Institute of Drug Abuse ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' Strategic Planning ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' time use ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' next generation ', ' resilience ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' malleable risk ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' therapy design ', ' early adolescence ', ' Cultural Assimilation ', ' Acculturation ', ' teenage ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' Adolescence ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Behavior ', ' psychological disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Belief ', ' Origin of Life ', ' Biogenesis ', ' Buffers ', ' Censuses ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' CDC ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' youngster ', ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Communities ', ' Conflict ', ' Conflict (Psychology) ', ' Cultural Characteristics ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Economics ', ' Employment ', ' Environment ', ' Family ', ' Family Characteristics ', ' Foundations ', ' Sex Roles ', ' Gender Role ', ' Grant ', ' social group process ', ' Group Processes ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Income ', ' long-term study ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' achievement Mainstream Education ', ' Mainstreaming ', ' Educational Mainstreaming ', ' Mainstreaming (Education) ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Chicanos ', ' Chicanas ', ' Mexican Americans ', ' Persons ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' NIMH ', ' National Institute of Mental Health (U.S.) ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' parent offspring interaction ', ' parent child interaction ', ' Parent-Child Relationship ', ' Parent-Child Relations ', ' Parents ', ' Peer Group ', ' abnormal psychology ', ' Psychopathology ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Records ', ' recruit ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' Research ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Research Design ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Schools ', ' Social transformation ', ' Social modification ', ' Social Change ', ' Social Class ', ' social support network ', ' Social support ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Measures ', ' Parenting ', ' Parenting behavior ', ' Mediating ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Youth ', ' disorders of conduct ', ' disorder of conduct ', ' Conduct Disorder ', ' rural area ', ' suburbia ', ' suburban ', ' suburb ', ' Family Study ', ' Left ', ' Site ', ' Phase ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' psychological ', ' psychologic ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Adolescent ', ' Link ', ' teacher ', ' Individual ', ' Mexican ', ' Relative Risks ', ' ']",NIMH,ARIZONA STATE UNIVERSITY-TEMPE CAMPUS,R01,2012,679260,0.05000922608620424
"Telemental Health to Improve MH Care & Outcomes for Children in Underserved Areas    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The need for new models for delivering mental heath services within primary care (PC) has been recognized for two decades, yet federal funding to address this need has been lacking. Telemental health (TMH) programs are being implemented nationally to address inequities in access to mental health services, but little scientific evidence is available regarding their efficacy, particularly with children. The goal of the proposed research is to test the efficacy of a TMH service delivery model for improving care and outcomes for children with a prevalent psychiatric condition who are treated by primary care physicians (PCPs) in 5 underserved communities in the Pacific Northwest. The research proposed is a randomized controlled trial of PCP care augmented by TMH-delivered evidence- based treatment of children (N=250) 7-11 years old diagnosed with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) versus treatment as usual by the PCP. Hispanic children will comprise 30% of the study sample. The experimental condition will consist of 6 pharmacotherapy sessions delivered by child psychiatrists through videoconferencing in conjunction with the referring PCP who will prescribe medications and 6 sessions of parent behavioral training delivered in-person by a community therapist supervised by a telepsychologist. The control condition will consist of treatment as usual with the PCP augmented by a single telepsychiatric consultation, which is current standard care in the participating communities. For children in both experimental and control conditions, hyperactivity, inattentiveness, oppositionality/defiance, and functional impairment, as well as parental stress, burden, and empowerment will be assessed 5 times from baseline to 25-week follow- up. In the experimental group, adherence to treatment protocols will be carefully monitored for families, telepsychiatrists, local community therapists, and PCPs. If under the experimental delivery model, improvements in clinical outcomes are demonstrated, and if an evidence-based treatment protocol can be implemented with fidelity, then TMH health service delivery models could be deployed with confidence to help rectify the severe geographic maldistribution of pediatric mental health services and to build new models of collaborative care within PC. This telemental health (TMH) investigation holds promise for improving the nation's public health and welfare in three ways. First, TMH offers children and families suffering with emotional and behavioral disorders help that cannot be found locally by redistributing specialty mental health care from urban centers to underserved communities. Second, TMH offers secondary and tertiary prevention by reaching children's in need prior to the full evolution of mental illness and its associated impairments. Third, TMH offers primary care physicians, teachers, and other professionals' assistance in their efforts to care for our nation's children.

"Improving Mental Health Services for Low-Income Latinos in Primary Care IMPROVING MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES FOR LOW-INCOME LATINOS IN PRIMARY CARE  Building community capacity to deliver accessible mental health services to Latino Immigrants is much needed.  Latinos in the US are less likely to utilize mental health services than non-Latino Whites, and they are less likely to receive guideline-concordant care, with disparities increasing.  The Community Academic Partnership for Mental Health (CAP-MH) seeks to address these concerns by strengthening an existing partnership between the Center for Trauma and the Community (CTC) in the Psychiatry Department at Georgetown Medical School, and the Primary Care Coalition (PCC) of Montgomery County, to support the timely development and evaluation of culturally competent, trauma-sensitive, and innovative interventions to improve patient mental health.  A major goal of this project is to integrate clinical research into the clinical care process at the community clinic level.  Thus, PCC¿s electronic medical record (EMR) will be improved by upgrading the mental health section, including the addition of custom data elements required for specific research protocol interventions, and essential functionalities, including improved data summary functions. Once the EMR has been upgraded, a naturalistic evaluation of the Montgomery Cares Behavioral Health Program (MCBHP) will be conducted, comparing clinics with and without the program.  The study aims include, 1) To evaluate the extent of implementation of the ongoing MCBHP via examination of MCBHP-related process parameters, including extent of guideline-concordant care provision; 2) To evaluate the effectiveness of the MCBHP on mental health outcomes (depression, anxiety); and, 3) among the subset of patients with comorbid chronic health conditions (diabetes, hypertension, obesity), to evaluate the effectiveness of the MCBHP on mental health, health behaviors, and health-related outcomes. Background support work will include interviews and focus groups with providers and other staff, whose input will be used to help design flexible aspects of the EMR and the study. This partnership will begin to serve as a laboratory for community-informed intervention development to improve services, and ultimately the health, of a large underserved minority population. Narrative (for the lay public) Latino populations have difficulty accessing culturally sensitive mental health services.  The proposed project will address these disparities by building the community¿s capacity to develop and study mental health services for the Latino community in a primary care service provider organization in Montgomery County, MD. A study of a clinical program that is already delivering mental health services in the community will be evaluated, with clinicians and staff providing input to help us design the study.

"Implementing Health Care Interventions for Hispanics with Serious Mental Illness    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Compared to majority whites with serious mental illness (SMI; e.g., schizophrenia), racial/ethnic minorities with SMI are at higher risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD). Although promising treatments (e.g., care manager interventions) exist to improve the health of people with SMI, limited attention has been paid to the process of making these interventions culturally relevant to Hispanics with SMI and to promote their use in the public mental health system. The objective of this Mentored Research Scientist Development Award (K01) is to prepare the candidate to become an independent investigator in implementation research to address the disparities in physical health care faced by underserved minorities with SMI. A mentoring team, led by Drs. Lewis-Fernandez and Druss, will guide the candidate in achieving the following training objectives: 1) obtain training in implementation research, focusing on community-based participatory research (CBPR) approaches as a translational strategy; 2) develop expertise on the integration of physical and mental health care for people with SMI; 3) acquire new skills in using intervention mapping and qualitative methods to inform intervention research; and 4) obtain training in clinical trial methodology and longitudinal data analysis. The application integrates course work, mentorship from established investigators, and mentored research activities. The research plan uses a collaborative intervention planning framework that blends principles of CBPR and intervention mapping to modify and assess the feasibility and acceptability of an existing care manager intervention. This 12-month intervention focuses on improving patient activation and the coordination of medical care between outpatient mental health clinics and primary care. The proposed project uses a multiphase approach supported by the candidate's training plan. In Phase 1, a community advisory board composed of researchers and stakeholders will be assembled to learn and review the intervention and make initial modifications. During Phase 2, qualitative methods - patient focus groups and stakeholder interviews - will be used to ensure that the modifications are acceptable to all stakeholders. In Phase 3, results from Phase 2 are used to further modify the intervention, develop an implementation plan, and train two care managers on the modified intervention. Phase 4 consists of a 12-month open pilot study (N = 30) to assess the feasibility and acceptability of the modified intervention and explore its effect. Lastly, Phase 5 will focus on analysis of pilot study data and preparation of an R01 proposal. The research plan will yield pilot data for a subsequent R01 to conduct a randomized controlled trial to test the effectiveness and implementation of the modified intervention.        This K01 prepares the candidate to develop an independent program of research focused on the implementation of integrated physical and mental health services in the public mental health system to improve the physical health and wellness of underserved minorities with SMI. This project responds to objectives 3 and 4 of the NIMH Strategic Plan which call for the development of better interventions that incorporate the needs of diverse people with mental illness and ensures the translation of research findings into clinical practice to enhance NIMH's public health mission.

"Development of an international cultural neuroscience consortium    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): By 2050, nearly one in five Americans (19%) will be an immigrant, including Hispanics, Blacks and Asians, compared with one in eight (12%) in 2005 (Pew Research Center, 2008). Prior research indicates the prevalence of population mental health disparities across ethnic and racial minority groups. The Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies (2009) estimates that eliminating racial/ethnic minority health disparities would have reduced indirect costs in the United States associated with illness and premature death by more than $1 trillion between 2003 and 2006 alone. Given this increase in cultural diversity within the United States and the existence of costly population health disparities across cultural groups, it is essential to develop a more sophisticated understanding of how culture affects basic psychological and biological mechanisms underlying mental health across diverse communities as well as how such basic research in culture and health can be translated in applied settings to reduce population health disparities in quality and access to treatment for illness.  The goal of the proposed grant is to implement a series of scientific meetings and infrastructural initiatives to create interdisciplinary teams of basic behavioral and social scientists that adopt a cultural neuroscience approach to addressing questions central to culture and health, particularly global mental health and population mental health disparities. Our goal is to create and sustain an international, interdisciplinary community of scientists that will allow for the acceleration, expansion, and strengthening of the scope of investigation in the emerging field of cultural neuroscience as well as to increase the sophistication of theoretical, methodological, and analytical approaches in cultural neuroscience.

"Advanced Center to Improve Pediatric Mental Health Care (ACIPMHC) We propose to establish an Advanced Center to Improve Pediatric Mental Health Care (ACIPMHC) that will be located within the Child and Adolescent Services Research Center (CASRC) at Rady Children's Hospital-San Diego. The ACIPMHC will have strong linkage to the intervention development program at the Center for Research to Practice (CR2P) at the Oregon Social Learning Center (OSLC) and to other intervention and services research programs and networks around the country. The research agenda has a strategic focus on improvement of public pediatric mental health care, primarily in the mental health and child welfare service sectors, through improved integration of evidence-based practice and usual care. The center's program of practice research spans clinical epidemiology studies linked to evidence-based practice, effectiveness, and implementation studies. The research agenda will have a primary focus on effectiveness and equity as two of the six aims for improving health care from the ""Crossing the Quality Chasm"" report. An overarching center perspective of cultural exchange will guide active partnership with major stakeholders in youth mental health care, including youth and family consumers, providers, program and funding managers, system administrators, policy makers, and intervention and services researchers.   The Principal Research Core (PRC) will focus on practice research through two developmental studies addressing implementation of two established evidence-based practices. These studies and others to be designed by the center network of investigators will be carried out in community-based mental health and child welfare service settings, building on already developed research-practice relationships. The Research Methods Core (RMC) will advance methods for effectiveness and implementation research through four workgroups focusing on (a) design and analysis, (b) measurement, (c) mixed methods, and (d) economic analyses, as well as one developmental study addressing incorporation of research-based measurement in usual care child welfare practice. The Community Network Core (CNC) will strengthen a multiple sector infrastructure in San Diego County and link research activities to an emerging research network in the State of California that partners with the California Institute of Mental Health, a technical assistance arm of the county mental health directors in California. The Operations Core (OC) will provide leadership and will support activities in the other three cores by extending an effective infrastructure developed through two prior services research center grants and participating as one of six sites in an R-25 training consortium. All cores will advance practice research to inform improvements in mental health care that decrease racial-ethnic disparities.

"Racial/Ethnic Disparities In Mental Health Service and Medical Care Expenditures     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Compared to Non-Latino White Americans, Black and Latino populations often receive health services of lower intensity or quality. This is particularl true in the area of mental health. Black and Latino populations are often less likely than Non-Latino Whites to receive timely and accurate mental health diagnoses, and less likely than Whites to receive evidence-based treatments for mental health conditions. Despite these large gaps, there is a lack of consensus whether disparities in mental health expenditures are primarily due to differences in access to care or whether there are also disparities in the quality or intensity of mental health services (MHS) among those with access. Identifying the point at which disparities occur in the delivery of MHS is critical to the development of targeted interventions to improve the quality of mental health services, particularly for underserved minority populations. The overall objective of this study is to answer questions of inequity in the delivery of MHS among racial/ethnic minority populations at-risk for mental illness. The project aims are: 1) to resolve the question of whether racial/ethnic differences in mental health expenditures are due to differences in access to care or whether there are also differences in the intensity of services provided; 2) to determine if the known racial/ethnic disparity in MHS is even greater among those with greater mental health needs; and 3) To determine if the hypothesized interaction between race/ethnicity and mental health needs (Aim 2) extends to similar disadvantages in use of medical care. To meet the study objectives, this study proposes to use longitudinal data from the National Health Interview Survey and the linked two-year Medical Expenditures Panel Survey. My approach uses a validated screening measure of psychological distress in both the NHIS and MEPS to identify individuals varying in need for mental health services. The outcomes of interest (outpatient mental health expenditures; overall medical care expenditures) are identified prospectively from the MEPS. The analytic approach employs multivariate two-part models (logit, GLM) to estimate racial/ethnic disparities in the probability of service use and in the average service expenditures among adults varying in need for mental health services. Study findings will help to resolve questions of the origin of racial/ethnic disparities in MHS. By estimating service expenditures across populations varying in need, this research will determine if the healthcare system is less responsive to the increased mental health needs of racial/ethnic minority populations. Study findings may identify particular sub- populations disadvantaged by the healthcare system that may benefit from initiatives to improve the quality of MHS, particularly in the primary care setting. In the face of health reform, this research will offer guidance to ensure equitable resource allocation for Black and Latino populations that is needed to improve the health and well-being of the nation.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research will provide improved understandings of inequalities in the distribution of mental health and medical care resources among racial/ethnic minorities who have an elevated risk-for mental illness. As large numbers of Black and Latino minorities are likely to gain access to insurance through the Affordable Care Act, study findings will be useful for guiding the development of policies to improve access to and quality of mental health services for vulnerable and underserved populations. By bringing attention to medical and mental health service expenditures, study findings may inform healthcare initiatives which aim to improve the integration of mental health services in medical care, particularly for racial/ethnic minorities.              The proposed research will provide improved understandings of inequalities in the distribution of mental health and medical care resources among racial/ethnic minorities who have an elevated risk-for mental illness.

"Feasible Delivery of CBT for Rural Latino Youth with Anxiety    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Children with anxiety disorders are often characterized by an unmet need for treatment however, in special populations such as Latino and rural youth, such disparities are compounded by the effects of culture and geographic isolation. More specifically, barriers related to language, stigma, and access often lead to lower rates of utilization and poorer outcomes among children in need of mental health services (Alvidrez and Azocar, 1999; McCabe et al., 2002; Myers et al., 2008; Vega et al., 2001). These findings are disappointing given abundant data supporting the effectiveness of cognitive behavior and behavior therapies for children with anxiety disorders (Barrett et al., 1996; Beidel et al., 2007; Kendall & Southam-Gerow, 1996; Walkup et al., 2008). Efforts to examine feasible methods to deliver evidence-based treatments to children with anxiety disorders are critical in order to extend quality care to underserved groups. The goal of this R34 is to address these disparities, by translating and tailoring an existing child anxiety cognitive behavior therapy program (The Cool Kids Outreach Program; Lyneham and Rapee, 2006), to fit the needs of Spanish-speaking rural families and examining the feasibility, acceptability, tolerability and safety of implementing this intervention using varying modes of delivery. Qualitative methodologies which include focus groups with bicultural and bilingual mental health providers and individual interviews with rural Latino parents will be used to examine the acceptability and cultural appropriateness of the intervention. Using these findings and other extant literature, an expert panel guided by a cultural adaptation framework (Lau, 2006), will determine the extent to which tailoring of the Cool Kids Outreach Program is necessary. Next, a pilot study for children (age 8-13) with anxiety disorders (i.e., separation anxiety disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, social anxiety disorder, and specific phobias) will be conducted and 40 children will be randomized to two service delivery modes which represent varying levels of therapist contact: 1) 20 families will be randomized to a telephone-based, therapist- supported CBT program, and; 2) 20 families will be randomized to a more minimal contact bilbiotherapy condition (primarily CBT self-help materials). All families will be recruited from primary care settings, given its defacto mental health service status. Feasibility and clinical outcomes will be measured at baseline, midtreatment and post-treatment. Additionally, during exit interviews, participants (as well as those who may have dropped out of the program) will be asked to discuss the perceived usefulness, acceptability, and impact of the intervention. This pilot study will provide important data regarding the feasibility, acceptability, tolerability and safety of the intervention conditions as well as the opportunity to pilot procedures that will be used in a larger effectiveness trial with rural Latino youth.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This R34 proposal will incorporate the perspectives of family and community mental health providers, to tailor, as necessary, an evidence based treatment for child anxiety disorders, in order to meet the needs of a hard-to- reach group (i.e., rural Latino youth). The pilot study will examine the feasibility of new modes of service delivery (e.g., a minimal therapist contact, self-help program, and a more intensive therapist supported, telephone-based approach) that may ultimately improve access to evidence based treatments and mental health outcomes among underserved groups. These findings will ultimately inform a larger program of research focusing on effectiveness and dissemination efforts for children with anxiety disorders, using service delivery approaches that allow for the personalization of mental health care.

"Cultural Development of an Adolescent Mental Health Quality of Life Instrument    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Improving health related quality of life (HRQOL) is a major goal in the treatment of all chronic illnesses. In addition, there is growing consensus that assessment of quality of life is crucial to provide a complete picture of children's physical and mental health status. To our knowledge there are no HRQOL instruments specifically developed for adolescents with mental health problems. Therefore, the central goal of the proposed application is to develop, test, and validate an adolescent HRQOL instrument for mental health [AQOL-MH) in Spanish and English. This will provide a culturally valid outcome measure that will contribute to reduce mental health care disparities. This instrument will help mental health professionals focus on particular HRQOL domains during the diagnostic process; thereby assisting both patients and providers set, define and evaluate adequate treatment goals. This proposal presents a unique opportunity for a young faculty with extensive experience in behavioral sciences research, to advance her career and obtain independent funding. The ultimate objective of this proposal is to develop ah RO1 application to administer the AQOL-MH to representative clinical samples in order to target its usefulness in evaluating clinical effectiveness in treatment programs and interventions. The specific aims of this proposal are the following:      Aim 1: To develop themes that respond to the construct of quality of life as perceived by adolescents who are receiving services for mental health problems in Puerto Rican and Mexican American, as well as Anglo populations. The development will be achieved using a grounded theory approach with the use of focus groups and in-depth interviews of clinical samples of Latino and US non-Latino youth who are recruited to have one of four prevalent mental disorders; ADHD, Conduct Disorder, Generalized Anxiety, and Depression.      Aim 2: To test the psychometric properties of the measure developed in Aim 1 using clinical and nonclinical samples of youth from Puerto Rico and the US. Psychometric analyses will include assessments of internal structure, tests for differential item functioning across Latino and non-Latino as well as gender groups, and preliminary tests of construct validity.      Aim 3: Test the usefulness of the short-form AQOL-MH for tracking change during the course of service use in evidence based practice among youth with ADHD and Depression disorders in Puerto Rico. To achieve this aim we will recruit 60 youth who begin to receive treatment and we will obtain a baseline and two repeated assessments of HRQOL at six month intervals.

"Bronx Youth Partnership on Mental Health Disparities For the past two years, AECOM's Preventive Intervention Research Center has been the lead agency for a  Bronx community coalition, led by adolescents, ""Albert's Leaders of Tomorrow"" (A.L.O.T.). It used CPBR to  identify mental health disparities as the most important to address among minority inner-city adolescents,  and with a Coalition of 48 community agencies, it developed BxThunder, a mental health intervention. We  plan to conduct a randomized controlled trial of BxThunder in 3 community agencies: Mosholu-Montefiore  Community Center, Wildcat Academy, and Citizen's Advice Bureau. BxThunder has three parts: PART I.  TEEN is an award-winning positive youth development program that improves mental health and trains teens  to be peer educators; PART II. graduates will join ""ALOTMore"" and implement a multimedia workshop in  Bronx agencies to teach about mental health and reduce stigma; PART III. teens in BxThunder who need  mental health services will receive them on site from clinical psychologists and externs from three community  partners, Lehman College CUNY, Wurzweiler School of Social Work, and Ferkauf Graduate School of  Psychology.We will conduct an intent-to-treat randomized controlled trial of BxThunder. We will recruit 240  teens at each site (n=720 total), and randomize them to receive BxThunder or standard care. Teens will be  interviewed at baseline and 6- and 12-months later. Outcome measures are positive mental health  (Resiliency Scales for Adolescents, RSCA; The Self-Perception Profile for Adolescents, SPPA) and  psychological symptoms (Youth Self Report, YSR). Among symptomatic teens, we will assess the number  of identified youth who received a referral for services; the number of those who implemented the referral;  the number who are in or have completed services; and their mental health outcomes (symptoms) after  treatment. The Specific Aims are to test the hypotheses that, compared to control teens:  (1) teens in BxThunder will experience fewer mental health symptoms;  (2) teens in BxThunder will experience a greater increase in positive mental health;  (3) teens with psychological problems in BxThunder are more likely to have a successful referral for care,  and are more likely to complete treatment;  (4) teens in BxThunder with psychological problems will experience a larger reduction in psychological  symptoms;  (5) the BxCAM workshop will increase knowledge and decrease stigma among those who attend, as  measured by change in pre-test and post-test measures of workshop attendees.  A sustainability project will be designed and implemented by Affinity Health Plan in conjunction with the New  York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene.

"A novel post-disaster mental health training for black communities    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The disparities in disaster-related mental health problems highlight the highlighted the need for local pre-disaster planning in black communities living in high stress areas. Training in Post Disaster Mental Health in Black Communities is a train the trainer, group-level intervention designed to improve the local disaster mental health readiness. HERMES' Phase I study developed a training package based on needs assessment. The results indicate that the training of both clinical providers and community leaders is a promising model for integrating culturally appropriate mental health in local response strategies. Aims: Our Phase II field study will further refine the curriculum components and field test the acceptability, adaptability, effectiveness, and sustainability of our model in high stress black communities of coastal and rural eastern North Carolina and downtown Charleston and Low Country areas in South Carolina. Method: We will recruit and train a core team of mental health providers to deliver clinical provider- and community leader-tailored training workshops to 240 participants in eight target communities. Local collaborative planning teams will be supported by web-based exercise and group training components. Participants will complete evaluations follow each training component and pre, post and 3, 6, and 12 month follow- up tests on knowledge and self-rated competency skills. We will measure benchmarks of increased capacity and performance-based skills using qualitative interviews and site profiles. Expected Results: The triangulation of process and outcome data will determine the effectiveness of this model for increasing knowledge and skills in providing culturally competent mental health support for survivors in the immediate aftermath of disasters. We also will identify best training and local planning practices for promoting and sustaining resilience and document case studies that illustrate the mitigation of disaster-related mental health consequences.        HERMES proposes to field test a training model and materials designed to build an  integrated local capacity in black communities to respond to mental in the immediate aftermath of a disaster. The training is will prepare clinical providers and community- based organization leaders who have the relational advantage of insiders to mitigate the risk of longer term mental health consequences that result from disasters. HERMES, will further develop the model according to feasible results and collaborate with partners in implementing a train the trainer model. Follow up sessions will cover clinical treatment and planning skills building with a web-based Community of Practice containing multi- media exercises and information resources to support site clinical and community planning teams. This blended learning product will fill a growing market demand among response agencies and has promise for spinoffs in complementary areas. The resulting product is marketable as social capital building strategy that will increase the coordination and efficiency of mental services in low-resource disaster affected communities.

"Research Training: Socio-Economics of Mental Health Service Delivery in SE Europe    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The University of California, Berkeley and Babes-Bolyai University, Cluj, Romania, propose to provide advanced, multidisciplinary research training to outstanding pre- and post-doctoral economists, psychiatrists, sociologists, clinicians, and mental health professionals from South Eastern Europe (SEE) in the latest research methods and issues regarding the economic and social factors that influence or drive the delivery of mental health care services. We propose to build upon the successful ""Finance and Mental Health Services Training in Czech Republic/Central Europe (5-D43-TW005810-10). Prof. Richard Scheffler, University of California, Berkeley, has been the PI and co-Director of this program for the past ten years. The other co-Director has been Prof. Martin Potucek, Charles University, Prague. During its span, the program has trained over sixty people from Bulgaria, Croatia, Czech Republic, Romania, and Slovakia. The past 5 years of the program has been highly successful by all measures, with over 72 publications and 3 books by its trainees. The PI of our new application will be Prof. Scheffler. Because the Czech Republic is now a high-income economy, we will replace Charles University with a new partner. We propose that the new partner be the new School of Public Health at Babes-Bolyai University (http://www.publichealth.ro/), Cluj-Napoca, Romania. SPH- BBU will serve as the hub of the program in Europe, attracting and screening candidates, and fostering their subsequent career development. Berkeley will continue to be the primary training site, providing senior faculty to mentor the trainees as they take classes, participate in seminars, and engage in research projects in their home countries. The new co-Director will be Razvan Chereches, MD, Ph.D., Babes-Bolyai University. Dr. Chereches has himself been a trainee and a project leader in our previous program. He has also participated in other NIH programs: University of Iowa International Training and Research in Occupational and Environmental Health Program, Fogarty International Center - D43 TW000621; Minority Health and Health Disparities International Research and Training, Fogarty International Center- T37 MD001453-05; and University of Iowa International Collaborative Trauma and Injury Prevention Research and Training Program, Fogarty International Center - D43 TW007261. Just as the previous program expanded from the Czech Republic into four other countries in the region, we intend to start from Romania and Bulgaria, and expand into other LMICs in SEE. The countries of interest currently include Albania, Moldova, and Serbia, but other countries of the former Yugoslavia will also be considered. Expansion into any country always depends on identifying an appropriate institution and persons who can help support qualified and interested trainees.        The University of California, Berkeley and Babes-Bolyai University, Cluj, Romania, propose to provide advanced, multidisciplinary research training to outstanding pre- and post-doctoral economists, psychiatrists, sociologists, clinicians, and mental health professionals from South Eastern Europe (SEE) in the latest research methods and issues regarding the economic and social factors that influence or drive the delivery of mental health care services. Following shortcomings in mental health promotion, treatment, access to care, and resource allocation in SEE, our Program, ""Research Training: Socio-Economics of Mental Health Service Delivery in SE Europe,"" seeks to build an international network of mental health experts in SEE and to train the next generation of researchers and leaders in the region, who have a common understanding of current thinking on mental health financing and services. Our research trainees will gain the tools to examine the development and enhancement of public and private mental health service delivery systems from a social, political, and economic frame within their own countries.

"Improving Metabolic Screening in Diverse Severely Mentally Ill Populations    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application for a K23 Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award will support critical additional training for the candidate, Dr. Christina Mangurian, a psychiatrist at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF), based at San Francisco General Hospital. Dr. Mangurian's research plan focuses on improving metabolic screening among ethnically and racially diverse severely mentally ill populations served in community mental health clinics. To further develop her career as a mental health services researcher and to accomplish her research plan, she requires specific training in three areas: 1) clinical research methods (e.g., biostatistics, epidemiology, and mixed methods); 2) implementation research; and 3) mental health disparities research.  Dr. Mangurian has assembled a multidisciplinary team of mentors to facilitate her training and research. Her primary mentor is Dr. Dean Schillinger, a UCSF primary care internist with international expertise in primary care health services research, including implementation research in public health settings. He will oversee all training and research plans, providing his wealth of experience in this field, including his dedication to improving services for underserved populations. His expertise will be complemented by Dr. Martha Shumway, a UCSF mental health services researcher; and Dr. John Newcomer, a Washington University clinical investigator who is an expert in clinical and laboratory measurement of metabolic risk in severely mentally ill populations and in the translation of monitoring objectives into clinical practice.  People with severe mental illness die, on average, 25 years earlier than the general population, most often from cardiovascular disease. Metabolic abnormalities (e.g., diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia) resulting from antipsychotic medications used to treat this population can lead to increased rates of cardiovascular disease. Despite national guidelines emphasizing the importance of screening, metabolic screening rates for this population remain low. There is an urgent need for evidence-based, generalizable interventions that can be feasibly implemented to improve metabolic screening at community mental health clinics where this vulnerable population is primarily served. Therefore, in Aim 1, Dr. Mangurian proposes to characterize metabolic screening rates among adults with severe mental illness who receive services at community mental health clinics in San Francisco County. In Aim 2, she will tailor an intervention to improve metabolic screening for adults with severe mental illness by engaging multiple stakeholders and focusing on barriers that may impact high-risk racial/ethnic subpopulations. In Aim 3, she will conduct a pilot study of the intervention. The results of this research will contribute new information about implementation efforts to improve metabolic screening in community mental health clinics and will form the basis of an R01 application to study the effectiveness of this intervention.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The majority of people with severe mental illness are prescribed antipsychotic medications, many of which result in metabolic abnormalities (e.g., dyslipidemia, diabetes) and in turn increase cardiovascular risk. We will evaluate whether a pragmatic intervention - a mandatory annual metabolic screening visit by a psychiatrist, which is linked to a web-based electronic referral and clinical decision support tool - can be feasibly implemented at community mental health clinics to enhance early detection and treatment of metabolic disorders and thereby reduce the high prevalence of cardiovascular disease among people with severe mental illness.              The majority of people with severe mental illness are prescribed antipsychotic medications, many of which result in metabolic abnormalities (e.g., dyslipidemia, diabetes) and in turn increase cardiovascular risk.

"Center for Mental Health Services in Pediatric Primary Care    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Mission: The center seeks sustainable ways to increase primary care providers' capacity to improve function, reduce distress, and prevent disability among children with mental health problems. Background: The mental health issues treated in pediatric primary care are characterized by high prevalence and a preponderance of children with impairment but without a diagnosis. Parent distress frequently complicates children's mental health problems and requires simultaneous attention. The ability to engage families around their needs promotes access to treatment and contributes to reducing ethnic (disparities. Goal and specific aims: The Center will develop an evidence-based model for mental health in primary care that 1) applies to the range of problems seen in primary care, 2) engages existing skills and knowledge of families and pediatric providers, and 3) results in sustainable increases in the mental health treatment capacity of primary care. Its specific aims are to: 1) adapt Wagner's Chronic Care Model (CCM) of primary care mental health service to include treatment based on ""common factors"" and ""common treatment elements.""; la) within the CCM's 5 domains, address priority research needs related to the impact of common factors and their implementation in office practice; lb) develop packages of practical interventions, built around domains of the adapted CCM, for larger scale trials in pediatric primary care; 2) develop measurements, study designs and analytic methods to efficiently assess outcomes in community settings; and 3) stimulate innovation in pediatric mental health services through multidisciplinary and community-academic collaboration, attracting new and diverse scholars and providing a resource for scientists, policy makers, and advocates. Methods: The Center's faculty is a team of pediatricians, psychologists, psychiatrists, and other scholars from six institutions that include rural, suburban, and urban settings. Their work is informed by ties to the American Academy of Pediatrics' Task Force on Mental Health and leaders in state mental health policy. Guidance and focus come from a community advisory committee and a national scientific advisory board. Research Methods Core studies address priority questions about the evidence base for common factors, the burden of mental health care, and feasible clinical data systems. Principal Research Core studies test complementary common factors approaches for children with anxiety problems.

"The Recognition and Referral of Mental Disorders within Religious Congregations    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Religious congregations are often the first and only point of contact for help with mental health problems. As community gatekeepers, religious congregations can play a powerful role in linking individuals to needed mental health treatment. However, religious congregations often do not know when, how, or where to consult with mental health providers. Thus, although recognized as invaluable counterparts that can connect informal and formal systems of care, religious congregations remain a grossly untapped resource, particularly for underserved ethnic minority populations for whom there are significant disparities in access, use, and quality of mental health care. A more standardized process on how to enhance religious congregations' recognition of mental disorders and collaboration with mental health providers is needed. As an initial step, the proposed study aims to lay the foundation for an intervention that enhances congregational practices around mental health screening, referral, and consultation. The proposed study would be carried out in collaboration with a faith-based partner, West Angeles Church of God in Christ, which has over 24,000 congregants and is one of the largest Black ""mega-churches"" in the nation. Situated in South Los Angeles, West Angeles has extensive interactions with health, social welfare, and community organizations and provides more than 80 programs to enhance the community. West Angeles seeks to build the capacity of other congregations to engage in similar collaborative relationships and helps lead the Faith-based Community Collaborative, a network of over 300 local religious congregations. The proposed study has the following specific aims:  (1) Describe the range of congregational practices in addressing mental disorders  (2) Identify factors associated with religious congregations' receptivity to mental health screening, referral,  and consultation  (3) Develop a preliminary protocol to enhance the capacity of religious congregations' engagement in  mental health screening, referral, and collaboration For Aim 1, we will conduct focus groups with key stakeholders from a purposeful sample of religious congregations with varying organizational characteristics. For Aim 2, we will conduct a survey with the Collaborative to test hypotheses about predictors of receptivity to mental health screening, referral, and collaboration. For Aim 3, a subset of the Collaborative will convene as a workgroup to develop a preliminary intervention aimed at enhancing RCs mental health screening, referral, and consultation, based upon findings from Aims 1 and 2 and from the literature on quality improvement collaborative care mental health interventions. Using adapted modified Delphi methods, the Collaborative will review the preliminary plan, provide feedback, make revisions, and obtain consensus on a final set of recommendations that will be presented at stakeholder feedback sessions in preparation for future wide-scale implementation efforts.        Religious congregations are often the first and only point of contact for help with mental disorders. As community gatekeepers, religious congregations can play a powerful role in linking individuals to needed treatment, particularly for ethnic minorities who continue to experience significant disparities in mental health care access and utilization. However, religious congregations remain grossly untapped resources given that they rarely refer, consult, or collaborate with mental health providers. The proposed study would lay the groundwork for a preliminary intervention aimed at enhancing religious congregations' capacity to engage in mental health screening, referral, and collaboration. The developed intervention would serve as a model on how to successfully bridge faith and mental health communities and could yield significant impact for the estimated 140.4 million Americans who are members of a religious congregation.

"Social Inequality and Children's Mental Health Abstract  BACKGROUND: The social gradient in children's mental health is well documented. What is less clear is  how social inequalities influence children's development. We propose to examine this question at three  levels of analysis. At the neighborhood level, we will assess ecometric properties of the local areas in  which children reside and test whether neighborhood-level social processes, such as collective efficacy,  mediate the effects of neighborhood poverty on children's mental health. At the family level, we will trace  the effects of socioeconomic deprivation on proximal family processes (exposure to violence, food  insecurity) and test how stressful early life events may become biologically embedded. At the individual  level, we will use a genetically-informative longitudinal design to test the hypothesis that children's  perceptions of their social position can help to explain why some children growing up in poverty do  versus do not develop health problems.  METHOD: We will conduct this research using data from the Environmental Risk (E-Risk) Study. E-Risk  is a longitudinal study (from birth to age 12) of a nationally-representative sample of twins born in  England and Wales in 1994-1995 (N=2232), selected from a registry created with the UK Office of  National Statistics (ONS). We have tracked the children over the first 12 years of their lives, monitoring  their development and their environmental exposures, including multiple forms of social inequality. We  have gathered data about the children and their families at 6 time points (birth, ages 2, 5, 7, 10, and 12  years). We have also conducted two independent ecometric assessments of the neighborhoods in which  the children are growing up, enabling us to study inequalities in children's lives at both the community  and family level.  INNOVATION AND SIGNIFICANCE: The proposed research has implications both for understanding  and reducing health inequalities. At each level of analysis, we adopt a process approach to test how  social inequalities influence children's development. At the neighborhood level, we will identify malleable  factors for community-level interventions which may be more cost effective and pragmatic than  individual-level interventions. At the family level, we will test the direct and indirect contributions of family  socio-economic conditions to children's development and identify specific intervention targets for  reducing social inequalities in children's mental health. At the individual level, if we discover  environmentally-mediated effects between children's subjective social status and their health, the  implications would point to children's perceptions of social status as malleable intervention targets and  open up a realm of intervention possibilities for empowering children. Narrative  About half of the population variation in children's mental health problems is accounted for  by environmental factors, and social inequalities stand out as the most prominent  determinants of health in the first decade of life. However, the hope of preventing early-  emerging mental health problems requires research to identify the underlying mechanisms  by which inequalities affect health. Our proposed research tests how social inequalities  affect children's health, aiming to identify malleable intervention targets at the community,  family, and individual levels.",Social Inequality

"Understanding Mechanisms of Mental Health Care Disparities    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Racial/ethnic disparities in mental health care, in relative terms, exceed disparities in many other areas of health care services, with African-Americans and Hispanics accessing mental health care at only half the rate of non-Hispanic Whites, even after accounting for mental health status. These disparities in service use likely contribute to the greater persistence, severity, and disease burden of mental disorder among African- Americans and Latinos. In this proposed study, we fulfill a need for direct, easily understandable information about the mechanisms underlying disparities in mental health care services. We improve upon previous research by assessing racial/ethnic disparities in episodes of care rather than cross-sectional data, allowing us to understand factors related to initiation, duration, intensity, and quality of care that are more closely linked with the actual behaviors of patients and providers. In addition, we propose the first comprehensive look at the contribution of geographic disparities to racial/ethnic disparities in mental health care, distinguishing disparities due to the state and neighborhood where an individual lives from disparities due to individual characteristics and identifying area-level characteristics that are amenable to policy change. Finally, we develop, in collaboration with policymakers, a mental health care disparities index that provides an easy to understand state-by-state comparison of mental health care disparities to directly inform policymakers' disparities reduction interventions. Our specific aims are to:     1. Assess disparities in initiation, intensity, duration, and quality of mental health  care episodes     2. Assess role of geography in disparities identifying area-level correlates of mental  health service use     3. Develop indices of disparities in states' mental health care expenditure and quality.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: In this project, we attempt to identify and understand the underlying mechanisms driving racial/ethnic disparities in mental health care episodes. Our focus in this project is to use state-of-the-art methods of disparity research, improving upon previous studies by incorporating longitudinal and neighborhood-level data on mental health care treatment. We aim to translate our findings to provide directly useable information to policymakers on how to reduce mental health care disparities, including the development of a mental health care disparities index, a state-by-state comparison of disparities in mental health care expenditures and quality.

"Social Support Scale Development for Persons with Serious Mental Illness     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposed research will develop a psychometrically sound measure of functional social support tailored to the needs of individuals with serious mental illness (SMI). The specific aims of this mixed-methods study are: (1) to define an empirically-based typology of functional support for persons with SMI, and (2) to develop and pilot a psychometrically sound SMI- specific measure of functional support. For Aim 1, data will be collected on SMI-specific functional support needs via focus groups conducted with three constituencies of stakeholders: 32 support receivers (persons with SMI), 32 formal support providers (case workers), and 32 informal support providers (family/friends). Employing a grounded theory approach, the PI will then use the data collected from the focus groups to implement Aim 2, the construction of an initial pool of items, which be refined with guidance from an expert review panel, and tested using exploratory structural equation modeling (ESEM) and preliminary psychometric validation studies with 300 SMI participants. The instrument produced through this work will ultimately: (1) provide a tool for researchers to investigate the impact of functional support on buffering chronic SMI stressors (e.g., stigma, isolation, illness management), raising quality of life, and reducing morbidity and mortality among the SMI population; (2) assist service providers in better identifying individual support needs for clinical intervention; (3) add to the growing body of research on disease-specific support measurement; and (4) contribute to establishing standards to address the social support needs of individuals with SMI and to inform national mental health care policy. Additionally, in keeping with the objectives of the AREA program, the project will provide biobehavioral research training opportunities for students, inform the existing curriculum by further emphasizing the connection between research and clinical practice, and enhance the development of research infrastructure at a comprehensive, urban, publicly-funded master's granting institution serving a highly diverse student population.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research is one of the first studies to identify and measure functional social support specifically among persons with serious mental illness (SMI). It will increase our knowledge of the particular types of social support which are most beneficial for individuals with SMI. The tool created through this study will impact national mental health care policy and, more immediately, people with SMI who access community mental health services, along with their support providers. Results will contribute to the development of new interventions to reduce health disparities by reducing the risks for morbidity and mortality which disproportionately impact persons with SMI.              The proposed research is one of the first studies to identify and measure functional social support specifically among persons with serious mental illness (SMI).

"Rural Parents' Perceived Stigma of Mental Health Services for Their Children    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Stigma has been widely cited as the most significant barrier to individuals seeking mental health services (e.g., President's New Freedom Commission on Mental Health, Report of Surgeon General on Mental Health) and it is often identified as a particularly salient concern for those living in rural areas (e.g., Bray, Enright, & Easling, 2004; deGruy, 1997; Jameson & Blank, 2007). Despite these statements, little empirical work has been conducted, particularly with regard to children. The purpose of the proposed project is to examine rural parents' perceived stigma regarding seeking mental health services for their children using the R21 Exploratory/ Developmental Grant mechanism (PA-10-069). This project addresses the NIMH Strategic Plan to strengthen the public health impact of NIMH-supported research by identifying barriers to the implementation of current knowledge (Objective 4). Specific aims are: 1) to examine rural parents' perceived stigma around seeking mental health services for their child; 2) to validate a new measure assessing parents' perceived stigma about seeking mental health services for their child; and 3) to explore the relations between parents' perceived stigma of mental health service seeking and their willingness to seek both traditional and innovative (e.g., integrated care, telehealth, etc.) mental health services. These relations will be tested in the context of a theoretical model that considers: 1) established factors affecting perceived stigma and service- seeking (e.g. caregiver strain, other barriers to rural care access) and 2) developmental, experiential, and demographic factors (e.g., past experiences with mental health services, age, gender, religiosity). Participants will be the parents of 350 children who have borderline or higher parent ratings on a measure of psychosocial concerns. Parents will complete a newly- developed measure regarding their perceived stigma of seeking mental health services for their child as well as a variety of other measures included to validate the primary measure and explore a theoretical model in which perceived stigma impacts willingness to seek traditional versus innovative services. The results of this study will inform the field about the role of stigma in service seeking for rural Appalachian parents. The study will serve as a platform for future research examining and comparing other contexts (i.e., urban and other rural settings) as well as experimentally examining the impact of innovative services on perceived stigma and service use.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed study will examine parents' perceived stigma around seeking mental health services for their children including both traditional and innovative service mechanisms (e.g., integrated care, telehealth, etc.). Results will inform the field about the attitudes of parents in rural Appalachia and provide information about the role of stigma in the context of other, well- established factors influencing help-seeking. These findings will serve as a platform for developing service delivery mechanisms that decrease stigma as a barrier to treatment (i.e., translating evidence-based treatment), particularly in rural communities.

"COPE/Healthy Lifestyles for Teens: A School-Based RCT  ABSTRACT  The prevention and treatment of obesity and mental health disorders in adolescence are two major public health problems in the United States (U.S.) today. The incidence of adolescents who are overweight or obese has increased dramatically over the past 20 years, with approximately 17.1 percent of teens now being overweight or obese. Furthermore, approximately 15 million children and adolescents (25 percent) in the U.S. have a mental health problem that is interfering with their functioning at home or at school, but less than 25 percent of those affected receive any treatment for these disorders. The prevalence rates of obesity and mental health problems are even higher in Hispanic teens, with studies suggesting that the two conditions often coexist in many youth. However, despite the rapidly increasing incidence of these two public health problems with their related health disparities and adverse health outcomes, there has been a paucity of theory- based intervention studies conducted with adolescents in high schools to improve their healthy lifestyle behaviors as well as their physical and mental health outcomes. Unfortunately, physical and mental health services continue to be largely separated instead of integrated in the nation's healthcare system, which often leads to inadequate identification and treatment of these significant adolescent health problems.  Therefore, the goal of the proposed randomized controlled trial is to test the efficacy of the COPE (Creating Opportunities for Personal Empowerment)/Healthy Lifestyles TEEN (Thinking, Feeling, Emotions & Exercise) Program, an educational and cognitive-behavioral skills building intervention guided by cognitive behavior theory, on the healthy lifestyle behaviors and depressive symptoms of 800 culturally diverse adolescents enrolled in Phoenix, Arizona high schools. The specific aims of the study are to: (1) Use a randomized controlled trial to test the short- and more long-term efficacy of the COPE TEEN Program on key outcomes, including healthy lifestyles behaviors, depressive symptoms and body mass index percentage, (2) Examine the role of cognitive beliefs and perceived difficulty in leading a healthy lifestyle in mediating the effects of COPE on healthy lifestyle behaviors and depressive symptoms; and (3) Explore variables that may moderate the effects of the intervention on healthy lifestyle behaviors and depressive symptoms, including race/ethnicity, gender, SES, acculturation, and parental healthy lifestyle beliefs and behaviors. Six prior pilot studies support the need for this full scale clinical trial and the use of cognitive-behavioral skills building in promoting healthy lifestyles beliefs, behaviors and optimal mental health in teens.  This study is consistent with the NIH roadmap and goals of improving people's health and preventing the onset of disease and disability as well as promoting the highest level of health in a vulnerable population.  PROJECT NARRATIVE  The prevention and treatment of obesity and mental health disorders in adolescence are two major public health problems in the United States today. To address the increasing incidence and adverse health outcomes associated with both obesity and mental health problems, a theory-based 15 session intervention program entitled COPE (Creating Opportunities for Personal Empowerment)/Healthy Lifestyles TEEN (Thinking, Feeling, Emotions & Exercise), will be delivered within high school health classes in order to improve the physical and mental health outcomes of 800 culturally diverse adolescents (14 to 16 years of age).",COPE/Healthy Lifestyles for Teens: A School-Based RCT,8307990,R01NR012171,"['Cultural Assimilation ', ' Acculturation ', ' teenage ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' Adolescence ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' Anxiety ', ' Arizona ', ' Bronchial Asthma ', ' Asthma ', ' Attention ', ' Behavior ', ' psychological disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Belief ', ' youngster ', ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' clinical investigation ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Computers ', ' Control Groups ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' Depressive disorder ', ' type II DM ', ' type 2 DM ', ' maturity onset diabetes ', ' ketosis resistant diabetes ', ' adult onset diabetes ', ' Type II diabetes ', ' Type II Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Type 2 diabetes ', ' Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus ', ' T2DM ', ' T2D ', ' T2 DM ', ' Stable Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Slow-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Noninsulin Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Non-Insulin Dependent Diabetes ', ' NIDDM ', ' Maturity-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' MODY ', ' Ketosis-Resistant Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Adult-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Emotions ', ' Epidemic ', ' Physical Exercise ', ' Exercise ', ' Family ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Level of Health ', ' Health Status ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' high blood pressure ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Hypertension ', ' Incidence ', ' interventions research ', ' intervention research ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' Lifestyle ', ' Life Style ', ' lifespan ', ' life span ', ' Length of Life ', ' Longevity ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene Services ', ' Mental Health Services ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity -

"Understanding Health Disparities in the Progression of Type 2 Diabetes  It is well-established that modifiable, lifestyle-related behaviors including smoking, alcohol, diet, and physical activity greatly contribute to the risk of most common physical health conditions. The recent, almost epidemic increase in the prevalence of diseases associated with these health behaviors, especially hypertension, type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease (CVD), and growing disparities in the burden of these conditions across racial and ethnic groups, highlights the urgency of developing effective prevention strategies - however, few intervention studies have produced long-term changes in lifestyle and behaviors. Addressing an omission in existing behavioral intervention models, we propose that what is needed is an examination of behavioral change in the context of the interrelationships among health behaviors, sources of and coping responses to chronic stress, and their influence on physical and mental health. This proposal is motivated by a robust literature that indicates blacks in the US are more likely to engage in poor health behaviors (i.e., tobacco smoking, diets high in fat and carbohydrates, excessive alcohol use) and, expectedly, experience disproportionate burdens of common physical health conditions associated with these behaviors, including CVD and diabetes, relative to non-Hispanic whites - paradoxically, however, population-based and clinic studies have consistently found that blacks, in comparison to whites, have the same or lower rates of most mental disorders, even while experiencing higher rates of psychological distress. We theorize that a defined set of health-related stress-coping strategies (i.e., tobacco smoking, diets high in fat and carbohydrates, excessive alcohol use, etc) have a two-pronged effect that helps to account for this counterintuitive patterning. First, we suggest that these behaviors act on the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and related stress- hormonal systems which influences the subjective experience and development of stress-associated psychiatric disorder. Second, we believe that the effects of these poor behaviors on pathophysiology, combined with direct effects of stressful living conditions over the life-course, contribute to disproportionate burden of chronic physical health problems among blacks. Succinctly, we propose that blacks and other individuals from highly stressed populations ""buy"" their relative, comparatively positive rates of mental disorders at the expense of their deteriorating physical health. Therefore, this framework suggests that adherence to traditional preventative care, specifically involving changes in behavioral lifestyle, can lead to a perverse result: improvements in physical health but worsening of mental health. We will extend this line of research and assess the effect of traditional preventative care among three categories of type 2 diabetes patients: 1) pre- or borderline; 2) early onset; and, 3) poorly-controlled. In the proposed accelerated longitudinal design we will examine the inter-relationships among stress, health behaviors, and physical and mental health at three distinct points of diabetes progression.  Type 2 diabetes and its associated risk factors such as hypertension and heart disease continue to top the domestic and international public health agendas. The diagnoses of these conditions are invariably followed by recommendations for extensive behavioral modifications. In all cases rates of long-term adherence to recommended healthy behavioral changes are spotty at best, both intra-and inter-individually. We believe that physical and mental health disparities are linked to the lack of behavioral change adherence. The findings of this study will help anticipate, understand, and identify informal and formal programs and public health policies needed to address the physical and mental health challenges facing the growing epidemic of related cardiovascular and metabolic disorders in the U.S. and other developed and developing countries.

"Rural Parents' Perceived Stigma of Mental Health Services for Their Children    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Stigma has been widely cited as the most significant barrier to individuals seeking mental health services (e.g., President's New Freedom Commission on Mental Health, Report of Surgeon General on Mental Health) and it is often identified as a particularly salient concern for those living in rural areas (e.g., Bray, Enright, & Easling, 2004; deGruy, 1997; Jameson & Blank, 2007). Despite these statements, little empirical work has been conducted, particularly with regard to children. The purpose of the proposed project is to examine rural parents' perceived stigma regarding seeking mental health services for their children using the R21 Exploratory/ Developmental Grant mechanism (PA-10-069). This project addresses the NIMH Strategic Plan to strengthen the public health impact of NIMH-supported research by identifying barriers to the implementation of current knowledge (Objective 4). Specific aims are: 1) to examine rural parents' perceived stigma around seeking mental health services for their child; 2) to validate a new measure assessing parents' perceived stigma about seeking mental health services for their child; and 3) to explore the relations between parents' perceived stigma of mental health service seeking and their willingness to seek both traditional and innovative (e.g., integrated care, telehealth, etc.) mental health services. These relations will be tested in the context of a theoretical model that considers: 1) established factors affecting perceived stigma and service- seeking (e.g. caregiver strain, other barriers to rural care access) and 2) developmental, experiential, and demographic factors (e.g., past experiences with mental health services, age, gender, religiosity). Participants will be the parents of 350 children who have borderline or higher parent ratings on a measure of psychosocial concerns. Parents will complete a newly- developed measure regarding their perceived stigma of seeking mental health services for their child as well as a variety of other measures included to validate the primary measure and explore a theoretical model in which perceived stigma impacts willingness to seek traditional versus innovative services. The results of this study will inform the field about the role of stigma in service seeking for rural Appalachian parents. The study will serve as a platform for future research examining and comparing other contexts (i.e., urban and other rural settings) as well as experimentally examining the impact of innovative services on perceived stigma and service use.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed study will examine parents' perceived stigma around seeking mental health services for their children including both traditional and innovative service mechanisms (e.g., integrated care, telehealth, etc.). Results will inform the field about the attitudes of parents in rural Appalachia and provide information about the role of stigma in the context of other, well- established factors influencing help-seeking.

"Can Medicaid Benefits Reduce Access Disparities for Minority Children & Youth?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The study goal is to examine the aggressive enforcement of Medicaid's (Medi-Cal's) Early Periodic Screening Diagnosis and Treatment program (EPSDT) to learn whether reducing important structural barriers to public mental health care by providing generous financing, increasing treatment capacity, and engaging with community-based programs and organizations will bring about the desired policy effect of equalizing spending and treatment patterns among low-income white and ethnic minority children and youth.  Study aims are: 1) Estimate the extent to which California's EPSDT mental health program expansion reduced disparities in spending for African American, Latino and Native American Medi-Cal enrolled children and youth. Determine how much reduction in spending disparities was immediate and how much it constituted minority-white convergence in trends. 2) Estimate the extent to which California's enforcement of EPSDT mental health services reduced disparities in access (measured by overall penetration rates; outpatient treatment penetration rates; and crisis treatment penetration rates) for African American, Latino and Native American Medi-Cal enrolled children and youth. Determine how much reduction in access disparities was immediate and how much it constituted minority-white convergence in trends. 3) Estimate for each dependent measure described in 1 and 2 above the extent to which reduced minority-white disparities was associated with: a) increases in total provider supply and Spanish-speaking provider supply; and b) increased engagement with community-based organizations including those with an ethnic minority focus.  Using panel data multivariate regression methods in a kind of ""interrupted time-series"" approach (Shadish, Cook & Campbell, 2002), we control for factors correlated with aggressive EPSDT enforcement that could confound our assessment of its impact on cost and access disparities. We will observe costs and penetration rates before and after EPSDT enforcement over 48 quarters (July 1992 - June 2004) and across the 57 California county mental health plans. Since our focus is on changes in disparities between ethnic minorities and whites over time, any potential confounds must differentially affect ethnic minorities or whites to influence study results. To further test hypotheses, we contrast disparities in sub-samples minimally affected by, and unaffected by, EPSDT enforcement. Medi-Cal Specialty Mental Health Claims data and Medi-Cal enrollment data obtained from the California Department of Mental Health will be used.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The lack of mental health access and treatment for children and adolescents is a serious public health problem raised by the Surgeon General in his 2000 report. Low access is especially pronounced among ethnic minority populations for whom mental illness is becoming a significant problem: in May 2007, the CDC issued a report stating that suicide was the fourth leading cause of death among youth, and that the highest rates have occurred among minority populations1. The proposed study will provide information for policymakers and administrators to understand the conditions under which existing financing and delivery systems can be levered to rapidly expand access and improve care for these children and youth. 1 Bernard SJ, Paulozzi LJ, Wallace DL; Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) (2007).

"Center for Mental Health Services in Pediatric Primary Care    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Mission: The center seeks sustainable ways to increase primary care providers' capacity to improve function, reduce distress, and prevent disability among children with mental health problems. Background: The mental health issues treated in pediatric primary care are characterized by high prevalence and a preponderance of children with impairment but without a diagnosis. Parent distress frequently complicates children's mental health problems and requires simultaneous attention. The ability to engage families around their needs promotes access to treatment and contributes to reducing ethnic (disparities. Goal and specific aims: The Center will develop an evidence-based model for mental health in primary care that 1) applies to the range of problems seen in primary care, 2) engages existing skills and knowledge of families and pediatric providers, and 3) results in sustainable increases in the mental health treatment capacity of primary care. Its specific aims are to: 1) adapt Wagner's Chronic Care Model (CCM) of primary care mental health service to include treatment based on ""common factors"" and ""common treatment elements.""; la) within the CCM's 5 domains, address priority research needs related to the impact of common factors and their implementation in office practice; lb) develop packages of practical interventions, built around domains of the adapted CCM, for larger scale trials in pediatric primary care; 2) develop measurements, study designs and analytic methods to efficiently assess outcomes in community settings; and 3) stimulate innovation in pediatric mental health services through multidisciplinary and community-academic collaboration, attracting new and diverse scholars and providing a resource for scientists, policy makers, and advocates. Methods: The Center's faculty is a team of pediatricians, psychologists, psychiatrists, and other scholars from six institutions that include rural, suburban, and urban settings. Their work is informed by ties to the American Academy of Pediatrics' Task Force on Mental Health and leaders in state mental health policy. Guidance and focus come from a community advisory committee and a national scientific advisory board. Research Methods Core studies address priority questions about the evidence base for common factors, the burden of mental health care, and feasible clinical data systems. Principal Research Core studies test complementary common factors approaches for children with anxiety problems. The Operations Core promotes recruiting underrepresented trainees, meaningful community interaction, quality control, and innovative study design.             The Center's work develops a model of mental health prevention and treatment that can be practically implemented in pediatric primary care. The model has the potential to make care available to populations that currently have limited access to specialized mental health services. It will create a resource for other researchers in this field and lay the groundwork for larger scale, community-based trials.",Center for Mental Health Services in Pediatric Primary Care,8211039,P20MH086048,"['Academy ', ' Anxiety ', ' Attention ', ' youngster ', ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Elements ', ' Faculty ', ' Family ', ' Goals ', ' healthcare policy ', ' health care policy ', ' Health Policy ', ' healthcare service availability ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare access availability ', ' health services availability ', ' health care service availability ', ' health care service access ', ' health care availability ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Availability of Health Services ', ' Accessibility of health care ', ' Access to Healthcare ', ' Access to Health Care ', ' Access to Care ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' Information Technology Systems ', ' IT Systems ', ' Data Systems ', ' Information Systems ', ' Learning ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene Services ', ' Mental Health Services ', ' Methods ', ' Mission ', ' Parents ', ' Patients ', ' Pediatrics ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Primary Care ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Psychiatrist ', ' Psychologist ', ' Psychotherapy ', ' Quality Control ', ' recruit ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' Research ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Research Design ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Testing ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Research Methods ', ' Research Methodology ', ' Caring ', ' Task Forces ', ' Advisory Committees ', ' base ', ' suburbia ', ' suburban ', ' suburb ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' Training ', ' disability ', ' Distress ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' pediatrician ', ' Rural ', ' Policy Maker ', ' Measurement ', ' Collaborations ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Research Priority ', ' Knowledge ', ' Scientist ', ' American ', ' skills ', ' Prevention ', ' Modeling ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Provider ', ' Institution ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' Child Mental Health ', ' Advocate ', ' High Prevalence ', ' Clinical Data ', ' active treatment ', ' active technique ', ' active method ', ' Instruction ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' improved functioning ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' Impairment ', ' chronic care model ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' community setting ', ' evidence base ', ' common treatment ', ' operation ', ' ']",NIMH,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,P20,2012,1054643,0.14308611468183477
"Disparities in Mental Health Care: Age, Race/Ethnicity, and Geography Effects DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application addresses a priority area for the National Institute on Aging (NIA): to reduce or eliminate health disparities between racial/ethnic minorities and nonminorities among older adults. The focus of this application is on mental health care, where racial/ethnic minorities access mental health services at only half the rate of non- Hispanic Whites, even after controlling for mental health status. While existing literature documents individual- level characteristics associated with mental health care, area-level (i.e., geographic) characteristics of such care are poorly understood. Thus, in this proposed study, we will assess the contribution of geographic factors to racial and ethnic disparities in mental health care among older adults. The overall goal of this research is to improve our understanding of the complex, yet unexplored, relations between race/ethnicity and geographic factors. This project will be accomplished by linking nationally representative survey data on mental health care to area-level data drawn from the U.S. Census and the Area Resource File. The proposed research has two specific aims: Aim 1. Identify geographic 'hot spots' of racial/ethnic disparities in mental health care at the regional, state, and county levels. After completing Aim 1, we will be able to identify geographic areas (at the state or county level) that need new policies to reduce racial/ethnic disparities among older adults. Aim 2. Assess geographic characteristics associated with racial/ethnic disparities in mental health care at the regional, state, and county levels. After completing Aim 2, we will be able to identify area-level risk factors that are potentially modifiable and should be considered in development of policies to reduce disparities. Beyond the scientific aims, this career development award will provide training in advanced methodology, medical geography, and epidemiology. The skills obtained during the training period will enable the candidate to perform cutting-edge research at the intersection of aging, mental health and geography to find ways to reduce or eliminate existing disparities among older adults. The interdisciplinary mentoring team I put together and my affiliations with the UA Center for Mental Health and Aging and the Deep South RCMAR provide the infrastructure to support these endeavors. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project is designed to improve our understanding of the complex, yet unexplored, relations between race/ethnicity and geographic factors with respect to older adult use of mental health care services. Knowledge produced by this project would be relevant to the current efforts of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the National Institue on Aging (NIA) to reduce and eventually eliminate racial and ethnic disparities between racial/ethnic minorities and non-minorities among older adults.","Disparities in Mental Health Care: Age, Race/Ethnicity, and Geography Effects",8568205,K01AG045342,"['Population Density ', ' Data Set ', ' Poverty ', ' Predisposing Factor ', ' Caring ', ' Geographic Factor ', ' Geographic Locations ', ' Geography ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health Services ', ' Health Status ', ' Race ', ' Age ', ' Age Distribution ', ' Elderly ', ' Aging ', ' Regression Analysis ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Resources ', ' Hospitals ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Attention ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Insurance ', ' Disease ', ' Literature ', ' Relative (related person) ', ' United States Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality ', ' Surveys ', ' Asians ', ' African American ', ' County ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Health Services ', ' Mentors ', ' Methodology ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' Censuses ', ' Enabling Factors ', ' Maps ', ' Communities ', ' Healthcare ', ' Hispanics ', ' Latino ', ' Testing ', ' Minority Groups ', ' development policy ', ' Epidemiology ', ' Sampling ', ' geographic difference ', ' health disparity ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' base ', ' Mechanics ', ' Knowledge ', ' age group ', ' American ', ' Intervention ', ' Link ', ' Geographic Information Systems ', ' improved ', ' mental age ', ' mental health center ', ' high school ', ' Modeling ', ' Area ', ' K-Series Research Career Programs ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Complex ', ' Policies ', ' Clinic ', ' Medical Geography ', ' Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System ', ' Techniques ', ' Location ', ' skills ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' psychological disorder ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' trend ', ' Characteristics ', ' Hot Spot ', ' Deep South ', ' Prevalence ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' Process ', ' sex ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' Older Population ', ' Disorder ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' Address ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' design ', ' National Institute on Aging ', ' epidemiologic ', ' epidemiological ', ' oriental ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Geographic Area ', ' Geographic Region ', ' Geographical Location ', ' MeSH Descriptors Class 4 ', ' geographic site ', ' Data ', ' human population density ', ' health care service ', ' Level of Health ', ' Racial Group ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Method LOINC Axis 6 ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' Regression Analyses ', ' Regression Diagnostics ', ' Statistical Regression ', ' Investigators ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene Services ', ' Researchers ', ' mechanical ', ' Research Resources ', ' Relative ', ' AHCPR ', ' AHRQ ', ' Agency for Health Care Policy and Research ', ' Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality ', ' United States Agency for Health Care Policy and Research ', ' Dataset ', ' Afro American ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Black Populations ', ' Black or African American ', ' black American ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Ethnicity ', ' health care ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Latino Population ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' hispanic community ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Hot Spots (Area of Increased Mortality) ', ' BRFSS ', ' Behavior Risk Factor Surveillance System ', ' Career Development Awards ', ' Career Development Awards and Programs ', ' Career Development Programs K-Series ', ' K-Awards ', ' Research Career Program ', ' Infrastructure ', ' designing ', ' geographic variation ', ' health disparities ', ' ethnic minority ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' racial/ethnic ', ' ']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA IN TUSCALOOSA,K01,2013,118418,0.028213491760265174
"Multiple-Impact Effectiveness of a State Supported Employment Policy Initiative    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose an observational study to examine a broad range of impacts produced by a state policy initiative that increased accessibility and availability of the evidence-based individual placement and support (IPS) model of supported-employment (SE) services for persons with severe mental illness (SMI) in Maryland. We will study the experience of Maryland's public mental health system (PMHS) in facilitating the diffusion of IPS-SE services in the state. Our research exploits inter-temporal and geographic variations in accessibility and availability of IPS-SE services 1) over time in the period 2002-2010 and 2) across geographic areas of Maryland. We also examine variations across providers in fidelity to the IPS-SE model. We propose to study the observed effectiveness of this state policy initiative in its actual operation and impact. This study will extend evaluative research on IPS-SE beyond the current focus on efficacy/effectiveness in small-scale RCT trials of a limited number of sites. We also propose to combine data from multiple public sector databases to expand the range of SE impacts studied, beyond the current research focus on employment outcomes, to include impacts on mental health status, and on mental health and somatic health treatment costs.  The policy initiative that promoted the implementation and diffusion of IPS-SE services, undertaken by the Maryland Mental Hygiene Administration (MHA), began as a pilot project in 2002. MHA provided funding for training service providers and for monitoring providers for fidelity with the IPS-SE model. Beginning in 2006, financial incentives were given to providers for offering IPS-SE services, and for meeting fidelity benchmarks.  This MHA initiative increased accessibility and availability of IPS-SE services for persons with SMI, with major increases, occurring in the period from 2004 to 2010, that also varied by geographic area. We plan to use data on individuals with SMI from several large, defined cohorts 1) of Maryland Medicaid recipients and 2) of other non-Medicaid-covered users of PMHS services, followed over the 2002-2010 period. Using these data, we will assess the impacts of the MHA policy initiative on (1) the take-up rate of IPS-SE services, (2) disparities by race and ethnicity in the rate of IPS-SE service use, (3) the mental health status of IPS-SE users relative to non-users, (4) costs of treatment for mental health specialty services and other health services for users vs. non-users of IPS-SE services, and (5) employment and earnings of users vs. non-users of IPS-SE services. We also will examine the impact of varying IPS-SE provider fidelity levels on these outcomes.  A variety of regression analysis methods are proposed for estimating these policy impacts, including instrumental variables-generalized method of moments (IV-GMM) procedures, reduced-form regression models, models based on pooling of data on individuals over time, and analyses based on sequences of cross- sectional regressions. We propose IV-GMM methods to account for unobservable factors influencing selection into use of IPS-SE services, as well as tests for our assumption of endogeneity of the indicator of IPS-SE use.        This proposal addresses one the focus areas Healthy People 2010 that is proposed to be retained for Health People 2020: Increase the proportion of persons with serious mental illness (SMI) who are employed. The research will examine the effectiveness of a state-wide initiative to increase the provision of evidence-based supported employment services for those with SMI in the state of Maryland. We assess the initiative's impact on multiple outcomes including supported employment service receipt, race and ethnic disparities in service receipt, employment, earnings, mental health treatment costs, somatic treatment costs, mental health status.

"Implementing Health Care Interventions for Hispanics with Serious Mental Illness    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Compared to majority whites with serious mental illness (SMI; e.g., schizophrenia), racial/ethnic minorities with SMI are at higher risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD). Although promising treatments (e.g., care manager interventions) exist to improve the health of people with SMI, limited attention has been paid to the process of making these interventions culturally relevant to Hispanics with SMI and to promote their use in the public mental health system. The objective of this Mentored Research Scientist Development Award (K01) is to prepare the candidate to become an independent investigator in implementation research to address the disparities in physical health care faced by underserved minorities with SMI. A mentoring team, led by Drs. Lewis-Fernandez and Druss, will guide the candidate in achieving the following training objectives: 1) obtain training in implementation research, focusing on community-based participatory research (CBPR) approaches as a translational strategy; 2) develop expertise on the integration of physical and mental health care for people with SMI; 3) acquire new skills in using intervention mapping and qualitative methods to inform intervention research; and 4) obtain training in clinical trial methodology and longitudinal data analysis. The application integrates course work, mentorship from established investigators, and mentored research activities. The research plan uses a collaborative intervention planning framework that blends principles of CBPR and intervention mapping to modify and assess the feasibility and acceptability of an existing care manager intervention. This 12-month intervention focuses on improving patient activation and the coordination of medical care between outpatient mental health clinics and primary care. The proposed project uses a multiphase approach supported by the candidate's training plan. In Phase 1, a community advisory board composed of researchers and stakeholders will be assembled to learn and review the intervention and make initial modifications. During Phase 2, qualitative methods - patient focus groups and stakeholder interviews - will be used to ensure that the modifications are acceptable to all stakeholders. In Phase 3, results from Phase 2 are used to further modify the intervention, develop an implementation plan, and train two care managers on the modified intervention. Phase 4 consists of a 12-month open pilot study (N = 30) to assess the feasibility and acceptability of the modified intervention and explore its effect. Lastly, Phase 5 will focus on analysis of pilot study data and preparation of an R01 proposal. The research plan will yield pilot data for a subsequent R01 to conduct a randomized controlled trial to test the effectiveness and implementation of the modified intervention.        This K01 prepares the candidate to develop an independent program of research focused on the implementation of integrated physical and mental health services in the public mental health system to improve the physical health and wellness of underserved minorities with SMI. This project responds to objectives 3 and 4 of the NIMH Strategic Plan which call for the development of better interventions that incorporate the needs of diverse people with mental illness and ensures the translation of research findings into clinical practice to enhance NIMH's public health mission.

"Research Training: Socio-Economics of Mental Health Service Delivery in SE Europe    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The University of California, Berkeley and Babes-Bolyai University, Cluj, Romania, propose to provide advanced, multidisciplinary research training to outstanding pre- and post-doctoral economists, psychiatrists, sociologists, clinicians, and mental health professionals from South Eastern Europe (SEE) in the latest research methods and issues regarding the economic and social factors that influence or drive the delivery of mental health care services. We propose to build upon the successful ""Finance and Mental Health Services Training in Czech Republic/Central Europe (5-D43-TW005810-10). Prof. Richard Scheffler, University of California, Berkeley, has been the PI and co-Director of this program for the past ten years. The other co-Director has been Prof. Martin Potucek, Charles University, Prague. During its span, the program has trained over sixty people from Bulgaria, Croatia, Czech Republic, Romania, and Slovakia. The past 5 years of the program has been highly successful by all measures, with over 72 publications and 3 books by its trainees. The PI of our new application will be Prof. Scheffler. Because the Czech Republic is now a high-income economy, we will replace Charles University with a new partner. We propose that the new partner be the new School of Public Health at Babes-Bolyai University (http://www.publichealth.ro/), Cluj-Napoca, Romania. SPH- BBU will serve as the hub of the program in Europe, attracting and screening candidates, and fostering their subsequent career development. Berkeley will continue to be the primary training site, providing senior faculty to mentor the trainees as they take classes, participate in seminars, and engage in research projects in their home countries. The new co-Director will be Razvan Chereches, MD, Ph.D., Babes-Bolyai University. Dr. Chereches has himself been a trainee and a project leader in our previous program. He has also participated in other NIH programs: University of Iowa International Training and Research in Occupational and Environmental Health Program, Fogarty International Center - D43 TW000621; Minority Health and Health Disparities International Research and Training, Fogarty International Center- T37 MD001453-05; and University of Iowa International Collaborative Trauma and Injury Prevention Research and Training Program, Fogarty International Center - D43 TW007261. Just as the previous program expanded from the Czech Republic into four other countries in the region, we intend to start from Romania and Bulgaria, and expand into other LMICs in SEE. The countries of interest currently include Albania, Moldova, and Serbia, but other countries of the former Yugoslavia will also be considered. Expansion into any country always depends on identifying an appropriate institution and persons who can help support qualified and interested trainees.

"Understanding Health Disparities in the Progression of Type 2 Diabetes  It is well-established that modifiable, lifestyle-related behaviors including smoking, alcohol, diet, and physical activity greatly contribute to the risk of most common physical health conditions. The recent, almost epidemic increase in the prevalence of diseases associated with these health behaviors, especially hypertension, type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease (CVD), and growing disparities in the burden of these conditions across racial and ethnic groups, highlights the urgency of developing effective prevention strategies - however, few intervention studies have produced long-term changes in lifestyle and behaviors. Addressing an omission in existing behavioral intervention models, we propose that what is needed is an examination of behavioral change in the context of the interrelationships among health behaviors, sources of and coping responses to chronic stress, and their influence on physical and mental health. This proposal is motivated by a robust literature that indicates blacks in the US are more likely to engage in poor health behaviors (i.e., tobacco smoking, diets high in fat and carbohydrates, excessive alcohol use) and, expectedly, experience disproportionate burdens of common physical health conditions associated with these behaviors, including CVD and diabetes, relative to non-Hispanic whites - paradoxically, however, population-based and clinic studies have consistently found that blacks, in comparison to whites, have the same or lower rates of most mental disorders, even while experiencing higher rates of psychological distress. We theorize that a defined set of health-related stress-coping strategies (i.e., tobacco smoking, diets high in fat and carbohydrates, excessive alcohol use, etc) have a two-pronged effect that helps to account for this counterintuitive patterning. First, we suggest that these behaviors act on the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and related stress- hormonal systems which influences the subjective experience and development of stress-associated psychiatric disorder. Second, we believe that the effects of these poor behaviors on pathophysiology, combined with direct effects of stressful living conditions over the life-course, contribute to disproportionate burden of chronic physical health problems among blacks. Succinctly, we propose that blacks and other individuals from highly stressed populations ""buy"" their relative, comparatively positive rates of mental disorders at the expense of their deteriorating physical health. Therefore, this framework suggests that adherence to traditional preventative care, specifically involving changes in behavioral lifestyle, can lead to a perverse result: improvements in physical health but worsening of mental health. We will extend this line of research and assess the effect of traditional preventative care among three categories of type 2 diabetes patients: 1) pre- or borderline; 2) early onset; and, 3) poorly-controlled. In the proposed accelerated longitudinal design we will examine the inter-relationships among stress, health behaviors, and physical and mental health at three distinct points of diabetes progression.  Type 2 diabetes and its associated risk factors such as hypertension and heart disease continue to top the domestic and international public health agendas. The diagnoses of these conditions are invariably followed by recommendations for extensive behavioral modifications. In all cases rates of long-term adherence to recommended healthy behavioral changes are spotty at best, both intra-and inter-individually. We believe that physical and mental health disparities are linked to the lack of behavioral change adherence. The findings of this study will help anticipate, understand, and identify informal and formal programs and public health policies needed to address the physical and mental health challenges facing the growing epidemic of related cardiovascular and metabolic disorders in the U.S. and other developed and developing countries.

"Reducing Disparities in Mental Health Expenditure Among Children in Child Welfare    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Children coming into contact with child welfare agencies constitute what has been described as the dominant public mental health problem when it comes to children. These approximately 5.8 million children are disproportionately non-white, and display considerable race/ethnic disparities in their utilization of mental health services. What makes these disparities especially pernicious is that virtually all of these children have entitlements to Medicaid. Medicaid agencies' ability to reduce these disparities occurring among its beneficiaries is hampered by the lack of information on what factors result in differential utilization of services among children of different race/ethnicities, which has the potential risk of worsening mental health outcomes among this highly vulnerable population.  For the first time in the field of child welfare research, members of this research team are assembling a unique data set that links the respondents of a national survey of children in child welfare to their Medicaid claims data, along with information on Medicaid and mental health policies within their counties of residence. Such a linkage combines the richness of person-level information contained in survey data - such as need for mental health services identified using standardized psychometric measures - with the use and expenditure information contained in claims data. In the present study, we propose to complete construction of this data set, and then conduct longitudinal data analysis to (1) model race/ethnic differences in mental health service utilization (ambulatory mental health service use, inpatient hospitalizations, psychotropic medication use, overall service volume, and timeliness of services) and expenditures among a national sample of children in child welfare; (2) estimate race/ethnic differences in mental health services utilization and expenditure trajectories over the childhood development cycle (ages 0- 18 years) among these children; and (3) examine the role of care consistent with national standards as mediators of race/ethnic differences in mental health service utilization and expenditures (from Aim 1), and use and expenditure trajectories (from Aim 2), among these children; and (4) effects of Medicaid policies (presumptive eligibility, managed care, and system coordination) on race/ethnic differences in mental health service utilization and expenditures (from Aim 1), and use and expenditure trajectories (from Aim 2), among these children  This proposal by a new investigator brings together a highly experienced team of senior investigators and a state Medicaid policymaker to address these salient issues with respect to Medicaid coverage of a very vulnerable child population. This proposal is aligned to several Federal and NIH priorities, including the NIMH Strategic Plan, several reports of the Surgeon-General, publications from the Institute of Medicine, and several of the proposed objectives from Healthy People 2020, all of which call for policy action that can reduce and eliminate disparities in mental health.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Race/ethnic disparities in access to needed mental health services is a national public health concern, highlighted in several publications from the Institute of Medicine, the Surgeon-General, and Healthy People 2020 objectives. These disparities are especially prevalent among children in the child welfare system, a group with the highest needs for mental health services among child populations, and a group that paradoxically possesses entitlements to Medicaid. Clearly, Medicaid agencies require better information on the magnitude of these disparities both cross-sectionally and over time, as well as an investigation of which Medicaid policies may worsen disparities among this vulnerable population. For the first time in child welfare research, this study links national survey data of children in child welfare with Medicaid claims data to identify, quantify, and appropriately resource care for children at risk for disparities in access to services. In the context of health reform, this proposal provides a unique opportunity to examine how disparities among these children can be reduced through Medicaid policy action.

"Iwankapiya_Healing Historical Trauma Practice and Group IPT for American Indians     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal addresses the significant disparity in mental health problems, as well as availability of Evidence Based Treatment (EBT), between American Indians (AIs) and the general U.S. population. Limited treatment engagement and poor retention rates, commonly regarded as major barriers to mental health care, contribute to the problem of disparities in mental health disorder prevalence. Socioeconomic factors are predictors of reduced treatment engagement and premature, unplanned termination. These characteristics include: minority status, low income, lack of health insurance, lower educational attainment, negative attitudes about mental health care, and substance use (Edlund, 2002; Wang, Bergland, et al., 2005).  This proposal focuses on research designed to develop strategies to deal with three significant causes of the disparities: (1) the lack of an evidence base for culturally appropriate treatment for AIs; (2) problems of engagement and retention of AIs in treatment; and (3) the salience of historical trauma.  In this pilot study, we will explore he feasibility, acceptance and sustainability of a treatment engagement and retention strategy, the Historical Trauma and Unresolved Grief Tribal Best Practice (HTUG) to engage and retain AI adults in an EBT, Group Interpersonal Psychotherapy (IPT), that may be well suited for treating depression and related mental disorders in this population. HTUG focuses on grief resolution related to AI collective massive group trauma across generations, and has potential for engaging AIs in EBTs through acknowledging the negative effects of colonialism on well-being and reducing the stigma of mental health problems (Brave Heart, 1998; Brave Heart, 2003).  We will examine multiple aspects of feasibility, including recruitment, randomization, engagement and retention of clients; recruitment, training, supervision and retention of clinicians; client an clinician acceptance of and satisfaction with HTUG and Group IPT, client and clinician perceptions of the appropriateness of the research measures for client screening, process monitoring and outcome measurement; client (and clinician) acceptance of measures for examining their fidelity to the research model, clinic costs in terms of finances, space use, training time for clinicians, and clinical and staff support costs for HTUG and Group IPT implementation. Long term, what is learned from this proposed research could have significant promise for reducing disparities in mental health treatment and disease burden across AI populations and in culturally unique, disadvantaged and poorly served populations in general.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: American Indians disproportionally experience minority status, low income, lack of health insurance, lower educational attainment, unemployment and substance use. This disparity is widely recognized as a major barrier to mental health care and as a significant public health issue. This pilot study explores the feasibility, acceptance and sustainability of an engagement and retention strategy that may be especially well suited for treating depression and related mental health disorders in this population. Such disparities have long been recognized by agencies like the NIH and Institute of Medicine as a significant public mental health problem and strategies for their alleviation are a high priority.                  ",Iwankapiya_Healing Historical Trauma Practice and Group IPT for American Indians,8583759,R34MH097834,"['adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' American Indian ', ' American Indians ', ' Attitude ', ' psychological disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Client ', ' clinical investigation ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Colonialism ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Grief ', ' Grief reaction ', ' Group Practice ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Health Personnel ', ' Heart ', ' NAS/IOM ', ' Institute of Medicine ', ' Institute of Medicine (U.S.) ', ' Health Insurance ', ' Learning ', ' Manuals ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene Services ', ' Mental Health Services ', ' Methods ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' New Mexico ', ' Perception ', ' well-being ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' pilot study ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' Psychotherapy ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Research ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Research Design ', ' Socioeconomic Factors ', ' South Dakota ', ' Supervision ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' unemployed ', ' out of work ', ' joblessness ', ' jobless ', ' Unemployment ', ' Generations ', ' Measures ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' diverse populations ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' Caring ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Site ', ' Clinical ', ' Healed ', ' prematurity ', ' premature ', ' Training ', ' using substances ', ' substance use ', ' AOD use ', ' Alcohol or Other Drugs use ', ' satisfaction ', ' Measurement ', ' root ', ' Plant Roots ', ' programs ', ' Clinic ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' experience ', ' treatment program ', ' social ', ' Modeling ', ' stigma ', ' social stigma ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Drops ', ' Provider ', ' disease causation ', ' causation ', ' Causality ', ' Etiology ', ' Low income ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Randomized ', ' Research Training ', ' Resolution ', ' trial treatment ', ' trial regimen ', ' Clinical Treatment ', ' Monitor ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' Evidence based treatment ', ' cost ', ' healing ', ' years of life lost to disease ', ' years of life lost to disability ', ' disease burden ', ' burden of disease ', ' burden of illness ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Minority ', ' therapy efficacy ', ' therapeutically effective ', ' therapeutic efficacy ', ' intervention efficacy ', ' Treatment Efficacy ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' Trauma ', ' Pine Ridge Indian Reservation ', ' resistant ', ' Resistance ', ' mental health related disorder ', ' public health relevance ', ' evidence base ', ' randomized trial ', ' screening ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF NEW MEXICO HEALTH SCIS CTR,R34,2013,188398,0.061183746917197655
"Addressing Mental Health Disparities in Refugee ChildrenL A CBPR Collaboration     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In the US, refugee children and families face dramatic disparities in the incidence and treatment of mental health disorders. Resettlement stressors (poverty, limited access to care) and acculturative challenges (differences in cultural norms, discrimination) often exacerbate risks due to war-related trauma exposure. Commonly, refugee mental health services are limited-usually with a narrow focus on clinical treatment of PTSD-and rarely respond to the holistic needs of refugee communities; few interventions are designed to be used across cultures and refugee groups, despite rapidly evolving refugee demographics in the US. The cross-cultural application of community-based participatory research (CBPR) methods can increase understanding of risk and protective factors in refugee communities and contribute to development of flexible mental health interventions to address disparities. This CBPR project builds on an existing collaborative research relationships with the Somali Bantu refugee community in Greater Boston. Preliminary research has identified numerous cultural and community strengths as well as ongoing problems of family conflict, poor parent-child communication which interact with ongoing stressors to increase risks for child emotional and behavioral problems. Family-based intervention models adapted via local input and delivered by trained members of the community hold great promise for use among these and other refugee groups in the US. This study will use CBPR mixed methods (qualitative and quantitative data collection) to conduct needs assessments and design and evaluate a core family-based intervention. Project activities will emphasize capacity building in two refugee communities resettled in Greater Boston-the Somali Bantu and the Bhutanese-actively engaging refugee community members, community advisory boards, services providers, and other stakeholders. Specific Aims are to: (1) deepen partnerships with the Somali Bantu and Bhutanese communities through co-leadership, capacity-building, and knowledge sharing; (2) collect and apply qualitative data to (a) prepare a needs assessment of mental health in children and adolescents, barriers to care, and services preferences with each target refugee group; (b) develop mental health/psychosocial assessments for refugee caregivers and children; (c) adapt the core components of a family-based strengthening intervention for use with refugees; and (3) conduct an 80-family pilot study to examine acceptability and sustainability of the intervention. Key outcomes will be improvements in caregiver-child relationships, mental health services access, increased functioning, and reduced mental health symptoms in children and adolescents.         RELEVANCE (See instructions): The proposed study will employ cross-cultural CBPR methods to develop a family-based intervention grounded in needs assessments on contributors to mental health disparities among refugee children and families. The mixed methods research approach to selecting, adapting and implementing culturally-informed assessments and intervention models has the potential to contribute to feasible, acceptable and sustainable intervention models of mental health services for diverse groups of refugee children and families.                  ",Addressing Mental Health Disparities in Refugee ChildrenL A CBPR

"Culture, Context, and Mexican American Mental Health ABSTRACT  This proposal seeks 5 years of continued support for a longitudinal study of processes that contribute to the  high levels of psychopathology experienced by Mexican American youth. Consistent with priorities in the NIMH  Strategic Plan (2008), this study is designed to (1) chart mental illness trajectories of Mexican American youth,  (2) increase our capacity to predict who in this population is at risk for mental illness by identifying individual,  environmental, and social factors that contribute to both risk and resilience processes, (3) identify contributors  to the mental health disparities experienced by Mexican Americans, and (4) provide a scientific foundation for  the design of the next generation of preventive interventions for this population. Beginning with a diverse  sample of 750 Mexican American families, this study tests hypotheses regarding how interactions of  individuals' cultural orientations with characteristics of family, community, peer, and school contexts contribute  to the mental health burden of this population. A unique aspect of this study is the assessment of cultural  orientation (i.e., degree of endorsement of traditional Mexican cultural values and degree of endorsement of  U.S. cultural values) of children and parents as well as the degree to which communities and schools support  these cultural traditions. Children and their parents were assessed initially when children were in 5th and 7th  grades. Results supported the specific aims: (1) changes in children's and parents' cultural orientations are  related to greater risk for mental health disorders; (2) family characteristics, such as parent-child conflict,  mediate the relation between cultural orientation mismatches and children's psychopathology; and (3) child  and parent cultural orientations buffer relations between common risk factors (e.g., economic hardship) and  children's mental health. The proposed continuation will assess this sample of children and their parents as  youth experience the rapid developmental changes of middle adolescence (grades 10 and 12) when rates of  psychopathology accelerate. The specific aims remain: (1) cultural mismatches between children and family,  community, and school contexts will be related to risk for psychopathology; (2) family and peer group  processes will mediate relations between cultural mismatches and psychopathology; and (3) cultural  orientations of children and their parents will moderate relations between risk factors and psychopathology.  Longitudinal tests of these aims will provide a strong foundation for the next generation of prevention programs  to reduce mental health disparities for Mexican Americans. NARRATIVE  This longitudinal study of 750 Mexican American adolescents and their parents is important from a public  health standpoint because of the mental health disparities Mexican American adolescents experience, and the  limited knowledge about factors that contribute to these disparities. This study is designed to (1) chart mental  illness trajectories of Mexican American youth, (2) increase our capacity to predict who in this population is at  risk for mental illness by identifying individual, environmental, and social factors that contribute to both risk and  resilience processes, (3) identify contributors to the mental health disparities experienced by Mexican  Americans, and (4) provide a firm scientific foundation for the design of the next generation of preventive  interventions for this population in order to reduce the individual, family, and societal burden of  psychopathology within this population.","Culture, Context, and Mexican American Mental Health",8432471,R01MH068920,"['Cultural Assimilation ', ' Acculturation ', ' teenage ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' Adolescence ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Behavior ', ' psychological disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Belief ', ' Origin of Life ', ' Biogenesis ', ' Buffers ', ' Censuses ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' CDC ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Communities ', ' Conflict ', ' Conflict (Psychology) ', ' Cultural Characteristics ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Economics ', ' Employment ', ' Environment ', ' Family ', ' Family Characteristics ', ' Foundations ', ' Sex Roles ', ' Gender Role ', ' Grant ', ' social group process ', ' Group Processes ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Income ', ' long-term study ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' achievement Mainstream Education ', ' Mainstreaming ', ' Educational Mainstreaming ', ' Mainstreaming (Education) ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Chicanos ', ' Chicanas ', ' Mexican Americans ', ' Persons ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' NIMH ', ' National Institute of Mental Health (U.S.) ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' parent offspring interaction ', ' parent child interaction ', ' Parent-Child Relationship ', ' Parent-Child Relations ', ' Parents ', ' Peer Group ', ' abnormal psychology ', ' Psychopathology ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Records ', ' recruit ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' Research ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Research Design ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Schools ', ' Social transformation ', ' Social modification ', ' Social Change ', ' Social Class ', ' social support network ', ' Social support ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Measures ', ' Parenting ', ' Parenting behavior ', ' Mediating ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Youth ', ' disorders of conduct ', ' disorder of conduct ', ' Conduct Disorder ', ' rural area ', ' suburbia ', ' suburban ', ' suburb ', ' Family Study ', ' Left ', ' Site ', ' Phase ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' psychological ', ' psychologic ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Adolescent ', ' Link ', ' teacher ', ' Individual ', ' Mexican ', ' Relative Risks ', ' drug use ', ' Drug usage ', ' Immigrant ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Knowledge ', ' Event ', ' Source ', ' Application Context ', ' contextual factors ', ' meetings ', ' inner city ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' success ', ' cohesion ', ' high school ', ' Prevention program ', ' peer ', ' 7th grade ', ' seventh grade ', ' deviancy ', ' deviant ', ' cultural values ', ' 5th grade ', ' fifth grade ', ' social ', ' substance abuse ', ' abuse of substances ', ' Substance abuse problem ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' boys ', ' girls ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Low income ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Child Mental Health ', ' Adherence ', ' Adherence (attribute) ', ' Data ', ' Developmental Process ', ' National Institute on Drug Abuse ', ' NIDA ', ' National Institute of Drug Abuse ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' Strategic Planning ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' time use ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' next generation ', ' resilience ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' malleable risk ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' therapy design ', ' early adolescence ', ' ']",NIMH,ARIZONA STATE UNIVERSITY-TEMPE CAMPUS,R01,2013,565862,0.05000922608620424
"Preventing & Treating HIV Comorbidities in India: Multi-tiered Strategy for Women     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall objective of this project is to demonstrate that a low cost, cell phone-delivered intervention is a promising, feasible and acceptable way to improve the prevention and treatment outcomes of women in India who are affected by HIV and inter-related mental health and psychosocial risk factors. Over the past decade there have been dramatic improvements in HIV prevention and access to life-saving antiretroviral therapy (ART). Yet, deficits in adherence to the spectrum of HIV care pose significant barriers to success. Women are at a particular disadvantage. Gender inequality, physical and situational factors place many women at increased risk for HIV acquisition and poor mental health and interrelated psychosocial co-factors (depression, gender-discrimination, violence, lack of social support, etc.) that are well established correlates of poor adherence and retention in HIV care. Few adherence interventions have focused on women in India outside of short-term prevention in PMTCT programs. Recent studies have shown alarmingly high rates of loss to follow-up for these women, particularly in the transition after delivery, between PMTCT and lifelong HIV care services. To address this gap, a collaborative partnership between the National Institute of Mental Health and Neuro Sciences (NIMHANS) and Yale University will leverage the complementary expertise of a uniquely well qualified, multidisciplinary team of Indian and U.S. of clinical investigators, stakeholders and resources. Our preliminary work indicates that a theory-guided adherence phone intervention that can be easily integrated and sustained as a component of routine ART Centre services is well suited for the target population, but it needs to be adapted to the sociocultural context. Following initial formative work to refine the interventio for delivery in India, we will train clinic nurses to deliver the intervention, and then evaluate te feasibility, fidelity and preliminary efficacy of the novel application of the intervention in a randomized trial. After baseline assessment, women (n=120) will be randomly assigned to treatment as usual (TAU) or TAU plus the phone intervention (delivered over 16 weeks) and outcomes (e.g., depressive symptoms, adherence) will be evaluated at 6, 14, 24, 36 weeks post-randomization.

"Organizational Capacity to Eliminate Outcome Disparities under Healthcare Reform     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The substance abuse treatment field faces an unprecedented challenge to reduce health disparities among racial and ethnic minority populations. Access to integrated substance abuse, mental health, and HIV prevention care is associated with positive health outcomes and reduced cost. The overall goal of the proposed study is to identify how changes precipitated by the Affordable Care Act (ACA) impact community- based outpatient substance abuse treatment (OSAT) program capacity to expand service delivery in racial and ethnic minority communities and eliminate outcome disparities among African American and Latino clients. The objective for this application is to examine the organizational impact of the current expansion of Medicaid on the capacity of community-based OSAT programs to enhance treatment access and retention among minorities residing in Los Angeles County (L.A.), California by developing and analyzing a panel dataset. Our conceptual framework, grounded in organizational development frameworks investigates the role of organizational capacity (i.e., leadership, readiness for change, Medi-Cal billing) in mediating the effect of Medicaid expansion (referred as Medi-Cal in California) on service delivery (i.e., mental health and HIV prevention services) and on treatment access and retention among African American and Latino clients. In Aim 1 and 2 we will examine baseline data to refine our conceptual model of organizational capacity factors likely to impact the delivery of mental health and HIV prevention services in OSAT programs in racial and ethnic minority communities, prior to ACA enactment. We will resurvey in 2013, 2015 and 2017 the same representative sample of 147 OSAT programs located in minority communities to form a panel data set. These repeated measures of program data will be concatenated with administrative client outcome data (N~10,800 clients) at each data point to examine in Aims 3 and 4 the longitudinal impact of insurance expansion on service delivery in minority communities and rates of access and retention among African American and Latino clients with mental health and HIV risk conditions. The overall public health impact of the proposed study includes identifying promising organizational factors among publicly funded community-based OSAT programs that serve large proportions of low-income minority clients that play a mediating role between the ACA insurance expansion and client-centered process outcomes with the goal of eliminating health disparities.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This study will identify how changes precipitated by the Affordable Care Act impact community-based outpatient substance abuse treatment program capacity to expand accessibility to mental health and HIV prevention care in racial and ethnic minority communities in Los Angeles County, California. As such, the public health relevance of this project relies on providing critical information for state insurance administrators, policy makers and community-based providers who seek to develop evidence-informed policies and practices to respond to health care reform and parity legislation and eliminate health disparities.           ",Organizational Capacity to Eliminate Outcome Disparities under Healthcare Reform,8535048,R21DA035634,"['California ', ' Client ', ' Communities ', ' Economics ', ' Elements ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' inducement ', ' Incentives ', ' Insurance ', ' Leadership ', ' Legislation ', ' Statutes and Laws ', ' Los Angeles ', ' Medicaid ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Out-patients ', ' Outpatients ', ' parity ', ' Play ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Research ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Testing ', ' County ', ' Measures ', ' Administrator ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Latino ', ' Mediating ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' HIV/AIDS prevention ', ' HIV Prevention ', ' AIDS/HIV prevention ', ' AIDS prevention ', ' Caring ', ' Organizational Models ', ' base ', ' Phase ', ' Healthcare Reform ', ' Health Care Reform ', ' Policy Maker ', ' Policies ', ' Funding ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Nature ', ' programs ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' Services ', ' Performance ', ' prevention service ', ' treatment program ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' substance abuse ', ' abuse of substances ', ' Substance abuse problem ', ' HIV risk ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' QOC ', ' Quality of Care ', ' response ', ' theories ', ' Provider ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Preparedness ', ' Readiness ', ' Low income ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Improve Access ', ' Subgroup ', ' underserved minority ', ' under-represented minority ', ' Underrepresented Minority ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' substance abuse therapy ', ' substance abuse treatment ', ' cost ', ' care systems ', ' treatment organization ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' ethnic minority ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' racial/ethnic ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' addictive disorder ', ' addiction ', ' public health relevance ', ' evidence base ', ' ']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,R21,2013,263628,-0.010166100835864327
"Patient Navigation for Depressed Mothers in Head Start - An Engagement Strategy     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Maternal depression disproportionately affects low-income and minority women and has substantial negative impacts on their children. Among these women, myriad cultural, psychological and logistic barriers impede engagement with mental health services, resulting in disparities in access to care. In 2009, the Institute of Medicine (IOM) published a landmark report, Depression in Parents, Parenting, and Children, in which it recognized engagement with care to be a substantial hurdle to better outcomes, and called for interventions that link screening efforts to treatment plans, and that take place in community-based, family-focused venues. Consistent with this report, our research group obtained an R01 award (R01MH091871) in 2010 to conduct a randomized trial of a maternal depression prevention intervention in Head Start - a federally funded preschool program that provides services for ~1 million children of low-income families across the US. In this ongoing study, Head Start mothers are enrolled based on their risk for developing major depressive episode (MDE); those in MDE are deliberately excluded and referred to more definitive care. This R21 proposes to enroll those women excluded from the prevention trial in an adjunct pilot study - the principal goal of which is to develop Patient Navigation as a model to promote engagement with depression care. Patient Navigation is a lay-delivered case management approach that focuses on overcoming logistical hurdles to care, such as transportation, language barriers or insurance complexities, during a defined episode. However, because engaging with mental health care requires addressing additional cultural and psychological barriers, we believe that traditional Navigation models will be insufficient for this purpose. We will thus train our navigators in the 'Engagement Interview,' an empirically-supported technique, in which interviewers facilitate client-focused exploration of life experiences, shared decision making, and goal setting as a way to build motivation to seek treatment. We propose a two-arm, 60-subject pilot study, within which we will: field test study mechanics, including the acceptabiliy of randomization among Head Start mothers in MDE; use quality improvement methods to optimize intervention delivery; and obtain empiric estimates of study parameters to inform the planning of an appropriately powered RCT. Although Patient Navigation has emerging evidence among adult cancer patients for promoting timely use of diagnostic services, it has yet to be studied as a mechanism to promote engagement with mental health care. Studying engagement in the child-focused Head Start setting offers the further possibility of learning how such a community-based setting - with its emphasis on children and family - can be leveraged to help mothers in MDE seek care. Such knowledge will inform the development of a subsequent trial of the intervention model. Our ultimate goal is model dissemination at the national level through Head Start and a reduction in disparities in access to mental health care.          Maternal depression disproportionately affects low-income and minority women and has substantial negative impacts on their children. Among these women, myriad cultural, psychological and logistic barriers impede engagement with mental health services, resulting in disparities in access to care. This R21 application proposes to explore Patient Navigation as a mechanism to promote engagement with care for depressed mothers in Head Start - a federally funded early learning program for children of low-income families. By embedding theory-based engagement strategies in the navigation model, we aim to improve engagement with mental health services, and thereby improve outcomes for both depressed mothers and their children.

"Discrimination and Mental Health in Latino Families:  Mediators and Moderators     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Exposure to racial/ethnic discrimination has been consistently associated with poor mental and physical health outcomes. However, the mechanisms underlying the link between discrimination and health are still unclear. In addition, potential moderators of the stressful impact of exposure to discrimination on mental health have yet to be clearly identified, particularly within underresearched groups such as Latino adolescents. The proposed study will address these gaps in the literature by investigating perceived racial/ethnic discrimination among Mexican-origin adolescents 12-17 years old. The proposed study has three specific aims:  (1) To test mediating mechanisms (focusing on anger regulation) that help explain the link between racial/ethnic discrimination and mental health in Mexican-origin adolescents;  (2) To identify coping strategies (e.g., ethnic identity; social support) that influence the link between  racial/ethnic discrimination and mental health in Mexican-origin adolescents.  (3) To assess the degree to which the family environment and sociocultural context factors (e.g., gender, nativity status, ethnic socialization) increase or decrease the adverse effect of racial/ethnic discrimination on adolescents' mental health. To achieve these study aims, we will conduct a longitudinal community-based survey of N = 270 Mexican- origin families in the northern Indiana region. Data will be collected using an audio computer administered self- interview (ACASI) approach with adolescents and face-to-face interviews with parents. Adolescents will be surveyed across three measurement occasions at 6-month intervals, whereas parents will be surveyed at the first time point. We will assess racial/ethnic discrimination, emotion regulation, anger expression/suppression, acculturation/enculturation levels, acculturative stress, ethnic identity development, cultural orientation and values, racial/ethnic/cultural socialization practices, and mental health. The within-group approach will allow us to carefully study cultural influences and variations in sources of resilience and vulnerability vis-¿-vis mental disorders, and the longitudinal design wil enable us to test mediation and moderation effects across time to better determine sequence of effects. The proposed study is significant because it advances our understanding of: (1) key mediating mechanisms that help explain the link between discrimination and mental disorder; and, (2) potential moderating factors that can either buffer or exacerbate the impact of discrimination on mental health in this understudied population. This project is relevant to public health as it has the potential to identify explanatory mechanisms, as well as malleable risk and resilience factors, in the discrimination-mental health link. This will aid in the development of more targeted and culturally-sensitive interventions that can mitigate the detrimental impact of racism on the mental health of Latino youth and thus, help reduce health disparities.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project will help identify explanatory mechanisms, as well as malleable vulnerability and resilience factors, in the discrimination-mental health link.

"Center for Mental Health Services in Pediatric Primary Care    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Mission: The center seeks sustainable ways to increase primary care providers' capacity to improve function, reduce distress, and prevent disability among children with mental health problems. Background: The mental health issues treated in pediatric primary care are characterized by high prevalence and a preponderance of children with impairment but without a diagnosis. Parent distress frequently complicates children's mental health problems and requires simultaneous attention. The ability to engage families around their needs promotes access to treatment and contributes to reducing ethnic (disparities. Goal and specific aims: The Center will develop an evidence-based model for mental health in primary care that 1) applies to the range of problems seen in primary care, 2) engages existing skills and knowledge of families and pediatric providers, and 3) results in sustainable increases in the mental health treatment capacity of primary care. Its specific aims are to: 1) adapt Wagner's Chronic Care Model (CCM) of primary care mental health service to include treatment based on ""common factors"" and ""common treatment elements.""; la) within the CCM's 5 domains, address priority research needs related to the impact of common factors and their implementation in office practice; lb) develop packages of practical interventions, built around domains of the adapted CCM, for larger scale trials in pediatric primary care; 2) develop measurements, study designs and analytic methods to efficiently assess outcomes in community settings; and 3) stimulate innovation in pediatric mental health services through multidisciplinary and community-academic collaboration, attracting new and diverse scholars and providing a resource for scientists, policy makers, and advocates. Methods: The Center's faculty is a team of pediatricians, psychologists, psychiatrists, and other scholars from six institutions that include rural, suburban, and urban settings.

"Regional Network for Mental Health Research in Latin America DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overriding objective of our Hub for Latin America (HLA) is to improve the condition of people with severe mental disorders in Latin America. We propose to do so by making a focused contribution to narrowing the ""mental health gap"". Our long-term goal is to improve health services for people with severe mental disorders until they are equivalent to the best health services offered to people with highly prioritized general health conditions. We envision an integrated system of primary care and secondary mental health services that we refer to as Community Health Care for individuals with Severe Mental Disorders (CHC-SMD). We adopt a multi-pronged approach that is tailored to the distinctive context of the urban areas of Latin America. Our goals for the 5-year grant period are to launch strategic initiatives that will generate significant progress toward CHC-SMD in this region, and to build a platform for ongoing progress over a longer time period.    The HLA brings together key researchers and stakeholders from six cities across Latin America (Santiago, Chile; Rio de Janeiro, Brazil; Buenos Aires, Cordoba, Neuquen, Argentina; Medellin, Colombia) with researchers in New York City in a concerted effort to make progress toward a shared vision of CHC-SMD. The Components are designed to be synergistic so that the impact of the whole HLA is greater than the sum of its parts. The Research Component, for example, proposes to pilot a regional randomized controlled trial (RCT). In order for the HLA to proceed as planned to conduct a full scale regional RCT, the Capacity Building Component will need to train leaders at the HLA sites to conduct RCTs and coordinate regional studies. At the same time, the pilot RCT will help generate this capacity by providing practical experience in RCTs and regional studies.    Our overall specific aims are (a) to deploy and evaluate task shifting approaches that can accelerate progress toward CHC-SMD; (b) to train young leaders with the capacities required to generate ongoing progress toward CHC-SMD; and (c) to bring together multiple stakeholders to contribute to implementing and shaping CHC-SMD. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Within Latin American cities people with severe mental disorders are a vulnerable population whose lives are often characterized by extreme poverty, social exclusion from education, employment, and participation in civil society, multiple traumas including violence and abuse, reduced access to health care and high mortality rates. Equitable development, as endorsed by international conventions, requires the inclusion of this vulnerable population in the benefits of development and the protection of their civil and human rights.

"Implementation of a Measurement Feedback System in School Mental Health     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This Mentored Career Development Award (K08) is designed to provide intensive training in developing a strong program of research that investigates the adaptation and implementation of health information technologies within the school context to increase the availability of high-quality mental health interventions for underserved youth and families. A field of implementation science has recently emerged to address the significant gap between the proliferation of evidence-based practices (EBP) for treating youth mental health problems and their use in usual care treatment settings. Nowhere is this gap more apparent than in schools. Schools provide the bulk of youth mental health services (>70%) and effectively reduce service access disparities by ethnicity and socioeconomic status. Nevertheless, implementation research focused on the school context has been disproportionately limited. To address these gaps and advance implementation science, the candidate's long term career objective is to develop effective methods for promoting the use of EBP among mental health providers in educational settings. Standardized assessment (SA) of psychiatric symptoms is a cornerstone of all EBP and has been significantly associated with improvements in treatment- related outcome. Nevertheless, SA is infrequently utilized by school-based providers, resulting in sub-optimal care. Measurement feedback systems (MFS) use the results of SA to deliver information to clinicians about client progress, represent a structured way to introduce SA into service systems, and have the potential to support effective, client-centered care. The candidate's immediate focus is therefore to increase clinicians' administration of SA tools and incorporation of SA feedback into routine practice through the development of a MFS and an accompanying contextualized adaptation process that are designed specifically for schools.  The current K08 Award will uniquely position the candidate to advance this research agenda. His background includes specialized training in child clinical psychology, evidence-based assessment and intervention approaches, research on school-based mental health, mental health services research, and collaboration with community stakeholders. To more effectively bridge the gap between typical and optimal mental health care in schools, he seeks to extend his training to include: (1) design of healthcare technologies that are user-friendly and contextually appropriate, (2) experience with theory and methods to support innovation uptake/implementation in schools, (3) advanced statistics and research methodology, and (4) advanced academic writing. The University of Washington is an outstanding environment in which to engage in the interdisciplinary training required to achieve these training goals. The candidate's primary mentors-Drs. Elizabeth McCauley and Jurgen Unutzer have combined expertise in the assessment and treatment of adolescent psychopathology, training with school-based providers, development of computer products to support evidence-based service delivery, implementation science, and the development and dissemination of measurement feedback tools for client progress monitoring. Additional local and national consultants will contribute expertise in implementation research for youth/family services, user-centered design, school-based mental health, community service provision, decision support tools for youth treatment providers, cultural diversity and mental health care, mental health policy, and qualitative and mixed methods research.  The proposed project draws on the training and expertise above to develop and evaluate a contextually- adapted, web-based MFS for use in school-based health centers (SBHCs) through a series of qualitative, quantitative, and mixed methods research aims. The University of Washington Care Management Tracking System is a MFS, developed by Dr. Unutzer, previously found to result in improved care, symptom reductions, and increased functioning among patients. The current study proposes to use SBHC clinician focus groups and direct clinician feedback to adapt this MFS for use by SBHC clinicians. The candidate's prior research has revealed that SBHC providers infrequently utilize SA measures, but supports the feasibility of using structured, computerized methods to increase SA administration. A sample of SBHC clinicians (n = 20) and youth (n = 64, Aim 3) will participate in the project to advance the following Research Aims: (1) evaluate the SBHC context to inform MFS adaptation; (2) assess the adaptation's effectiveness in context; (3) evaluate the system impact on clinician behavior and youth outcomes; and (4) assess the added utility of providing academic data to school clinicians for use in progress monitoring. SBHC clinicians will provide feedback on the optimal design of the MFS and use it to track outcomes among youth experiencing depression and anxiety. Aims 1 and 2 will be evaluated descriptively, using existing benchmarks when applicable. Aim 3 will be tested experimentally via a small-scale randomized trial in which clinicians (and a subset of their caseloads) will be randomized to one of two conditions: (a) use of the school MFS to monitor progress using SA or (b) assessment as usual. Aim 4 will be tested using the MFS, with randomization of youth to two conditions: (a) clinicians receive the results of SA and students' school attendance data from the MFS or (b) data include SA results only. Based on the results of this work, a R01 grant application will be submitted to investigate the larger-scale implementation of the school MFS and contextualized adaptation process among a range of school service delivery models, allowing for more thorough evaluation of its impact on clinician behavior and student functioning.          Evidence-based mental health services are infrequently provided by school-based clinicians, resulting in sub- optimal outcomes for the ""safety net"" populations most likely to receive care in that setting (i.e., low- socioeconomic status, ethnic minority youth). By identifying innovative health technologies that systematically support the implementation of evidence-based practices and adapting them for use in schools, the proposed research and training carries considerable potential to enhance the availability of high-quality care for underserved youth, thereby more effectively alleviating symptoms and promoting functioning across domains.

"Improving Metabolic Screening in Diverse Severely Mentally Ill Populations    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application for a K23 Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award will support critical additional training for the candidate, Dr. Christina Mangurian, a psychiatrist at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF), based at San Francisco General Hospital. Dr. Mangurian's research plan focuses on improving metabolic screening among ethnically and racially diverse severely mentally ill populations served in community mental health clinics. To further develop her career as a mental health services researcher and to accomplish her research plan, she requires specific training in three areas: 1) clinical research methods (e.g., biostatistics, epidemiology, and mixed methods); 2) implementation research; and 3) mental health disparities research.  Dr. Mangurian has assembled a multidisciplinary team of mentors to facilitate her training and research. Her primary mentor is Dr. Dean Schillinger, a UCSF primary care internist with international expertise in primary care health services research, including implementation research in public health settings. He will oversee all training and research plans, providing his wealth of experience in this field, including his dedication to improving services for underserved populations. His expertise will be complemented by Dr. Martha Shumway, a UCSF mental health services researcher; and Dr. John Newcomer, a Washington University clinical investigator who is an expert in clinical and laboratory measurement of metabolic risk in severely mentally ill populations and in the translation of monitoring objectives into clinical practice.  People with severe mental illness die, on average, 25 years earlier than the general population, most often from cardiovascular disease. Metabolic abnormalities (e.g., diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia) resulting from antipsychotic medications used to treat this population can lead to increased rates of cardiovascular disease. Despite national guidelines emphasizing the importance of screening, metabolic screening rates for this population remain low. There is an urgent need for evidence-based, generalizable interventions that can be feasibly implemented to improve metabolic screening at community mental health clinics where this vulnerable population is primarily served. Therefore, in Aim 1, Dr. Mangurian proposes to characterize metabolic screening rates among adults with severe mental illness who receive services at community mental health clinics in San Francisco County. In Aim 2, she will tailor an intervention to improve metabolic screening for adults with severe mental illness by engaging multiple stakeholders and focusing on barriers that may impact high-risk racial/ethnic subpopulations. In Aim 3, she will conduct a pilot study of the intervention. The results of this research will contribute new information about implementation efforts to improve metabolic screening in community mental health clinics and will form the basis of an R01 application to study the effectiveness of this intervention.        The majority of people with severe mental illness are prescribed antipsychotic medications, many of which result in metabolic abnormalities (e.g., dyslipidemia, diabetes) and in turn increase cardiovascular risk. We will evaluate whether a pragmatic intervention - a mandatory annual metabolic screening visit by a psychiatrist, which is linked to a web-based electronic referral and clinical decision support tool - can be feasibly implemented at community mental health clinics to enhance early detection and treatment of metabolic disorders and thereby reduce the high prevalence of cardiovascular disease among people with severe mental illness.

"A Multi-channel Web Platform to Provide Holistic Care to Underserved Consumers     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Significant obstacles exist in care delivery that prevents meaningful utilization of mental health services by consumers who experience health disparities. Specifically, individuals facing isolation due to linguistic, literacy, or cultural bariers often face challenges in procuring mental health care. These challenges are in part due to the medical and mental systems' present lack of integration and failure to take into account the importance of social cohesion when delivering care. Addressing these gaps in the healthcare industry, the objective of this proposal is to create a dynamic communication platform that uses multi-channel message delivery to (i) provide culturally competent, language-concordant mental health content to consumers facing health disparities; (ii) empower providers to integrate medical and mental health care, both through shared message delivery and integration with electronic medical record (EMR) systems; and (iii) strengthen social cohesion by connecting isolated clients not only to physical and mental health message campaigns but also to community resources and peer supports critical to augmenting social well-being. The goal of Phase I is to create a series of depression and anxiety Messages and to assess whether they influence health knowledge and attitudinal change among mental health consumer participants and the suitability of the proposed technology for mental health and social service sectors. During Phase II, we will build the fully functional web-based communication platform, which will include a peer counseling function and integration with EMR systems. We will populate the integrated system with several hundred mental health and social support audio, text, and email messages in English, Spanish, and Mandarin. The project will culminate in two six-month summative evaluations with institutional and community service providers to assess the effectiveness of the proposed technology in increasing access to information about mental health and social supports, improving service and clinical outcomes, and enhancing quality of care and social cohesion for consumers who face disparities in access to mental health services.          Multi-channel communication platforms are a promising solution to the problem of uneven access to medical, mental, and social services experienced by those experiencing health disparities. The proposed project-the development of an integrated, web-based communication platform targeting mental health and social cohesion-will employ messaging including Interactive Voice Response (IVR), text, and email to (i) disseminate language-concordant, culturally competent messages; (ii) facilitate care integration between medical, mental health, and social service fields; and (iii) enrich social cohesion by connecting clients to providers between appointments, to community resources, and to peer supports. Providing such personalized, accessible care will ameliorate the present knowledge and access gaps among isolated and underserved communities and will improve health outcomes by connecting individuals to critical health services and community support networks.

"Addressing Social Determinants to Reduce Refugee Mental Health Disparities     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this study is to test an ecological/empowerment approach to reducing mental health disparities among socioeconomically disadvantaged Central African and Iraqi refugee adults by examining the effectiveness of a community-based advocacy, learning, and social support intervention (Refugee Well-being Project, RWP) that addresses social determinants of mental health and incorporates an evidence-based trauma treatment (Narrative Exposure Therapy, NET) for refugees with PTSD. The waitlist randomized controlled trial with 180 African and Iraqi refugee adults is innovative and significant because it will rigorously test the effectiveness of addressin social determinants of mental health (poverty, social and physical environments, access to services, marginalization) to reduce mental health disparities, as well as examine the impact of a community-based, mutual learning intervention on improving engagement and retention in evidence-based trauma-focused treatment for those who need it. The RWP intervention emphasizes a sustainable and replicable partnership model between refugee resettlement agencies and universities/colleges that involves refugee adults and undergraduate advocates working together to: a) increase refugees' abilities to navigate their new communities; b) improve refugees' access to community resources; c) enhance meaningful social roles by valuing refugees' culture, experiences, and knowledge; d) reduce refugees' social isolation; and e) increase communities' responsiveness to refugees. The RWP intervention is administered by university undergraduate students enrolled in a service learning course, and has two elements: 1) Learning Circles, which involve cultural exchange and one-on-one learning opportunities, and; 2) Advocacy, which involves collaborative efforts to mobilize community resources related to health, housing, employment, education, and legal issues. Pilot testing of RWP demonstrated feasibility, appropriateness, acceptability, and preliminary evidence that the intervention decreased Hmong, Central African, and Iraqi participants' psychological distress and increased protective factors. A mixed methods strategy with data collected from each participant at four time points over a period of 14 months will be used to test the effectiveness of the 6- month intervention to reduce psychological distress (PTSD, depression, and culturally-specific distress), increase protective factors (access to resources, English proficiency, environmental mastery, mental health service use, and social support), and engage and retain refugee adults with PTSD in an evidence-based trauma treatment (NET). Mechanisms of intervention effectiveness will be explored by testing mediating relationships between protective factors and psychological distress. Qualitative components of interviews with refugee participants and paired qualitative interviews with refugees and undergraduates will explore participants' experiences in the intervention, inform interpretation of quantitative data, and investigate unexpected impacts.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This study tests the effectiveness of an innovative, community-based advocacy, learning, and social support intervention (Refugee Well-being Project) to reduce the mental health disparities experienced by low-income refugee adults by addressing several well-defined social determinants of mental health and increasing refugees' engagement in trauma treatment, when warranted. This is important not only for the large number of refugees in the United States and worldwide, but also because the intervention model has the potential to alleviate the disproportionate psychological distress experienced by other immigrant and minority populations throughout the United States who experience inequities in social and material resources and disproportionate exposure to trauma and stress and who are less likely to access formal mental health services because of lack of trust and concerns about culturally appropriateness. The intervention model is low in cost to implement, replicable, sustainable, and non-stigmatizing.                ",Addressing Social Determinants to Reduce Refugee Mental Health Disparities,8700506,R01MD007712,"['adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Affect ', ' Communities ', ' Control Groups ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Discrimination (Psychology) ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Economics ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Elements ', ' Employment ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' healthcare service availability ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare access availability ', ' health services availability ', ' health care service availability ', ' health care service access ', ' health care availability ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Availability of Health Services ', ' Accessibility of health care ', ' Access to Healthcare ', ' Access to Health Care ', ' Access to Care ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' Housing ', ' Interview ', ' Learning ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene Services ', ' Mental Health Services ', ' Methods ', ' well-being ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' Poverty ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' QOL ', ' Quality of life ', ' Refugees ', ' Research ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' socioenvironment ', ' social context ', ' social climate ', ' Social Environment ', ' Social isolation ', ' social support network ', ' Social support ', ' Stress ', ' traumatic neurosis ', ' Posttraumatic Stress Disorders ', ' Posttraumatic Neuroses ', ' Post-Traumatic Neuroses ', ' PTSD ', ' Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' depressive ', ' depression symptom ', ' Emotional Depression ', ' depressive symptoms ', ' Mediating ', ' Advocacy ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' dosage ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' mental ', ' Psyche structure ', ' Distress ', ' Trust ', ' African ', ' Immigrant ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' Exposure to ', ' Knowledge ', ' Physical environment ', ' collegiate ', ' college ', ' Services ', ' experience ', ' stressor ', ' Participant ', ' empowerment ', ' Agreement ', ' social ', ' universal preventive measure ', ' universal preventive interventions ', ' universal interventions ', ' universal prevention ', ' psychological distress ', ' Modeling ', ' psychoeducation ', ' response ', ' stigma ', ' social stigma ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Legal ', ' Low income ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Advocate ', ' Data ', ' Effectiveness of Interventions ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Randomized ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' therapy outcome ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomic ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio economic ', ' socioeconomics ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' cost ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Minority ', ' cost-effective ', ' cost effective ', ' Population ', ' migration ', ' Trauma ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' clinical significance ', ' clinically significant ', ' public health relevance ', ' evidence base ', ' social health determinants ', ' undergraduate student ', ' ']",NIMHD,UNIVERSITY OF NEW MEXICO,R01,2014,372028,0.10264979305107906
"Emerging Regulatory Capacity in Low-income Mexican American Children     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The identification of early life precursors to psychopathology in a high risk population has considerable promise for efforts to mitigate the public health burden of mental disorders. Hispanic children, members of the fastest growing ethnic group in the US, are more than twice as likely as non-Hispanic white children to be raised in poverty, and considerable research documents deleterious effects of poverty and ethnic minority status on brain development, stress physiology, development of social and emotional regulatory capacity, and lifespan mental and physical health. To better understand developmental precursors to psychopathology in very low- income ethnic minority children, we propose to capitalize on data collected by an NIMH-funded longitudinal study of Mexican American mothers and infants (""Las Madres Nuevas"") that addressed maternal mental health and mother-infant coregulation across the first two postpartum years. The proposed project will focus on the children from Las Madres Nuevas as they approach a critical developmental transition period (ages 3-6). We will chart trajectories of cognitive, emotional, social, and behavioral competence, with the goal of early identification and predication of points at which elevated risk for disorder emerges. Our project will focus on the emergence of self-regulatory skills from early life mother-infant coregulation as a central mechanism by which early life risk factors translate into lifespan health outcomes for low-income children. The development of self- regulatory ability is a critical foundation for lifespan mental health, but Hispanic children and children from disadvantaged environments are at risk of impaired self-regulatory skills as they enter kindergarten. Our scientific approach emphasizes the cultural embeddedness of development, with the view that child outcomes must be examined with attention to cultural forces that shape and give meaning to self-regulation and mental health. We also address the role of early life biological susceptibility in shaping children's developing regulatory skills. In combination, this project holds great potential to address central questions about cultural, biological, and environmental contributions to adaptive regulatory capacity; identify early precursors to psychopathology in a high risk ethnic group; and enhance opportunities for translation to treatment and prevention.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Children raised in poverty face significantly elevated risk for developmental deficits, behavioral and emotional health problems, and poor lifespan mental and physical health. Ethnic minority status compounds the risk, but little is known about mechanisms of risk or cultural-contextual factors that may mitigate risk. A central goal of this project is to unravel developmental pathways that lead to positive or negative adaptation for minority children in a high risk context, information critical for identifying modifiable targets for intervention and prevention programs.              ",Emerging Regulatory Capacity in Low-income Mexican American Children,8750402,R01HD083027,"['Cultural Assimilation ', ' Acculturation ', ' Age ', ' Attention ', ' Behavior ', ' psychological disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Natural Products ', ' Biologic Factor ', ' Biological Factors ', ' Parturition ', ' Birth ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Brain ', ' white race ', ' Occidental ', ' Caucasoid ', ' Caucasian Race ', ' Caucasian ', ' Caucasoid Race ', ' Censuses ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Emotions ', ' Environment ', ' Ethnic group ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' Family ', ' Foundations ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Therapeutic Hydrocortisone ', ' Proctocort ', ' Pregn-4-ene-3,20-dione, 11,17,21-trihydroxy-, (11beta)- ', ' Nutracort ', ' Hytone ', ' Hydrocortone ', ' Eldecort ', ' Dermacort ', ' Cortril ', ' Cortispray ', ' Cortisol ', ' Cortenema ', ' Cortef ', ' Cort-Dome ', ' Cetacort ', ' Aeroseb-HC ', ' Hydrocortisone ', ' Immigrations ', ' In-Migration ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Income ', ' Infant ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' lifespan ', ' life span ', ' Length of Life ', ' Longevity ', ' long-term study ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Chicanos ', ' Chicanas ', ' Mexican Americans ', ' Mothers ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' NIMH ', ' National Institute of Mental Health (U.S.) ', ' Parents ', ' Physiology ', ' Poverty ', ' abnormal psychology ', ' Psychopathology ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Self Regulation ', ' Informal Social Control ', ' Social Development ', ' Socialization ', ' Stress ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' Translations ', ' Caucasians ', ' Parenting ', ' Parenting behavior ', ' adaptive behavior ', ' adaptation behavior ', ' Adaptive Behaviors ', ' Competence ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Hispanics ', ' Postpartum ', ' Postpartum Period ', ' Biological ', ' Link ', ' Evaluation ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Predisposition ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' Individual ', ' Funding ', ' Immigrant ', ' Shapes ', ' Filamentous Fungi ', ' Molds ', ' Life ', ' Pattern ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' expression of emotion ', ' emotional expression ', ' showing emotion ', ' physical health ', ' physical conditioning ', ' Application Context ', ' contextual factors ', ' experience ', ' parallel processing ', ' intervention program ', ' unborn ', ' prenatal ', ' skills ', ' Prevention program ', ' member ', ' disease risk ', ' disorder risk ', ' Prevention ', ' social ', ' Early identification ', ' Impulsivity ', ' Emotional ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' behavioral health ', ' kindergarten ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Low income ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Cognitive ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' Process ', ' Cardiac ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomic ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio economic ', ' socioeconomics ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' Minority ', ' resilience ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Impairment ', ' ethnic minority ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' high risk ', ' public health relevance ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' Research Domain Criteria ', ' ']",NICHD,ARIZONA STATE UNIVERSITY-TEMPE CAMPUS,R01,2014,615609,0.035446469903747814
"Regional Network for Mental Health Research in Latin America DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overriding objective of our Hub for Latin America (HLA) is to improve the condition of people with severe mental disorders in Latin America. We propose to do so by making a focused contribution to narrowing the ""mental health gap"". Our long-term goal is to improve health services for people with severe mental disorders until they are equivalent to the best health services offered to people with highly prioritized general health conditions. We envision an integrated system of primary care and secondary mental health services that we refer to as Community Health Care for individuals with Severe Mental Disorders (CHC-SMD). We adopt a multi-pronged approach that is tailored to the distinctive context of the urban areas of Latin America. Our goals for the 5-year grant period are to launch strategic initiatives that will generate significant progress toward CHC-SMD in this region, and to build a platform for ongoing progress over a longer time period.    The HLA brings together key researchers and stakeholders from six cities across Latin America (Santiago, Chile; Rio de Janeiro, Brazil; Buenos Aires, Cordoba, Neuquen, Argentina; Medellin, Colombia) with researchers in New York City in a concerted effort to make progress toward a shared vision of CHC-SMD. The Components are designed to be synergistic so that the impact of the whole HLA is greater than the sum of its parts. The Research Component, for example, proposes to pilot a regional randomized controlled trial (RCT). In order for the HLA to proceed as planned to conduct a full scale regional RCT, the Capacity Building Component will need to train leaders at the HLA sites to conduct RCTs and coordinate regional studies. At the same time, the pilot RCT will help generate this capacity by providing practical experience in RCTs and regional studies.    Our overall specific aims are (a) to deploy and evaluate task shifting approaches that can accelerate progress toward CHC-SMD; (b) to train young leaders with the capacities required to generate ongoing progress toward CHC-SMD; and (c) to bring together multiple stakeholders to contribute to implementing and shaping CHC-SMD.

"Implementation of a Measurement Feedback System in School Mental Health     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This Mentored Career Development Award (K08) is designed to provide intensive training in developing a strong program of research that investigates the adaptation and implementation of health information technologies within the school context to increase the availability of high-quality mental health interventions for underserved youth and families. A field of implementation science has recently emerged to address the significant gap between the proliferation of evidence-based practices (EBP) for treating youth mental health problems and their use in usual care treatment settings. Nowhere is this gap more apparent than in schools. Schools provide the bulk of youth mental health services (>70%) and effectively reduce service access disparities by ethnicity and socioeconomic status. Nevertheless, implementation research focused on the school context has been disproportionately limited. To address these gaps and advance implementation science, the candidate's long term career objective is to develop effective methods for promoting the use of EBP among mental health providers in educational settings. Standardized assessment (SA) of psychiatric symptoms is a cornerstone of all EBP and has been significantly associated with improvements in treatment- related outcome. Nevertheless, SA is infrequently utilized by school-based providers, resulting in sub-optimal care. Measurement feedback systems (MFS) use the results of SA to deliver information to clinicians about client progress, represent a structured way to introduce SA into service systems, and have the potential to support effective, client-centered care. The candidate's immediate focus is therefore to increase clinicians' administration of SA tools and incorporation of SA feedback into routine practice through the development of a MFS and an accompanying contextualized adaptation process that are designed specifically for schools.  The current K08 Award will uniquely position the candidate to advance this research agenda. His background includes specialized training in child clinical psychology, evidence-based assessment and intervention approaches, research on school-based mental health, mental health services research, and collaboration with community stakeholders. To more effectively bridge the gap between typical and optimal mental health care in schools, he seeks to extend his training to include: (1) design of healthcare technologies that are user-friendly and contextually appropriate, (2) experience with theory and methods to support innovation uptake/implementation in schools, (3) advanced statistics and research methodology, and (4) advanced academic writing. The University of Washington is an outstanding environment in which to engage in the interdisciplinary training required to achieve these training goals. The candidate's primary mentors-Drs. Elizabeth McCauley and Jurgen Unutzer have combined expertise in the assessment and treatment of adolescent psychopathology, training with school-based providers, development of computer products to support evidence-based service delivery, implementation science, and the development and dissemination of measurement feedback tools for client progress monitoring. Additional local and national consultants will contribute expertise in implementation research for youth/family services, user-centered design, school-based mental health, community service provision, decision support tools for youth treatment providers, cultural diversity and mental health care, mental health policy, and qualitative and mixed methods research.  The proposed project draws on the training and expertise above to develop and evaluate a contextually- adapted, web-based MFS for use in school-based health centers (SBHCs) through a series of qualitative, quantitative, and mixed methods research aims. The University of Washington Care Management Tracking System is a MFS, developed by Dr. Unutzer, previously found to result in improved care, symptom reductions, and increased functioning among patients. The current study proposes to use SBHC clinician focus groups and direct clinician feedback to adapt this MFS for use by SBHC clinicians. The candidate's prior research has revealed that SBHC providers infrequently utilize SA measures, but supports the feasibility of using structured, computerized methods to increase SA administration. A sample of SBHC clinicians (n = 20) and youth (n = 64, Aim 3) will participate in the project to advance the following Research Aims: (1) evaluate the SBHC context to inform MFS adaptation; (2) assess the adaptation's effectiveness in context; (3) evaluate the system impact on clinician behavior and youth outcomes; and (4) assess the added utility of providing academic data to school clinicians for use in progress monitoring. SBHC clinicians will provide feedback on the optimal design of the MFS and use it to track outcomes among youth experiencing depression and anxiety. Aims 1 and 2 will be evaluated descriptively, using existing benchmarks when applicable. Aim 3 will be tested experimentally via a small-scale randomized trial in which clinicians (and a subset of their caseloads) will be randomized to one of two conditions: (a) use of the school MFS to monitor progress using SA or (b) assessment as usual. Aim 4 will be tested using the MFS, with randomization of youth to two conditions: (a) clinicians receive the results of SA and students' school attendance data from the MFS or (b) data include SA results only. Based on the results of this work, a R01 grant application will be submitted to investigate the larger-scale implementation of the school MFS and contextualized adaptation process among a range of school service delivery models, allowing for more thorough evaluation of its impact on clinician behavior and student functioning.          Evidence-based mental health services are infrequently provided by school-based clinicians, resulting in sub- optimal outcomes for the ""safety net"" populations most likely to receive care in that setting (i.e., low- socioeconomic status, ethnic minority youth). By identifying innovative health technologies that systematically support the implementation of evidence-based practices and adapting them for use in schools, the proposed research and training carries considerable potential to enhance the availability of high-quality care for underserved youth, thereby more effectively alleviating symptoms and promoting functioning across domains.

"Addressing Mental Health Disparities in Refugee ChildrenL A CBPR Collaboration     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In the US, refugee children and families face dramatic disparities in the incidence and treatment of mental health disorders. Resettlement stressors (poverty, limited access to care) and acculturative challenges (differences in cultural norms, discrimination) often exacerbate risks due to war-related trauma exposure. Commonly, refugee mental health services are limited-usually with a narrow focus on clinical treatment of PTSD-and rarely respond to the holistic needs of refugee communities; few interventions are designed to be used across cultures and refugee groups, despite rapidly evolving refugee demographics in the US. The cross-cultural application of community-based participatory research (CBPR) methods can increase understanding of risk and protective factors in refugee communities and contribute to development of flexible mental health interventions to address disparities. This CBPR project builds on an existing collaborative research relationships with the Somali Bantu refugee community in Greater Boston. Preliminary research has identified numerous cultural and community strengths as well as ongoing problems of family conflict, poor parent-child communication which interact with ongoing stressors to increase risks for child emotional and behavioral problems. Family-based intervention models adapted via local input and delivered by trained members of the community hold great promise for use among these and other refugee groups in the US. This study will use CBPR mixed methods (qualitative and quantitative data collection) to conduct needs assessments and design and evaluate a core family-based intervention. Project activities will emphasize capacity building in two refugee communities resettled in Greater Boston-the Somali Bantu and the Bhutanese-actively engaging refugee community members, community advisory boards, services providers, and other stakeholders. Specific Aims are to: (1) deepen partnerships with the Somali Bantu and Bhutanese communities through co-leadership, capacity-building, and knowledge sharing; (2) collect and apply qualitative data to (a) prepare a needs assessment of mental health in children and adolescents, barriers to care, and services preferences with each target refugee group; (b) develop mental health/psychosocial assessments for refugee caregivers and children; (c) adapt the core components of a family-based strengthening intervention for use with refugees; and (3) conduct an 80-family pilot study to examine acceptability and sustainability of the intervention. Key outcomes will be improvements in caregiver-child relationships, mental health services access, increased functioning, and reduced mental health symptoms in children and adolescents.         RELEVANCE (See instructions): The proposed study will employ cross-cultural CBPR methods to develop a family-based intervention grounded in needs assessments on contributors to mental health disparities among refugee children and families. The mixed methods research approach to selecting, adapting and implementing culturally-informed assessments and intervention models has the potential to contribute to feasible, acceptable and sustainable intervention models of mental health services for diverse groups of refugee children and families.                  ",Addressing Mental Health Disparities in Refugee ChildrenL A CBPR

"Disparities in Acute Psychiatric Care: System, Community & Economic Determinants     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Acute psychiatric services--the emergency and inpatient services charged with responding to individuals and communities at times of psychiatric crisis--play important, but poorly understood, roles in community mental health systems. Emergency and inpatient psychiatric service use imposes high personal costs on service users and high financial costs on service systems. While evidence on acute psychiatric care is limited, there is compelling evidence of racial/ethnic differences and disparities in utilization. Available descriptive data on racial/ethnic differences and disparities does not provide explanations that can inform programmatic or policy changes to improve services and eliminate disparities. It is increasingly clear that a full understanding of racial/ethnic disparites in acute psychiatric service use necessitates moving beyond descriptive study of individual service users to consider the ways in which mental health system and community characteristics influence disparities. By explicitly examining system and community characteristics, we can begin to explain and address differences and disparities by identifying contexts and conditions that both increase and decrease them. The proposed project examines disparities in acute psychiatric service using a framework that considers race/ethnicity in the context of service system and community characteristics over time. Client-level Medicaid mental health claims data on over one million adults served in California's diverse county-operated community mental health systems since 2005 will be used to address three aims. First, quantitative methods will be used to test the hypotheses that there are racial/ethnic disparities in utilization of acute and outpatient psychiatric, but that outpatient service use is associated with reductions in acute service use disparities. Second, quantitative methods will be used to test the hypotheses that county-level investments in mental health services are associated with acute service use disparities and that economic downturns are associated with increases in disparities. Third, a mixed methods approach to county-specific analysis will characterize service strategies that reduce racial/ethnic disparities in acute psychiatric service use.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Racial/ethnic differences have been consistently documented in utilization of costly acute psychiatric services. Using extensive data on California's county-operated community mental health systems, the proposed research will move beyond documentation of racial/ethnic differences to explain racial/ethnic disparities in acute service utilization and inform programmatic and policy interventions to eliminate disparities.                ","Disparities in Acute Psychiatric Care: System, Community & Economic Determinants",8771376,R01MD007669,"['Accounting ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Affect ', ' Asian Americans ', ' Budgets ', ' California ', ' Charge ', ' Client ', ' Communities ', ' Financial cost ', ' Economics ', ' Emergencies ', ' Emergency Situation ', ' emergency service ', ' Emergency medical service ', ' ethical ', ' Ethics ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Expenditure ', ' Future ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Income ', ' Inpatients ', ' Investments ', ' Medicaid ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene Services ', ' Mental Health Services ', ' Methods ', ' Out-patients ', ' Outpatients ', ' Play ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Research ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Running ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' unemployed ', ' out of work ', ' joblessness ', ' jobless ', ' Unemployment ', ' County ', ' Relative ', ' Relative (related person) ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' Case Management ', ' Latino ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' diverse populations ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' Caring ', ' racial/ethnic difference ', ' improved ', ' psychiatric treatment ', ' psychiatric therapy ', ' psychiatric care ', ' Psychiatric therapeutic procedure ', ' Acute ', ' Individual ', ' Policies ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Collaborations ', ' Native Americans ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' Application Context ', ' contextual factors ', ' Services ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' theories ', ' case control ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Documentation ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Address ', ' Health system ', ' Data ', ' Characteristics ', ' cost ', ' inpatient service ', ' care systems ', ' underserved people ', ' under served population ', ' Underserved Population ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Minority ', ' aged ', ' racial/ethnic ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' service utilization ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' public health relevance ', ' ']",NIMHD,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R01,2014,338541,0.055400811448777204
"Multiple-Impact Effectiveness of a State Supported Employment Policy Initiative    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose an observational study to examine a broad range of impacts produced by a state policy initiative that increased accessibility and availability of the evidence-based individual placement and support (IPS) model of supported-employment (SE) services for persons with severe mental illness (SMI) in Maryland. We will study the experience of Maryland's public mental health system (PMHS) in facilitating the diffusion of IPS-SE services in the state. Our research exploits inter-temporal and geographic variations in accessibility and availability of IPS-SE services 1) over time in the period 2002-2010 and 2) across geographic areas of Maryland. We also examine variations across providers in fidelity to the IPS-SE model. We propose to study the observed effectiveness of this state policy initiative in its actual operation and impact. This study will extend evaluative research on IPS-SE beyond the current focus on efficacy/effectiveness in small-scale RCT trials of a limited number of sites. We also propose to combine data from multiple public sector databases to expand the range of SE impacts studied, beyond the current research focus on employment outcomes, to include impacts on mental health status, and on mental health and somatic health treatment costs.  The policy initiative that promoted the implementation and diffusion of IPS-SE services, undertaken by the Maryland Mental Hygiene Administration (MHA), began as a pilot project in 2002. MHA provided funding for training service providers and for monitoring providers for fidelity with the IPS-SE model. Beginning in 2006, financial incentives were given to providers for offering IPS-SE services, and for meeting fidelity benchmarks.  This MHA initiative increased accessibility and availability of IPS-SE services for persons with SMI, with major increases, occurring in the period from 2004 to 2010, that also varied by geographic area. We plan to use data on individuals with SMI from several large, defined cohorts 1) of Maryland Medicaid recipients and 2) of other non-Medicaid-covered users of PMHS services, followed over the 2002-2010 period. Using these data, we will assess the impacts of the MHA policy initiative on (1) the take-up rate of IPS-SE services, (2) disparities by race and ethnicity in the rate of IPS-SE service use, (3) the mental health status of IPS-SE users relative to non-users, (4) costs of treatment for mental health specialty services and other health services for users vs. non-users of IPS-SE services, and (5) employment and earnings of users vs. non-users of IPS-SE services. We also will examine the impact of varying IPS-SE provider fidelity levels on these outcomes.  A variety of regression analysis methods are proposed for estimating these policy impacts, including instrumental variables-generalized method of moments (IV-GMM) procedures, reduced-form regression models, models based on pooling of data on individuals over time, and analyses based on sequences of cross- sectional regressions. We propose IV-GMM methods to account for unobservable factors influencing selection into use of IPS-SE services, as well as tests for our assumption of endogeneity of the indicator of IPS-SE use.        This proposal addresses one the focus areas Healthy People 2010 that is proposed to be retained for Health People 2020: Increase the proportion of persons with serious mental illness (SMI) who are employed. The research will examine the effectiveness of a state-wide initiative to increase the provision of evidence-based supported employment services for those with SMI in the state of Maryland. We assess the initiative's impact on multiple outcomes including supported employment service receipt, race and ethnic disparities in service receipt, employment, earnings, mental health treatment costs, somatic treatment costs, mental health status.

"Regional Network for Mental Health Research in Latin America DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overriding objective of our Hub for Latin America (HLA) is to improve the condition of people with severe mental disorders in Latin America. We propose to do so by making a focused contribution to narrowing the ""mental health gap"". Our long-term goal is to improve health services for people with severe mental disorders until they are equivalent to the best health services offered to people with highly prioritized general health conditions. We envision an integrated system of primary care and secondary mental health services that we refer to as Community Health Care for individuals with Severe Mental Disorders (CHC-SMD). We adopt a multi-pronged approach that is tailored to the distinctive context of the urban areas of Latin America. Our goals for the 5-year grant period are to launch strategic initiatives that will generate significant progress toward CHC-SMD in this region, and to build a platform for ongoing progress over a longer time period.    The HLA brings together key researchers and stakeholders from six cities across Latin America (Santiago, Chile; Rio de Janeiro, Brazil; Buenos Aires, Cordoba, Neuquen, Argentina; Medellin, Colombia) with researchers in New York City in a concerted effort to make progress toward a shared vision of CHC-SMD. The Components are designed to be synergistic so that the impact of the whole HLA is greater than the sum of its parts. The Research Component, for example, proposes to pilot a regional randomized controlled trial (RCT). In order for the HLA to proceed as planned to conduct a full scale regional RCT, the Capacity Building Component will need to train leaders at the HLA sites to conduct RCTs and coordinate regional studies. At the same time, the pilot RCT will help generate this capacity by providing practical experience in RCTs and regional studies.    Our overall specific aims are (a) to deploy and evaluate task shifting approaches that can accelerate progress toward CHC-SMD; (b) to train young leaders with the capacities required to generate ongoing progress toward CHC-SMD; and (c) to bring together multiple stakeholders to contribute to implementing and shaping CHC-SMD. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Within Latin American cities people with severe mental disorders are a vulnerable population whose lives are often characterized by extreme poverty, social exclusion from education, employment, and participation in civil society, multiple traumas including violence and abuse, reduced access to health care and high mortality rates. Equitable development, as endorsed by international conventions, requires the inclusion of this vulnerable population in the benefits of development and the protection of their civil and human rights. The overriding objective of our Hub for Latin America (HLA) is to improve the condition of this vulnerable group through an integrated system of primary care and secondary mental health services tailored to the distinctive context of the urban areas of Latin America.",Regional Network for Mental Health Research in Latin America,8789470,U19MH095718,"['Argentina ', ' Brazil ', ' Chile ', ' Cities ', ' Civil Rights ', ' Colombia ', ' Communities ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Complement ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Employment ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' health care service ', ' Health Services ', ' healthcare service availability ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare access availability ', ' health services availability ', ' health care service availability ', ' health care service access ', ' health care availability ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Availability of Health Services ', ' Accessibility of health care ', ' Access to Healthcare ', ' Access to Health Care ', ' Access to Care ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' Human Rights ', ' Latin America ', ' Leadership ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene Services ', ' Mental Health Services ', ' Mortality ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Multiple Wounds ', ' Multiple Injuries ', ' Multiple Trauma ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' New York City ', ' Poverty ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Primary Care ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Psychiatry ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Strikes ', ' Employee Strikes ', ' Time ', ' Universities ', ' violent behavior ', ' violent ', ' Violence ', ' visual function ', ' Sight ', ' Vision ', ' Community Health Care ', ' Community Healthcare ', ' urban area ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' Shapes ', ' programs ', ' Adopted ', ' Complex ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' Country ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' Exclusion ', ' social inequality ', ' social ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' Institution ', ' International ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Sum ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' severe mental disorder ', ' serious mental illness ', ' serious mental disorder ', ' persistent mental illness ', ' chronic mental illness ', ' severe mental illness ', ' public health relevance ', ' civil society ', ' ']",NIMH,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,U19,2014,194525,0.05596283974428328
"Mental Health Impact and Service Use Among Asian Survivors and Rescuers Exposed      DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The impact of the World Trade Center (WTC) attack on those directly exposed to it is long-lasting and affects their day-to-day living. Due to the proximity of Chinatown to the disaster site and a large number of South Asians working in the WTC and nearby buildings, Asian Americans (AA) constituted a sizeable proportion of those exposed to the attack. The trauma has created major challenges for mental health professionals. While dozens of studies have investigated the mental health impact of the attack on the survivors, few have included Asians in their study samples. Objectives: this investigation targets the Asian community and attempts to assess the mental health impact of the trauma to individuals directly exposed to the attack, and to understand their mental health service use patterns so as to more effective in reaching out to them. The literature has indicated that due to cultural impact AA tend to emphasize the somatic expression of emotional distress, attribute immense stigma to mental illness itself and to mental health service use. As a result, delay in treatment and the use of medical care to address physical symptoms of emotional distress is common. Since 71% of AA in New York City are immigrants, language barriers, lack of knowledge about services, and the paucity of bilingual services also created practical barriers to service use. Acculturation stress and the prolonged economic setbacks around Chinatown following the attack also aggravated the stress they experienced. PTSD resulting from recent trauma has hardly been studied among AA. The WTC attack offers a unique test case to understand the impact of PTSD among AA, to see if the widely recognized disaster had ameliorating effect on help-seeking, and if 9/11-designated programs succeeded in reaching out to AA. Design & Methods: to address the knowledge gap, secondary data analyses will be conducted using the large study of WTC Health Registry focusing on survivors and rescuers of the attack. The Registry has 3 waves of data with a large Asian sample of 4,885. The longitudinal study spanning over 9 years also extends the horizon of existing studies. Mental health impact and mental health and medical care service use among AA will be studied and compared against the Whites as a reference group. Subsample analyses of the rescue and recovery workers and Chinese Americans would also be done to provide an occupational focus and to examine the largest Asian ethnic group. Specific aims of the study are: 1)To assess the short-, medium-, and long-term mental health impact of the WTC attack on AA, its course and related risk factors, and to compare to those of the Whites; 2) To examine patterns of mental health service use and identify the enabling factors vs. barriers affecting service use among AA, and compare them with these factors among Whites, to better understand racial disparities; 3)To examine the relationship between psychological distress and medical care use among AA and Whites, and the impact of comorbidity of psychological and physical distress on their use of medical care service, to illuminate processes underlying racial disparities.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This study attempts to assess the short-, medium-, and long-term mental health impact of Post Traumatic Syndrome Disorder and its risk factors among Asian Americans after the World Trade Center attack, and compare the pattern to that of the Whites. It also examines Asians' mental health service use patterns and the facilitating factors and barriers to help seeking. This study has important policy implications for improving treatment to this sizeable but understudied subgroup affected by the attack, so that more effective effort could be developed to reach out to this group which has a history of being the lowest mental health service users compared to other races.            ",Mental Health Impact and Service Use Among Asian Survivors and Rescuers Exposed ,8777678,U01OH010516,[''],NIOSH,FORDHAM UNIVERSITY,U01,2014,315338,0.03002712122831701
"Addressing Health Disparities among Transgender Women     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Rachel L. Kaplan, PhD, MPH is a public health researcher at the Center for Research and Education on Gender and Sexuality at San Francisco State University and a postdoctoral scholar at University of California, Berkeley's Mack Center on Mental Health and Social Conflict. Dr. Kaplan's long-term career objective is to become an independent researcher specializing in the development and implementation of sexual and mental health promoting interventions among sexual minority populations in international settings. The proposed training, mentorship, and research plan support this goal and will provide her with the theoretical and practical skills necessary to become an independent intervention researcher. Although transgender women are among the most-at-risk populations for contracting HIV, few studies have been conducted to determine the most feasible and acceptable ways to impact risk. Further, knowledge of sexual and mental health among transgender women has been derived mostly from the United States. There is an urgent need for culturally relevant interventions for this marginalized population in poorly-resourced, high-stigma settings. The proposed study will address these gaps by: (1) exploring the psycho-social and cultural factors that form the context in which transgender women's sexual and mental health are situated; (2) determining how to impact transgender women's sexual and mental health through adaptation of a prevention intervention; and (3) assessing the feasibility and accessibility of the prevention intervention through pilot testing among transgender women in Lebanon. It is expected that this research will reveal prevention needs and strategies specific to transgender women in the Middle East and provide unique and powerful results to inform efficacy testing in future larger- scale trials in international settings.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This study is important to public health because it will provide critical information about how to access and engage high-risk and highly stigmatized sexual minority populations such as transgender women. Because rates of HIV transmission and mental health problems are high among transwomen, it is crucial to examine this population's sexual and mental health. Transwomen are typically marginalized; they experience high rates of gender-related abuse, unstable housing, depression, and HIV risk behavior including the engagement in sex work for income. As public health researchers, we have only begun to understand which components of existing interventions might be efficacious for risk reduction and health promotion among transwomen in the U.S. This study will investigate the cultural acceptability and feasibility of an adapted HIV prevention intervention that was originally developed for use among transwomen in the U.S. A better understanding of culturally acceptable and feasible strategies for addressing sexual and mental health among transwomen in Lebanon will aid the development and adaptation of health-promoting approaches in other international settings.                ",Addressing Health Disparities among Transgender Women,8659990,K01MH102142,"['Affect ', ' North Africa ', ' Maghreb ', ' French-Speaking Africa ', ' Northern Africa ', ' California ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' CDC ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' Communities ', ' Conflict ', ' Conflict (Psychology) ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Discrimination (Psychology) ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Epidemic ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' Health Promotion ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' Incidence ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Income ', ' Lebanon ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mentorship ', ' Middle East ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' San Francisco ', ' Sexuality ', ' Social Sciences ', ' social support network ', ' Social support ', ' Testing ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' violent behavior ', ' violent ', ' Violence ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Gender ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' HIV/AIDS prevention ', ' HIV Prevention ', ' AIDS/HIV prevention ', ' AIDS prevention ', ' base ', ' career ', ' Area ', ' Training ', ' Populations at Risk ', ' Staging ', ' Contracting Opportunities ', ' Contracts ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Application Context ', ' contextual factors ', ' transsexual ', ' transgender ', ' experience ', ' skills ', ' Prevention ', ' social ', ' HIV/AIDS problem ', ' HIV/AIDS ', ' AIDS/HIV ', ' AIDS/HIV problem ', ' HIV risk ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' stigma ', ' social stigma ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Risk Reduction ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Address ', ' Sexual Health ', ' Data ', ' PhD ', ' Ph.D. ', ' Doctor of Philosophy ', ' International ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' Research Career Program ', ' K-Awards ', ' Career Development Programs K-Series ', ' Career Development Awards and Programs ', ' Career Development Awards ', ' K-Series Research Career Programs ', ' Funding Mechanisms ', ' Low Prevalence ', ' Transmission ', ' transmission process ', ' sex ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' unstably housed ', ' unstable housing ', ' instably housed ', ' housing instability ', ' resilience ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' Evidence based intervention ', ' treatment development ', ' intervention development ', ' develop therapy ', ' therapy development ', ' high risk ', ' public health relevance ', ' successful intervention ', ' efficacy testing ', ' sexual minority ', ' ']",NIMH,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",K01,2014,182674,0.047340309351373545
"Preventing & Treating HIV Comorbidities in India: Multi-tiered Strategy for Women     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall objective of this project is to demonstrate that a low cost, cell phone-delivered intervention is a promising, feasible and acceptable way to improve the prevention and treatment outcomes of women in India who are affected by HIV and inter-related mental health and psychosocial risk factors. Over the past decade there have been dramatic improvements in HIV prevention and access to life-saving antiretroviral therapy (ART). Yet, deficits in adherence to the spectrum of HIV care pose significant barriers to success. Women are at a particular disadvantage. Gender inequality, physical and situational factors place many women at increased risk for HIV acquisition and poor mental health and interrelated psychosocial co-factors (depression, gender-discrimination, violence, lack of social support, etc.) that are well established correlates of poor adherence and retention in HIV care. Few adherence interventions have focused on women in India outside of short-term prevention in PMTCT programs. Recent studies have shown alarmingly high rates of loss to follow-up for these women, particularly in the transition after delivery, between PMTCT and lifelong HIV care services. To address this gap, a collaborative partnership between the National Institute of Mental Health and Neuro Sciences (NIMHANS) and Yale University will leverage the complementary expertise of a uniquely well qualified, multidisciplinary team of Indian and U.S. of clinical investigators, stakeholders and resources. Our preliminary work indicates that a theory-guided adherence phone intervention that can be easily integrated and sustained as a component of routine ART Centre services is well suited for the target population, but it needs to be adapted to the sociocultural context. Following initial formative work to refine the interventio for delivery in India, we will train clinic nurses to deliver the intervention, and then evaluate te feasibility, fidelity and preliminary efficacy of the novel application of the intervention in a randomized trial. After baseline assessment, women (n=120) will be randomly assigned to treatment as usual (TAU) or TAU plus the phone intervention (delivered over 16 weeks) and outcomes (e.g., depressive symptoms, adherence) will be evaluated at 6, 14, 24, 36 weeks post-randomization. If the promising mobile phone intervention developed and pilot tested in this project shows promise in this Phase 1 study as we expect, the efficacy and cost of the intervention will then be evaluated in a large scale, multi-site study. If successful, an extremely practical approach will be available to improve the prevention and treatment outcomes of women with HIV and co-morbid mental health problems in India.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project is directly responsive to RFA-AI-12-033 ""U.S. - India Bilateral Collaborative Research Partnerships (CRP) on the Prevention of HIV/AIDS and Co-morbidities (R21)"" A collaborative partnership between the National Institute of Mental Health and Neuro Sciences (NIMHANS) and Yale University will address an understudied problem of importance to U.S., Indian and global health priorities.

"Building Community Capacity for Disability Prevention for Minority Elders     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Although minority elders represent the fastest growing segment of an aging US population, they have less access to mental health care and prevention of disability, lagging well behind non-Latino whites, and suffering significant disparities. Blacks and Latinos have the greatest risk for disability, with striking disparities in healthy aging. This includes elderly immigrants who exhibit elevated depressive and anxiety symptoms, and higher rates of disability than the native-born population; yet, they often go undiagnosed or underdiagnosed. This is a missed opportunity given that mood disorder treatment has been shown to reduce disability days and that several risk factors for disability, such as functional mobility are modifiable. Research suggests that a contributing factor may be an insufficient supply of professional providers and the inability of evidence based treatments to reach and be acceptable to minority elders. An IOM committee recently reported that the severe workforce shortages in providing mental health care to elder adults required novel approaches to resolve. To address these disparities and prevent disability among minority elders, the proposed R01 examines how to successfully build collaborative research for the provision of evidence-based mental health and disability prevention treatments in community-based settings. Promising results in a few international studies show improved access and quality of mental health outcomes and reduced disability when interventions are delivered by Community Health Workers. Yet limited and inconsistent evidence of the efficacy of CHW-led interventions in the US context remains. While the number of community-based health interventions has grown exponentially to address these service disparities, there is a lack of systematic assessment of whether they lead to increased community capacity and systems change, and whether they improve the quality of care and potentially decrease disability. Our proposed study endeavors to address this limitation. As such, the proposed R01 will be one of few efforts that simultaneously study the three components necessary for a successful intervention: efficacy, since the intervention must work, acceptability among clients, and feasibility and sustainability within the organization. It seeks to understand the role of the partnerships in increasing community capacity for a combined mental health and disability prevention intervention, and evaluating the acceptability, efficacy, feasibility and sustainability of the intervention delivere by CHWs and exercise trainers to Latino, African American and Asian elders with moderate to severe mood symptoms and at risk of disability.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The rapid expansion of the aging population is outstripping the development of mental health and disability prevention services necessary to respond to their needs. The proposed revised R01 aims to evaluate whether partnerships between academic researchers, minority elders, and the community-based organizations which serve them can expand community resources and capabilities to effectively provide mental health services and reduce the risk of disability in minority elders.            ",Building Community Capacity for Disability Prevention for Minority Elders,8761686,R01AG046149,"['functional capacity ', ' functional ability ', ' daily living functionality ', ' Activities of everyday life ', ' Activities of Daily Living ', ' Adoption ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Affect ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Elderly ', ' Aging ', ' Anxiety ', ' psychological disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Client ', ' Communities ', ' Environment ', ' Physical Exercise ', ' Exercise ', ' Exhibits ', ' Health ', ' Language ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene Services ', ' Mental Health Services ', ' Moods ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Patients ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Support ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Strikes ', ' Employee Strikes ', ' Testing ', ' Work ', ' oriental ', ' Asians ', ' Native People ', ' Indigenous Population ', ' Native-Born ', ' generic ', ' Nonproprietary Drugs ', ' Generic Drugs ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' depressive ', ' depression symptom ', ' Emotional Depression ', ' depressive symptoms ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Latino ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Acute ', ' Chronic ', ' prematurity ', ' premature ', ' Training ', ' mental ', ' Psyche structure ', ' disability ', ' using substances ', ' substance use ', ' AOD use ', ' Alcohol or Other Drugs use ', ' Relative Risks ', ' Immigrant ', ' sadness ', ' depressed ', ' Depressed mood ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Adopted ', ' Clinic ', ' Source ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' Country ', ' Organ System ', ' body system ', ' Affective Disorders ', ' Mood Disorders ', ' meetings ', ' Services ', ' prevention service ', ' Prevention ', ' personnel ', ' Manpower ', ' Human Resources ', ' Reporting ', ' Emotional ', ' Modeling ', ' QOC ', ' Quality of Care ', ' stigma ', ' social stigma ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Provider ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Low income ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Improve Access ', ' International ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' Community Health ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Evidence based treatment ', ' years of life lost to disease ', ' years of life lost to disability ', ' disease burden ', ' burden of disease ', ' burden of illness ', ' Minority ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel approaches ', ' new approaches ', ' novel strategies ', ' therapy efficacy ', ' therapeutically effective ', ' therapeutic efficacy ', ' intervention efficacy ', ' Treatment Efficacy ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Evidence based intervention ', ' population aging ', ' aging population ', ' healthy aging ', ' public health relevance ', ' community setting ', ' evidence base ', ' successful intervention ', ' efficacy testing ', ' ']",NIA,CAMBRIDGE HEALTH ALLIANCE,R01,2014,737857,0.032416395899690656
"Organizational Capacity to Eliminate Outcome Disparities under Healthcare Reform     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The substance abuse treatment field faces an unprecedented challenge to reduce health disparities among racial and ethnic minority populations. Access to integrated substance abuse, mental health, and HIV prevention care is associated with positive health outcomes and reduced cost. The overall goal of the proposed study is to identify how changes precipitated by the Affordable Care Act (ACA) impact community- based outpatient substance abuse treatment (OSAT) program capacity to expand service delivery in racial and ethnic minority communities and eliminate outcome disparities among African American and Latino clients. The objective for this application is to examine the organizational impact of the current expansion of Medicaid on the capacity of community-based OSAT programs to enhance treatment access and retention among minorities residing in Los Angeles County (L.A.), California by developing and analyzing a panel dataset. Our conceptual framework, grounded in organizational development frameworks investigates the role of organizational capacity (i.e., leadership, readiness for change, Medi-Cal billing) in mediating the effect of Medicaid expansion (referred as Medi-Cal in California) on service delivery (i.e., mental health and HIV prevention services) and on treatment access and retention among African American and Latino clients. In Aim 1 and 2 we will examine baseline data to refine our conceptual model of organizational capacity factors likely to impact the delivery of mental health and HIV prevention services in OSAT programs in racial and ethnic minority communities, prior to ACA enactment. We will resurvey in 2013, 2015 and 2017 the same representative sample of 147 OSAT programs located in minority communities to form a panel data set. These repeated measures of program data will be concatenated with administrative client outcome data (N~10,800 clients) at each data point to examine in Aims 3 and 4 the longitudinal impact of insurance expansion on service delivery in minority communities and rates of access and retention among African American and Latino clients with mental health and HIV risk conditions. The overall public health impact of the proposed study includes identifying promising organizational factors among publicly funded community-based OSAT programs that serve large proportions of low-income minority clients that play a mediating role between the ACA insurance expansion and client-centered process outcomes with the goal of eliminating health disparities.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This study will identify how changes precipitated by the Affordable Care Act impact community-based outpatient substance abuse treatment program capacity to expand accessibility to mental health and HIV prevention care in racial and ethnic minority communities in Los Angeles County, California. As such, the public health relevance of this project relies on providing critical information for state insurance administrators, policy makers and community-based providers who seek to develop evidence-informed policies and practices to respond to health care reform and parity legislation and eliminate health disparities.           ",Organizational Capacity to Eliminate Outcome Disparities under Healthcare Reform,8650816,R21DA035634,"['California ', ' Client ', ' Communities ', ' Economics ', ' Elements ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' inducement ', ' Incentives ', ' Insurance ', ' Leadership ', ' Legislation ', ' Statutes and Laws ', ' Los Angeles ', ' Medicaid ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Out-patients ', ' Outpatients ', ' parity ', ' Play ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Research ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Testing ', ' County ', ' Measures ', ' Administrator ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Latino ', ' Mediating ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' HIV/AIDS prevention ', ' HIV Prevention ', ' AIDS/HIV prevention ', ' AIDS prevention ', ' Caring ', ' Organizational Models ', ' base ', ' Phase ', ' Healthcare Reform ', ' Health Care Reform ', ' Policy Maker ', ' Policies ', ' Funding ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Nature ', ' programs ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' Services ', ' Performance ', ' prevention service ', ' treatment program ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' substance abuse ', ' abuse of substances ', ' Substance abuse problem ', ' HIV risk ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' QOC ', ' Quality of Care ', ' response ', ' theories ', ' Provider ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Preparedness ', ' Readiness ', ' Low income ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Improve Access ', ' Subgroup ', ' underserved minority ', ' under-represented minority ', ' Underrepresented Populations ', ' Underrepresented Groups ', ' Underrepresented Minority ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' substance abuse therapy ', ' substance abuse treatment ', ' cost ', ' care systems ', ' treatment organization ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' ethnic minority ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' racial/ethnic ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' addictive disorder ', ' addiction ', ' public health relevance ', ' evidence base ', ' ']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,R21,2014,164699,-0.010166100835864327
"Iwankapiya_Healing Historical Trauma Practice and Group IPT for American Indians     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal addresses the significant disparity in mental health problems, as well as availability of Evidence Based Treatment (EBT), between American Indians (AIs) and the general U.S. population. Limited treatment engagement and poor retention rates, commonly regarded as major barriers to mental health care, contribute to the problem of disparities in mental health disorder prevalence. Socioeconomic factors are predictors of reduced treatment engagement and premature, unplanned termination. These characteristics include: minority status, low income, lack of health insurance, lower educational attainment, negative attitudes about mental health care, and substance use (Edlund, 2002; Wang, Bergland, et al., 2005).  This proposal focuses on research designed to develop strategies to deal with three significant causes of the disparities: (1) the lack of an evidence base for culturally appropriate treatment for AIs; (2) problems of engagement and retention of AIs in treatment; and (3) the salience of historical trauma.  In this pilot study, we will explore he feasibility, acceptance and sustainability of a treatment engagement and retention strategy, the Historical Trauma and Unresolved Grief Tribal Best Practice (HTUG) to engage and retain AI adults in an EBT, Group Interpersonal Psychotherapy (IPT), that may be well suited for treating depression and related mental disorders in this population. HTUG focuses on grief resolution related to AI collective massive group trauma across generations, and has potential for engaging AIs in EBTs through acknowledging the negative effects of colonialism on well-being and reducing the stigma of mental health problems (Brave Heart, 1998; Brave Heart, 2003).  We will examine multiple aspects of feasibility, including recruitment, randomization, engagement and retention of clients; recruitment, training, supervision and retention of clinicians; client an clinician acceptance of and satisfaction with HTUG and Group IPT, client and clinician perceptions of the appropriateness of the research measures for client screening, process monitoring and outcome measurement; client (and clinician) acceptance of measures for examining their fidelity to the research model, clinic costs in terms of finances, space use, training time for clinicians, and clinical and staff support costs for HTUG and Group IPT implementation. Long term, what is learned from this proposed research could have significant promise for reducing disparities in mental health treatment and disease burden across AI populations and in culturally unique, disadvantaged and poorly served populations in general.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: American Indians disproportionally experience minority status, low income, lack of health insurance, lower educational attainment, unemployment and substance use. This disparity is widely recognized as a major barrier to mental health care and as a significant public health issue. This pilot study explores the feasibility, acceptance and sustainability of an engagement and retention strategy that may be especially well suited for treating depression and related mental health disorders in this population. Such disparities have long been recognized by agencies like the NIH and Institute of Medicine as a significant public mental health problem and strategies for their alleviation are a high priority.                  ",Iwankapiya_Healing Historical Trauma Practice and Group IPT for American Indians,8693022,R34MH097834,"['adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' American Indian ', ' American Indians ', ' Attitude ', ' psychological disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Client ', ' clinical investigation ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Colonialism ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Grief ', ' Grief reaction ', ' Group Practice ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Health Personnel ', ' Heart ', ' NAS/IOM ', ' Institute of Medicine ', ' Institute of Medicine (U.S.) ', ' Health Insurance ', ' Learning ', ' Manuals ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene Services ', ' Mental Health Services ', ' Methods ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' New Mexico ', ' Perception ', ' well-being ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' pilot study ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' Psychotherapy ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Research ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Research Design ', ' Socioeconomic Factors ', ' South Dakota ', ' Supervision ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' unemployed ', ' out of work ', ' joblessness ', ' jobless ', ' Unemployment ', ' Generations ', ' Measures ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' diverse populations ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' Caring ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Site ', ' Clinical ', ' Healed ', ' prematurity ', ' premature ', ' Training ', ' using substances ', ' substance use ', ' AOD use ', ' Alcohol or Other Drugs use ', ' satisfaction ', ' Measurement ', ' root ', ' Plant Roots ', ' programs ', ' Clinic ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' experience ', ' treatment program ', ' social ', ' Modeling ', ' stigma ', ' social stigma ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Drops ', ' Provider ', ' disease causation ', ' causation ', ' Causality ', ' Etiology ', ' Low income ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Randomized ', ' Research Training ', ' Resolution ', ' trial treatment ', ' trial regimen ', ' Clinical Treatment ', ' Monitor ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' Evidence based treatment ', ' cost ', ' healing ', ' years of life lost to disease ', ' years of life lost to disability ', ' disease burden ', ' burden of disease ', ' burden of illness ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Minority ', ' therapy efficacy ', ' therapeutically effective ', ' therapeutic efficacy ', ' intervention efficacy ', ' Treatment Efficacy ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' Trauma ', ' Pine Ridge Indian Reservation ', ' resistant ', ' Resistance ', ' mental health related disorder ', ' public health relevance ', ' evidence base ', ' randomized trial ', ' screening ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF NEW MEXICO HEALTH SCIS CTR,R34,2014,187236,0.061183746917197655
"Understanding Health Disparities in the Progression of Type 2 Diabetes  It is well-established that modifiable, lifestyle-related behaviors including smoking, alcohol, diet, and physical activity greatly contribute to the risk of most common physical health conditions. The recent, almost epidemic increase in the prevalence of diseases associated with these health behaviors, especially hypertension, type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease (CVD), and growing disparities in the burden of these conditions across racial and ethnic groups, highlights the urgency of developing effective prevention strategies - however, few intervention studies have produced long-term changes in lifestyle and behaviors. Addressing an omission in existing behavioral intervention models, we propose that what is needed is an examination of behavioral change in the context of the interrelationships among health behaviors, sources of and coping responses to chronic stress, and their influence on physical and mental health. This proposal is motivated by a robust literature that indicates blacks in the US are more likely to engage in poor health behaviors (i.e., tobacco smoking, diets high in fat and carbohydrates, excessive alcohol use) and, expectedly, experience disproportionate burdens of common physical health conditions associated with these behaviors, including CVD and diabetes, relative to non-Hispanic whites - paradoxically, however, population-based and clinic studies have consistently found that blacks, in comparison to whites, have the same or lower rates of most mental disorders, even while experiencing higher rates of psychological distress. We theorize that a defined set of health-related stress-coping strategies (i.e., tobacco smoking, diets high in fat and carbohydrates, excessive alcohol use, etc) have a two-pronged effect that helps to account for this counterintuitive patterning. First, we suggest that these behaviors act on the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and related stress- hormonal systems which influences the subjective experience and development of stress-associated psychiatric disorder. Second, we believe that the effects of these poor behaviors on pathophysiology, combined with direct effects of stressful living conditions over the life-course, contribute to disproportionate burden of chronic physical health problems among blacks. Succinctly, we propose that blacks and other individuals from highly stressed populations ""buy"" their relative, comparatively positive rates of mental disorders at the expense of their deteriorating physical health. Therefore, this framework suggests that adherence to traditional preventative care, specifically involving changes in behavioral lifestyle, can lead to a perverse result: improvements in physical health but worsening of mental health. We will extend this line of research and assess the effect of traditional preventative care among three categories of type 2 diabetes patients: 1) pre- or borderline; 2) early onset; and, 3) poorly-controlled. In the proposed accelerated longitudinal design we will examine the inter-relationships among stress, health behaviors, and physical and mental health at three distinct points of diabetes progression.  Type 2 diabetes and its associated risk factors such as hypertension and heart disease continue to top the domestic and international public health agendas. The diagnoses of these conditions are invariably followed by recommendations for extensive behavioral modifications. In all cases rates of long-term adherence to recommended healthy behavioral changes are spotty at best, both intra-and inter-individually. We believe that physical and mental health disparities are linked to the lack of behavioral change adherence. The findings of this study will help anticipate, understand, and identify informal and formal programs and public health policies needed to address the physical and mental health challenges facing the growing epidemic of related cardiovascular and metabolic disorders in the U.S. and other developed and developing countries.

"Disparities in Mental Health Care: Age, Race/Ethnicity, and Geography Effects DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application addresses a priority area for the National Institute on Aging (NIA): to reduce or eliminate health disparities between racial/ethnic minorities and nonminorities among older adults. The focus of this application is on mental health care, where racial/ethnic minorities access mental health services at only half the rate of non- Hispanic Whites, even after controlling for mental health status. While existing literature documents individual- level characteristics associated with mental health care, area-level (i.e., geographic) characteristics of such care are poorly understood. Thus, in this proposed study, we will assess the contribution of geographic factors to racial and ethnic disparities in mental health care among older adults. The overall goal of this research is to improve our understanding of the complex, yet unexplored, relations between race/ethnicity and geographic factors. This project will be accomplished by linking nationally representative survey data on mental health care to area-level data drawn from the U.S. Census and the Area Resource File. The proposed research has two specific aims: Aim 1. Identify geographic 'hot spots' of racial/ethnic disparities in mental health care at the regional, state, and county levels. After completing Aim 1, we will be able to identify geographic areas (at the state or county level) that need new policies to reduce racial/ethnic disparities among older adults. Aim 2. Assess geographic characteristics associated with racial/ethnic disparities in mental health care at the regional, state, and county levels. After completing Aim 2, we will be able to identify area-level risk factors that are potentially modifiable and should be considered in development of policies to reduce disparities. Beyond the scientific aims, this career development award will provide training in advanced methodology, medical geography, and epidemiology. The skills obtained during the training period will enable the candidate to perform cutting-edge research at the intersection of aging, mental health and geography to find ways to reduce or eliminate existing disparities among older adults. The interdisciplinary mentoring team I put together and my affiliations with the UA Center for Mental Health and Aging and the Deep South RCMAR provide the infrastructure to support these endeavors. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project is designed to improve our understanding of the complex, yet unexplored, relations between race/ethnicity and geographic factors with respect to older adult use of mental health care services. Knowledge produced by this project would be relevant to the current efforts of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the National Institue on Aging (NIA) to reduce and eventually eliminate racial and ethnic disparities between racial/ethnic minorities and non-minorities among older adults.","Disparities in Mental Health Care: Age, Race/Ethnicity, and Geography Effects",8719910,K01AG045342,"['Age ', ' Age Distribution ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Elderly ', ' Aging ', ' Attention ', ' psychological disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Censuses ', ' Communities ', ' development policy ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Enabling Factors ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' Geographic Factor ', ' geographic site ', ' MeSH Descriptors Class 4 ', ' Geographical Location ', ' Geographic Region ', ' Geographic Area ', ' Geographic Locations ', ' Geography ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' health care service ', ' Health Services ', ' Level of Health ', ' Health Status ', ' Hospitals ', ' Insurance ', ' Literature ', ' Maps ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene Services ', ' Mental Health Services ', ' Mentors ', ' Method LOINC Axis 6 ', ' Methodology ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' Minority Groups ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' human population density ', ' Population Density ', ' Poverty ', ' Predisposing Factor ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Statistical Regression ', ' Regression Diagnostics ', ' Regression Analyses ', ' Regression Analysis ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Testing ', ' oriental ', ' Asians ', ' County ', ' Relative ', ' Relative (related person) ', ' United States Agency for Health Care Policy and Research ', ' Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality ', ' Agency for Health Care Policy and Research ', ' AHRQ ', ' AHCPR ', ' United States Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Hispanics ', ' Latino ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Policies ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Knowledge ', ' mechanical ', ' Mechanics ', ' Complex ', ' Clinic ', ' Techniques ', ' Location ', ' age group ', ' American ', ' mental age ', ' mental health center ', ' high school ', ' skills ', ' Medical Geography ', ' geospatial information system ', ' Geographic Information Systems ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Behavior Risk Factor Surveillance System ', ' BRFSS ', ' Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System ', ' geographic variation ', ' geographic difference ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Research Career Program ', ' K-Awards ', ' Career Development Programs K-Series ', ' Career Development Awards and Programs ', ' Career Development Awards ', ' K-Series Research Career Programs ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' Older Population ', ' trend ', ' Characteristics ', ' Hot Spots (Area of Increased Mortality) ', ' Hot Spot ', ' Process ', ' sex ', ' National Institute on Aging ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Deep South ', ' Prevalence ', ' ethnic minority ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' racial/ethnic ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' ']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA IN TUSCALOOSA,K01,2014,118418,0.028213491760265174
"Center for Mental Health Services in Pediatric Primary Care    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Mission: The center seeks sustainable ways to increase primary care providers' capacity to improve function, reduce distress, and prevent disability among children with mental health problems. Background: The mental health issues treated in pediatric primary care are characterized by high prevalence and a preponderance of children with impairment but without a diagnosis. Parent distress frequently complicates children's mental health problems and requires simultaneous attention. The ability to engage families around their needs promotes access to treatment and contributes to reducing ethnic (disparities. Goal and specific aims: The Center will develop an evidence-based model for mental health in primary care that 1) applies to the range of problems seen in primary care, 2) engages existing skills and knowledge of families and pediatric providers, and 3) results in sustainable increases in the mental health treatment capacity of primary care. Its specific aims are to: 1) adapt Wagner's Chronic Care Model (CCM) of primary care mental health service to include treatment based on ""common factors"" and ""common treatment elements.""; la) within the CCM's 5 domains, address priority research needs related to the impact of common factors and their implementation in office practice; lb) develop packages of practical interventions, built around domains of the adapted CCM, for larger scale trials in pediatric primary care; 2) develop measurements, study designs and analytic methods to efficiently assess outcomes in community settings; and 3) stimulate innovation in pediatric mental health services through multidisciplinary and community-academic collaboration, attracting new and diverse scholars and providing a resource for scientists, policy makers, and advocates. Methods: The Center's faculty is a team of pediatricians, psychologists, psychiatrists, and other scholars from six institutions that include rural, suburban, and urban settings. Their work is informed by ties to the American Academy of Pediatrics' Task Force on Mental Health and leaders in state mental health policy. Guidance and focus come from a community advisory committee and a national scientific advisory board. Research Methods Core studies address priority questions about the evidence base for common factors, the burden of mental health care, and feasible clinical data systems. Principal Research Core studies test complementary common factors approaches for children with anxiety problems. The Operations Core promotes recruiting underrepresented trainees, meaningful community interaction, quality control, and innovative study design.             The Center's work develops a model of mental health prevention and treatment that can be practically implemented in pediatric primary care. The model has the potential to make care available to populations that currently have limited access to specialized mental health services.

"The Cultural Formulation Interview-Engagement Aid for Mental Health Treatment     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposed Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award (K23) is a four-year plan that will enable the candidate to develop as an intervention development, services researcher with an independent program of research. The goal of this research program is to improve the treatment engagement of underserved racial and ethnic minority populations in mental health settings by developing a cross-cultural communication engagement aid that ascertains relevant cultural views in starting, continuing, and participating in treatment. We will test the intervention's effects on medical communication and patient outcomes.  The training objectives are to: 1) train in intervention development; 2) study how to overcome cultural barriers to engagement, focusing on treatment entry, continuation, and participation; 3) acquire methodological skills to assess how cross-cultural miscommunication leads to treatment disengagement and health disparities; 4) train  in clinical trials methodology and longitudinal data analysis. The application integrates formal course work, mentorship from established investigators, and mentored research activities. Three studies, supported by the candidate's training plan, are proposed that move from intervention development to pilot testing. Project 1 consists of three separate focus groups with patients, clinicians, and administrators to define program objectives, methods, and strategies to promote treatment entry, participation, and continuation of minorities with mental illness. The candidate will present these diverse stakeholders with results from a literature review on these topics to translate theoretical methods into practical strategies. The goals of this 12-month program are to design the intervention, write the first instruction manual for clinicians, and to develop cliniian adherence and competence measures for the intervention. Project 2 is a small, pre-pilot, open study in which trained clinicians will deliver the intervention. Debriefing interviews with patient and clinicians will identify factors affecting feasibility and acceptability with subsequent revisin of the intervention's instruction manual.  An implementation plan will then be revised for clinicians based on the adapted intervention with fidelity indicators. Project 3 is a small pilot RCT to examine the feasibility and acceptability of the adapted intervention and explore its initia efficacy versus usual care at a public outpatient mental health clinic. Drawing from implementation mapping, a Scientific Advisory Board (SAB) consisting of patients, clinicians, administrators, mentors, and consultants will be used to incorporate the perspectives of multiple stakeholders in all projects.  Results from these projects will serve as pilot data to apply for subsequent grants.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This K23 prepares the candidate to initiate an independent research program on developing cross-cultural communication interventions to engage minorities in mental health treatment. This project responds to Objectives 3 and 4 of the NIMH Strategic Plan calling for the development of interventions that address the needs of diverse people with mental illness and that translate research findings into clinical practice to enhance the NIMH's public health mission.                ",The Cultural Formulation Interview-Engagement Aid for Mental Health Treatment,8765652,K23MH102334,"['Affect ', ' psychological disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Mental disorders ', ' white race ', ' Occidental ', ' Caucasoid ', ' Caucasian Race ', ' Caucasian ', ' Caucasoid Race ', ' clinical investigation ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Communication ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Interview ', ' Language ', ' Manuals ', ' Maps ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methods ', ' Method LOINC Axis 6 ', ' Methodology ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Mission ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' NIMH ', ' National Institute of Mental Health (U.S.) ', ' Out-patients ', ' Outpatients ', ' Patients ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Testing ', ' Translating ', ' Vocabulary Words ', ' Vocabulary ', ' Caucasians ', ' Work ', ' Writing ', ' CFI ', ' chemotactic factor inactivator ', ' Measures ', ' Administrator ', ' Competence ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' communication behavior ', ' improved ', ' prematurity ', ' premature ', ' Medical ', ' Training ', ' Research Activity ', ' Training Intervention ', ' instructional intervention ', ' Instruction Intervention ', ' Education for Intervention ', ' Educational Intervention ', ' Review Literature ', ' programs ', ' inattentiveness ', ' inattention ', ' Side ', ' Clinic ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' Formulation ', ' Drug Formulations ', ' communication aid ', ' Services ', ' preference ', ' skills ', ' social ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Address ', ' Adherence ', ' Adherence (attribute) ', ' Data ', ' Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award (K23) ', ' K23 Program ', ' K23 Mechanism ', ' K23 Award ', ' Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award ', ' Strategic Planning ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' Instruction ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' ethnic minority ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' racial/ethnic ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' therapy design ', ' treatment development ', ' intervention development ', ' develop therapy ', ' therapy development ', ' public health relevance ', ' evidence base ', ' usual care ', ' treatment as usual ', ' intervention effect ', ' clinical practice ', ' ']",NIMH,NEW YORK STATE PSYCHIATRIC INSTITUTE,K23,2014,184963,0.06436877254248255
"Testing the Community-Based Learning Collaborative Implementation Model     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): One in four U.S. children experience a mental health disorder with severe impairment and/or distress during their childhood. Further, high rates of exposure to violence and abuse are common among youth, particularly among those involved in the child welfare and mental health service systems. Violence exposure presents significant health and mental health consequences for children, with disparities in these experiences among racial/ethnic minority youth, and estimated costs exceeding $124 billion. While evidence-based treatments (EBTs) can prevent and/or reduce these negative effects, these treatments are still not the standard practice of care in many communities. Despite a recent proliferation of implementation research across a variety of settings, an ongoing challenge facing child mental health and child welfare professionals is how to transport and implement these EBTs so that they are readily available, accessible and sustained. The Learning Collaborative training model is being widely disseminated as a way to train community-based therapists to deliver EBTs. However, to date, the effectiveness of this model has not been demonstrated, nor has it been examined as a way to build and strengthen inter-professional relationships across the multiple professionals and agencies involved in providing services to children. Thus, to meet these public health needs, child welfare and mental health professionals must collaborate to improve the availability and sustainment of evidence- based practices for children. This project aims to test an extension of the Learning Collaborative Model, the Community-based Learning Collaborative model, which targets both clinical and non-clinical professionals in the child welfare and mental health service sectors as a way to build and strengthen inter-professional relationships and thereby improve coordination and delivery of evidence-based mental health treatment services. The proposed research offers the opportunity to capitalize on an on-going, statewide implementation project to generate evidence about implementation strategies needed to make EBTs more accessible to children. This study also provides data to inform an R01 effectiveness trial that will utilize a time-series design to rigorously evaluate the effectivenessof the CBLC model as a mechanism to improve access and sustained use of EBTs for children. The proposed mixed-methods study will involve participants (n=150) from two ongoing CBLCs being conducted as part of a statewide, foundation funded training initiative in South Carolina. The study will examine data collected pre/post, weekly and monthly over the 12 month active implementation period. Participants will be recruited for an 18 month follow-up period to examine whether inter-professional and inter-organizational relationships and use of EBTs are sustained over time. New quantitative and qualitative data will be collected during this sustainment phase. The proposed study will demonstrate feasibility and inform development of a large scale, multi-site study that will utilize a time-series design, to examine effectiveness of the CBLC implementation model.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: One in four US children experiences a mental health disorder; violence exposure is highly prevalent and associated with significant mental health consequences for children. Effective treatments exist, but availability is limited, particularly fo traditionally underserved minority children, overrepresented in the child welfare system.

However, the mechanisms underlying the link between discrimination and health are still unclear. In addition, potential moderators of the stressful impact of exposure to discrimination on mental health have yet to be clearly identified, particularly within underresearched groups such as Latino adolescents. The proposed study will address these gaps in the literature by investigating perceived racial/ethnic discrimination among Mexican-origin adolescents 12-17 years old. The proposed study has three specific aims:  (1) To test mediating mechanisms (focusing on anger regulation) that help explain the link between racial/ethnic discrimination and mental health in Mexican-origin adolescents;  (2) To identify coping strategies (e.g., ethnic identity; social support) that influence the link between  racial/ethnic discrimination and mental health in Mexican-origin adolescents.  (3) To assess the degree to which the family environment and sociocultural context factors (e.g., gender, nativity status, ethnic socialization) increase or decrease the adverse effect of racial/ethnic discrimination on adolescents' mental health. To achieve these study aims, we will conduct a longitudinal community-based survey of N = 270 Mexican- origin families in the northern Indiana region. Data will be collected using an audio computer administered self- interview (ACASI) approach with adolescents and face-to-face interviews with parents. Adolescents will be surveyed across three measurement occasions at 6-month intervals, whereas parents will be surveyed at the first time point. We will assess racial/ethnic discrimination, emotion regulation, anger expression/suppression, acculturation/enculturation levels, acculturative stress, ethnic identity development, cultural orientation and values, racial/ethnic/cultural socialization practices, and mental health. The within-group approach will allow us to carefully study cultural influences and variations in sources of resilience and vulnerability vis-¿-vis mental disorders, and the longitudinal design wil enable us to test mediation and moderation effects across time to better determine sequence of effects. The proposed study is significant because it advances our understanding of: (1) key mediating mechanisms that help explain the link between discrimination and mental disorder; and, (2) potential moderating factors that can either buffer or exacerbate the impact of discrimination on mental health in this understudied population. This project is relevant to public health as it has the potential to identify explanatory mechanisms, as well as malleable risk and resilience factors, in the discrimination-mental health link. This will aid in the development of more targeted and culturally-sensitive interventions that can mitigate the detrimental impact of racism on the mental health of Latino youth and thus, help reduce health disparities.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project will help identify explanatory mechanisms, as well as malleable vulnerability and resilience factors, in the discrimination-mental health link. Such information is critical in the reduction of health disparities as it will aid in the development of more targeted and culturally-sensitive interventions that can mitigate the detrimental impact of racism on the mental health of Latino youth.

"Addressing Mental Health Disparities in Refugee ChildrenL A CBPR Collaboration DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In the US, refugee children and families face dramatic disparities in the incidence and treatment of mental health disorders. Resettlement stressors (poverty, limited access to care) and acculturative challenges (differences in cultural norms, discrimination) often exacerbate risks due to war-related trauma exposure. Commonly, refugee mental health services are limited-usually with a narrow focus on clinical treatment of PTSD-and rarely respond to the holistic needs of refugee communities; few interventions are designed to be used across cultures and refugee groups, despite rapidly evolving refugee demographics in the US. The cross-cultural application of community-based participatory research (CBPR) methods can increase understanding of risk and protective factors in refugee communities and contribute to development of flexible mental health interventions to address disparities. This CBPR project builds on an existing collaborative research relationships with the Somali Bantu refugee community in Greater Boston. Preliminary research has identified numerous cultural and community strengths as well as ongoing problems of family conflict, poor parent-child communication which interact with ongoing stressors to increase risks for child emotional and behavioral problems. Family-based intervention models adapted via local input and delivered by trained members of the community hold great promise for use among these and other refugee groups in the US. This study will use CBPR mixed methods (qualitative and quantitative data collection) to conduct needs assessments and design and evaluate a core family-based intervention. Project activities will emphasize capacity building in two refugee communities resettled in Greater Boston-the Somali Bantu and the Bhutanese-actively engaging refugee community members, community advisory boards, services providers, and other stakeholders. Specific Aims are to: (1) deepen partnerships with the Somali Bantu and Bhutanese communities through co-leadership, capacity-building, and knowledge sharing; (2) collect and apply qualitative data to (a) prepare a needs assessment of mental health in children and adolescents, barriers to care, and services preferences with each target refugee group; (b) develop mental health/psychosocial assessments for refugee caregivers and children; (c) adapt the core components of a family-based strengthening intervention for use with refugees; and (3) conduct an 80-family pilot study to examine acceptability and sustainability of the intervention. Key outcomes will be improvements in caregiver-child relationships, mental health services access, increased functioning, and reduced mental health symptoms in children and adolescents.         RELEVANCE (See instructions): The proposed study will employ cross-cultural CBPR methods to develop a family-based intervention grounded in needs assessments on contributors to mental health disparities among refugee children and families. The mixed methods research approach to selecting, adapting and implementing culturally-informed assessments and intervention models has the potential to contribute to feasible, acceptable and sustainable intervention models of mental health services for diverse groups of refugee children and families.

"Implementing Health Care Interventions for Hispanics with Serious Mental Illness    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Compared to majority whites with serious mental illness (SMI; e.g., schizophrenia), racial/ethnic minorities with SMI are at higher risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD). Although promising treatments (e.g., care manager interventions) exist to improve the health of people with SMI, limited attention has been paid to the process of making these interventions culturally relevant to Hispanics with SMI and to promote their use in the public mental health system. The objective of this Mentored Research Scientist Development Award (K01) is to prepare the candidate to become an independent investigator in implementation research to address the disparities in physical health care faced by underserved minorities with SMI. A mentoring team, led by Drs. Lewis-Fernandez and Druss, will guide the candidate in achieving the following training objectives: 1) obtain training in implementation research, focusing on community-based participatory research (CBPR) approaches as a translational strategy; 2) develop expertise on the integration of physical and mental health care for people with SMI; 3) acquire new skills in using intervention mapping and qualitative methods to inform intervention research; and 4) obtain training in clinical trial methodology and longitudinal data analysis. The application integrates course work, mentorship from established investigators, and mentored research activities. The research plan uses a collaborative intervention planning framework that blends principles of CBPR and intervention mapping to modify and assess the feasibility and acceptability of an existing care manager intervention. This 12-month intervention focuses on improving patient activation and the coordination of medical care between outpatient mental health clinics and primary care. The proposed project uses a multiphase approach supported by the candidate's training plan. In Phase 1, a community advisory board composed of researchers and stakeholders will be assembled to learn and review the intervention and make initial modifications. During Phase 2, qualitative methods - patient focus groups and stakeholder interviews - will be used to ensure that the modifications are acceptable to all stakeholders. In Phase 3, results from Phase 2 are used to further modify the intervention, develop an implementation plan, and train two care managers on the modified intervention. Phase 4 consists of a 12-month open pilot study (N = 30) to assess the feasibility and acceptability of the modified intervention and explore its effect. Lastly, Phase 5 will focus on analysis of pilot study data and preparation of an R01 proposal. The research plan will yield pilot data for a subsequent R01 to conduct a randomized controlled trial to test the effectiveness and implementation of the modified intervention.        This K01 prepares the candidate to develop an independent program of research focused on the implementation of integrated physical and mental health services in the public mental health system to improve the physical health and wellness of underserved minorities with SMI. This project responds to objectives 3 and 4 of the NIMH Strategic Plan which call for the development of better interventions that incorporate the needs of diverse people with mental illness and ensures the translation of research findings into clinical practice to enhance NIMH's public health mission.

"A novel post-disaster mental health training for black communities    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The disparities in disaster-related mental health problems highlight the highlighted the need for local pre-disaster planning in black communities living in high stress areas. Training in Post Disaster Mental Health in Black Communities is a train the trainer, group-level intervention designed to improve the local disaster mental health readiness. HERMES' Phase I study developed a training package based on needs assessment. The results indicate that the training of both clinical providers and community leaders is a promising model for integrating culturally appropriate mental health in local response strategies. Aims: Our Phase II field study will further refine the curriculum components and field test the acceptability, adaptability, effectiveness, and sustainability of our model in high stress black communities of coastal and rural eastern North Carolina and downtown Charleston and Low Country areas in South Carolina. Method: We will recruit and train a core team of mental health providers to deliver clinical provider- and community leader-tailored training workshops to 240 participants in eight target communities. Local collaborative planning teams will be supported by web-based exercise and group training components. Participants will complete evaluations follow each training component and pre, post and 3, 6, and 12 month follow- up tests on knowledge and self-rated competency skills. We will measure benchmarks of increased capacity and performance-based skills using qualitative interviews and site profiles. Expected Results: The triangulation of process and outcome data will determine the effectiveness of this model for increasing knowledge and skills in providing culturally competent mental health support for survivors in the immediate aftermath of disasters. We also will identify best training and local planning practices for promoting and sustaining resilience and document case studies that illustrate the mitigation of disaster-related mental health consequences.        HERMES proposes to field test a training model and materials designed to build an  integrated local capacity in black communities to respond to mental in the immediate aftermath of a disaster. The training is will prepare clinical providers and community- based organization leaders who have the relational advantage of insiders to mitigate the risk of longer term mental health consequences that result from disasters. HERMES, will further develop the model according to feasible results and collaborate with partners in implementing a train the trainer model. Follow up sessions will cover clinical treatment and planning skills building with a web-based Community of Practice containing multi- media exercises and information resources to support site clinical and community planning teams. This blended learning product will fill a growing market demand among response agencies and has promise for spinoffs in complementary areas. The resulting product is marketable as social capital building strategy that will increase the coordination and efficiency of mental services in low-resource disaster affected communities.

"Connecting Cultures and Technology: Addressing Disparities in Mental Health Intervention for Refugees ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Thousands of individuals seek refuge in the United States to escape atrocities of war and torture in their country of origin. An overwhelming majority of these individuals continue to struggle with Chronic Traumatic Stress (CTS), the persistence of prior traumatic events (e.g., re-experiencing past trauma) coupled with daily post-migration stressors (e.g., poverty, lack of transportation). CTS significantly increases the burden of mental illness experienced by refugees such that approximately 70% meet criteria for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and comorbid conditions including depression, generalized anxiety disorder, and somatic concerns. Evidence-based mental health treatments for these conditions rely on worksheets, mobile applications, websites, or telephone calls to facilitate the use of skils and manage distress outside of session. Language barriers (e.g., most refugees have limited English proficiency) prevent these strategies from being incorporated into mental health treatment for refugees, which results in a significant disparity in the quality of care. Treatments delivered via mobile device are able to overcome this barrier through the use of intuitive graphical interfaces that eliminate the need for text or language-based instruction. Culturally adapted mHealth toolkits that address the mental health needs of refugees will reduce a significant disparity in care and is consistent with calls from the National Institutes of Health, World Health Organization, and United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. The current SBIR Phase I project aims to develop, refine, and pilot an mHealth toolkit aimed at addressing the burden of mental illness in refugees. A community-based participatory research approach will be used in which GameTheory, a women-owned small business, mental health clinicians who serve refugees, and refugees will create an advisory panel to develop the toolkit. The panel will be involved in all aspects of development to ensure the application meet the needs of the community. An agile development strategy will be used that will proceed across three phases that correspond to the aims of the project. Aim 1: The design and components of the toolkit will be created with feedback from the advisory panel using agile development. Prototypes will be created, reviewed internally, and revised based on feedback from community members. Feedback from additional refugees will be solicited during the initial development to ensure that our toolkit is user-friendly and can be used intuitively. Aim 2: A formal prototype evaluation of the toolkit with a sample of n=24 refugees from different cultural backgrounds and n=5 providers who work with the refugee community will be conducted. Consistent with agile development, evaluation will occur across 4 waves in which feedback is obtained and integrated into the application at each wave. Aim 3: The refined toolkit will be alpha tested with n=20 patients across n=5 providers during culturally adapted treatment. Metrics of engagement, usability, and satisfaction will be obtained to guide final refinements to the toolkit. Feasibility metrics of recruitment, completion, and compliance will also be obtained in preparation for a Phase II Clinical Trial.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Refugees and victims of torture experience disproportionally high rates of mental illness, which contributes to an undue burden of illness. Multiple barriers prevent these individuals from accessing high quality care in times of crisis including language, economics, and transportation.

"Regional Network for Mental Health Research in Latin America DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overriding objective of our Hub for Latin America (HLA) is to improve the condition of people with severe mental disorders in Latin America. We propose to do so by making a focused contribution to narrowing the ""mental health gap"". Our long-term goal is to improve health services for people with severe mental disorders until they are equivalent to the best health services offered to people with highly prioritized general health conditions. We envision an integrated system of primary care and secondary mental health services that we refer to as Community Health Care for individuals with Severe Mental Disorders (CHC-SMD). We adopt a multi-pronged approach that is tailored to the distinctive context of the urban areas of Latin America. Our goals for the 5-year grant period are to launch strategic initiatives that will generate significant progress toward CHC-SMD in this region, and to build a platform for ongoing progress over a longer time period.    The HLA brings together key researchers and stakeholders from six cities across Latin America (Santiago, Chile; Rio de Janeiro, Brazil; Buenos Aires, Cordoba, Neuquen, Argentina; Medellin, Colombia) with researchers in New York City in a concerted effort to make progress toward a shared vision of CHC-SMD. The Components are designed to be synergistic so that the impact of the whole HLA is greater than the sum of its parts. The Research Component, for example, proposes to pilot a regional randomized controlled trial (RCT). In order for the HLA to proceed as planned to conduct a full scale regional RCT, the Capacity Building Component will need to train leaders at the HLA sites to conduct RCTs and coordinate regional studies. At the same time, the pilot RCT will help generate this capacity by providing practical experience in RCTs and regional studies.    Our overall specific aims are (a) to deploy and evaluate task shifting approaches that can accelerate progress toward CHC-SMD; (b) to train young leaders with the capacities required to generate ongoing progress toward CHC-SMD; and (c) to bring together multiple stakeholders to contribute to implementing and shaping CHC-SMD. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Within Latin American cities people with severe mental disorders are a vulnerable population whose lives are often characterized by extreme poverty, social exclusion from education, employment, and participation in civil society, multiple traumas including violence and abuse, reduced access to health care and high mortality rates. Equitable development, as endorsed by international conventions, requires the inclusion of this vulnerable population in the benefits of development and the protection of their civil and human rights. The overriding objective of our Hub for Latin America (HLA) is to improve the condition of this vulnerable group through an integrated system of primary care and secondary mental health services tailored to the distinctive context of the urban areas of Latin America.",Regional Network for Mental Health Research in Latin America,8916184,U19MH095718,"['Argentina ', ' Brazil ', ' Chile ', ' Cities ', ' Civil Rights ', ' Colombia ', ' Communities ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Complement ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Employment ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' health care service ', ' Health Services ', ' healthcare service availability ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare access availability ', ' health services availability ', ' health care service availability ', ' health care service access ', ' health care availability ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Availability of Health Services ', ' Accessibility of health care ', ' Access to Healthcare ', ' Access to Health Care ', ' Access to Care ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' Human Rights ', ' Latin America ', ' Leadership ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene Services ', ' Mental Health Services ', ' Mortality ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Multiple Wounds ', ' Multiple Injuries ', ' Multiple Trauma ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' New York City ', ' Poverty ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Primary Care ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Psychiatry ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Strikes ', ' Employee Strikes ', ' Time ', ' Universities ', ' violent behavior ', ' violent ', ' Violence ', ' visual function ', ' Sight ', ' Vision ', ' Community Health Care ', ' Community Healthcare ', ' urban area ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' Shapes ', ' programs ', ' Adopted ', ' Complex ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' Country ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' social inequality ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' Institution ', ' International ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Sum ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' severe mental disorder ', ' serious mental illness ', ' serious mental disorder ', ' persistent mental illness ', ' chronic mental illness ', ' severe mental illness ', ' public health relevance ', ' civil society ', ' ']",NIMH,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,U19,2015,931334,0.05596283974428328
"Iwankapiya_Healing Historical Trauma Practice and Group IPT for American Indians DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal addresses the significant disparity in mental health problems, as well as availability of Evidence Based Treatment (EBT), between American Indians (AIs) and the general U.S. population. Limited treatment engagement and poor retention rates, commonly regarded as major barriers to mental health care, contribute to the problem of disparities in mental health disorder prevalence. Socioeconomic factors are predictors of reduced treatment engagement and premature, unplanned termination. These characteristics include: minority status, low income, lack of health insurance, lower educational attainment, negative attitudes about mental health care, and substance use (Edlund, 2002; Wang, Bergland, et al., 2005).  This proposal focuses on research designed to develop strategies to deal with three significant causes of the disparities: (1) the lack of an evidence base for culturally appropriate treatment for AIs; (2) problems of engagement and retention of AIs in treatment; and (3) the salience of historical trauma.  In this pilot study, we will explore he feasibility, acceptance and sustainability of a treatment engagement and retention strategy, the Historical Trauma and Unresolved Grief Tribal Best Practice (HTUG) to engage and retain AI adults in an EBT, Group Interpersonal Psychotherapy (IPT), that may be well suited for treating depression and related mental disorders in this population. HTUG focuses on grief resolution related to AI collective massive group trauma across generations, and has potential for engaging AIs in EBTs through acknowledging the negative effects of colonialism on well-being and reducing the stigma of mental health problems (Brave Heart, 1998; Brave Heart, 2003).  We will examine multiple aspects of feasibility, including recruitment, randomization, engagement and retention of clients; recruitment, training, supervision and retention of clinicians; client an clinician acceptance of and satisfaction with HTUG and Group IPT, client and clinician perceptions of the appropriateness of the research measures for client screening, process monitoring and outcome measurement; client (and clinician) acceptance of measures for examining their fidelity to the research model, clinic costs in terms of finances, space use, training time for clinicians, and clinical and staff support costs for HTUG and Group IPT implementation. Long term, what is learned from this proposed research could have significant promise for reducing disparities in mental health treatment and disease burden across AI populations and in culturally unique, disadvantaged and poorly served populations in general. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: American Indians disproportionally experience minority status, low income, lack of health insurance, lower educational attainment, unemployment and substance use. This disparity is widely recognized as a major barrier to mental health care and as a significant public health issue. This pilot study explores the feasibility, acceptance and sustainability of an engagement and retention strategy that may be especially well suited for treating depression and related mental health disorders in this population.

"E-diaries to assess health effects of microaggressions ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Health disparities among lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) persons across the lifespan are increasingly well- documented, yet gaps remain in our basic understanding of the health status, behaviors, and outcomes within LGB groups. Specifically, bisexual women tend to fare the worst on a majority of health outcomes, with the most consistent and pronounced disparities in mental health. A potentially important area of investigation pertains to the unique identity-based stressors associated with a bisexual identity. Minority stressors at the daily-level, known as microaggressions, may be more common among bisexual women and may explain health disparities among this group. The proposed study will use daily process measures, in the form of electronic diaries (EDs), over a 4-week period, to study the effect of microaggressions on bisexual women's daily mental health. Qualitative interviews will also be conducted. In addition, we will consider lifetime stressors that may potentiate deleterious effects of microaggressions on daily health and lifetime mental health. The main hypothesis of the proposed study is that bisexual women who more frequently report sexual orientation microaggressions will experience poorer mental health than bisexual women who less frequently report such microaggressions. In order to test this, we propose the following aims: 1) determine the frequency and source of sexual orientation microaggressions (SMAs) among racially diverse bisexual women and test their association(s) with mental health, 2) identify the characteristics of bisexual women's microaggressive experiences, e.g., context, content and source, including their responses to such experiences, through both quantitative and qualitative methodologies and 3) identify lifetime stressors that influence associations between SMAs and daily health and lifetime depression. Such stressors will include: childhood sexual or physical abuse, adult sexual or physical abuse, and a history of hazardous drinking. This exploratory project relies on a novel multi-method approach to study daily-level minority stressors, in the form of microaggressions, among a relatively understudied population, bisexual women. This preliminary exploration of within-group differences can significantly advance our knowledge of the risk factors associated with mental health disparities among racially diverse bisexual women. Findings will be critical for informing directions for future research and practice through the identification of relevant research questions and/or foci for preventative interventions.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Bisexual women experience pronounced health disparities, particularly in relation to their mental health. These disparities represent a significant public health burden, given economic and human costs associated with mental illness. The project will identify unique risk factors for poor mental health among bisexual women and provide data necessary to inform future intervention and prevention efforts among this population of women.            ",E-diaries to assess health effects of microaggressions,8873307,R21MD009585,"['Accounting ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Affect ', ' Alcohol Chemical Class ', ' Alcohols ', ' Anxiety Disorders ', ' psychological disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Chicago ', ' juvenile sex abuse ', ' childhood sexual abuse ', ' Molestation, Sexual, Child ', ' Child Sexual Abuse ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Discrimination (Psychology) ', ' Economics ', ' Electronics ', ' Employment ', ' Future ', ' Health ', ' Level of Health ', ' Health Status ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' Housing ', ' Modern Man ', ' Man (Taxonomy) ', ' Human ', ' Interview ', ' Life Experience ', ' lifespan ', ' life span ', ' Length of Life ', ' Longevity ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Methods ', ' Method LOINC Axis 6 ', ' Methodology ', ' Persons ', ' Prejudice ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Research ', ' Risk Factors ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Testing ', ' Tobacco ', ' United States ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Illicit Drugs ', ' Process Measure ', ' base ', ' Bi-sexual ', ' Bisexual ', ' Area ', ' Sexual Orientation ', ' Sex Orientation ', ' Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-IV ', ' Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th edition ', ' DSM4 ', ' DSM-IV ', ' using substances ', ' substance use ', ' AOD use ', ' Alcohol or Other Drugs use ', ' Gays ', ' Lesbian ', ' Respondent ', ' sex abuse ', ' Sexual abuse ', ' Knowledge ', ' diaries ', ' Investigation ', ' Frequency ', ' Frequencies (time pattern) ', ' Event ', ' Source ', ' Pattern ', ' physical health ', ' physical conditioning ', ' Affective Disorders ', ' Mood Disorders ', ' Tobacco Consumption ', ' Tobacco use ', ' experience ', ' stressor ', ' novel ', ' Categories ', ' Reporting ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Latinas ', ' Latina ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Data ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' Sum ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Characteristics ', ' Heterosexuals ', ' physical maltreatment ', ' physical abuse ', ' cost ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Mind ', ' stem ', ' public health relevance ', ' hazardous drinking ', ' sexual encounter ', ' sexual minority ', ' ']",NIMHD,NORTHERN ILLINOIS UNIVERSITY,R21,2015,198494,0.09370214545113675
"Addressing Health Disparities among Transgender Women DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Rachel L. Kaplan, PhD, MPH is a public health researcher at the Center for Research and Education on Gender and Sexuality at San Francisco State University and a postdoctoral scholar at University of California, Berkeley's Mack Center on Mental Health and Social Conflict. Dr. Kaplan's long-term career objective is to become an independent researcher specializing in the development and implementation of sexual and mental health promoting interventions among sexual minority populations in international settings. The proposed training, mentorship, and research plan support this goal and will provide her with the theoretical and practical skills necessary to become an independent intervention researcher. Although transgender women are among the most-at-risk populations for contracting HIV, few studies have been conducted to determine the most feasible and acceptable ways to impact risk. Further, knowledge of sexual and mental health among transgender women has been derived mostly from the United States. There is an urgent need for culturally relevant interventions for this marginalized population in poorly-resourced, high-stigma settings. The proposed study will address these gaps by: (1) exploring the psycho-social and cultural factors that form the context in which transgender women's sexual and mental health are situated; (2) determining how to impact transgender women's sexual and mental health through adaptation of a prevention intervention; and (3) assessing the feasibility and accessibility of the prevention intervention through pilot testing among transgender women in Lebanon. It is expected that this research will reveal prevention needs and strategies specific to transgender women in the Middle East and provide unique and powerful results to inform efficacy testing in future larger- scale trials in international settings. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This study is important to public health because it will provide critical information about how to access and engage high-risk and highly stigmatized sexual minority populations such as transgender women. Because rates of HIV transmission and mental health problems are high among transwomen, it is crucial to examine this population's sexual and mental health. Transwomen are typically marginalized; they experience high rates of gender-related abuse, unstable housing, depression, and HIV risk behavior including the engagement in sex work for income. As public health researchers, we have only begun to understand which components of existing interventions might be efficacious for risk reduction and health promotion among transwomen in the U.S. This study will investigate the cultural acceptability and feasibility of an adapted HIV prevention intervention that was originally developed for use among transwomen in the U.S. A better understanding of culturally acceptable and feasible strategies for addressing sexual and mental health among transwomen in Lebanon will aid the development and adaptation of health-promoting approaches in other international settings.",Addressing Health Disparities among Transgender Women,8899640,K01MH102142,"['Affect ', ' North Africa ', ' Maghreb ', ' French-Speaking Africa ', ' Northern Africa ', ' California ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' CDC ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' Communities ', ' Conflict ', ' Conflict (Psychology) ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Discrimination (Psychology) ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Epidemic ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' Health Promotion ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' Incidence ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Income ', ' Lebanon ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mentorship ', ' Middle East ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' San Francisco ', ' Sexuality ', ' Social Sciences ', ' social support network ', ' Social support ', ' Testing ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' violent behavior ', ' violent ', ' Violence ', ' Work ', ' Gender ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' HIV/AIDS prevention ', ' HIV Prevention ', ' AIDS/HIV prevention ', ' AIDS prevention ', ' base ', ' career ', ' Area ', ' Training ', ' Populations at Risk ', ' Staging ', ' Contracting Opportunities ', ' Contracts ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Application Context ', ' contextual factors ', ' experience ', ' skills ', ' Prevention ', ' social ', ' HIV/AIDS problem ', ' HIV/AIDS ', ' AIDS/HIV ', ' AIDS/HIV problem ', ' HIV risk ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' stigma ', ' social stigma ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Risk Reduction ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Address ', ' Sexual Health ', ' Data ', ' PhD ', ' Ph.D. ', ' Doctor of Philosophy ', ' International ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' Research Career Program ', ' K-Awards ', ' Career Development Programs K-Series ', ' Career Development Awards and Programs ', ' Career Development Awards ', ' K-Series Research Career Programs ', ' Funding Mechanisms ', ' Low Prevalence ', ' Transmission ', ' transmission process ', ' sex ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' unstably housed ', ' unstable housing ', ' instably housed ', ' housing instability ', ' resilience ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' Evidence based intervention ', ' treatment development ', ' intervention development ', ' develop therapy ', ' therapy development ', ' high risk ', ' successful intervention ', ' efficacy testing ', ' sexual minority ', ' ']",NIMH,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",K01,2015,181950,0.047340309351373545
"Addressing Social Determinants to Reduce Refugee Mental Health Disparities DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this study is to test an ecological/empowerment approach to reducing mental health disparities among socioeconomically disadvantaged Central African and Iraqi refugee adults by examining the effectiveness of a community-based advocacy, learning, and social support intervention (Refugee Well-being Project, RWP) that addresses social determinants of mental health and incorporates an evidence-based trauma treatment (Narrative Exposure Therapy, NET) for refugees with PTSD. The waitlist randomized controlled trial with 180 African and Iraqi refugee adults is innovative and significant because it will rigorously test the effectiveness of addressin social determinants of mental health (poverty, social and physical environments, access to services, marginalization) to reduce mental health disparities, as well as examine the impact of a community-based, mutual learning intervention on improving engagement and retention in evidence-based trauma-focused treatment for those who need it. The RWP intervention emphasizes a sustainable and replicable partnership model between refugee resettlement agencies and universities/colleges that involves refugee adults and undergraduate advocates working together to: a) increase refugees' abilities to navigate their new communities; b) improve refugees' access to community resources; c) enhance meaningful social roles by valuing refugees' culture, experiences, and knowledge; d) reduce refugees' social isolation; and e) increase communities' responsiveness to refugees. The RWP intervention is administered by university undergraduate students enrolled in a service learning course, and has two elements: 1) Learning Circles, which involve cultural exchange and one-on-one learning opportunities, and; 2) Advocacy, which involves collaborative efforts to mobilize community resources related to health, housing, employment, education, and legal issues. Pilot testing of RWP demonstrated feasibility, appropriateness, acceptability, and preliminary evidence that the intervention decreased Hmong, Central African, and Iraqi participants' psychological distress and increased protective factors. A mixed methods strategy with data collected from each participant at four time points over a period of 14 months will be used to test the effectiveness of the 6- month intervention to reduce psychological distress (PTSD, depression, and culturally-specific distress), increase protective factors (access to resources, English proficiency, environmental mastery, mental health service use, and social support), and engage and retain refugee adults with PTSD in an evidence-based trauma treatment (NET). Mechanisms of intervention effectiveness will be explored by testing mediating relationships between protective factors and psychological distress. Qualitative components of interviews with refugee participants and paired qualitative interviews with refugees and undergraduates will explore participants' experiences in the intervention, inform interpretation of quantitative data, and investigate unexpected impacts. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This study tests the effectiveness of an innovative, community-based advocacy, learning, and social support intervention (Refugee Well-being Project) to reduce the mental health disparities experienced by low-income refugee adults by addressing several well-defined social determinants of mental health and increasing refugees' engagement in trauma treatment, when warranted. This is important not only for the large number of refugees in the United States and worldwide, but also because the intervention model has the potential to alleviate the disproportionate psychological distress experienced by other immigrant and minority populations throughout the United States who experience inequities in social and material resources and disproportionate exposure to trauma and stress and who are less likely to access formal mental health services because of lack of trust and concerns about culturally appropriateness.

"Integrating Mental Health into a HIV Clinic to Improve Outcomes in Tanzanian Youth     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Dr. Dorothy Dow has a Master's of Science in Global Health and will become junior faculty at Duke University Medical Center in the Division of Pediatric Infectious Diseases in July 2014. For nearly three years, she has been living and working in Moshi, Tanzania. Her long-term goal is to become an independent global health researcher integrating mental health into the prevention and treatment of HIV among adolescents. During HIV clinic both at Duke University and Kilimanjaro Christian Medical Centre (KCMC), Dr. Dow has come to realize the reality of the statement, ""no health without mental health."" Her preliminary research evaluating the prevalence of mental health difficulties among HIV-positive adolescents in Tanzania has demonstrated symptoms of depression and trauma are prevalent in the local HIV youth clinic. Despite these findings, there are no psychologists or psychiatrists currently available at KCMC. This proposed career development plan incorporates a multidisciplinary five-year program complete with didactic training in global mental health, research methods and trial design, advanced biostatistics, and management skills for implementing large clinical trials. These didactics closely align with a mentored, patient-oriented research experience designing, adapting, and implementing a mental health intervention in the HIV adolescent clinic. Dr. Dow will receive mentorship from Dr. Coleen Cunningham (Chief, Pediatric Infectious Diseases and Pediatric Global Health), Dr. Karen O'Donnell (Clinical Psychology), Dr. Kathryn Whetten (Director of the Center for Health Policy and Inequalities Research), Dr. Blandina Mmbaga (Co-Site leader KCMC-Duke Collaboration, Professor of Pediatrics), and consultants Dr. John Bartlett (Duke Global Health Institute, DGHI) and Dr. Kathleen Sikkema (Clinical Psychology). Dr. Dow proposes to integrate both a HIV educational curriculum and an intensive cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and life skills training program called SPARCS, into the HIV teen clinic. The first aim is to create a tool kit by adapting both a HIV educational curriculum and SPARCS to be culturally relevant and in Swahili language. The second aim is a feasibility study to determine if SPARCS improves mental health, adherence, and viral outcomes. Based on the work of Dr. Dow's mentors who have successfully implemented trauma-focused CBT among orphans in Tanzania, it is anticipated that SPARCS will also be feasible to implement in a resource-limited setting. The hypothesis is that by addressing mental health needs, youth will demonstrate improved ART adherence and improved virologic outcomes. This project is anticipated to improve both mental and physical health of HIV-positive adolescents in Tanzania and open a dialogue of discussion around mental health difficulties in this setting. Upon completion of this feasibility study and further didactics and mentorship, the candidate plans to submit a R01 grant to evaluate the efficacy of this intervention as a randomized controlled trial, fulfilling her goal of conducting independent global health research to improve the overall health of adolescents living in Tanzania and other resource-limited settings.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project aims to address the mental health treatment gap that exists in the HIV youth clinic in Moshi, Tanzania with the goal of improving adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART) and HIV outcomes. Addressing this treatment gap is highly relevant in two important ways. First, improved ART adherence is important not only for one's own health, but as these youth become sexually active, it also decreases the risk of sexual transmission of HIV to their partners. Second, as perinatally HIV-infected children age into adolescence, their mental health difficulties and traumatic experiences must be addressed to facilitate a healthy and productive adulthood.                ",Integrating Mental Health into a HIV Clinic to Improve Outcomes in Tanzanian Youth,8815436,K01TW009985,"['University Medical Centers ', ' Academic Medical Centers ', ' teenage ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' Adolescence ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Age ', ' Behavior ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Biometrics ', ' Biometry ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' clinical investigation ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' cognitive behavioral treatment ', ' cognitive behavioral therapy ', ' cognitive behavioral modification ', ' cognitive behavioral intervention ', ' cognitive behavior therapy ', ' cognitive behavior modification ', ' cognitive behavior intervention ', ' Cognitive Psychotherapy ', ' Cognition Therapy ', ' Cognitive Therapy ', ' Infectious Disorder ', ' Infectious Diseases and Manifestations ', ' Infectious Diseases ', ' Infectious Disease Pathway ', ' Communicable Diseases ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Comorbidity ', ' Counselor ', ' Professional counselor ', ' Curriculum ', ' Educational Curriculum ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' Information Disclosure ', ' Disclosure ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Faculty ', ' Feasibility Studies ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Hair ', ' Health ', ' Health Tutoring ', ' Health Instruction ', ' Health education ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Health Personnel ', ' healthcare policy ', ' health care policy ', ' Health Policy ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' seropositive (AIDS test) ', ' antigen positive AIDS test ', ' antibody positive AIDS test ', ' HTLV-III Seropositivity ', ' HTLV-III Seroconversion ', ' HIV Seroconversion ', ' HIV Positivity ', ' HIV Positive ', ' HIV Antibody Positivity ', ' Anti-HIV Positivity ', ' AIDS Seropositivity ', ' AIDS Seroconversion ', ' HIV Seropositivity ', ' human T lymphotropic virus III ', ' human T cell leukemia virus III ', ' Human immunodeficiency virus 1 ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Virus Type 1 ', ' HIV1 ', ' HIV-I ', ' HIV-1 ', ' Institutes ', ' Language ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene Services ', ' Mental Health Services ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity -

"Research Training: Socio-Economics of Mental Health Service Delivery in SE Europe DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The University of California, Berkeley and Babes-Bolyai University, Cluj, Romania, propose to provide advanced, multidisciplinary research training to outstanding pre- and post-doctoral economists, psychiatrists, sociologists, clinicians, and mental health professionals from South Eastern Europe (SEE) in the latest research methods and issues regarding the economic and social factors that influence or drive the delivery of mental health care services. We propose to build upon the successful ""Finance and Mental Health Services Training in Czech Republic/Central Europe (5-D43-TW005810-10). Prof. Richard Scheffler, University of California, Berkeley, has been the PI and co-Director of this program for the past ten years. The other co-Director has been Prof. Martin Potucek, Charles University, Prague. During its span, the program has trained over sixty people from Bulgaria, Croatia, Czech Republic, Romania, and Slovakia. The past 5 years of the program has been highly successful by all measures, with over 72 publications and 3 books by its trainees. The PI of our new application will be Prof. Scheffler. Because the Czech Republic is now a high-income economy, we will replace Charles University with a new partner. We propose that the new partner be the new School of Public Health at Babes-Bolyai University (http://www.publichealth.ro/), Cluj-Napoca, Romania. SPH- BBU will serve as the hub of the program in Europe, attracting and screening candidates, and fostering their subsequent career development. Berkeley will continue to be the primary training site, providing senior faculty to mentor the trainees as they take classes, participate in seminars, and engage in research projects in their home countries. The new co-Director will be Razvan Chereches, MD, Ph.D., Babes-Bolyai University. Dr. Chereches has himself been a trainee and a project leader in our previous program. He has also participated in other NIH programs: University of Iowa International Training and Research in Occupational and Environmental Health Program, Fogarty International Center - D43 TW000621; Minority Health and Health Disparities International Research and Training, Fogarty International Center- T37 MD001453-05; and University of Iowa International Collaborative Trauma and Injury Prevention Research and Training Program, Fogarty International Center - D43 TW007261. Just as the previous program expanded from the Czech Republic into four other countries in the region, we intend to start from Romania and Bulgaria, and expand into other LMICs in SEE. The countries of interest currently include Albania, Moldova, and Serbia, but other countries of the former Yugoslavia will also be considered. Expansion into any country always depends on identifying an appropriate institution and persons who can help support qualified and interested trainees. The University of California, Berkeley and Babes-Bolyai University, Cluj, Romania, propose to provide advanced, multidisciplinary research training to outstanding pre- and post-doctoral economists, psychiatrists, sociologists, clinicians, and mental health professionals from South Eastern Europe (SEE) in the latest research methods and issues regarding the economic and social factors that influence or drive the delivery of mental health care services. Following shortcomings in mental health promotion, treatment, access to care, and resource allocation in SEE, our Program, ""Research Training: Socio-Economics of Mental Health Service Delivery in SE Europe,"" seeks to build an international network of mental health experts in SEE and to train the next generation of researchers and leaders in the region, who have a common understanding of current thinking on mental health financing and services. Our research trainees will gain the tools to examine the development and enhancement of public and private mental health service delivery systems from a social, political, and economic frame within their own countries.

"Testing the Community-Based Learning Collaborative Implementation Model DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): One in four U.S. children experience a mental health disorder with severe impairment and/or distress during their childhood. Further, high rates of exposure to violence and abuse are common among youth, particularly among those involved in the child welfare and mental health service systems. Violence exposure presents significant health and mental health consequences for children, with disparities in these experiences among racial/ethnic minority youth, and estimated costs exceeding $124 billion. While evidence-based treatments (EBTs) can prevent and/or reduce these negative effects, these treatments are still not the standard practice of care in many communities. Despite a recent proliferation of implementation research across a variety of settings, an ongoing challenge facing child mental health and child welfare professionals is how to transport and implement these EBTs so that they are readily available, accessible and sustained. The Learning Collaborative training model is being widely disseminated as a way to train community-based therapists to deliver EBTs. However, to date, the effectiveness of this model has not been demonstrated, nor has it been examined as a way to build and strengthen inter-professional relationships across the multiple professionals and agencies involved in providing services to children. Thus, to meet these public health needs, child welfare and mental health professionals must collaborate to improve the availability and sustainment of evidence- based practices for children. This project aims to test an extension of the Learning Collaborative Model, the Community-based Learning Collaborative model, which targets both clinical and non-clinical professionals in the child welfare and mental health service sectors as a way to build and strengthen inter-professional relationships and thereby improve coordination and delivery of evidence-based mental health treatment services. The proposed research offers the opportunity to capitalize on an on-going, statewide implementation project to generate evidence about implementation strategies needed to make EBTs more accessible to children. This study also provides data to inform an R01 effectiveness trial that will utilize a time-series design to rigorously evaluate the effectivenessof the CBLC model as a mechanism to improve access and sustained use of EBTs for children. The proposed mixed-methods study will involve participants (n=150) from two ongoing CBLCs being conducted as part of a statewide, foundation funded training initiative in South Carolina. The study will examine data collected pre/post, weekly and monthly over the 12 month active implementation period. Participants will be recruited for an 18 month follow-up period to examine whether inter-professional and inter-organizational relationships and use of EBTs are sustained over time. New quantitative and qualitative data will be collected during this sustainment phase. The proposed study will demonstrate feasibility and inform development of a large scale, multi-site study that will utilize a time-series design, to examine effectiveness of the CBLC implementation model. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: One in four US children experiences a mental health disorder; violence exposure is highly prevalent and associated with significant mental health consequences for children. Effective treatments exist, but availability is limited, particularly fo traditionally underserved minority children, overrepresented in the child welfare system. This study aims to examine an implementation model designed to build and support collaborations between child welfare and mental health professionals to support sustained delivery of treatments for children.",Testing the Community-Based Learning Collaborative Implementation Model,8896877,R34MH104470,"['Adoption ', ' psychological disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Mental disorders ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' adolescent welfare ', ' Child Welfare ', ' Communities ', ' Foundations ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' Interview ', ' Learning ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene Services ', ' Mental Health Services ', ' Methods ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' Minority Groups ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' recruit ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' Research ', ' South Carolina ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration ', ' SAMHSA ', ' United States Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration ', ' violent behavior ', ' violent ', ' Violence ', ' Mediating ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Youth ', ' Caring ', ' Social Network ', ' base ', ' density ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Clinical ', ' Penetration ', ' Phase ', ' Series ', ' Training ', ' Distress ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' Measurement ', ' Funding ', ' uptake ', ' Collaborations ', ' Exposure to ', ' Nature ', ' Pattern ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' meetings ', ' Services ', ' experience ', ' welfare (mental health) ', ' Participant ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Network Analysis ', ' Pathway Analysis ', ' Modeling ', ' model design ', ' Provider ', ' Effectiveness ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Health system ', ' Child Mental Health ', ' Evidence based practice ', ' Qualitative Methods ', ' Data ', ' Improve Access ', ' Cognitive ', ' underserved minority ', ' under-represented minority ', ' Underrepresented Populations ', ' Underrepresented Groups ', ' Underrepresented Minority ', ' Preparation ', ' Process ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' informant ', ' Behavioral ', ' Healthcare professional ', ' Health Care Professional ', ' Health Professional ', ' Evidence based treatment ', ' effectiveness trial ', ' cost ', ' implementation research ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' childhood traumatic stress ', ' Child Traumatic Stress ', ' prospective ', ' Trauma ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' Impairment ', ' treatment effect ', ' evidence base ', ' effective treatment ', ' effective therapy ', ' ']",NIMH,MEDICAL UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA,R34,2015,261625,0.14971167223538803
"Implementation of a Measurement Feedback System in School Mental Health DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This Mentored Career Development Award (K08) is designed to provide intensive training in developing a strong program of research that investigates the adaptation and implementation of health information technologies within the school context to increase the availability of high-quality mental health interventions for underserved youth and families. A field of implementation science has recently emerged to address the significant gap between the proliferation of evidence-based practices (EBP) for treating youth mental health problems and their use in usual care treatment settings. Nowhere is this gap more apparent than in schools. Schools provide the bulk of youth mental health services (>70%) and effectively reduce service access disparities by ethnicity and socioeconomic status. Nevertheless, implementation research focused on the school context has been disproportionately limited. To address these gaps and advance implementation science, the candidate's long term career objective is to develop effective methods for promoting the use of EBP among mental health providers in educational settings. Standardized assessment (SA) of psychiatric symptoms is a cornerstone of all EBP and has been significantly associated with improvements in treatment- related outcome. Nevertheless, SA is infrequently utilized by school-based providers, resulting in sub-optimal care. Measurement feedback systems (MFS) use the results of SA to deliver information to clinicians about client progress, represent a structured way to introduce SA into service systems, and have the potential to support effective, client-centered care. The candidate's immediate focus is therefore to increase clinicians' administration of SA tools and incorporation of SA feedback into routine practice through the development of a MFS and an accompanying contextualized adaptation process that are designed specifically for schools.  The current K08 Award will uniquely position the candidate to advance this research agenda. His background includes specialized training in child clinical psychology, evidence-based assessment and intervention approaches, research on school-based mental health, mental health services research, and collaboration with community stakeholders. To more effectively bridge the gap between typical and optimal mental health care in schools, he seeks to extend his training to include: (1) design of healthcare technologies that are user-friendly and contextually appropriate, (2) experience with theory and methods to support innovation uptake/implementation in schools, (3) advanced statistics and research methodology, and (4) advanced academic writing. The University of Washington is an outstanding environment in which to engage in the interdisciplinary training required to achieve these training goals. The candidate's primary mentors-Drs. Elizabeth McCauley and Jurgen Unutzer have combined expertise in the assessment and treatment of adolescent psychopathology, training with school-based providers, development of computer products to support evidence-based service delivery, implementation science, and the development and dissemination of measurement feedback tools for client progress monitoring. Additional local and national consultants will contribute expertise in implementation research for youth/family services, user-centered design, school-based mental health, community service provision, decision support tools for youth treatment providers, cultural diversity and mental health care, mental health policy, and qualitative and mixed methods research.  The proposed project draws on the training and expertise above to develop and evaluate a contextually- adapted, web-based MFS for use in school-based health centers (SBHCs) through a series of qualitative, quantitative, and mixed methods research aims. The University of Washington Care Management Tracking System is a MFS, developed by Dr. Unutzer, previously found to result in improved care, symptom reductions, and increased functioning among patients. The current study proposes to use SBHC clinician focus groups and direct clinician feedback to adapt this MFS for use by SBHC clinicians. The candidate's prior research has revealed that SBHC providers infrequently utilize SA measures, but supports the feasibility of using structured, computerized methods to increase SA administration. A sample of SBHC clinicians (n = 20) and youth (n = 64, Aim 3) will participate in the project to advance the following Research Aims: (1) evaluate the SBHC context to inform MFS adaptation; (2) assess the adaptation's effectiveness in context; (3) evaluate the system impact on clinician behavior and youth outcomes; and (4) assess the added utility of providing academic data to school clinicians for use in progress monitoring. SBHC clinicians will provide feedback on the optimal design of the MFS and use it to track outcomes among youth experiencing depression and anxiety. Aims 1 and 2 will be evaluated descriptively, using existing benchmarks when applicable. Aim 3 will be tested experimentally via a small-scale randomized trial in which clinicians (and a subset of their caseloads) will be randomized to one of two conditions: (a) use of the school MFS to monitor progress using SA or (b) assessment as usual. Aim 4 will be tested using the MFS, with randomization of youth to two conditions: (a) clinicians receive the results of SA and students' school attendance data from the MFS or (b) data include SA results only. Based on the results of this work, a R01 grant application will be submitted to investigate the larger-scale implementation of the school MFS and contextualized adaptation process among a range of school service delivery models, allowing for more thorough evaluation of its impact on clinician behavior and student functioning. Evidence-based mental health services are infrequently provided by school-based clinicians, resulting in sub- optimal outcomes for the ""safety net"" populations most likely to receive care in that setting (i.e., low- socioeconomic status, ethnic minority youth). By identifying innovative health technologies that systematically support the implementation of evidence-based practices and adapting them for use in schools, the proposed research and training carries considerable potential to enhance the availability of high-quality care for underserved youth, thereby more effectively alleviating symptoms and promoting functioning across domains.",Implementation of a Measurement Feedback System in School Mental Health,8857260,K08MH095939,"['Anxiety ', ' Attention ', ' Award ', ' Behavior ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Client ', ' Communities ', ' Community Mental Health Services ', ' Computers ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Environment ', ' Exhibits ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' Family ', ' Feedback ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' positive attitude ', ' Happiness ', ' Health ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Health Personnel ', ' healthcare policy ', ' health care policy ', ' Health Policy ', ' services research ', ' Medical Care Research ', ' Healthcare Research ', ' Health Services Evaluation ', ' Health Care Research ', ' Health Services Research ', ' Information Technology Systems ', ' IT Systems ', ' Data Systems ', ' Information Systems ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene Services ', ' Mental Health Services ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' web based ', ' online computer ', ' On-Line Systems ', ' Online Systems ', ' Patients ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Primary Care ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Clinical Psychology ', ' abnormal psychology ', ' Psychopathology ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Research ', ' Research Support ', ' Schools ', ' statistics ', ' Students ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Universities ', ' Washington ', ' Work ', ' Writing ', ' Measures ', ' Reminder Systems ', ' Process Assessment ', ' Process Assessment (Health Care) ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Research Methods ', ' Research Methodology ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' Underinsured ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Youth ', ' RQ2 ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Series ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Adolescent ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Measurement ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' uptake ', ' Collaborations ', ' Multiculturalism ', ' Cultural Diversity ', ' tool ', ' sadness ', ' depressed ', ' Depressed mood ', ' programs ', ' Clinic ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' Best Practice Analysis ', ' Benchmarking ', ' Services ', ' experience ', ' Structure ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Health Care Technology ', ' Health Technology ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' behavioral health ', ' QOC ', ' Quality of Care ', ' theories ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Provider ', ' Effectiveness ', ' low socioeconomic position ', ' low socio-economic status ', ' low socio-economic position ', ' low socioeconomic status ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Evidence based practice ', ' Data ', ' Grant Proposals ', ' Applications Grants ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Randomized ', ' Research Career Program ', ' K-Awards ', ' Career Development Programs K-Series ', ' Career Development Awards and Programs ', ' Career Development Awards ', ' K-Series Research Career Programs ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Research Training ', ' Monitor ', ' Process ', ' Modification ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomic ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio economic ', ' socioeconomics ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Evidence based treatment ', ' neglect ', ' systems research ', ' implementation research ', ' computerized ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' safety net ', ' ethnic minority ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' user-friendly ', ' user centered design ', ' usability ', ' implementation science ', ' evidence base ', ' routine practice ', ' usual care ', ' treatment as usual ', ' health information technology ', ' randomized trial ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,K08,2015,160380,0.09031540477900665
"Regional Network for Mental Health Research in Latin America DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overriding objective of our Hub for Latin America (HLA) is to improve the condition of people with severe mental disorders in Latin America. We propose to do so by making a focused contribution to narrowing the ""mental health gap"". Our long-term goal is to improve health services for people with severe mental disorders until they are equivalent to the best health services offered to people with highly prioritized general health conditions. We envision an integrated system of primary care and secondary mental health services that we refer to as Community Health Care for individuals with Severe Mental Disorders (CHC-SMD). We adopt a multi-pronged approach that is tailored to the distinctive context of the urban areas of Latin America. Our goals for the 5-year grant period are to launch strategic initiatives that will generate significant progress toward CHC-SMD in this region, and to build a platform for ongoing progress over a longer time period.    The HLA brings together key researchers and stakeholders from six cities across Latin America (Santiago, Chile; Rio de Janeiro, Brazil; Buenos Aires, Cordoba, Neuquen, Argentina; Medellin, Colombia) with researchers in New York City in a concerted effort to make progress toward a shared vision of CHC-SMD. The Components are designed to be synergistic so that the impact of the whole HLA is greater than the sum of its parts. The Research Component, for example, proposes to pilot a regional randomized controlled trial (RCT). In order for the HLA to proceed as planned to conduct a full scale regional RCT, the Capacity Building Component will need to train leaders at the HLA sites to conduct RCTs and coordinate regional studies. At the same time, the pilot RCT will help generate this capacity by providing practical experience in RCTs and regional studies.    Our overall specific aims are (a) to deploy and evaluate task shifting approaches that can accelerate progress toward CHC-SMD; (b) to train young leaders with the capacities required to generate ongoing progress toward CHC-SMD; and (c) to bring together multiple stakeholders to contribute to implementing and shaping CHC-SMD. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Within Latin American cities people with severe mental disorders are a vulnerable population whose lives are often characterized by extreme poverty, social exclusion from education, employment, and participation in civil society, multiple traumas including violence and abuse, reduced access to health care and high mortality rates. Equitable development, as endorsed by international conventions, requires the inclusion of this vulnerable population in the benefits of development and the protection of their civil and human rights. The overriding objective of our Hub for Latin America (HLA) is to improve the condition of this vulnerable group through an integrated system of primary care and secondary mental health services tailored to the distinctive context of the urban areas of Latin America.",Regional Network for Mental Health Research in Latin America,9129336,U19MH095718,"['Argentina ', ' Brazil ', ' Chile ', ' Cities ', ' Civil Rights ', ' Colombia ', ' Communities ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Complement ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Employment ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' health care service ', ' Health Services ', ' healthcare service availability ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare access availability ', ' health services availability ', ' health care service availability ', ' health care service access ', ' health care availability ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Availability of Health Services ', ' Accessibility of health care ', ' Access to Healthcare ', ' Access to Health Care ', ' Access to Care ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' Human Rights ', ' Latin America ', ' Leadership ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene Services ', ' Mental Health Services ', ' Mortality ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Multiple Wounds ', ' Multiple Injuries ', ' Multiple Trauma ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' New York City ', ' Poverty ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Primary Care ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Psychiatry ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Strikes ', ' Employee Strikes ', ' Time ', ' Universities ', ' violent behavior ', ' violent ', ' Violence ', ' visual function ', ' Sight ', ' Vision ', ' Community Health Care ', ' Community Healthcare ', ' urban area ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' Shapes ', ' programs ', ' Adopted ', ' Complex ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' Country ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' social inequality ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' Institution ', ' International ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Sum ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' severe mental disorder ', ' serious mental illness ', ' serious mental disorder ', ' persistent mental illness ', ' chronic mental illness ', ' severe mental illness ', ' public health relevance ', ' civil society ', ' ']",NIMH,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,U19,2015,120508,0.05596283974428328
"Organizational Capacity to Eliminate Outcome Disparities under Healthcare Reform Project Summary/Abstract The substance abuse treatment field faces an unprecedented challenge to reduce health disparities among racial and ethnic minority populations. Access to integrated substance abuse, mental health, and HIV prevention care is associated with positive health outcomes and reduced cost. The overall goal of the proposed study is to identify how changes precipitated by the Affordable Care Act (ACA) impact community- based outpatient substance abuse treatment (OSAT) program capacity to expand service delivery in racial and ethnic minority communities and eliminate outcome disparities among African American and Latino clients. The objective for this application is to examine the organizational impact of the current expansion of Medicaid on the capacity of community-based OSAT programs to enhance treatment access and retention among minorities residing in Los Angeles County (L.A.), California by developing and analyzing a panel dataset. Our conceptual framework, grounded in organizational development frameworks investigates the role of organizational capacity (i.e., leadership, readiness for change, Medi-Cal billing) in mediating the effect of Medicaid expansion (referred as Medi-Cal in California) on service delivery (i.e., mental health and HIV prevention services) and on treatment access and retention among African American and Latino clients. In Aim 1 and 2 we will examine baseline data to refine our conceptual model of organizational capacity factors likely to impact the delivery of mental health and HIV prevention services in OSAT programs in racial and ethnic minority communities, prior to ACA enactment. We will resurvey in 2013, 2015 and 2017 the same representative sample of 147 OSAT programs located in minority communities to form a panel data set. These repeated measures of program data will be concatenated with administrative client outcome data (N~10,800 clients) at each data point to examine in Aims 3 and 4 the longitudinal impact of insurance expansion on service delivery in minority communities and rates of access and retention among African American and Latino clients with mental health and HIV risk conditions. The overall public health impact of the proposed study includes identifying promising organizational factors among publicly funded community-based OSAT programs that serve large proportions of low-income minority clients that play a mediating role between the ACA insurance expansion and client-centered process outcomes with the goal of eliminating health disparities. Project Narrative This study will identify how changes precipitated by the Affordable Care Act impact community-based outpatient substance abuse treatment program capacity to expand accessibility to mental health and HIV prevention care in racial and ethnic minority communities in Los Angeles County, California. As such, the public health relevance of this project relies on providing critical information for state insurance administrators, policy makers and community-based providers who seek to develop evidence-informed policies and practices to respond to health care reform and parity legislation and eliminate health disparities.",Organizational Capacity to Eliminate Outcome Disparities under Healthcare Reform,9026799,R33DA035634,"['abstracting ', ' California ', ' Client ', ' Communities ', ' Economics ', ' Elements ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' inducement ', ' Incentives ', ' Insurance ', ' Leadership ', ' Legislation ', ' Statutes and Laws ', ' Los Angeles ', ' Medicaid ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Out-patients ', ' Outpatients ', ' parity ', ' Play ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Research ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Testing ', ' County ', ' Measures ', ' Administrator ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Latino ', ' Mediating ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' HIV/AIDS prevention ', ' HIV Prevention ', ' AIDS/HIV prevention ', ' AIDS prevention ', ' Caring ', ' Organizational Models ', ' base ', ' Phase ', ' Healthcare Reform ', ' Health Care Reform ', ' Policy Maker ', ' Policies ', ' Funding ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Nature ', ' programs ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' Services ', ' Performance ', ' prevention service ', ' treatment program ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' substance abuse ', ' abuse of substances ', ' Substance abuse problem ', ' HIV risk ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' QOC ', ' Quality of Care ', ' response ', ' theories ', ' Provider ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Preparedness ', ' Readiness ', ' Low income ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Improve Access ', ' Subgroup ', ' underserved minority ', ' under-represented minority ', ' Underrepresented Populations ', ' Underrepresented Groups ', ' Underrepresented Minority ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' substance abuse therapy ', ' substance abuse treatment ', ' cost ', ' care systems ', ' treatment organization ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' ethnic minority ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' racial/ethnic ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' addictive disorder ', ' addiction ', ' public health relevance ', ' evidence base ', ' ']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,R33,2015,469823,-0.010166100835864327
"Social Determinants of Primary Care Utilization among Urban Community Mental Health Center Patients with Serious Mental Illness ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This mixed methods study will identify individual and interpersonal factors that are associated with utilization of primary care services among a diverse sample of people with serious mental illness who are receiving mental health care at urban community mental health centers. Background: People with serious mental illnesses face enormous health disparities and are at risk of premature mortality due to medical conditions. Ethnic and racial minorities and women with serious mental illness may encounter even greater health risks. Increasing the utilization of primary care services is a promising way to reduce health disparities among disadvantaged populations. Broad systems-level changes like the Affordable Care Act and the implementation of integrated models of mental health-primary care will make primary care services more accessible to people with serious mental illness. In the context of these systems-level changes, it will be important to understand how individual and interpersonal factors may limit the adequate utilization of available services. The objective of th present study is to identify social factors underlying primary care utilization among people with serious mental illness, thereby providing knowledge regarding specific factors that can be addressed to improve primary care utilization and ultimately reduce the substantial health disparities and premature mortality in this population. This objective is consistent with the goal of the National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities (NIMHD) to support research on factors underlying health disparities. Accordingly, the proposed study has the following specific aims: Aim 1. To prospectively assess the contributions of health literacy, health insurance literacy, mental health stigma, discrimination, and mistrust in the health system on primary care utilization over the course of six months among a racially diverse sample of urban community mental health center patients with SMI. Aim 2 To assess primary care experiences and preferences of a racially diverse sample of urban community mental health center patients with SMI as a function of whether or not patients received primary care in the prior six months. An exploratory aim related to Specific Aim 2 is to examine potential gender and racial/ethnic differences related to primary care experiences and preferences. Methods: The study will employ a sequential mixed-methods design. First, a prospective survey study will be conducted to address Aim 1. Second, using a subsample of participants from the prospective study, focus groups will be conducted to better understand patients' preferences for primary care, and their personal experiences of the social factors assessed in the prospective study. The focus groups will yield critical information as to how the intersection of multiple social identities (e.g., race/ethnicity, gender, having a mental illness) influences patients' primary care experiences and preferences. Student involvement: Consistent with NIMHD's goal to enhance research capacity to create a culturally sensitive workforce, the research team for the proposed study includes undergraduate and graduate students who will receive training health disparities research through their involvement in the study.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This study will provide critical information as to how individual and interpersonal factors serve as barriers to adequate use of primary care services among diverse persons with serious mental illness who are receiving mental health care at urban community mental health centers. Findings will provide new knowledge that can be applied to increase the use of primary care services, and thus potentially reduce significant health disparities and premature mortality in the vulnerable population of people with serious mental illness.            ",Social Determinants of Primary Care Utilization among Urban Community Mental Health Center Patients with Serious Mental Illness,8994609,R15MD010214,"['Affect ', ' psychological disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Mental disorders ', ' manic depressive illness ', ' manic depressive disorder ', ' bipolar disease ', ' bipolar affective disorder ', ' Manic-Depressive Psychosis ', ' Bipolar Affective Psychosis ', ' Bipolar Disorder ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' CMHC ', ' Community Mental Health Centers ', ' Data Collection ', ' diabetes ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Discrimination (Psychology) ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Spanish Americans ', ' Hispanic Americans ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' high blood pressure ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Hypertension ', ' Institutes ', ' Health Insurance ', ' Interview ', ' literacy ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Methods ', ' Michigan ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Mortality ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Persons ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Obesity ', ' Patients ', ' Poverty ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Primary Care ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Prospective Studies ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' recruit ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' Research ', ' Research Support ', ' Risk ', ' schizophrenic ', ' dementia praecox ', ' Schizophrenic Disorders ', ' Schizophrenia ', ' Social Identity ', ' Social Identification ', ' Solutions ', ' Students ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Woman ', ' Gender ', ' Relative ', ' Relative (related person) ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' TimeLine ', ' Caring ', ' racial/ethnic difference ', ' improved ', ' Chronic ', ' Medical ', ' Training ', ' white American ', ' caucasian American ', ' Individual ', ' healthcare utilization ', ' healthcare service utilization ', ' health services utilization ', ' Health Care Utilization ', ' health care service utilization ', ' Premature Mortality ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Baseline Surveys ', ' Patient Preferences ', ' Knowledge ', ' Investigation ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' Services ', ' preference ', ' experience ', ' Participant ', ' graduate student ', ' underclass ', ' economically disadvantaged ', ' Economically Deprived ', ' Economically Deprived Population ', ' General Public ', ' General Population ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' cardiovascular risk ', ' cardiovascular risk factor ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' stigma ', ' social stigma ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' Provider ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' major depression ', ' Major Depressive Disorder ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' Health system ', ' Improve Access ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' minority health ', ' health literacy ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' severe mental disorder ', ' serious mental illness ', ' serious mental disorder ', ' persistent mental illness ', ' chronic mental illness ', ' severe mental illness ', ' care preference ', ' Population ', ' prospective ', ' ethnic minority ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' patient centered ', ' patient oriented ', ' public health relevance ', ' undergraduate student ', ' ']",NIMHD,UNIVERSITY OF DETROIT MERCY,R15,2015,417827,0.06294483122060893
"The Cultural Formulation Interview-Engagement Aid for Mental Health Treatment DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposed Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award (K23) is a four-year plan that will enable the candidate to develop as an intervention development, services researcher with an independent program of research. The goal of this research program is to improve the treatment engagement of underserved racial and ethnic minority populations in mental health settings by developing a cross-cultural communication engagement aid that ascertains relevant cultural views in starting, continuing, and participating in treatment. We will test the intervention's effects on medical communication and patient outcomes.  The training objectives are to: 1) train in intervention development; 2) study how to overcome cultural barriers to engagement, focusing on treatment entry, continuation, and participation; 3) acquire methodological skills to assess how cross-cultural miscommunication leads to treatment disengagement and health disparities; 4) train  in clinical trials methodology and longitudinal data analysis. The application integrates formal course work, mentorship from established investigators, and mentored research activities. Three studies, supported by the candidate's training plan, are proposed that move from intervention development to pilot testing. Project 1 consists of three separate focus groups with patients, clinicians, and administrators to define program objectives, methods, and strategies to promote treatment entry, participation, and continuation of minorities with mental illness. The candidate will present these diverse stakeholders with results from a literature review on these topics to translate theoretical methods into practical strategies. The goals of this 12-month program are to design the intervention, write the first instruction manual for clinicians, and to develop cliniian adherence and competence measures for the intervention. Project 2 is a small, pre-pilot, open study in which trained clinicians will deliver the intervention. Debriefing interviews with patient and clinicians will identify factors affecting feasibility and acceptability with subsequent revisin of the intervention's instruction manual.  An implementation plan will then be revised for clinicians based on the adapted intervention with fidelity indicators. Project 3 is a small pilot RCT to examine the feasibility and acceptability of the adapted intervention and explore its initia efficacy versus usual care at a public outpatient mental health clinic. Drawing from implementation mapping, a Scientific Advisory Board (SAB) consisting of patients, clinicians, administrators, mentors, and consultants will be used to incorporate the perspectives of multiple stakeholders in all projects.  Results from these projects will serve as pilot data to apply for subsequent grants. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This K23 prepares the candidate to initiate an independent research program on developing cross-cultural communication interventions to engage minorities in mental health treatment. This project responds to Objectives 3 and 4 of the NIMH Strategic Plan calling for the development of interventions that address the needs of diverse people with mental illness and that translate research findings into clinical practice to enhance the NIMH's public health mission.",The Cultural Formulation Interview-Engagement Aid for Mental Health Treatment,8889306,K23MH102334,"['Affect ', ' psychological disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Mental disorders ', ' clinical investigation ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Communication ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' Interview ', ' Language ', ' Manuals ', ' Maps ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methods ', ' Method LOINC Axis 6 ', ' Methodology ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Mission ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' NIMH ', ' National Institute of Mental Health (U.S.) ', ' Out-patients ', ' Outpatients ', ' Patients ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Testing ', ' Translating ', ' Vocabulary Words ', ' Vocabulary ', ' white race ', ' Occidental ', ' Caucasoid Race ', ' Caucasoid ', ' Caucasian Race ', ' Caucasian ', ' Caucasians ', ' Work ', ' Writing ', ' CFI ', ' chemotactic factor inactivator ', ' Measures ', ' Administrator ', ' Competence ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' communication behavior ', ' improved ', ' prematurity ', ' premature ', ' Medical ', ' Training ', ' Research Activity ', ' instructional intervention ', ' Training Intervention ', ' Instruction Intervention ', ' Education for Intervention ', ' Educational Intervention ', ' Review Literature ', ' programs ', ' inattentiveness ', ' inattention ', ' Side ', ' Clinic ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' Formulation ', ' Drug Formulations ', ' communication aid ', ' Services ', ' preference ', ' skills ', ' social ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Address ', ' Adherence ', ' Adherence (attribute) ', ' Data ', ' Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award (K23) ', ' K23 Program ', ' K23 Mechanism ', ' K23 Award ', ' Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award ', ' Strategic Planning ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' Instruction ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' ethnic minority ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' racial/ethnic ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' therapy design ', ' treatment development ', ' intervention development ', ' develop therapy ', ' therapy development ', ' evidence base ', ' usual care ', ' treatment as usual ', ' intervention effect ', ' clinical practice ', ' ']",NIMH,NEW YORK STATE PSYCHIATRIC INSTITUTE,K23,2015,183636,0.06436877254248255
"Mental Health Impact and Service Use Among Asian Survivors and Rescuers Exposed      DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The impact of the World Trade Center (WTC) attack on those directly exposed to it is long-lasting and affects their day-to-day living. Due to the proximity of Chinatown to the disaster site and a large number of South Asians working in the WTC and nearby buildings, Asian Americans (AA) constituted a sizeable proportion of those exposed to the attack. The trauma has created major challenges for mental health professionals. While dozens of studies have investigated the mental health impact of the attack on the survivors, few have included Asians in their study samples. Objectives: this investigation targets the Asian community and attempts to assess the mental health impact of the trauma to individuals directly exposed to the attack, and to understand their mental health service use patterns so as to more effective in reaching out to them. The literature has indicated that due to cultural impact AA tend to emphasize the somatic expression of emotional distress, attribute immense stigma to mental illness itself and to mental health service use. As a result, delay in treatment and the use of medical care to address physical symptoms of emotional distress is common. Since 71% of AA in New York City are immigrants, language barriers, lack of knowledge about services, and the paucity of bilingual services also created practical barriers to service use. Acculturation stress and the prolonged economic setbacks around Chinatown following the attack also aggravated the stress they experienced. PTSD resulting from recent trauma has hardly been studied among AA. The WTC attack offers a unique test case to understand the impact of PTSD among AA, to see if the widely recognized disaster had ameliorating effect on help-seeking, and if 9/11-designated programs succeeded in reaching out to AA. Design & Methods: to address the knowledge gap, secondary data analyses will be conducted using the large study of WTC Health Registry focusing on survivors and rescuers of the attack. The Registry has 3 waves of data with a large Asian sample of 4,885. The longitudinal study spanning over 9 years also extends the horizon of existing studies. Mental health impact and mental health and medical care service use among AA will be studied and compared against the Whites as a reference group. Subsample analyses of the rescue and recovery workers and Chinese Americans would also be done to provide an occupational focus and to examine the largest Asian ethnic group. Specific aims of the study are: 1)To assess the short-, medium-, and long-term mental health impact of the WTC attack on AA, its course and related risk factors, and to compare to those of the Whites; 2) To examine patterns of mental health service use and identify the enabling factors vs. barriers affecting service use among AA, and compare them with these factors among Whites, to better understand racial disparities; 3)To examine the relationship between psychological distress and medical care use among AA and Whites, and the impact of comorbidity of psychological and physical distress on their use of medical care service, to illuminate processes underlying racial disparities.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This study attempts to assess the short-, medium-, and long-term mental health impact of Post Traumatic Syndrome Disorder and its risk factors among Asian Americans after the World Trade Center attack, and compare the pattern to that of the Whites. It also examines Asians' mental health service use patterns and the facilitating factors and barriers to help seeking. This study has important policy implications for improving treatment to this sizeable but understudied subgroup affected by the attack, so that more effective effort could be developed to reach out to this group which has a history of being the lowest mental health service users compared to other races.            ",Mental Health Impact and Service Use Among Asian Survivors and Rescuers Exposed ,8908929,U01OH010516,[''],NIOSH,FORDHAM UNIVERSITY,U01,2015,362385,0.03002712122831701
"Building Community Capacity for Disability Prevention for Minority Elders DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Although minority elders represent the fastest growing segment of an aging US population, they have less access to mental health care and prevention of disability, lagging well behind non-Latino whites, and suffering significant disparities. Blacks and Latinos have the greatest risk for disability, with striking disparities in healthy aging. This includes elderly immigrants who exhibit elevated depressive and anxiety symptoms, and higher rates of disability than the native-born population; yet, they often go undiagnosed or underdiagnosed. This is a missed opportunity given that mood disorder treatment has been shown to reduce disability days and that several risk factors for disability, such as functional mobility are modifiable. Research suggests that a contributing factor may be an insufficient supply of professional providers and the inability of evidence based treatments to reach and be acceptable to minority elders. An IOM committee recently reported that the severe workforce shortages in providing mental health care to elder adults required novel approaches to resolve. To address these disparities and prevent disability among minority elders, the proposed R01 examines how to successfully build collaborative research for the provision of evidence-based mental health and disability prevention treatments in community-based settings. Promising results in a few international studies show improved access and quality of mental health outcomes and reduced disability when interventions are delivered by Community Health Workers. Yet limited and inconsistent evidence of the efficacy of CHW-led interventions in the US context remains. While the number of community-based health interventions has grown exponentially to address these service disparities, there is a lack of systematic assessment of whether they lead to increased community capacity and systems change, and whether they improve the quality of care and potentially decrease disability. Our proposed study endeavors to address this limitation. As such, the proposed R01 will be one of few efforts that simultaneously study the three components necessary for a successful intervention: efficacy, since the intervention must work, acceptability among clients, and feasibility and sustainability within the organization. It seeks to understand the role of the partnerships in increasing community capacity for a combined mental health and disability prevention intervention, and evaluating the acceptability, efficacy, feasibility and sustainability of the intervention delivere by CHWs and exercise trainers to Latino, African American and Asian elders with moderate to severe mood symptoms and at risk of disability. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The rapid expansion of the aging population is outstripping the development of mental health and disability prevention services necessary to respond to their needs. The proposed revised R01 aims to evaluate whether partnerships between academic researchers, minority elders, and the community-based organizations which serve them can expand community resources and capabilities to effectively provide mental health services and reduce the risk of disability in minority elders.",Building Community Capacity for Disability Prevention for Minority Elders,8911750,R01AG046149,"['functional capacity ', ' functional ability ', ' daily living functionality ', ' Activities of everyday life ', ' Activities of Daily Living ', ' Adoption ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Affect ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Elderly ', ' Aging ', ' psychological disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Client ', ' Communities ', ' Environment ', ' Physical Exercise ', ' Exercise ', ' Exhibits ', ' Health ', ' Language ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene Services ', ' Mental Health Services ', ' Moods ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Patients ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Support ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Strikes ', ' Employee Strikes ', ' Testing ', ' Work ', ' oriental ', ' Asians ', ' Native People ', ' Indigenous Population ', ' Native-Born ', ' Generic Drugs ', ' generic ', ' Nonproprietary Drugs ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' depressive ', ' depression symptom ', ' Emotional Depression ', ' depressive symptoms ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Latino ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Acute ', ' Chronic ', ' prematurity ', ' premature ', ' Training ', ' mental ', ' Psyche structure ', ' disability ', ' using substances ', ' substance use ', ' AOD use ', ' Alcohol or Other Drugs use ', ' Relative Risks ', ' Immigrant ', ' bilingualism ', ' sadness ', ' depressed ', ' Depressed mood ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Adopted ', ' Clinic ', ' Source ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' Country ', ' Organ System ', ' body system ', ' Affective Disorders ', ' Mood Disorders ', ' meetings ', ' Services ', ' prevention service ', ' Prevention ', ' personnel ', ' Manpower ', ' Human Resources ', ' Reporting ', ' Emotional ', ' Modeling ', ' QOC ', ' Quality of Care ', ' stigma ', ' social stigma ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Provider ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Low income ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Improve Access ', ' International ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' Community Health ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Evidence based treatment ', ' years of life lost to disease ', ' years of life lost to disability ', ' disease burden ', ' burden of disease ', ' burden of illness ', ' Minority ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel approaches ', ' new approaches ', ' novel strategies ', ' therapy efficacy ', ' therapeutically effective ', ' therapeutic efficacy ', ' intervention efficacy ', ' Treatment Efficacy ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Evidence based intervention ', ' population aging ', ' aging population ', ' healthy aging ', ' community setting ', ' evidence base ', ' successful intervention ', ' efficacy testing ', ' ']",NIA,CAMBRIDGE HEALTH ALLIANCE,R01,2015,290930,0.032416395899690656
"Improving Metabolic Screening in Diverse Severely Mentally Ill Populations DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application for a K23 Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award will support critical additional training for the candidate, Dr. Christina Mangurian, a psychiatrist at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF), based at San Francisco General Hospital. Dr. Mangurian's research plan focuses on improving metabolic screening among ethnically and racially diverse severely mentally ill populations served in community mental health clinics. To further develop her career as a mental health services researcher and to accomplish her research plan, she requires specific training in three areas: 1) clinical research methods (e.g., biostatistics, epidemiology, and mixed methods); 2) implementation research; and 3) mental health disparities research.  Dr. Mangurian has assembled a multidisciplinary team of mentors to facilitate her training and research. Her primary mentor is Dr. Dean Schillinger, a UCSF primary care internist with international expertise in primary care health services research, including implementation research in public health settings. He will oversee all training and research plans, providing his wealth of experience in this field, including his dedication to improving services for underserved populations. His expertise will be complemented by Dr. Martha Shumway, a UCSF mental health services researcher; and Dr. John Newcomer, a Washington University clinical investigator who is an expert in clinical and laboratory measurement of metabolic risk in severely mentally ill populations and in the translation of monitoring objectives into clinical practice.  People with severe mental illness die, on average, 25 years earlier than the general population, most often from cardiovascular disease. Metabolic abnormalities (e.g., diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia) resulting from antipsychotic medications used to treat this population can lead to increased rates of cardiovascular disease. Despite national guidelines emphasizing the importance of screening, metabolic screening rates for this population remain low. There is an urgent need for evidence-based, generalizable interventions that can be feasibly implemented to improve metabolic screening at community mental health clinics where this vulnerable population is primarily served. Therefore, in Aim 1, Dr. Mangurian proposes to characterize metabolic screening rates among adults with severe mental illness who receive services at community mental health clinics in San Francisco County. In Aim 2, she will tailor an intervention to improve metabolic screening for adults with severe mental illness by engaging multiple stakeholders and focusing on barriers that may impact high-risk racial/ethnic subpopulations. In Aim 3, she will conduct a pilot study of the intervention. The results of this research will contribute new information about implementation efforts to improve metabolic screening in community mental health clinics and will form the basis of an R01 application to study the effectiveness of this intervention. The majority of people with severe mental illness are prescribed antipsychotic medications, many of which result in metabolic abnormalities (e.g., dyslipidemia, diabetes) and in turn increase cardiovascular risk. We will evaluate whether a pragmatic intervention - a mandatory annual metabolic screening visit by a psychiatrist, which is linked to a web-based electronic referral and clinical decision support tool - can be feasibly implemented at community mental health clinics to enhance early detection and treatment of metabolic disorders and thereby reduce the high prevalence of cardiovascular disease among people with severe mental illness.",Improving Metabolic Screening in Diverse Severely Mentally Ill Populations,8890224,K23MH093689,"['adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Attention ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Biometrics ', ' Biometry ', ' California ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' Clinical Investigator ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Communities ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Complement ', ' Dedications ', ' diabetes ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Electronics ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Goals ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' services research ', ' Medical Care Research ', ' Healthcare Research ', ' Health Services Evaluation ', ' Health Care Research ', ' Health Services Research ', ' General Hospitals ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' high blood pressure ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Hypertension ', ' Laboratories ', ' Language ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Medicaid ', ' Medicine ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene Services ', ' Mental Health Services ', ' Mentally Ill ', ' Mental Patients ', ' Mentally Ill Persons ', ' Mentors ', ' metabolism disorder ', ' Thesaurismosis ', ' Metabolic Disorder ', ' Metabolic Diseases ', ' Methods ', ' web based ', ' online computer ', ' On-Line Systems ', ' Online Systems ', ' pilot study ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Primary Care ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Psychiatrist ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Publications ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Research Design ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Risk ', ' San Francisco ', ' Solutions ', ' Target Populations ', ' Time ', ' Neuroleptics ', ' Neuroleptic Drugs ', ' Neuroleptic Agents ', ' Major Tranquilizing Agents ', ' Major Tranquilizers ', ' Antipsychotics ', ' Antipsychotic Drugs ', ' Antipsychotic Agents ', ' Translations ', ' Universities ', ' Washington ', ' wt gain ', ' body weight increase ', ' body weight gain ', ' Weight Increase ', ' Weight Gain ', ' County ', ' Research Methods ', ' Research Methodology ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Surface ', ' Clinical ', ' Link ', ' Ensure ', ' Training ', ' Dyslipidemias ', ' Measurement ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' uptake ', ' Internist ', ' Metabolic ', ' tool ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Complex ', ' Clinic ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' Clinical Decision Support Systems ', ' Visit ', ' Services ', ' early detection ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' research study ', ' General Public ', ' General Population ', ' cardiovascular risk ', ' cardiovascular risk factor ', ' Modeling ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' Provider ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Effectiveness of Interventions ', ' Grant Proposals ', ' Applications Grants ', ' High Prevalence ', ' International ', ' Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award (K23) ', ' K23 Program ', ' K23 Mechanism ', ' K23 Award ', ' Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award ', ' Research Training ', ' underserved minority ', ' under-represented minority ', ' Underrepresented Populations ', ' Underrepresented Groups ', ' Underrepresented Minority ', ' Monitor ', ' implementation research ', ' underserved people ', ' under served population ', ' Underserved Population ', ' Minority ', ' severe mental disorder ', ' serious mental illness ', ' serious mental disorder ', ' persistent mental illness ', ' chronic mental illness ', ' severe mental illness ', ' Population ', ' Evidence based intervention ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' early therapy ', ' Early treatment ', ' racial/ethnic ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' high risk ', ' evidence base ', ' clinical practice ', ' randomized trial ', ' screening ', ' ']",NIMH,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",K23,2015,177687,0.07961161349438568
"Predictors of Achievement from Early Childhood to Adulthood ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project will significantly contribute to the growing body of research on physical attractiveness as a source of social stratification that has wide implications for health, akin to more frequently studied factors like race and gender. Health is an integral component of the approach to this project-as a dimension of physical attractiveness (e.g., weight), as a mechanism by which physical attractiveness has effects on social and academic achievement (e.g., mental health), and because the adult socioeconomic attainment that is expected to reflect histories of physical attractiveness is a fundamental component of lifelong health and health disparities. This project also will provide a practical service to the feld by expanding a public use data set so that it can be used to study the role of attractiveness in a wide variety of outcomes, including health behaviors and health disparities. Specifically, the project will create the most comprehensive longitudinal data ever amassed of physical attractiveness from infancy through adolescence by re-coding videotapes that were already gathered at nearly a dozen time points in the NICHD Study of Early Child Care and Youth Development. It will describe trajectories of beauty in this cohort and test important hypotheses derived from an integrative theoretical model put forward in a new book by the investigators. Based on status characteristics and life course theory as well as developmental systems and stigma perspectives, beauty's association with higher achievement is expected to operate through mental health mechanisms, including positive mood, perceived competence, and self esteem. These mental health resources are expected to counteract some of the ways being good looking could distract from schooling (i.e., physical assets might accentuate desires to climb the social ladder as young people move into and through adolescence and its associated peer contexts). Differences in the strength of associations by social location (gender, race/ethnicity, SES), by developmental period (early childhood, elementary, junior, and high school), and by ecological contexts (schools) will also be examined. The results of this project, and the new source of public use data created through the project, will stimulate future developmental, social psychological, and public health research on physical attractiveness as a stratifying force. These results will be written up for academic journal articles and also widely disseminated, which is important given the public, media and policy interest in the topic.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project will significantly contribute to the growing body of research on physical attractiveness as a source of social stratification with wide implications for health, akin to more frequently studied factors like race and gender.

This project also will provide a practical service to the field by expanding a public use data set so that it can be used to study the role of attractiveness in a wide array of outcomes, including health behaviors and disparities.            ",Predictors of Achievement from Early Childhood to Adulthood,8884956,R01HD081022,"['Achievement Attainment ', ' Achievement ', ' teenage ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' Adolescence ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Archives ', ' Attention ', ' Beauty ', ' Parturition ', ' Birth ', ' Books ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Puericulture ', ' Child Care ', ' Data Sources ', ' Demographic Factors ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Discrimination (Psychology) ', ' Economics ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' Health Resources ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' Legislation ', ' Statutes and Laws ', ' life course ', ' Life Cycle ', ' Life Cycle Stages ', ' long-term study ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' Marketing ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Methods ', ' Theoretic Models ', ' Theoretical model ', ' Persons ', ' well-being ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' Psychologist ', ' Psychology ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Salaries ', ' Wages ', ' Schools ', ' self esteem ', ' Social Class ', ' socioenvironment ', ' social context ', ' social climate ', ' Social Environment ', ' sociologist ', ' Sociology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Videotape ', ' Weight ', ' Work ', ' Writing ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', ' Competence ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Youth ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' base ', ' career ', ' court ', ' improved ', ' Biological ', ' psychological ', ' psychologic ', ' Economical Factors ', ' Economic Factors ', ' infantile ', ' infancy ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' Discipline ', ' young adulthood ', ' adult youth ', ' young adult ', ' Policies ', ' Inequality ', ' Sample Size ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' journal article ', ' Staging ', ' Shapes ', ' Consensus ', ' Dimensions ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Source ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' Location ', ' interest ', ' Services ', ' early experience ', ' experience ', ' early childhood ', ' high school ', ' cohort ', ' peer ', ' Academic achievement ', ' social ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Modeling ', ' stigma ', ' social stigma ', ' theories ', ' repository ', ' middle school ', ' junior high ', ' junior high school ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Legal ', ' Data ', ' NICHD ', ' National Institute of Child Health and Human Development ', ' Stratification ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomic ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio economic ', ' socioeconomics ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' human capital ', ' positive mood ', ' Outcome ', ' comparative ', ' public health relevance ', ' public health research ', ' population health ', ' ']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT CHICAGO,R01,2015,328481,0.059004003885058234
"Implementing Health Care Interventions for Hispanics with Serious Mental Illness DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Compared to majority whites with serious mental illness (SMI; e.g., schizophrenia), racial/ethnic minorities with SMI are at higher risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD). Although promising treatments (e.g., care manager interventions) exist to improve the health of people with SMI, limited attention has been paid to the process of making these interventions culturally relevant to Hispanics with SMI and to promote their use in the public mental health system. The objective of this Mentored Research Scientist Development Award (K01) is to prepare the candidate to become an independent investigator in implementation research to address the disparities in physical health care faced by underserved minorities with SMI. A mentoring team, led by Drs. Lewis-Fernandez and Druss, will guide the candidate in achieving the following training objectives: 1) obtain training in implementation research, focusing on community-based participatory research (CBPR) approaches as a translational strategy; 2) develop expertise on the integration of physical and mental health care for people with SMI; 3) acquire new skills in using intervention mapping and qualitative methods to inform intervention research; and 4) obtain training in clinical trial methodology and longitudinal data analysis. The application integrates course work, mentorship from established investigators, and mentored research activities. The research plan uses a collaborative intervention planning framework that blends principles of CBPR and intervention mapping to modify and assess the feasibility and acceptability of an existing care manager intervention. This 12-month intervention focuses on improving patient activation and the coordination of medical care between outpatient mental health clinics and primary care. The proposed project uses a multiphase approach supported by the candidate's training plan. In Phase 1, a community advisory board composed of researchers and stakeholders will be assembled to learn and review the intervention and make initial modifications. During Phase 2, qualitative methods - patient focus groups and stakeholder interviews - will be used to ensure that the modifications are acceptable to all stakeholders. In Phase 3, results from Phase 2 are used to further modify the intervention, develop an implementation plan, and train two care managers on the modified intervention. Phase 4 consists of a 12-month open pilot study (N = 30) to assess the feasibility and acceptability of the modified intervention and explore its effect. Lastly, Phase 5 will focus on analysis of pilot study data and preparation of an R01 proposal. The research plan will yield pilot data for a subsequent R01 to conduct a randomized controlled trial to test the effectiveness and implementation of the modified intervention. This K01 prepares the candidate to develop an independent program of research focused on the implementation of integrated physical and mental health services in the public mental health system to improve the physical health and wellness of underserved minorities with SMI. This project responds to objectives 3 and 4 of the NIMH Strategic Plan which call for the development of better interventions that incorporate the needs of diverse people with mental illness and ensures the translation of research findings into clinical practice to enhance NIMH's public health mission.",Implementing Health Care Interventions for Hispanics with Serious Mental Illness,8794469,K01MH091118,"['Attention ', ' psychological disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Mental disorders ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' clinical investigation ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Communities ', ' Community Services ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Health ', ' healthcare service availability ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare access availability ', ' health services availability ', ' health care service availability ', ' health care service access ', ' health care availability ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Availability of Health Services ', ' Accessibility of health care ', ' Access to Healthcare ', ' Access to Health Care ', ' Access to Care ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' interventions research ', ' interventional study ', ' interventional research ', ' intervention research ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' Interview ', ' Learning ', ' Maps ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene Services ', ' Mental Health Services ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methods ', ' Method LOINC Axis 6 ', ' Methodology ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Mission ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' NIMH ', ' National Institute of Mental Health (U.S.) ', ' Out-patients ', ' Outpatients ', ' Patients ', ' pilot study ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' Primary Care Physician ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Primary Care ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Risk ', ' schizophrenic ', ' dementia praecox ', ' Schizophrenic Disorders ', ' Schizophrenia ', ' Social Workers ', ' Solutions ', ' Suggestion ', ' Testing ', ' Washington ', ' Work ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Hispanics ', ' Caring ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Phase ', ' Medical ', ' Ensure ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Research Activity ', ' Collaborations ', ' Letters ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' Metabolic ', ' programs ', ' Clinic ', ' Reaction ', ' Source ', ' Height ', ' physical health ', ' physical conditioning ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' research in practice ', ' R.N.

"Addressing Mental Health Disparities in Refugee ChildrenL A CBPR Collaboration DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In the US, refugee children and families face dramatic disparities in the incidence and treatment of mental health disorders. Resettlement stressors (poverty, limited access to care) and acculturative challenges (differences in cultural norms, discrimination) often exacerbate risks due to war-related trauma exposure. Commonly, refugee mental health services are limited-usually with a narrow focus on clinical treatment of PTSD-and rarely respond to the holistic needs of refugee communities; few interventions are designed to be used across cultures and refugee groups, despite rapidly evolving refugee demographics in the US. The cross-cultural application of community-based participatory research (CBPR) methods can increase understanding of risk and protective factors in refugee communities and contribute to development of flexible mental health interventions to address disparities. This CBPR project builds on an existing collaborative research relationships with the Somali Bantu refugee community in Greater Boston. Preliminary research has identified numerous cultural and community strengths as well as ongoing problems of family conflict, poor parent-child communication which interact with ongoing stressors to increase risks for child emotional and behavioral problems. Family-based intervention models adapted via local input and delivered by trained members of the community hold great promise for use among these and other refugee groups in the US. This study will use CBPR mixed methods (qualitative and quantitative data collection) to conduct needs assessments and design and evaluate a core family-based intervention. Project activities will emphasize capacity building in two refugee communities resettled in Greater Boston-the Somali Bantu and the Bhutanese-actively engaging refugee community members, community advisory boards, services providers, and other stakeholders. Specific Aims are to: (1) deepen partnerships with the Somali Bantu and Bhutanese communities through co-leadership, capacity-building, and knowledge sharing; (2) collect and apply qualitative data to (a) prepare a needs assessment of mental health in children and adolescents, barriers to care, and services preferences with each target refugee group; (b) develop mental health/psychosocial assessments for refugee caregivers and children; (c) adapt the core components of a family-based strengthening intervention for use with refugees; and (3) conduct an 80-family pilot study to examine acceptability and sustainability of the intervention. Key outcomes will be improvements in caregiver-child relationships, mental health services access, increased functioning, and reduced mental health symptoms in children and adolescents.         RELEVANCE (See instructions): The proposed study will employ cross-cultural CBPR methods to develop a family-based intervention grounded in needs assessments on contributors to mental health disparities among refugee children and families. The mixed methods research approach to selecting, adapting and implementing culturally-informed assessments and intervention models has the potential to contribute to feasible, acceptable and sustainable intervention models of mental health services for diverse groups of refugee children and families.

"Emerging Regulatory Capacity in Low-income Mexican American Children DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The identification of early life precursors to psychopathology in a high risk population has considerable promise for efforts to mitigate the public health burden of mental disorders. Hispanic children, members of the fastest growing ethnic group in the US, are more than twice as likely as non-Hispanic white children to be raised in poverty, and considerable research documents deleterious effects of poverty and ethnic minority status on brain development, stress physiology, development of social and emotional regulatory capacity, and lifespan mental and physical health. To better understand developmental precursors to psychopathology in very low- income ethnic minority children, we propose to capitalize on data collected by an NIMH-funded longitudinal study of Mexican American mothers and infants (""Las Madres Nuevas"") that addressed maternal mental health and mother-infant coregulation across the first two postpartum years. The proposed project will focus on the children from Las Madres Nuevas as they approach a critical developmental transition period (ages 3-6). We will chart trajectories of cognitive, emotional, social, and behavioral competence, with the goal of early identification and predication of points at which elevated risk for disorder emerges. Our project will focus on the emergence of self-regulatory skills from early life mother-infant coregulation as a central mechanism by which early life risk factors translate into lifespan health outcomes for low-income children. The development of self- regulatory ability is a critical foundation for lifespan mental health, but Hispanic children and children from disadvantaged environments are at risk of impaired self-regulatory skills as they enter kindergarten. Our scientific approach emphasizes the cultural embeddedness of development, with the view that child outcomes must be examined with attention to cultural forces that shape and give meaning to self-regulation and mental health. We also address the role of early life biological susceptibility in shaping children's developing regulatory skills. In combination, this project holds great potential to address central questions about cultural, biological, and environmental contributions to adaptive regulatory capacity; identify early precursors to psychopathology in a high risk ethnic group; and enhance opportunities for translation to treatment and prevention. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Children raised in poverty face significantly elevated risk for developmental deficits, behavioral and emotional health problems, and poor lifespan mental and physical health. Ethnic minority status compounds the risk, but little is known about mechanisms of risk or cultural-contextual factors that may mitigate risk. A central goal of this project is to unravel developmental pathways that lead to positive or negative adaptation for minority children in a high risk context, information critical for identifying modifiable targets for intervention and prevention programs.",Emerging Regulatory Capacity in Low-income Mexican American Children,8880263,R01HD083027,"['Cultural Assimilation ', ' Acculturation ', ' Age ', ' Attention ', ' Behavior ', ' psychological disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Natural Products ', ' Biologic Factor ', ' Biological Factors ', ' Parturition ', ' Birth ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Brain ', ' Censuses ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' childrearing ', ' Child Rearing ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Emotions ', ' Environment ', ' Ethnic group ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' Family ', ' Foundations ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Therapeutic Hydrocortisone ', ' Proctocort ', ' Pregn-4-ene-3,20-dione, 11,17,21-trihydroxy-, (11beta)- ', ' Nutracort ', ' Hytone ', ' Hydrocortone ', ' Eldecort ', ' Dermacort ', ' Cortril ', ' Cortispray ', ' Cortisol ', ' Cortenema ', ' Cortef ', ' Cort-Dome ', ' Cetacort ', ' Aeroseb-HC ', ' Hydrocortisone ', ' Immigrations ', ' In-Migration ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Income ', ' Infant ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' lifespan ', ' life span ', ' Length of Life ', ' Longevity ', ' long-term study ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Chicanos ', ' Chicanas ', ' Mexican Americans ', ' Mothers ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' NIMH ', ' National Institute of Mental Health (U.S.) ', ' Parents ', ' Physiology ', ' Poverty ', ' abnormal psychology ', ' Psychopathology ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Self Regulation ', ' Informal Social Control ', ' Social Development ', ' Socialization ', ' Stress ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' Translations ', ' white race ', ' Occidental ', ' Caucasoid Race ', ' Caucasoid ', ' Caucasian Race ', ' Caucasian ', ' Caucasians ', ' adaptive behavior ', ' adaptation behavior ', ' Adaptive Behaviors ', ' Competence ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Hispanics ', ' Postpartum ', ' Postpartum Period ', ' Biological ', ' Link ', ' Evaluation ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Predisposition ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' Individual ', ' Funding ', ' Immigrant ', ' Shapes ', ' Filamentous Fungi ', ' Molds ', ' Life ', ' Pattern ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' expression of emotion ', ' emotional expression ', ' showing emotion ', ' physical health ', ' physical conditioning ', ' Application Context ', ' contextual factors ', ' experience ', ' parallel processing ', ' intervention program ', ' unborn ', ' prenatal ', ' skills ', ' Prevention program ', ' member ', ' disease risk ', ' disorder risk ', ' Prevention ', ' social ', ' Early identification ', ' Impulsivity ', ' Emotional ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' behavioral health ', ' kindergarten ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Low income ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Cognitive ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' Process ', ' Cardiac ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomic ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio economic ', ' socioeconomics ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' Minority ', ' resilience ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Impairment ', ' ethnic minority ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' high risk ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' Research Domain Criteria ', ' ']",NICHD,ARIZONA STATE UNIVERSITY-TEMPE CAMPUS,R01,2015,563463,0.035446469903747814
"UCLA-South Africa Center for Chronic Mental Disorders DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Fogarty International Center has recognized the need for collaborative research training programs between the U.S. and institutions in low and middle income countries that focus on chronic non-communicable diseases (NCD). In response to PAR 10-257, NCD Lifespan Award and the South African Governmental Report, Revitalizing Clinical Research, which calls for the training of master's-level students to improve their capacit to conduct addiction mental health research and provide additional clinical services, we propose to develop the Tirisano Training Project, or TTP (Tirisano means ""working together"" in Tswana). A collaborative training program between UCLA and several South African Universities and Institutions including faculty from the University of Cape Town (UCT), the University of Stellenbosch, the Human Sciences Research Council, and North West University will increase the clinical and research skills of South African post-bachelor, master's and doctoral-level students and early career mental health professionals. Expanding upon the infrastructure and lessons learned from our Fogarty-funded Phodiso trauma and health disparities research training program for South Africa scholars, TTP focuses on chronic stress and non-communicable chronic mental health disorders including substance abuse, depression, and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) across the life course. TTP addresses the dearth of South African researchers by targeting the ""pipeline"" challenge and training scholars at diverse points of the academic career path. Guided by a multi-dimensional conceptual model of risks and resilience resources over the lifespan, trainees will be provided the tools to develop and test novel models and methods to implement effective substance abuse and mental health interventions within the South African context. The Specific Aims are to: 1) Implement a short-, medium-, and long-term multidisciplinary training program at UCLA and in South Africa for master's and doctoral-level students and early career mental health professionals drawn from clinical staff working in nursing, social work, psychiatry and public health to enhance their knowledge and skills in the areas of chronic stress and non-communicable chronic mental health disorders (Track A Scholars; cumulative n=16); 2) Implement a short-term multidisciplinary training program in South Africa for post-bachelor, master's and doctoral-level students in nursing, social work, and public health to enhance their knowledge and skills in the area of chronic stress and non-communicable chronic mental health disorders (Track B Scholars; cumulative n=100); 3) Evaluate the TTP processes, including the mentoring, research skills, and career support provided, as well as the career trajectories and accomplishments of the Track A Scholars over 10 years; and 4) Assess the sustainability and integration of TTP into academic, private, and government agencies that provide substance abuse and mental health research and services. Future goals will include encouraging the South African government to support, endorse, and adopt TTP as a successful and replicable model of cross-cultural clinical research training. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The UCLA-South Africa Tirisano Training Project (TTP) seeks five years of funding to prepare future investigators to conduct research on chronic stress and non-communicable chronic mental health disorders including substance abuse, depression, and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) across the life course. As an international collaboration between UCLA and several South African Universities and Institutions, including the University of Cape Town (UCT), the University of Stellenbosch, the Human Sciences Research Council and North West University, Tirisano's public health mission is to: 1) Increase the number of well-trained South African chronic stress and non-communicable chronic mental health researchers; 2) Translate research findings to culturally congruent substance abuse and mental health treatment interventions and programs; and 3) Facilitate the building of community clinical and research capacity and infrastructure that benefit South African people.",UCLA-South Africa Center for Chronic Mental Disorders,8653435,D43MH108170,"['Adopted ', ' response ', ' African ', ' Training ', ' Intervention ', ' tool ', ' international center ', ' Funding ', ' Modeling ', ' Knowledge ', ' career ', ' Clinical ', ' Country ', ' health disparity ', ' Substance abuse problem ', ' skills ', ' improved ', ' novel ', ' Services ', ' Reporting ', ' Area ', ' Chronic ', ' Health Care Professional ', ' Healthcare professional ', ' Faculty ', ' Longevity ', ' Testing ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders ', ' Students ', ' Mental Depression ', ' Learning ', ' Life Cycle Stages ', ' Disease ', ' Social work (field) ', ' South Africa ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mentors ', ' Universities ', ' Methods ', ' Science ', ' Training Programs ', ' Infrastructure ', ' addictive disorder ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' health disparities ', ' Psychiatry ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Risk ', ' Goals ', ' Research ', ' Government ', ' Government Agencies ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Resources ', ' Award ', ' Career Choice ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Human ', ' Income ', ' Work ', ' Life Cycle ', ' life course ', ' Public Health ', ' Length of Life ', ' life span ', ' lifespan ', ' abuse of substances ', ' substance abuse ', ' Discipline of Nursing ', ' Nursing Profession ', ' Economic Income ', ' Economical Income ', ' Man (Taxonomy) ', ' Modern Man ', ' Nursing ', ' Nursing Field ', ' Social Service ', ' Social Work ', ' PTSD ', ' Post-Traumatic Neuroses ', ' Posttraumatic Neuroses ', ' Posttraumatic Stress Disorders ', ' traumatic neurosis ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Investigators ', ' Chronic stress ', ' Researchers ', ' Process ', ' Research Resources ', ' Clinical Services ', ' Health Professional ', ' Institution ', ' Future ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' Trauma ', ' Career Path ', ' resilience ', ' Address ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' psychological disorder ', ' addiction ', ' training project ', ' depression ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Research Training ', ' Disorder ', ' disease/disorder ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,D43,2015,270000,0.02588447557425704
"A Multi-channel Web Platform to Provide Holistic Care to Underserved Consumers DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Significant obstacles exist in care delivery that prevents meaningful utilization of mental health services by consumers who experience health disparities. Specifically, individuals facing isolation due to linguistic, literacy, or cultural bariers often face challenges in procuring mental health care. These challenges are in part due to the medical and mental systems' present lack of integration and failure to take into account the importance of social cohesion when delivering care. Addressing these gaps in the healthcare industry, the objective of this proposal is to create a dynamic communication platform that uses multi-channel message delivery to (i) provide culturally competent, language-concordant mental health content to consumers facing health disparities; (ii) empower providers to integrate medical and mental health care, both through shared message delivery and integration with electronic medical record (EMR) systems; and (iii) strengthen social cohesion by connecting isolated clients not only to physical and mental health message campaigns but also to community resources and peer supports critical to augmenting social well-being. The goal of Phase I is to create a series of depression and anxiety Messages and to assess whether they influence health knowledge and attitudinal change among mental health consumer participants and the suitability of the proposed technology for mental health and social service sectors. During Phase II, we will build the fully functional web-based communication platform, which will include a peer counseling function and integration with EMR systems. We will populate the integrated system with several hundred mental health and social support audio, text, and email messages in English, Spanish, and Mandarin. The project will culminate in two six-month summative evaluations with institutional and community service providers to assess the effectiveness of the proposed technology in increasing access to information about mental health and social supports, improving service and clinical outcomes, and enhancing quality of care and social cohesion for consumers who face disparities in access to mental health services. Multi-channel communication platforms are a promising solution to the problem of uneven access to medical, mental, and social services experienced by those experiencing health disparities. The proposed project-the development of an integrated, web-based communication platform targeting mental health and social cohesion-will employ messaging including Interactive Voice Response (IVR), text, and email to (i) disseminate language-concordant, culturally competent messages; (ii) facilitate care integration between medical, mental health, and social service fields; and (iii) enrich social cohesion by connecting clients to providers between appointments, to community resources, and to peer supports. Providing such personalized, accessible care will ameliorate the present knowledge and access gaps among isolated and underserved communities and will improve health outcomes by connecting individuals to critical health services and community support networks.",A Multi-channel Web Platform to Provide Holistic Care to Underserved Consumers,8842470,R44MD007635,"['Accounting ', ' Anxiety ', ' Appointment ', ' Asian Americans ', ' Attitude ', ' psychological disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Belief ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' CDC ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' Client ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' Community Health Services ', ' Community Services ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Comorbidity ', ' Counseling ', ' Curriculum ', ' Educational Curriculum ', ' Decision Making ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' Email ', ' E-Mail ', ' Electronic Mail ', ' Expeditions ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Health Personnel ', ' health care service ', ' Health Services ', ' Housing ', ' Language ', ' Libraries ', ' Linguistic ', ' Linguistics ', ' literacy ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene Services ', ' Mental Health Services ', ' New York ', ' web based ', ' online computer ', ' On-Line Systems ', ' Online Systems ', ' Patients ', ' well-being ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' QOL ', ' Quality of life ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' social support network ', ' Social support ', ' Social Work ', ' Social Service ', ' Social work (field) ', ' Solutions ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Vendor ', ' Voice ', ' Electronic Medical Record ', ' Computerized Medical Record ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' diverse populations ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' mental health organization ', ' improved ', ' Phase ', ' Medical ', ' Series ', ' Health Campaign ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' mental ', ' Psyche structure ', ' failure ', ' FLR ', ' Failure (biologic function) ', ' Individual ', ' world wide web ', ' web ', ' WWW ', ' Internet ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' Nature ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' physical health ', ' physical conditioning ', ' health knowledge ', ' Health Care Industry ', ' Healthcare Industry ', ' interest ', ' empowered ', ' information gathering ', ' experience ', ' cohesion ', ' care delivery ', ' knowledgebase ', ' knowledge base ', ' Participant ', ' peer ', ' outreach ', ' social ', ' Modeling ', ' QOC ', ' Quality of Care ', ' response ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' outreach to information ', ' Access to Information ', ' Provider ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Institution ', ' Effectiveness ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Diameter ', ' Caliber ', ' Address ', ' Health system ', ' Data ', ' Social Health Services ', ' Monitor ', ' Process ', ' Text ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Clinical Services ', ' health literacy ', ' underserved people ', ' under served population ', ' Underserved Population ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' Prevalence ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' community setting ', ' ']",NIMHD,"TRANSCENDENT INTERNATIONAL, LLC",R44,2015,344297,0.12140258484525573
"Examining Health Disparities: The Health and Healthcare of Incarcerated Adults     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Incarceration is an often ignored and poorly understood factor in health disparities research (Moore and Elkavich 2008). Incarcerated persons are excluded from national health surveys (Ahalt et al. 2011) and correctional facilities often have an inadequate surveillance system for providing valid and reliable data on the health status of inmates (Greifinger 2006). The NCCHC report on the health status of inmates concludes that there is a tremendous and largely unexploited opportunity to benefit public health by illuminating health disparities among inmates and improving correctional health care practices. The overall goal of the current research and training fellowship application is to prepare the applicant to become an independent, interdisciplinary researcher who can contribute to the reduction of inmate health disparities. The specific training goals of this fellowship are: 1) expand the applicants' knowledge of public health approaches to health disparities including the social determinants of health, the healthcare of inmates, and the social epidemiology of drug use, mental health, and violence; 2) increase the applicants' research design and quantitative analysis skills necessary to study health disparities among inmates; and 3) examine the complex way that demographic characteristics, mental health, risk behaviors, and prison treatment and healthcare intersect with incarceration to influence health.  To achieve the first aim, the applicant will take several courses in epidemiology to build on her sociology and demography training including social epidemiology, epidemiology of mental health, epidemiology of violence and injury, and analytic epidemiology. The second aim will be accomplished via continuous engagement in activities that focus on the responsible conduct of research and the completion of statistical courses covering several topics directly related to the research aims and the use of large national datasets including missing data for large data sets, propensity score matching, resampling techniques, sampling theory, confounding and mediation, database management, and sampling weight computation. Completion of a doctoral dissertation focusing on inmate health disparities will fulfill the third aim.  The proposed dissertation will use multiple preexisting, national probability samples (i.e., SISCF, SICFC, NHANES, and Add Health) as well as multiple statistical and methodological approaches (i.e., logistic regression, moderation, mediation, quasi-experimental design, and multilevel modeling) to identify demographic patterns of health disparities for chronic health and infectious diseases for incarcerated adults, determine the effect of the prison environment on health, and examine disparities in in the utilization of treatment (i.e., substance use, mental health) and healthcare services by adult inmates as well as the inmate- and prison-level factors that may account for these variations. Findings will be useful in the development of policy aimed at decreasing health disparities related to alcohol and drug addiction, mental health, and trauma for inmates during incarceration and community reentry. Additionally, findings from this study can be used by prison staff to target specific groups for inclusion in treatment and healthcare services as well a develop knowledge that can contribute to personalized or customized interventions for inmates. Specifically, the findings can inform age-appropriate and culturally-relevant, gender-informed treatment interventions. The applicant is firmly committed to a research career that will contribute to the understanding and reduction of health disparities for inmates and the communities to which they return.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Incarceration is an often ignored and poorly understood factor in health disparities research. This is a significant omission given that at yearend 2011 there were 2.24 million adults incarcerated in prisons and jails in the US with over 650,000 inmates being released every year. The goal of this fellowship is to prepare the applicant to become an independent, interdisciplinary researcher who can contribute to the understanding and reduction of health disparities for incarcerated adults.            ",Examining Health Disparities: The Health and Healthcare of Incarcerated Adults,8968184,F31DA037645,"['Accounting ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Age ', ' psychological disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Infectious Disorder ', ' Infectious Diseases and Manifestations ', ' Infectious Diseases ', ' Infectious Disease Pathway ', ' Communicable Diseases ', ' Communities ', ' Criminology ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Population Studies / Demography ', ' Demography ', ' development policy ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Environment ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' Experimental Designs ', ' Fellowship ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Level of Health ', ' Health Status ', ' Health Surveys ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' Institutes ', ' Medicaid ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity -

"Systematically Adapted Delivery of the Family Check-Up in Underserved Communities ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): When disruptive behavior problems manifest in very young children, the risk of later antisocial behaviors- including substance abuse, school failure, and criminality-escalates significantly. Evidence-based behavioral parent training (BPT) interventions have demonstrated efficacy and effectiveness in a range of settings in preventing the negative outcomes and costs associated with disruptive behavior problems. However, the public health impact of these interventions has yet to be realized, in part due to reliance on delivery by trained mental health professionals in clinic or community settings. Although implementation studies of BPT have been reported, these results lack generalizability because of their methodological idiosyncrasies in implementation. To maximize the public health benefits of BPT, systematic implementation studies are needed, particularly in underserved community settings. In Appalachia, a region recognized for its dramatic health disparities, at least one in five children exhibits sub-clinical to clinical levels of disruptive behavior problems. Risk factor for child disruptive behavior problems are pervasive; Appalachian residents suffer high poverty rates, low education levels, disproportionately high rates of substance abuse and mental health disorders, and persistent disparities in a wide range of health problems. A challenging combination of cultural barriers and poor access to mental health services hinders the usual delivery model for BPT in Appalachia (i.e., by trained mental health professionals). The vast majority of Appalachian counties are designated as mental health provider shortage areas, and cultural considerations (e.g., distrust of outsiders, the primacy of kinship networks, history of authoritarian parenting styles, strong self-reliance) may limit uptake of the few services available. The goal of this mixed-methods pilot study is to prepare for a future large-scale hybrid effectiveness-implementation trial of an evidence-based BPT intervention across rural Appalachian communities. Our preliminary data revealed community preferences for brief BPT delivery by local community health workers. Thus, to increase the accessibility and acceptability of BPT in this region, we will use the ADAPT-ITT framework to systematically adapt the delivery model for the Family Check-Up, a brief BPT intervention previously shown to be effective in reducing behavior problems and preventing negative outcomes when delivered by trained mental health professionals in clinic and community settings. Following the systematic adaptation of the Family Check-Up delivery model, we will pilot-test its implementation by community health workers in four high-need, under- resourced Appalachian communities to assess feasibility, acceptability, and costs. Our primary questions are whether we can effectively train community health workers in these communities to deliver the Family Check- Up with fidelity; whether we can enroll parents/caregivers and children to initiate and complete the intervention; and whether the battery of assessments and measures planned for the subsequent R01 effectiveness- implementation trial are feasible and appropriate for these community settings.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Early childhood disruptive behavior problems lead to significant costs to families and society, but can be reduced with behavioral parent training interventions. To increase the public health impact of these interventions, their feasibility, accessibility, and acceptability in high-need, underserved communities must be ensured. This pilot project will systematically adapt and pilot-test the delivery model of an existing effective parent training intervention for implementation in rural Appalachia, a region with many documented health disparities, high levels of poverty, and shortages of mental health providers.                  ",Systematically Adapted Delivery of the Family Check-Up in Underserved Communities,8871275,R34MH106661,"['Aggression ', ' Aggressive behavior ', ' Appalachia ', ' Appalachian Region ', ' Authoritarianism ', ' psychological disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Mental disorders ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Child Behavior ', ' childrearing ', ' Child Rearing ', ' adolescent welfare ', ' Child Welfare ', ' Communities ', ' disruptive behavioral disorder ', ' Disruptive Behavior Disorder ', ' Exhibits ', ' Family ', ' Feedback ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Health Personnel ', ' services research ', ' Medical Care Research ', ' Healthcare Research ', ' Health Services Evaluation ', ' Health Care Research ', ' Health Services Research ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' Hybrids ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' lifespan ', ' life span ', ' Length of Life ', ' Longevity ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene Services ', ' Mental Health Services ', ' Methods ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' NIMH ', ' National Institute of Mental Health (U.S.) ', ' Parents ', ' pilot study ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' Poverty ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Research Support ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Schools ', ' preschool ', ' Nursery Schools ', ' Societies ', ' Specialty ', ' medical specialties ', ' Testing ', ' Training Programs ', ' Work ', ' County ', ' Measures ', ' Care Givers ', ' Caregivers ', ' Health Benefit ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Caring ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Nexus Junction ', ' Nexus ', ' Low-resistance Junction ', ' Communicating Junction ', ' Gap Junctions ', ' Ensure ', ' Training ', ' failure ', ' FLR ', ' Failure (biologic function) ', ' Individual ', ' Rural ', ' Kinship Networks ', ' uptake ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' behavioral problem ', ' Problem behavior ', ' instructional intervention ', ' Training Intervention ', ' Instruction Intervention ', ' Education for Intervention ', ' Educational Intervention ', ' Education Level ', ' Educational Background ', ' Home ', ' Home environment ', ' Clinic ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Location ', ' Services ', ' preference ', ' Church ', ' experience ', ' checkup ', ' Check-up ', ' checkup examination ', ' early childhood ', ' self reliance ', ' Modality ', ' Reporting ', ' substance abuse ', ' abuse of substances ', ' Substance abuse problem ', ' Modeling ', ' stigma ', ' social stigma ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Effectiveness ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' Child Mental Health ', ' Data ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Community Health ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' Healthcare professional ', ' Health Care Professional ', ' Health Professional ', ' implementation trial ', ' cost ', ' Behavioral Model ', ' implementation research ', ' underserved people ', ' under served population ', ' Underserved Population ', ' Outcome ', ' Prevalence ', ' aged ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' resistant ', ' Resistance ', ' Evidence based intervention ', ' implementation science ', ' public health relevance ', ' community setting ', ' evidence base ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF KENTUCKY,R34,2015,221348,0.06877741493259552
"Disparities in Acute Psychiatric Care: System, Community & Economic Determinants DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Acute psychiatric services--the emergency and inpatient services charged with responding to individuals and communities at times of psychiatric crisis--play important, but poorly understood, roles in community mental health systems. Emergency and inpatient psychiatric service use imposes high personal costs on service users and high financial costs on service systems. While evidence on acute psychiatric care is limited, there is compelling evidence of racial/ethnic differences and disparities in utilization. Available descriptive data on racial/ethnic differences and disparities does not provide explanations that can inform programmatic or policy changes to improve services and eliminate disparities. It is increasingly clear that a full understanding of racial/ethnic disparites in acute psychiatric service use necessitates moving beyond descriptive study of individual service users to consider the ways in which mental health system and community characteristics influence disparities. By explicitly examining system and community characteristics, we can begin to explain and address differences and disparities by identifying contexts and conditions that both increase and decrease them. The proposed project examines disparities in acute psychiatric service using a framework that considers race/ethnicity in the context of service system and community characteristics over time. Client-level Medicaid mental health claims data on over one million adults served in California's diverse county-operated community mental health systems since 2005 will be used to address three aims. First, quantitative methods will be used to test the hypotheses that there are racial/ethnic disparities in utilization of acute and outpatient psychiatric, but that outpatient service use is associated with reductions in acute service use disparities. Second, quantitative methods will be used to test the hypotheses that county-level investments in mental health services are associated with acute service use disparities and that economic downturns are associated with increases in disparities. Third, a mixed methods approach to county-specific analysis will characterize service strategies that reduce racial/ethnic disparities in acute psychiatric service use. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Racial/ethnic differences have been consistently documented in utilization of costly acute psychiatric services. Using extensive data on California's county-operated community mental health systems, the proposed research will move beyond documentation of racial/ethnic differences to explain racial/ethnic disparities in acute service utilization and inform programmatic and policy interventions to eliminate disparities.","Disparities in Acute Psychiatric Care: System, Community & Economic Determinants",8890202,R01MD007669,"['Accounting ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Affect ', ' Asian Americans ', ' Budgets ', ' California ', ' Charge ', ' Client ', ' Communities ', ' Financial cost ', ' Economics ', ' Emergencies ', ' Emergency Situation ', ' emergency service ', ' Emergency medical service ', ' ethical ', ' Ethics ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Expenditure ', ' Future ', ' Health ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Income ', ' Inpatients ', ' Investments ', ' Medicaid ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene Services ', ' Mental Health Services ', ' Methods ', ' Out-patients ', ' Outpatients ', ' Play ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Research ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Running ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' unemployed ', ' out of work ', ' joblessness ', ' jobless ', ' Unemployment ', ' County ', ' Relative ', ' Relative (related person) ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' Case Management ', ' Latino ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' diverse populations ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' Caring ', ' racial/ethnic difference ', ' improved ', ' psychiatric treatment ', ' psychiatric therapy ', ' psychiatric care ', ' Psychiatric therapeutic procedure ', ' Acute ', ' Individual ', ' Policies ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Collaborations ', ' Native Americans ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' Application Context ', ' contextual factors ', ' Services ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' theories ', ' case control ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Documentation ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Address ', ' Health system ', ' Data ', ' Characteristics ', ' cost ', ' inpatient service ', ' care systems ', ' underserved people ', ' under served population ', ' Underserved Population ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Minority ', ' aged ', ' racial/ethnic ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' service utilization ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' ']",NIMHD,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R01,2015,332645,0.055400811448777204
"Disparities in Mental Health Care: Age, Race/Ethnicity, and Geography Effects DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application addresses a priority area for the National Institute on Aging (NIA): to reduce or eliminate health disparities between racial/ethnic minorities and nonminorities among older adults. The focus of this application is on mental health care, where racial/ethnic minorities access mental health services at only half the rate of non- Hispanic Whites, even after controlling for mental health status. While existing literature documents individual- level characteristics associated with mental health care, area-level (i.e., geographic) characteristics of such care are poorly understood. Thus, in this proposed study, we will assess the contribution of geographic factors to racial and ethnic disparities in mental health care among older adults. The overall goal of this research is to improve our understanding of the complex, yet unexplored, relations between race/ethnicity and geographic factors. This project will be accomplished by linking nationally representative survey data on mental health care to area-level data drawn from the U.S. Census and the Area Resource File. The proposed research has two specific aims: Aim 1. Identify geographic 'hot spots' of racial/ethnic disparities in mental health care at the regional, state, and county levels. After completing Aim 1, we will be able to identify geographic areas (at the state or county level) that need new policies to reduce racial/ethnic disparities among older adults. Aim 2. Assess geographic characteristics associated with racial/ethnic disparities in mental health care at the regional, state, and county levels. After completing Aim 2, we will be able to identify area-level risk factors that are potentially modifiable and should be considered in development of policies to reduce disparities. Beyond the scientific aims, this career development award will provide training in advanced methodology, medical geography, and epidemiology. The skills obtained during the training period will enable the candidate to perform cutting-edge research at the intersection of aging, mental health and geography to find ways to reduce or eliminate existing disparities among older adults. The interdisciplinary mentoring team I put together and my affiliations with the UA Center for Mental Health and Aging and the Deep South RCMAR provide the infrastructure to support these endeavors. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project is designed to improve our understanding of the complex, yet unexplored, relations between race/ethnicity and geographic factors with respect to older adult use of mental health care services. Knowledge produced by this project would be relevant to the current efforts of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the National Institue on Aging (NIA) to reduce and eventually eliminate racial and ethnic disparities between racial/ethnic minorities and non-minorities among older adults.","Disparities in Mental Health Care: Age, Race/Ethnicity, and Geography Effects",8847622,K01AG045342,"['Age ', ' Age Distribution ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Elderly ', ' Aging ', ' Attention ', ' psychological disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Censuses ', ' Communities ', ' development policy ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Enabling Factors ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' Geographic Factor ', ' Geographic Locations ', ' geographic site ', ' MeSH Descriptors Class 4 ', ' Geographical Location ', ' Geographic Region ', ' Geographic Area ', ' Geography ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' health care service ', ' Health Services ', ' Level of Health ', ' Health Status ', ' Hospitals ', ' Insurance ', ' Literature ', ' Maps ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene Services ', ' Mental Health Services ', ' Mentors ', ' Method LOINC Axis 6 ', ' Methodology ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' Minority Groups ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' human population density ', ' Population Density ', ' Poverty ', ' Predisposing Factor ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Statistical Regression ', ' Regression Diagnostics ', ' Regression Analyses ', ' Regression Analysis ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Testing ', ' oriental ', ' Asians ', ' County ', ' Relative ', ' Relative (related person) ', ' United States Agency for Health Care Policy and Research ', ' Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality ', ' Agency for Health Care Policy and Research ', ' AHRQ ', ' AHCPR ', ' United States Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Hispanics ', ' Latino ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Policies ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Knowledge ', ' mechanical ', ' Mechanics ', ' Complex ', ' Clinic ', ' Techniques ', ' Location ', ' age group ', ' American ', ' mental age ', ' mental health center ', ' high school ', ' skills ', ' Medical Geography ', ' geospatial information system ', ' Geographic Information Systems ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Behavior Risk Factor Surveillance System ', ' BRFSS ', ' Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System ', ' geographic variation ', ' geographic difference ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Research Career Program ', ' K-Awards ', ' Career Development Programs K-Series ', ' Career Development Awards and Programs ', ' Career Development Awards ', ' K-Series Research Career Programs ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' Older Population ', ' trend ', ' Characteristics ', ' Hot Spots (Area of Increased Mortality) ', ' Hot Spot ', ' Process ', ' sex ', ' National Institute on Aging ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Deep South ', ' Prevalence ', ' ethnic minority ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' racial/ethnic ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' ']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA IN TUSCALOOSA,K01,2015,118418,0.028213491760265174
"Organizational Capacity to Eliminate Outcome Disparities under Healthcare Reform Project Summary/Abstract The substance abuse treatment field faces an unprecedented challenge to reduce health disparities among racial and ethnic minority populations. Access to integrated substance abuse, mental health, and HIV prevention care is associated with positive health outcomes and reduced cost. The overall goal of the proposed study is to identify how changes precipitated by the Affordable Care Act (ACA) impact community- based outpatient substance abuse treatment (OSAT) program capacity to expand service delivery in racial and ethnic minority communities and eliminate outcome disparities among African American and Latino clients. The objective for this application is to examine the organizational impact of the current expansion of Medicaid on the capacity of community-based OSAT programs to enhance treatment access and retention among minorities residing in Los Angeles County (L.A.), California by developing and analyzing a panel dataset. Our conceptual framework, grounded in organizational development frameworks investigates the role of organizational capacity (i.e., leadership, readiness for change, Medi-Cal billing) in mediating the effect of Medicaid expansion (referred as Medi-Cal in California) on service delivery (i.e., mental health and HIV prevention services) and on treatment access and retention among African American and Latino clients. In Aim 1 and 2 we will examine baseline data to refine our conceptual model of organizational capacity factors likely to impact the delivery of mental health and HIV prevention services in OSAT programs in racial and ethnic minority communities, prior to ACA enactment. We will resurvey in 2013, 2015 and 2017 the same representative sample of 147 OSAT programs located in minority communities to form a panel data set. These repeated measures of program data will be concatenated with administrative client outcome data (N~10,800 clients) at each data point to examine in Aims 3 and 4 the longitudinal impact of insurance expansion on service delivery in minority communities and rates of access and retention among African American and Latino clients with mental health and HIV risk conditions. The overall public health impact of the proposed study includes identifying promising organizational factors among publicly funded community-based OSAT programs that serve large proportions of low-income minority clients that play a mediating role between the ACA insurance expansion and client-centered process outcomes with the goal of eliminating health disparities. Project Narrative This study will identify how changes precipitated by the Affordable Care Act impact community-based outpatient substance abuse treatment program capacity to expand accessibility to mental health and HIV prevention care in racial and ethnic minority communities in Los Angeles County, California. As such, the public health relevance of this project relies on providing critical information for state insurance administrators, policy makers and community-based providers who seek to develop evidence-informed policies and practices to respond to health care reform and parity legislation and eliminate health disparities.",Organizational Capacity to Eliminate Outcome Disparities under Healthcare Reform,9063400,R33DA035634,"['abstracting ', ' California ', ' Client ', ' Communities ', ' Economics ', ' Elements ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' inducement ', ' Incentives ', ' Insurance ', ' Leadership ', ' Legislation ', ' Statutes and Laws ', ' Los Angeles ', ' Medicaid ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Out-patients ', ' Outpatients ', ' parity ', ' Play ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Research ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Testing ', ' County ', ' Measures ', ' Administrator ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Latino ', ' Mediating ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' HIV/AIDS prevention ', ' HIV Prevention ', ' AIDS/HIV prevention ', ' AIDS prevention ', ' Caring ', ' Organizational Models ', ' base ', ' Phase ', ' Healthcare Reform ', ' Health Care Reform ', ' Policy Maker ', ' Policies ', ' Funding ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Nature ', ' programs ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' Services ', ' Performance ', ' prevention service ', ' treatment program ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' substance abuse ', ' abuse of substances ', ' Substance abuse problem ', ' HIV risk ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' QOC ', ' Quality of Care ', ' response ', ' theories ', ' Provider ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Preparedness ', ' Readiness ', ' Low income ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Improve Access ', ' Subgroup ', ' underserved minority ', ' under-represented minority ', ' Underrepresented Populations ', ' Underrepresented Groups ', ' Underrepresented Minority ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' substance abuse therapy ', ' substance abuse treatment ', ' cost ', ' care systems ', ' treatment organization ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' ethnic minority ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' racial/ethnic ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' addictive disorder ', ' addiction ', ' public health relevance ', ' evidence base ', ' ']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,R33,2015,146193,-0.010166100835864327

The proposed research has two specific aims: Aim 1. Identify geographic 'hot spots' of racial/ethnic disparities in mental health care at the regional, state, and county levels. After completing Aim 1, we will be able to identify geographic areas (at the state or county level) that need new policies to reduce racial/ethnic disparities among older adults. Aim 2. Assess geographic characteristics associated with racial/ethnic disparities in mental health care at the regional, state, and county levels. After completing Aim 2, we will be able to identify area-level risk factors that are potentially modifiable and should be considered in development of policies to reduce disparities. Beyond the scientific aims, this career development award will provide training in advanced methodology, medical geography, and epidemiology. The skills obtained during the training period will enable the candidate to perform cutting-edge research at the intersection of aging, mental health and geography to find ways to reduce or eliminate existing disparities among older adults. The interdisciplinary mentoring team I put together and my affiliations with the UA Center for Mental Health and Aging and the Deep South RCMAR provide the infrastructure to support these endeavors. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project is designed to improve our understanding of the complex, yet unexplored, relations between race/ethnicity and geographic factors with respect to older adult use of mental health care services. Knowledge produced by this project would be relevant to the current efforts of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the National Institue on Aging (NIA) to reduce and eventually eliminate racial and ethnic disparities between racial/ethnic minorities and non-minorities among older adults.","Disparities in Mental Health Care: Age, Race/Ethnicity, and Geography Effects",9091394,K01AG045342,"['Age ', ' Age Distribution ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Elderly ', ' Aging ', ' Attention ', ' psychological disorder ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Censuses ', ' Communities ', ' development policy ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Enabling Factors ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' Geographic Factor ', ' geographic site ', ' Geographical Location ', ' Geographic Region ', ' Geographic Area ', ' Geographic Locations ', ' Geography ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Level of Health ', ' Health Status ', ' Hospitals ', ' Insurance ', ' Literature ', ' Maps ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene Services ', ' Mental Health Services ', ' Mentors ', ' Methodology ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' Population Density ', ' Poverty ', ' Predisposing Factor ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Statistical Regression ', ' Regression Diagnostics ', ' Regression Analyses ', ' Regression Analysis ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Testing ', ' Asians ', ' oriental ', ' County ', ' United States Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality ', ' United States Agency for Health Care Policy and Research ', ' Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality ', ' Agency for Health Care Policy and Research ', ' AHRQ ', ' AHCPR ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Hispanics ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Latino ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Policies ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Knowledge ', ' mechanical ', ' Mechanics ', ' Complex ', ' Clinic ', ' Techniques ', ' Location ', ' age group ', ' American ', ' mental age ', ' mental health center ', ' high school ', ' skills ', ' Medical Geography ', ' geospatial information system ', ' Geographic Information Systems ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Behavior Risk Factor Surveillance System ', ' BRFSS ', ' Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System ', ' geographic variation ', ' geographic difference ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Research Career Program ', ' K-Awards ', ' Career Development Programs K-Series ', ' Career Development Awards and Programs ', ' Career Development Awards ', ' K-Series Research Career Programs ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' Older Population ', ' trend ', ' Characteristics ', ' Hot Spot ', ' Process ', ' sex ', ' National Institute on Aging ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Deep South ', ' Prevalence ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' Minority Access ', ' Limited English Proficiency ', ' disparity reduction ', ' reduce disparity ', ' health care disparity ', ' healthcare disparity ', ' disparity in healthcare ', ' disparity in care ', ' health care service ', ' healthcare service ', ' health service use ', ' health service utilization ', ' ']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA IN TUSCALOOSA,K01,2016,112836,0.028213491760265174
"Building Community Capacity for Disability Prevention for Minority Elders DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Although minority elders represent the fastest growing segment of an aging US population, they have less access to mental health care and prevention of disability, lagging well behind non-Latino whites, and suffering significant disparities. Blacks and Latinos have the greatest risk for disability, with striking disparities in healthy aging. This includes elderly immigrants who exhibit elevated depressive and anxiety symptoms, and higher rates of disability than the native-born population; yet, they often go undiagnosed or underdiagnosed. This is a missed opportunity given that mood disorder treatment has been shown to reduce disability days and that several risk factors for disability, such as functional mobility are modifiable. Research suggests that a contributing factor may be an insufficient supply of professional providers and the inability of evidence based treatments to reach and be acceptable to minority elders. An IOM committee recently reported that the severe workforce shortages in providing mental health care to elder adults required novel approaches to resolve. To address these disparities and prevent disability among minority elders, the proposed R01 examines how to successfully build collaborative research for the provision of evidence-based mental health and disability prevention treatments in community-based settings. Promising results in a few international studies show improved access and quality of mental health outcomes and reduced disability when interventions are delivered by Community Health Workers. Yet limited and inconsistent evidence of the efficacy of CHW-led interventions in the US context remains. While the number of community-based health interventions has grown exponentially to address these service disparities, there is a lack of systematic assessment of whether they lead to increased community capacity and systems change, and whether they improve the quality of care and potentially decrease disability. Our proposed study endeavors to address this limitation. As such, the proposed R01 will be one of few efforts that simultaneously study the three components necessary for a successful intervention: efficacy, since the intervention must work, acceptability among clients, and feasibility and sustainability within the organization. It seeks to understand the role of the partnerships in increasing community capacity for a combined mental health and disability prevention intervention, and evaluating the acceptability, efficacy, feasibility and sustainability of the intervention delivere by CHWs and exercise trainers to Latino, African American and Asian elders with moderate to severe mood symptoms and at risk of disability. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The rapid expansion of the aging population is outstripping the development of mental health and disability prevention services necessary to respond to their needs. The proposed revised R01 aims to evaluate whether partnerships between academic researchers, minority elders, and the community-based organizations which serve them can expand community resources and capabilities to effectively provide mental health services and reduce the risk of disability in minority elders.",Building Community Capacity for Disability Prevention for Minority Elders,9084466,R01AG046149,"['functional capacity ', ' functional ability ', ' daily living functionality ', ' Activities of everyday life ', ' Activities of Daily Living ', ' Adoption ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Affect ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Elderly ', ' Aging ', ' psychological disorder ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Client ', ' Communities ', ' Environment ', ' Exercise ', ' Exhibits ', ' Health ', ' Language ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene Services ', ' Mental Health Services ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Patients ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Support ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Strikes ', ' Employee Strikes ', ' Testing ', ' Work ', ' Asians ', ' oriental ', ' Native-Born ', ' Native People ', ' Indigenous Population ', ' Generic Drugs ', ' generic ', ' Nonproprietary Drugs ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' depressive symptoms ', ' depressive ', ' depression symptom ', ' Emotional Depression ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Latino ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Acute ', ' Chronic ', ' prematurity ', ' premature ', ' Training ', ' mental ', ' Psyche structure ', ' disability ', ' using substances ', ' substance using ', ' substance use ', ' AOD use ', ' Alcohol or Other Drugs use ', ' Relative Risks ', ' Immigrant ', ' bilingual ', ' bilingualism ', ' sadness ', ' depressed ', ' Depressed mood ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Adopted ', ' Clinic ', ' Source ', ' System ', ' Organ System ', ' body system ', ' Affective Disorders ', ' Mood Disorders ', ' meetings ', ' Services ', ' prevention service ', ' Prevention ', ' personnel ', ' Manpower ', ' Human Resources ', ' Reporting ', ' Emotional ', ' Modeling ', ' QOC ', ' Quality of Care ', ' stigma ', ' social stigma ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Provider ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' Improve Access ', ' International ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Preventative intervention ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' Community Health ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Evidence based treatment ', ' years of life lost to disease ', ' years of life lost to disability ', ' disease burden ', ' burden of disease ', ' burden of illness ', ' Minority ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel approaches ', ' new approaches ', ' novel strategies ', ' Treatment Efficacy ', ' therapy efficacy ', ' therapeutically effective ', ' therapeutic efficacy ', ' intervention efficacy ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Evidence based intervention ', ' aging population ', ' population aging ', ' healthy aging ', ' community setting ', ' evidence base ', ' successful intervention ', ' efficacy testing ', ' anxiety symptoms ', ' anxious symptom ', ' community building ', ' disparity reduction ', ' reduce disparity ', ' mood symptom ', ' low income country ', ' ']",NIA,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R01,2016,767878,0.032416395899690656
"Examining Health Disparities: The Health and Healthcare of Incarcerated Adults DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Incarceration is an often ignored and poorly understood factor in health disparities research (Moore and Elkavich 2008). Incarcerated persons are excluded from national health surveys (Ahalt et al. 2011) and correctional facilities often have an inadequate surveillance system for providing valid and reliable data on the health status of inmates (Greifinger 2006). The NCCHC report on the health status of inmates concludes that there is a tremendous and largely unexploited opportunity to benefit public health by illuminating health disparities among inmates and improving correctional health care practices. The overall goal of the current research and training fellowship application is to prepare the applicant to become an independent, interdisciplinary researcher who can contribute to the reduction of inmate health disparities. The specific training goals of this fellowship are: 1) expand the applicants' knowledge of public health approaches to health disparities including the social determinants of health, the healthcare of inmates, and the social epidemiology of drug use, mental health, and violence; 2) increase the applicants' research design and quantitative analysis skills necessary to study health disparities among inmates; and 3) examine the complex way that demographic characteristics, mental health, risk behaviors, and prison treatment and healthcare intersect with incarceration to influence health.  To achieve the first aim, the applicant will take several courses in epidemiology to build on her sociology and demography training including social epidemiology, epidemiology of mental health, epidemiology of violence and injury, and analytic epidemiology. The second aim will be accomplished via continuous engagement in activities that focus on the responsible conduct of research and the completion of statistical courses covering several topics directly related to the research aims and the use of large national datasets including missing data for large data sets, propensity score matching, resampling techniques, sampling theory, confounding and mediation, database management, and sampling weight computation. Completion of a doctoral dissertation focusing on inmate health disparities will fulfill the third aim.  The proposed dissertation will use multiple preexisting, national probability samples (i.e., SISCF, SICFC, NHANES, and Add Health) as well as multiple statistical and methodological approaches (i.e., logistic regression, moderation, mediation, quasi-experimental design, and multilevel modeling) to identify demographic patterns of health disparities for chronic health and infectious diseases for incarcerated adults, determine the effect of the prison environment on health, and examine disparities in in the utilization of treatment (i.e., substance use, mental health) and healthcare services by adult inmates as well as the inmate- and prison-level factors that may account for these variations. Findings will be useful in the development of policy aimed at decreasing health disparities related to alcohol and drug addiction, mental health, and trauma for inmates during incarceration and community reentry. Additionally, findings from this study can be used by prison staff to target specific groups for inclusion in treatment and healthcare services as well a develop knowledge that can contribute to personalized or customized interventions for inmates. Specifically, the findings can inform age-appropriate and culturally-relevant, gender-informed treatment interventions. The applicant is firmly committed to a research career that will contribute to the understanding and reduction of health disparities for inmates and the communities to which they return. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Incarceration is an often ignored and poorly understood factor in health disparities research. This is a significant omission given that at yearend 2011 there were 2.24 million adults incarcerated in prisons and jails in the US with over 650,000 inmates being released every year. The goal of this fellowship is to prepare the applicant to become an independent, interdisciplinary researcher who can contribute to the understanding and reduction of health disparities for

"Testing the Community-Based Learning Collaborative Implementation Model DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): One in four U.S. children experience a mental health disorder with severe impairment and/or distress during their childhood. Further, high rates of exposure to violence and abuse are common among youth, particularly among those involved in the child welfare and mental health service systems. Violence exposure presents significant health and mental health consequences for children, with disparities in these experiences among racial/ethnic minority youth, and estimated costs exceeding $124 billion. While evidence-based treatments (EBTs) can prevent and/or reduce these negative effects, these treatments are still not the standard practice of care in many communities. Despite a recent proliferation of implementation research across a variety of settings, an ongoing challenge facing child mental health and child welfare professionals is how to transport and implement these EBTs so that they are readily available, accessible and sustained. The Learning Collaborative training model is being widely disseminated as a way to train community-based therapists to deliver EBTs. However, to date, the effectiveness of this model has not been demonstrated, nor has it been examined as a way to build and strengthen inter-professional relationships across the multiple professionals and agencies involved in providing services to children. Thus, to meet these public health needs, child welfare and mental health professionals must collaborate to improve the availability and sustainment of evidence- based practices for children. This project aims to test an extension of the Learning Collaborative Model, the Community-based Learning Collaborative model, which targets both clinical and non-clinical professionals in the child welfare and mental health service sectors as a way to build and strengthen inter-professional relationships and thereby improve coordination and delivery of evidence-based mental health treatment services. The proposed research offers the opportunity to capitalize on an on-going, statewide implementation project to generate evidence about implementation strategies needed to make EBTs more accessible to children. This study also provides data to inform an R01 effectiveness trial that will utilize a time-series design to rigorously evaluate the effectivenessof the CBLC model as a mechanism to improve access and sustained use of EBTs for children. The proposed mixed-methods study will involve participants (n=150) from two ongoing CBLCs being conducted as part of a statewide, foundation funded training initiative in South Carolina. The study will examine data collected pre/post, weekly and monthly over the 12 month active implementation period. Participants will be recruited for an 18 month follow-up period to examine whether inter-professional and inter-organizational relationships and use of EBTs are sustained over time. New quantitative and qualitative data will be collected during this sustainment phase. The proposed study will demonstrate feasibility and inform development of a large scale, multi-site study that will utilize a time-series design, to examine effectiveness of the CBLC implementation model. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: One in four US children experiences a mental health disorder; violence exposure is highly prevalent and associated with significant mental health consequences for children. Effective treatments exist, but availability is limited, particularly fo traditionally underserved minority children, overrepresented in the child welfare system.

"Intervention to Overcome Mental Health Disparities in Criminally-Justice Involved Transgender Women Project Summary/Abstract Transgender women, assigned a male birth sex who identify along the female gender spectrum, experience substantial mental health disparities and high prevalence of incarceration relative to the US general population. Incarcerated transgender women experience widespread structural and interpersonal forms of stigma, including the denial of necessary healthcare. Cross-sectional research suggests that incarceration experiences contribute to the mental health disparities observed among transgender women with incarceration histories, but longitudinal research is lacking. While prisons provide a unique setting within which to clinically intervene to improve the health of disproportionately incarcerated populations, without culturally and clinically knowledgeable providers, transgender inmates are excluded from this benefit. This F31 aims to improve the health of transgender women across two research aims: (1) Examine the psychosocial health trajectories of transgender women according to their incarceration history using data from a prospective cohort study of US transgender women (n=300). Specifically, we will examine the magnitude of the disparity in depressive distress and substance use at 4, 8, and 12 months comparing transgender women with and without incarceration histories, and test for differences in the intercept and slope of the trajectory between these groups over time. Additionally, we will explore the interaction between person-level (incarceration, demographics) and time- variant (stigma, resilience) predictors of depressive distress and substance use for transgender women to determine risk and protective factors in this population. (2) Develop and pilot test an educational intervention to increase prison healthcare providers' ability to care for transgender inmates. Using an implementation science framework, we will adapt an existing transgender competency training for healthcare providers to be inclusive of the prison context; openly field test the intervention with 70 prison healthcare providers in a non-randomized pilot; and evaluate intervention feasibility and acceptability, and changes in providers' knowledge, attitudes, and behavioral intentions to care for transgender patients at baseline, and immediately and 3 months post- intervention. The proposed research addresses an urgent need to equip prison providers with the knowledge and skills to effectively care for transgender inmates. This pilot intervention will set the stage for future refinement and evaluation via a randomized controlled trial with the long-term goal of implementing this needed intervention in correctional institutions across the US. Thus, this research has far-reaching implications for improving the mental health of transgender women during and after incarceration. Through the completion of this 2-year research and training fellowship, the applicant will gain training in advanced statistical methods, intervention development, and scientific communication. The extensive training provided by a multidisciplinary mentoring team will prepare the applicant for a successful career as an academic mentor and independent researcher working to eliminate mental health disparities in gender minority populations. Project Narrative Transgender women are disproportionately incarcerated and experience structural and interpersonal forms of stigma while incarcerated, which negatively affects their physical and mental health. The proposed study will lead to (1) the first estimates of the long-term mental health effects of incarceration among transgender women with incarceration histories; (2) the development of the first transgender cultural and clinical competency training for correctional healthcare providers containing a detailed curriculum and supporting materials; and (3) the first state-wide delivery and evaluation of a transgender cultural and clinical competency training to prison healthcare providers in Connecticut. This research has the potential to improve the mental and physical health of transgender women during incarceration and upon release.",Intervention to Overcome Mental Health Disparities in Criminally-Justice Involved Transgender Women,9189549,F31MD011203,"['abstracting ', ' Affect ', ' Anxiety ', ' Attitude ', ' Behavior ', ' psychological disorder ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Parturition ', ' Birth ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Communication ', ' Connecticut ', ' lesson plans ', ' Curriculum ', ' Educational Curriculum ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Discrimination ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Employment ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' Fellowship ', ' Female ', ' Future ', ' Gender Identity ', ' Goals ', ' Hand ', ' Health ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Health Personnel ', ' treatment access ', ' health services availability ', ' health service access ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' accessibility to health services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Access to Care ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Income ', ' Justice ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' male ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mentors ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Persons ', ' Patients ', ' Prisons ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Gender ', ' Competence ', ' depressive symptoms ', ' depressive ', ' depression symptom ', ' Emotional Depression ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Caring ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' incarceration ', ' incarcerated ', ' Imprisonment ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Medical ', ' Link ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Distress ', ' using substances ', ' substance using ', ' substance use ', ' AOD use ', ' Alcohol or Other Drugs use ', ' Policies ', ' instructional intervention ', ' Training Intervention ', ' Instruction Intervention ', ' Education for Intervention ', ' Educational Intervention ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' Staging ', ' Knowledge ', ' Victimization ', ' Correctional Institutions ', ' physical health ', ' physical conditioning ', ' psychosocial ', ' transgender ', ' experience ', ' field test ', ' field learning ', ' field based data ', ' field study ', ' stressor ', ' success ', ' Intercept ', ' skills ', ' Participant ', ' General Public ', ' General Population ', ' Reporting ', ' substance abuse ', ' abuse of substances ', ' Substance abuse problem ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' QOC ', ' Quality of Care ', ' stigma ', ' social stigma ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Provider ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' High Prevalence ', ' Research Training ', ' sex ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' post intervention ', ' resilience ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' prospective ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' demographics ', ' implementation science ', ' therapy development ', ' treatment development ', ' intervention development ', ' develop therapy ', ' transgender women ', ' transwomen ', ' transwoman ', ' trans-women ', ' gender minority ', ' ']",NIMHD,YALE UNIVERSITY,F31,2016,43576,0.05591486054611304
"Disparities in Acute Psychiatric Care: System, Community & Economic Determinants DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Acute psychiatric services--the emergency and inpatient services charged with responding to individuals and communities at times of psychiatric crisis--play important, but poorly understood, roles in community mental health systems. Emergency and inpatient psychiatric service use imposes high personal costs on service users and high financial costs on service systems. While evidence on acute psychiatric care is limited, there is compelling evidence of racial/ethnic differences and disparities in utilization. Available descriptive data on racial/ethnic differences and disparities does not provide explanations that can inform programmatic or policy changes to improve services and eliminate disparities. It is increasingly clear that a full understanding of racial/ethnic disparites in acute psychiatric service use necessitates moving beyond descriptive study of individual service users to consider the ways in which mental health system and community characteristics influence disparities. By explicitly examining system and community characteristics, we can begin to explain and address differences and disparities by identifying contexts and conditions that both increase and decrease them. The proposed project examines disparities in acute psychiatric service using a framework that considers race/ethnicity in the context of service system and community characteristics over time. Client-level Medicaid mental health claims data on over one million adults served in California's diverse county-operated community mental health systems since 2005 will be used to address three aims. First, quantitative methods will be used to test the hypotheses that there are racial/ethnic disparities in utilization of acute and outpatient psychiatric, but that outpatient service use is associated with reductions in acute service use disparities. Second, quantitative methods will be used to test the hypotheses that county-level investments in mental health services are associated with acute service use disparities and that economic downturns are associated with increases in disparities. Third, a mixed methods approach to county-specific analysis will characterize service strategies that reduce racial/ethnic disparities in acute psychiatric service use. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Racial/ethnic differences have been consistently documented in utilization of costly acute psychiatric services. Using extensive data on California's county-operated community mental health systems, the proposed research will move beyond documentation of racial/ethnic differences to explain racial/ethnic disparities in acute service utilization and inform programmatic and policy interventions to eliminate disparities.","Disparities in Acute Psychiatric Care: System, Community & Economic Determinants",9062336,R01MD007669,"['Accounting ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Affect ', ' Asian Americans ', ' Budgets ', ' California ', ' Charge ', ' Client ', ' Communities ', ' Financial cost ', ' Economics ', ' Emergencies ', ' Emergency Situation ', ' emergency service ', ' Emergency medical service ', ' ethical ', ' Ethics ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Expenditure ', ' Future ', ' Health ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Income ', ' Inpatients ', ' Investments ', ' Medicaid ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene Services ', ' Mental Health Services ', ' Methods ', ' Out-patients ', ' Outpatients ', ' Play ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Research ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Running ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Unemployment ', ' unemployed ', ' out of work ', ' joblessness ', ' jobless ', ' County ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Case Management ', ' Latino ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' population diversity ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' diverse populations ', ' improved ', ' psychiatric treatment ', ' psychiatric therapy ', ' psychiatric care ', ' Psychiatric therapeutic procedure ', ' Acute ', ' Individual ', ' Policies ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Collaborations ', ' Native Americans ', ' System ', ' Application Context ', ' contextual factors ', ' Services ', ' ethnicity difference ', ' ethnic difference ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' theories ', ' case control ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Documentation ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Address ', ' Health system ', ' Data ', ' Characteristics ', ' cost ', ' inpatient service ', ' care systems ', ' underserved people ', ' under served population ', ' Underserved Population ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Minority ', ' aged ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' service utilization ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' ethnic disparity ', ' ethnicity disparity ', ' disparity reduction ', ' reduce disparity ', ' Affordable Care Act ', ' Obamacare ', ' health service use ', ' health service utilization ', ' ']",NIMHD,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R01,2016,412796,0.055400811448777204
"Connecting Cultures and Technology: Addressing Disparities in Mental Health Intervention for Refugees ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Thousands of individuals seek refuge in the United States to escape atrocities of war and torture in their country of origin. An overwhelming majority of these individuals continue to struggle with Chronic Traumatic Stress (CTS), the persistence of prior traumatic events (e.g., re-experiencing past trauma) coupled with daily post-migration stressors (e.g., poverty, lack of transportation). CTS significantly increases the burden of mental illness experienced by refugees such that approximately 70% meet criteria for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and comorbid conditions including depression, generalized anxiety disorder, and somatic concerns. Evidence-based mental health treatments for these conditions rely on worksheets, mobile applications, websites, or telephone calls to facilitate the use of skils and manage distress outside of session. Language barriers (e.g., most refugees have limited English proficiency) prevent these strategies from being incorporated into mental health treatment for refugees, which results in a significant disparity in the quality of care. Treatments delivered via mobile device are able to overcome this barrier through the use of intuitive graphical interfaces that eliminate the need for text or language-based instruction. Culturally adapted mHealth toolkits that address the mental health needs of refugees will reduce a significant disparity in care and is consistent with calls from the National Institutes of Health, World Health Organization, and United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. The current SBIR Phase I project aims to develop, refine, and pilot an mHealth toolkit aimed at addressing the burden of mental illness in refugees. A community-based participatory research approach will be used in which GameTheory, a women-owned small business, mental health clinicians who serve refugees, and refugees will create an advisory panel to develop the toolkit. The panel will be involved in all aspects of development to ensure the application meet the needs of the community. An agile development strategy will be used that will proceed across three phases that correspond to the aims of the project. Aim 1: The design and components of the toolkit will be created with feedback from the advisory panel using agile development. Prototypes will be created, reviewed internally, and revised based on feedback from community members. Feedback from additional refugees will be solicited during the initial development to ensure that our toolkit is user-friendly and can be used intuitively. Aim 2: A formal prototype evaluation of the toolkit with a sample of n=24 refugees from different cultural backgrounds and n=5 providers who work with the refugee community will be conducted. Consistent with agile development, evaluation will occur across 4 waves in which feedback is obtained and integrated into the application at each wave. Aim 3: The refined toolkit will be alpha tested with n=20 patients across n=5 providers during culturally adapted treatment. Metrics of engagement, usability, and satisfaction will be obtained to guide final refinements to the toolkit. Feasibility metrics of recruitment, completion, and compliance will also be obtained in preparation for a Phase II Clinical Trial. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Refugees and victims of torture experience disproportionally high rates of mental illness, which contributes to an undue burden of illness. Multiple barriers prevent these individuals from accessing high quality care in times of crisis including language, economics, and transportation. Culturally adapted Mobile applications that rely on intuitive graphic interfaces, rather than text, to assist refugees in period of acute distress have the potential to address this significant public health concern and reduce disparities in care.",Connecting Cultures and Technology: Addressing Disparities in Mental Health Intervention for Refugees,9150653,R43MD010543,"['Atrocities ', ' psychological disorder ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Client ', ' Communication Barriers ', ' Communities ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Complement ', ' Consultations ', ' Cultural Backgrounds ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' Economics ', ' Feedback ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' treatment access ', ' health services availability ', ' health service access ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' accessibility to health services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Access to Care ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' Institutes ', ' Insurance ', ' Language ', ' Life Experience ', ' Maintenance ', ' Marketing ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' Patients ', ' Perception ', ' Poverty ', ' Public Health ', ' Refugees ', ' Research ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Research Design ', ' Software ', ' Computer software ', ' Stress ', ' traumatic neurosis ', ' Posttraumatic Stress Disorders ', ' Posttraumatic Neuroses ', ' Post-Traumatic Neuroses ', ' PTSD ', ' Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders ', ' Technology ', ' Phone ', ' Telephone ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Torture ', ' Transportation ', ' Travel ', ' United Nations ', ' United States ', ' War ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' World Health Organization ', ' Businesses ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' base ', ' Acute ', ' Chronic ', ' Phase ', ' Ensure ', ' Evaluation ', ' Distress ', ' Individual ', ' satisfaction ', ' Fees for Service ', ' Fee-for-Service Plans ', ' Generalized Anxiety Disorder ', ' phase II protocol ', ' phase 2 trial ', ' Phase 2 Clinical Trials ', ' Phase II Clinical Trials ', ' Nature ', ' Country ', ' Best Practice Analysis ', ' Benchmarking ', ' interest ', ' meetings ', ' Services ', ' experience ', ' stressor ', ' Participant ', ' member ', ' Sampling ', ' QOC ', ' Quality of Care ', ' developing computer software ', ' develop software ', ' software development ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Provider ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' disease causation ', ' causation ', ' Causality ', ' Etiology ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Advocate ', ' Small Business Innovation Research ', ' SBIR ', ' Small Business Innovation Research Grant ', ' Preparation ', ' Process ', ' Text ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' minority health ', ' website ', ' web site ', ' Instruction ', ' cost ', ' years of life lost to disease ', ' years of life lost to disability ', ' disease burden ', ' burden of disease ', ' burden of illness ', ' treatment center ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' migration ', ' Trauma ', ' Coupled ', ' skill acquisition ', ' skill development ', ' Evidence based intervention ', ' user-friendly ', ' graphical user interface ', ' graphic user interface ', ' Graphical interface ', ' handheld mobile device ', ' mobile device ', ' usability ', ' community based participatory research ', ' participatory action research ', ' community based research ', ' community based design ', ' prototype ', ' commercialization ', ' evidence base ', ' mHealth ', ' mobile health ', ' m-Health ', ' mobile application ', ' mobile app ', ' traumatic event ', ' Limited English Proficiency ', ' mobile computing ', ' mobile technology ', ' mobile platform ', ' disparity reduction ', ' reduce disparity ', ' health care disparity ', ' healthcare disparity ', ' disparity in healthcare ', ' disparity in care ', ' ']",NIMHD,"GAMETHEORY, INC.",R43,2016,189621,0.05194938095124917
"Addressing Social Determinants to Reduce Refugee Mental Health Disparities DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this study is to test an ecological/empowerment approach to reducing mental health disparities among socioeconomically disadvantaged Central African and Iraqi refugee adults by examining the effectiveness of a community-based advocacy, learning, and social support intervention (Refugee Well-being Project, RWP) that addresses social determinants of mental health and incorporates an evidence-based trauma treatment (Narrative Exposure Therapy, NET) for refugees with PTSD. The waitlist randomized controlled trial with 180 African and Iraqi refugee adults is innovative and significant because it will rigorously test the effectiveness of addressin social determinants of mental health (poverty, social and physical environments, access to services, marginalization) to reduce mental health disparities, as well as examine the impact of a community-based, mutual learning intervention on improving engagement and retention in evidence-based trauma-focused treatment for those who need it. The RWP intervention emphasizes a sustainable and replicable partnership model between refugee resettlement agencies and universities/colleges that involves refugee adults and undergraduate advocates working together to: a) increase refugees' abilities to navigate their new communities; b) improve refugees' access to community resources; c) enhance meaningful social roles by valuing refugees' culture, experiences, and knowledge; d) reduce refugees' social isolation; and e) increase communities' responsiveness to refugees. The RWP intervention is administered by university undergraduate students enrolled in a service learning course, and has two elements: 1) Learning Circles, which involve cultural exchange and one-on-one learning opportunities, and; 2) Advocacy, which involves collaborative efforts to mobilize community resources related to health, housing, employment, education, and legal issues. Pilot testing of RWP demonstrated feasibility, appropriateness, acceptability, and preliminary evidence that the intervention decreased Hmong, Central African, and Iraqi participants' psychological distress and increased protective factors. A mixed methods strategy with data collected from each participant at four time points over a period of 14 months will be used to test the effectiveness of the 6- month intervention to reduce psychological distress (PTSD, depression, and culturally-specific distress), increase protective factors (access to resources, English proficiency, environmental mastery, mental health service use, and social support), and engage and retain refugee adults with PTSD in an evidence-based trauma treatment (NET). Mechanisms of intervention effectiveness will be explored by testing mediating relationships between protective factors and psychological distress. Qualitative components of interviews with refugee participants and paired qualitative interviews with refugees and undergraduates will explore participants' experiences in the intervention, inform interpretation of quantitative data, and investigate unexpected impacts. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This study tests the effectiveness of an innovative, community-based advocacy, learning, and social support intervention (Refugee Well-being Project) to reduce the mental health disparities experienced by low-income refugee adults by addressing several well-defined social determinants of mental health and increasing refugees' engagement in trauma treatment, when warranted. This is important not only for the large number of refugees in the United States and worldwide, but also because the intervention model has the potential to alleviate the disproportionate psychological distress experienced by other immigrant and minority populations throughout the United States who experience inequities in social and material resources and disproportionate exposure to trauma and stress and who are less likely to access formal mental health services because of lack of trust and concerns about culturally appropriateness.

"Addressing Health Disparities among Transgender Women DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Rachel L. Kaplan, PhD, MPH is a public health researcher at the Center for Research and Education on Gender and Sexuality at San Francisco State University and a postdoctoral scholar at University of California, Berkeley's Mack Center on Mental Health and Social Conflict. Dr. Kaplan's long-term career objective is to become an independent researcher specializing in the development and implementation of sexual and mental health promoting interventions among sexual minority populations in international settings. The proposed training, mentorship, and research plan support this goal and will provide her with the theoretical and practical skills necessary to become an independent intervention researcher. Although transgender women are among the most-at-risk populations for contracting HIV, few studies have been conducted to determine the most feasible and acceptable ways to impact risk. Further, knowledge of sexual and mental health among transgender women has been derived mostly from the United States. There is an urgent need for culturally relevant interventions for this marginalized population in poorly-resourced, high-stigma settings. The proposed study will address these gaps by: (1) exploring the psycho-social and cultural factors that form the context in which transgender women's sexual and mental health are situated; (2) determining how to impact transgender women's sexual and mental health through adaptation of a prevention intervention; and (3) assessing the feasibility and accessibility of the prevention intervention through pilot testing among transgender women in Lebanon. It is expected that this research will reveal prevention needs and strategies specific to transgender women in the Middle East and provide unique and powerful results to inform efficacy testing in future larger- scale trials in international settings. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This study is important to public health because it will provide critical information about how to access and engage high-risk and highly stigmatized sexual minority populations such as transgender women. Because rates of HIV transmission and mental health problems are high among transwomen, it is crucial to examine this population's sexual and mental health. Transwomen are typically marginalized; they experience high rates of gender-related abuse, unstable housing, depression, and HIV risk behavior including the engagement in sex work for income. As public health researchers, we have only begun to understand which components of existing interventions might be efficacious for risk reduction and health promotion among transwomen in the U.S. This study will investigate the cultural acceptability and feasibility of an adapted HIV prevention intervention that was originally developed for use among transwomen in the U.S. A better understanding of culturally acceptable and feasible strategies for addressing sexual and mental health among transwomen in Lebanon will aid the development and adaptation of health-promoting approaches in other international settings.",Addressing Health Disparities among Transgender Women,9119638,K01MH102142,"['Affect ', ' North Africa ', ' Maghreb ', ' French-Speaking Africa ', ' Northern Africa ', ' California ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' CDC ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' Communities ', ' Conflict ', ' Conflict (Psychology) ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Discrimination ', ' Epidemic ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' Health Promotion ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' Incidence ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Income ', ' Lebanon ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mentorship ', ' Middle East ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' San Francisco ', ' Sexuality ', ' Social Sciences ', ' social support network ', ' Social support ', ' Testing ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' Violence ', ' violent behavior ', ' violent ', ' Work ', ' Gender ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' AIDS prevention ', ' HIV/AIDS prevention ', ' HIV Prevention ', ' AIDS/HIV prevention ', ' base ', ' career ', ' Area ', ' Training ', ' Populations at Risk ', ' Staging ', ' Contracting Opportunities ', ' Contracts ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Application Context ', ' contextual factors ', ' experience ', ' skills ', ' Prevention ', ' social ', ' HIV/AIDS problem ', ' HIV/AIDS ', ' AIDS/HIV ', ' AIDS/HIV problem ', ' HIV risk ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' stigma ', ' social stigma ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Risk Reduction ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Address ', ' Sexual Health ', ' Data ', ' PhD ', ' Ph.D. ', ' Doctor of Philosophy ', ' International ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Preventative intervention ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' Research Career Program ', ' K-Awards ', ' Career Development Programs K-Series ', ' Career Development Awards and Programs ', ' Career Development Awards ', ' K-Series Research Career Programs ', ' Funding Mechanisms ', ' Low Prevalence ', ' Transmission ', ' transmission process ', ' sex ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' unstably housed ', ' unstable housing ', ' instably housed ', ' housing instability ', ' resilience ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' Evidence based intervention ', ' therapy development ', ' treatment development ', ' intervention development ', ' develop therapy ', ' high risk ', ' successful intervention ', ' efficacy testing ', ' sexual minority ', ' transgender women ', ' transwomen ', ' transwoman ', ' trans-women ', ' education research ', ' ']",NIMH,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",K01,2016,181544,0.047340309351373545
"Community Partnership to Identify Intervention Targets to Improve Mental Health Services to Transgender Individuals in Underserved Areas Abstract Individuals who fall outside of the binary male/female classification of gender that matches the sex they were assigned at birth—termed transgender or simply trans—face innumerable challenges to their personal, interpersonal, and cultural identity that provoke significant health disparities. Although standards of care and other guidelines have been established for mental health services for trans individuals, these documents tend to be broad and aspirational and provide little specific information for front line providers or evidence-based practice. Furthermore, the history of stigmatization and discrimination, including in health care settings, has created many barriers to treatment seeking by trans individuals. This project seeks to reduce these health disparities and improve psychological services through two specific aims: #1 Develop culturally sensitive evidence-based principles of care for psychological services and assessment for the trans community in service impoverished areas. #2. Assess the needs and barriers for mental health services through an iterative development process in partnership with the Central Great Plains trans community that includes a deep understanding of stigma that can then inform the principles of care. Using a community-based participatory research model, the research team will partner with the Central Great Plains rural and urban trans community and local mental health providers through an iterative series of focus groups. Transcripts of the focus groups will be subjected to two analyses – an inductive analysis based in grounded theory to identify themes and a critical, cultural, and rhetorical approach to link key topics in the transcripts to the cultural context to better understand trans stigma. The project will be guided by the already established local and national advisory boards. Deliverables include principles of care that can inform trans-affirmative adaptations of first-line psychological interventions for common disorders; a self- report instrument to inform process and outcomes for trans psychological services; and a publishable taxonomy of stigmatizing and destigmatizing discourse to provide critical information to clinicians about the way language is used to marginalize or heal trans people in the healthcare context. These deliverables and the establishment of a partnership with trans community will prepare the research team to apply the principles of care in a specific context (e.g., adapting a first-line treatment for anxiety) and, eventually, randomized controlled trials. This project will enhance public health services to a population subject to large health disparities, offering a pathway to improve best practices in mental health care for the trans population. Project Narrative  The proposed principles of psychological care in this application will have tangible public health benefits to the more than 700,000 self-identified transgender (trans) Americans. These principles will provide guidance for first-line interventions for mental health issues for a group with high health disparities, including elevated suicidality. Furthermore, the taxonomy of stigmatizing and destigmatizing language and discourse surrounding trans communities developed in this application will be a valuable resource to both the trans communities and health practitioners across the medical world when serving trans clients.",Community Partnership to Identify Intervention Targets to Improve Mental Health Services to Transgender Individuals in Underserved Areas,9182362,R21MH108897,"['abstracting ', ' Anxiety ', ' assault ', ' psychological disorder ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Systematic Bias ', ' Systematics ', ' Classification ', ' Client ', ' Communities ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Discrimination ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' Feedback ', ' Female ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Foundations ', ' Gender Identity ', ' Goals ', ' Group Interviews ', ' Health ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Health Personnel ', ' services research ', ' Medical Care Research ', ' Health Services Evaluation ', ' Health Services Research ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' Language ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' male ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene Services ', ' Mental Health Services ', ' Methodology ', ' Moods ', ' Professional Positions ', ' Jobs ', ' Occupations ', ' Clinical Psychology ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' statistics ', ' Stigmatization ', ' suicidality ', ' intent to die ', ' fatal suicide ', ' fatal attempt ', ' Suicide ', ' suicidal attempt ', ' non fatal attempt ', ' Suicide attempt ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Translating ', ' United States Public Health Service ', ' USPHS ', ' Public Health Service ', ' Work ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', ' falls ', ' Health Benefit ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Specialist ', ' Taxonomy ', ' General Taxonomy ', ' Treatment Effectiveness ', ' Caring ', ' Social Network ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Surface ', ' Healed ', ' Biological ', ' Medical ', ' psychological ', ' psychologic ', ' Series ', ' Link ', ' Feminine ', ' Masculine ', ' term newborn ', ' full-term birth ', ' Fullterm Birth ', ' Term Birth ', ' Discipline ', ' Individual ', ' Rural ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' instrument ', ' Research Priority ', ' Services ', ' transgender ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' Special Population ', ' named group ', ' trait ', ' stress related disorder ', ' Structure ', ' member ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' General Public ', ' General Population ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Modeling ', ' behavioral health ', ' stigma ', ' social stigma ', ' theories ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' lethal toxin ', ' lethal factor ', ' anthrax toxin LF ', ' anthrax lethal toxin ', ' LeTx ', ' Bacillus anthracis lethal toxin ', ' Bacillus anthracis lef protein ', ' Bacillus anthracis LF protein ', ' B anthracis LeTx toxin ', ' B anthracis LeTx ', ' anthrax lethal factor ', ' Provider ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Address ', ' Evidence based practice ', ' Data ', ' Transcript ', ' Preparation ', ' Process ', ' sex ', ' Community Health ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' healing ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' efficacy trial ', ' Outcome ', ' coping ', ' Population ', ' Trauma ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' community based participatory research ', ' participatory action research ', ' community based research ', ' community based design ', ' therapy development ', ' treatment development ', ' intervention development ', ' develop therapy ', ' evidence base ', ' gender dysphoria ', ' gender dysphoric ', ' Sexual and Gender Minorities ', ' Gender and Sexual Minorities ', ' anxiety treatment ', ' social exclusion ', ' marginalization ', ' Assessment tool ', ' Assessment instrument ', ' community partnership ', ' cisgender ', ' disparity reduction ', ' reduce disparity ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF NEBRASKA LINCOLN,R21,2016,218097,0.10824179659849122
"Effect of Local Health Departments on Health Care Disparities for Individuals with Mental Health Disorders ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): African Americans and Latinos have less mental health care access and face substantial stigmatization in seeking and receiving treatment for mental health disorders (MHDs), compared to Whites. Untreated MHDs are associated with high mortality rates, increased risks of developing major chronic diseases, including heart disease and diabetes, and accelerating disease progression. Evidence demonstrates the cost effectiveness of improving health care for patients with coexisting MHDs and other diseases through the integration of individual and organizational factors, yet there remains a gap in our knowledge about how to best accomplish the integration of Local Health Departments (LHDs) with the communities they serve. The objective of this study is to identify effective LHD activitie that reduce racial and ethnic disparities in health care for individuals with MHDs, including those with MHDs and coexisting chronic diseases. Our central hypothesis is that LHDs' service provision and health promotion can reduce disparities. Our hypothesis is informed by an ecological model demonstrating that LHDs can reduce health care disparities for individuals with MHDs by providing critical health care resources to people with limited health care access and promoting health education and patient engagement that reflect community health needs. Since LHDs assume more responsibilities in underserved areas and provide a major source of health care for vulnerable populations, racial and ethnic minority patients with MHDs may gain more benefit from LHD activities. Specifically, we will assess the effect of LHD activities on health care for individuals with MHDs (Aim 1), and the effect of LHD activities on racial and ethnic disparities (African American vs. White; Latino vs. White) in mental health care (Aim 2). Given that MHDs are common comorbidities of major chronic diseases, we will assess the effect of LHD activities on racial and ethnic disparities in general health care for individuals with coexisting MHDs and other chronic diseases, such as diabetes and heart disease (Aim 3). We will assemble a unique multi-level (individual-, LHDs-, county-, and state-) data set for the years 2004-2014, and employ multi-level/hierarchical estimation, difference-in-differences analysis, and decomposition technique to quantify the contribution of LHDs' activities to the reduction of racial and ethnic disparities in health care for individuals with MHDs. Results of this exploratory study will generate substantial amounts of new evidence and insights about how to utilize LHDs' resources to integrate the care for individuals with MHDs, and to what extent the resources of LHDs can be used, or should be expanded, to improve mental health. Results of this study will provide preliminary data needed to build a more comprehensive and robust investigation to estimate the impact of LHDs on racial and ethnic disparities in health outcomes, and develop a scientifically sound and culturally tailored LHD-integrated health care model that will improve the efficiency of the health care delivery system and potentially accelerate sustainable efforts to reduce and ultimately eliminate health disparities for individuals with MHDs.           PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This study will provide critical evidence on how to utilize Local Health Department (LHD) resources to integrate and coordinate care for individuals with Mental Health Disorders (MHDs), and help us understand to what extent the resources of LHDs can be used, or should be expanded, to improve mental health and reduce disparities. Results of our exploratory study will provide preliminary data needed to build a more comprehensive and robust investigation to estimate the dynamic impact of LHDs on racial and ethnic disparities in health outcomes, and develop a scientifically sound and culturally tailored LHD-integrated health care model that will improve the efficiency of the health care delivery system and potentially accelerate sustainable efforts to reduce and ultimately eliminate health disparities fo individuals with MHDs.

"Organizational Capacity to Eliminate Outcome Disparities under Healthcare Reform Project Summary/Abstract The substance abuse treatment field faces an unprecedented challenge to reduce health disparities among racial and ethnic minority populations. Access to integrated substance abuse, mental health, and HIV prevention care is associated with positive health outcomes and reduced cost. The overall goal of the proposed study is to identify how changes precipitated by the Affordable Care Act (ACA) impact community- based outpatient substance abuse treatment (OSAT) program capacity to expand service delivery in racial and ethnic minority communities and eliminate outcome disparities among African American and Latino clients. The objective for this application is to examine the organizational impact of the current expansion of Medicaid on the capacity of community-based OSAT programs to enhance treatment access and retention among minorities residing in Los Angeles County (L.A.), California by developing and analyzing a panel dataset. Our conceptual framework, grounded in organizational development frameworks investigates the role of organizational capacity (i.e., leadership, readiness for change, Medi-Cal billing) in mediating the effect of Medicaid expansion (referred as Medi-Cal in California) on service delivery (i.e., mental health and HIV prevention services) and on treatment access and retention among African American and Latino clients. In Aim 1 and 2 we will examine baseline data to refine our conceptual model of organizational capacity factors likely to impact the delivery of mental health and HIV prevention services in OSAT programs in racial and ethnic minority communities, prior to ACA enactment. We will resurvey in 2013, 2015 and 2017 the same representative sample of 147 OSAT programs located in minority communities to form a panel data set. These repeated measures of program data will be concatenated with administrative client outcome data (N~10,800 clients) at each data point to examine in Aims 3 and 4 the longitudinal impact of insurance expansion on service delivery in minority communities and rates of access and retention among African American and Latino clients with mental health and HIV risk conditions. The overall public health impact of the proposed study includes identifying promising organizational factors among publicly funded community-based OSAT programs that serve large proportions of low-income minority clients that play a mediating role between the ACA insurance expansion and client-centered process outcomes with the goal of eliminating health disparities. Project Narrative This study will identify how changes precipitated by the Affordable Care Act impact community-based outpatient substance abuse treatment program capacity to expand accessibility to mental health and HIV prevention care in racial and ethnic minority communities in Los Angeles County, California. As such, the public health relevance of this project relies on providing critical information for state insurance administrators, policy makers and community-based providers who seek to develop evidence-informed policies and practices to respond to health care reform and parity legislation and eliminate health disparities.",Organizational Capacity to Eliminate Outcome Disparities under Healthcare Reform,9054824,R33DA035634,"['abstracting ', ' California ', ' Client ', ' Communities ', ' Economics ', ' Elements ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' treatment access ', ' health services availability ', ' health service access ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' accessibility to health services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Access to Care ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' Incentives ', ' Insurance ', ' Leadership ', ' Legislation ', ' Statutes and Laws ', ' Los Angeles ', ' Medicaid ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Out-patients ', ' Outpatients ', ' parity ', ' Play ', ' Public Health ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Research ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Testing ', ' County ', ' Measures ', ' Administrator ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Latino ', ' Mediating ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' AIDS prevention ', ' HIV/AIDS prevention ', ' HIV Prevention ', ' AIDS/HIV prevention ', ' Caring ', ' Organizational Models ', ' base ', ' Phase ', ' Healthcare Reform ', ' Health Care Reform ', ' Policy Maker ', ' Policies ', ' Funding ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Nature ', ' programs ', ' System ', ' Services ', ' Performance ', ' prevention service ', ' treatment program ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' substance abuse ', ' abuse of substances ', ' Substance abuse problem ', ' HIV risk ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' QOC ', ' Quality of Care ', ' response ', ' theories ', ' Provider ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Preparedness ', ' Readiness ', ' Low income ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Improve Access ', ' Subgroup ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' substance abuse therapy ', ' substance abuse treatment ', ' cost ', ' care systems ', ' treatment organization ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' addiction ', ' addictive disorder ', ' public health relevance ', ' evidence base ', ' underserved minority ', ' racial minority ', ' Affordable Care Act ', ' Obamacare ', ' ']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,R33,2016,466421,-0.010166100835864327
"Implementation of a Measurement Feedback System in School Mental Health DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This Mentored Career Development Award (K08) is designed to provide intensive training in developing a strong program of research that investigates the adaptation and implementation of health information technologies within the school context to increase the availability of high-quality mental health interventions for underserved youth and families. A field of implementation science has recently emerged to address the significant gap between the proliferation of evidence-based practices (EBP) for treating youth mental health problems and their use in usual care treatment settings. Nowhere is this gap more apparent than in schools. Schools provide the bulk of youth mental health services (>70%) and effectively reduce service access disparities by ethnicity and socioeconomic status. Nevertheless, implementation research focused on the school context has been disproportionately limited. To address these gaps and advance implementation science, the candidate's long term career objective is to develop effective methods for promoting the use of EBP among mental health providers in educational settings. Standardized assessment (SA) of psychiatric symptoms is a cornerstone of all EBP and has been significantly associated with improvements in treatment- related outcome. Nevertheless, SA is infrequently utilized by school-based providers, resulting in sub-optimal care. Measurement feedback systems (MFS) use the results of SA to deliver information to clinicians about client progress, represent a structured way to introduce SA into service systems, and have the potential to support effective, client-centered care. The candidate's immediate focus is therefore to increase clinicians' administration of SA tools and incorporation of SA feedback into routine practice through the development of a MFS and an accompanying contextualized adaptation process that are designed specifically for schools.  The current K08 Award will uniquely position the candidate to advance this research agenda. His background includes specialized training in child clinical psychology, evidence-based assessment and intervention approaches, research on school-based mental health, mental health services research, and collaboration with community stakeholders. To more effectively bridge the gap between typical and optimal mental health care in schools, he seeks to extend his training to include: (1) design of healthcare technologies that are user-friendly and contextually appropriate, (2) experience with theory and methods to support innovation uptake/implementation in schools, (3) advanced statistics and research methodology, and (4) advanced academic writing. The University of Washington is an outstanding environment in which to engage in the interdisciplinary training required to achieve these training goals. The candidate's primary mentors-Drs. Elizabeth McCauley and Jurgen Unutzer have combined expertise in the assessment and treatment of adolescent psychopathology, training with school-based providers, development of computer products to support evidence-based service delivery, implementation science, and the development and dissemination of measurement feedback tools for client progress monitoring. Additional local and national consultants will contribute expertise in implementation research for youth/family services, user-centered design, school-based mental health, community service provision, decision support tools for youth treatment providers, cultural diversity and mental health care, mental health policy, and qualitative and mixed methods research.  The proposed project draws on the training and expertise above to develop and evaluate a contextually- adapted, web-based MFS for use in school-based health centers (SBHCs) through a series of qualitative, quantitative, and mixed methods research aims. The University of Washington Care Management Tracking System is a MFS, developed by Dr. Unutzer, previously found to result in improved care, symptom reductions, and increased functioning among patients. The current study proposes to use SBHC clinician focus groups and direct clinician feedback to adapt this MFS for use by SBHC clinicians. The candidate's prior research has revealed that SBHC providers infrequently utilize SA measures, but supports the feasibility of using structured, computerized methods to increase SA administration. A sample of SBHC clinicians (n = 20) and youth (n = 64, Aim 3) will participate in the project to advance the following Research Aims: (1) evaluate the SBHC context to inform MFS adaptation; (2) assess the adaptation's effectiveness in context; (3) evaluate the system impact on clinician behavior and youth outcomes; and (4) assess the added utility of providing academic data to school clinicians for use in progress monitoring. SBHC clinicians will provide feedback on the optimal design of the MFS and use it to track outcomes among youth experiencing depression and anxiety. Aims 1 and 2 will be evaluated descriptively, using existing benchmarks when applicable. Aim 3 will be tested experimentally via a small-scale randomized trial in which clinicians (and a subset of their caseloads) will be randomized to one of two conditions: (a) use of the school MFS to monitor progress using SA or (b) assessment as usual. Aim 4 will be tested using the MFS, with randomization of youth to two conditions: (a) clinicians receive the results of SA and students' school attendance data from the MFS or (b) data include SA results only. Based on the results of this work, a R01 grant application will be submitted to investigate the larger-scale implementation of the school MFS and contextualized adaptation process among a range of school service delivery models, allowing for more thorough evaluation of its impact on clinician behavior and student functioning. Evidence-based mental health services are infrequently provided by school-based clinicians, resulting in sub- optimal outcomes for the ""safety net"" populations most likely to receive care in that setting (i.e., low- socioeconomic status, ethnic minority youth). By identifying innovative health technologies that systematically support the implementation of evidence-based practices and adapting them for use in schools, the proposed research and training carries considerable potential to enhance the availability of high-quality care for underserved youth, thereby more effectively alleviating symptoms and promoting functioning across domains.",Implementation of a Measurement Feedback System in School Mental Health,9069096,K08MH095939,"['Anxiety ', ' Attention ', ' Award ', ' Behavior ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children

"Predictors of Achievement from Early Childhood to Adulthood ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project will significantly contribute to the growing body of research on physical attractiveness as a source of social stratification that has wide implications for health, akin to more frequently studied factors like race and gender. Health is an integral component of the approach to this project-as a dimension of physical attractiveness (e.g., weight), as a mechanism by which physical attractiveness has effects on social and academic achievement (e.g., mental health), and because the adult socioeconomic attainment that is expected to reflect histories of physical attractiveness is a fundamental component of lifelong health and health disparities. This project also will provide a practical service to the feld by expanding a public use data set so that it can be used to study the role of attractiveness in a wide variety of outcomes, including health behaviors and health disparities. Specifically, the project will create the most comprehensive longitudinal data ever amassed of physical attractiveness from infancy through adolescence by re-coding videotapes that were already gathered at nearly a dozen time points in the NICHD Study of Early Child Care and Youth Development. It will describe trajectories of beauty in this cohort and test important hypotheses derived from an integrative theoretical model put forward in a new book by the investigators. Based on status characteristics and life course theory as well as developmental systems and stigma perspectives, beauty's association with higher achievement is expected to operate through mental health mechanisms, including positive mood, perceived competence, and self esteem. These mental health resources are expected to counteract some of the ways being good looking could distract from schooling (i.e., physical assets might accentuate desires to climb the social ladder as young people move into and through adolescence and its associated peer contexts). Differences in the strength of associations by social location (gender, race/ethnicity, SES), by developmental period (early childhood, elementary, junior, and high school), and by ecological contexts (schools) will also be examined. The results of this project, and the new source of public use data created through the project, will stimulate future developmental, social psychological, and public health research on physical attractiveness as a stratifying force. These results will be written up for academic journal articles and also widely disseminated, which is important given the public, media and policy interest in the topic. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project will significantly contribute to the growing body of research on physical attractiveness as a source of social stratification with wide implications for health, akin to more frequently studied factors like race and gender.

"Advancing Stepped Care for Women's Common Mental Disorders in an LMIC Globally, young women bear a disproportionate burden of common mental disorders especially including depression and anxiety. Lifting this burden in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) requires task sharing, which entails using non-specialists and laypersons to deliver mental health services. Several trials of task sharing interventions in LMICs have shown modest improvement. Obstacles to further progress include lack of evidence regarding what conditions should be treated, with what interventions, by whom, and how to overcome access obstacles. This R21 application advances knowledge about task sharing by developing and testing for feasibility a stepped care model for LMICs using primary care (PC) nurses and mental health peers to treat depression and anxiety. It also integrates neuroscience-based prediction models by investigating how low-cost, brief Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) tools can assist in evaluating and targeting stepped care. RDoC is an NIMH initiative to use dimensional, disease agnostic, brain based tools to better understand the key features of mental illness. The research takes place in Tajikistan, a low-income country, where Dr. Weine has currently funded R01, K24, and D43 research on migration and mental health and health. In Tajikistan, women are exposed to separation from their migrant husbands, violence both within and outside of the home, STIs transmitted by their spouses, as well as high mental illness stigma, restricted service access, and severely limited treatment resources. Aim 1 better characterizes the mental health needs, supports, resources, and barriers to care of women with depression (including with co-occurring anxiety) recruited from one primary care clinic in Dushanbe, through qualitative interviews and focus groups. Aim 2 forms an intervention design team that builds on knowledge gained through Aim 1 and on two existing interventions (BRIDGES and Interpersonal Psychotherapy) to develop a novel stepped care model that includes: 1) PC nurse and physician led screening and triage; 2) peer and PC nurse co-led psycho-education and support groups; 3) peer or PC nurse led Interpersonal Psychotherapy, and; 4) PC physician led medication treatment. Aim 3 assesses the feasibility and acceptability of the stepped care model with 45 women who have depression (including with co-occurring anxiety) recruited from a primary care clinic in Dushanbe, and whether brief tools assessing RDoC subconstructs of acute threat and cognitive control, predict or moderate pre-post changes. It builds on Dr. Weine’s strong collaborative partnerships with Tajik mental health and health leaders and researchers at the Prisma Research Center in Dushanbe, as well as the Tajikistan Ministry of Health and the Republican Psychiatric Center. This study will result in an adapted and piloted stepped care model that we hope to test in a subsequent R01 study. It will also result in increased capacity for mental health research that will augment Weine’s K24 and D43 research training program. The study addresses Grand Challenges in Global Mental Health Goal C to foster integration of mental health into primary care, and NIMH Strategic Aim 3 by developing new and better interventions that incorporate the diverse needs and circumstances of people with mental illness. It will help to build an evidence-based program that can then be introduced into public health services in Tajikistan. In Tajikistan, as well as in other LMICs, women suffer disproportionally from common mental disorders and also experience separation from their migrant husbands, trauma, and STIs, as well as stigma, gender inequality, poverty, and access barriers to mental health services. This project uses a task sharing approach to develop and test for feasibility a novel stepped care model for women with depression delivered by primary care nurses and mental health peers. It also explores how RDoC neuroscience contributes to implementation science through enhancing the evaluation and targeting of a stepped care model. Augmenting an existing D43 research training program, the project will further advance the capacities of researchers and research institutions in Tajikistan, and will develop an evidence-based program that has potential for being introduced into the country’s public mental health service system.",Advancing Stepped Care for Women's Common Mental Disorders in an LMIC,9199950,R21MH108363,"['adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Anxiety ', ' Award ', ' bear ', ' Ursidae ', ' Bears ', ' Ursidae Family ', ' psychological disorder ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Chicago ', ' Communities ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Family ', ' Feedback ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' healthcare policy ', ' health care policy ', ' Health Policy ', ' Illinois ', ' Interview ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene Services ', ' Mental Health Services ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methods ', ' Migrant ', ' Nomads ', ' Persons ', ' NIMH ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' Neurosciences ', ' Nurses ', ' Physicians ', ' Play ', ' Poverty ', ' Primary Care Physician ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Primary Care ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Primary Nursing Care ', ' recruit ', ' active recruitment ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Running ', ' self help organization ', ' Self-Help Groups ', ' Support Groups ', ' Tajikistan ', ' Testing ', ' Training Programs ', ' Triage ', ' United States Public Health Service ', ' USPHS ', ' Public Health Service ', ' Universities ', ' Violence ', ' violent behavior ', ' violent ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Gender ', ' prisma ', ' Caring ', ' Spouses ', ' Married Persons ', ' base ', ' Acute ', ' Lifting ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Fostering ', ' Research Activity ', ' Inequality ', ' Husband ', ' Wife ', ' Funding ', ' tool ', ' Consensus ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Investigation ', ' Home ', ' Home environment ', ' Clinic ', ' System ', ' Country ', ' meetings ', ' Services ', ' experience ', ' Stretching ', ' novel ', ' peer ', ' Prevention ', ' Modeling ', ' stigma ', ' social stigma ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Provider ', ' Institution ', ' Address ', ' Advocate ', ' Base of the Brain ', ' Research Training ', ' cost ', ' interpersonal psychotherapy ', ' interpersonal therapy ', ' Treatment Efficacy ', ' therapy efficacy ', ' therapeutically effective ', ' therapeutic efficacy ', ' intervention efficacy ', ' migration ', ' Trauma ', ' Evidence based program ', ' implementation science ', ' cognitive control ', ' therapy design ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' evidence base ', ' young woman ', ' adolescent women ', ' adolescent woman ', ' screening ', ' Research Domain Criteria ', ' RDoC ', ' low and middle-income countries ', ' LMIC ', ' brain dysfunction ', ' dysfunctional brain ', ' low income country ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT CHICAGO,R21,2016,193109,0.05434651426404011
"UCLA-South Africa Center for Chronic Mental Disorders DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Fogarty International Center has recognized the need for collaborative research training programs between the U.S. and institutions in low and middle income countries that focus on chronic non-communicable diseases (NCD). In response to PAR 10-257, NCD Lifespan Award and the South African Governmental Report, Revitalizing Clinical Research, which calls for the training of master's-level students to improve their capacit to conduct addiction mental health research and provide additional clinical services, we propose to develop the Tirisano Training Project, or TTP (Tirisano means ""working together"" in Tswana). A collaborative training program between UCLA and several South African Universities and Institutions including faculty from the University of Cape Town (UCT), the University of Stellenbosch, the Human Sciences Research Council, and North West University will increase the clinical and research skills of South African post-bachelor, master's and doctoral-level students and early career mental health professionals. Expanding upon the infrastructure and lessons learned from our Fogarty-funded Phodiso trauma and health disparities research training program for South Africa scholars, TTP focuses on chronic stress and non-communicable chronic mental health disorders including substance abuse, depression, and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) across the life course. TTP addresses the dearth of South African researchers by targeting the ""pipeline"" challenge and training scholars at diverse points of the academic career path. Guided by a multi-dimensional conceptual model of risks and resilience resources over the lifespan, trainees will be provided the tools to develop and test novel models and methods to implement effective substance abuse and mental health interventions within the South African context. The Specific Aims are to: 1) Implement a short-, medium-, and long-term multidisciplinary training program at UCLA and in South Africa for master's and doctoral-level students and early career mental health professionals drawn from clinical staff working in nursing, social work, psychiatry and public health to enhance their knowledge and skills in the areas of chronic stress and non-communicable chronic mental health disorders (Track A Scholars; cumulative n=16); 2) Implement a short-term multidisciplinary training program in South Africa for post-bachelor, master's and doctoral-level students in nursing, social work, and public health to enhance their knowledge and skills in the area of chronic stress and non-communicable chronic mental health disorders (Track B Scholars; cumulative n=100); 3) Evaluate the TTP processes, including the mentoring, research skills, and career support provided, as well as the career trajectories and accomplishments of the Track A Scholars over 10 years; and 4) Assess the sustainability and integration of TTP into academic, private, and government agencies that provide substance abuse and mental health research and services. Future goals will include encouraging the South African government to support, endorse, and adopt TTP as a successful and replicable model of cross-cultural clinical research training. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The UCLA-South Africa Tirisano Training Project (TTP) seeks five years of funding to prepare future investigators to conduct research on chronic stress and non-communicable chronic mental health disorders including substance abuse, depression, and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) across the life course. As an international collaboration between UCLA and several South African Universities and Institutions, including the University of Cape Town (UCT), the University of Stellenbosch, the Human Sciences Research Council and North West University, Tirisano's public health mission is to: 1) Increase the number of well-trained South African chronic stress and non-communicable chronic mental health researchers; 2) Translate research findings to culturally congruent substance abuse and mental health treatment interventions and programs; and 3) Facilitate the building of community clinical and research capacity and infrastructure that benefit South African people.",UCLA-South Africa Center for Chronic Mental Disorders,9023597,D43MH108170,"['Award ', ' psychological disorder ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Mental disorders ', ' career track ', ' career pathway ', ' career interest ', ' career aspiration ', ' Career Path ', ' Career Choice ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Research ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Faculty ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Government ', ' Government Agencies ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Learning ', ' life course ', ' Life Cycle ', ' Life Cycle Stages ', ' lifespan ', ' life span ', ' Length of Life ', ' Longevity ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' Nursing Profession ', ' Nursing Field ', ' Nursing ', ' Discipline of Nursing ', ' career skill ', ' Professional Competence ', ' Psychiatry ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Science ', ' Social Service ', ' Social Work ', ' South Africa ', ' traumatic neurosis ', ' Posttraumatic Stress Disorders ', ' Posttraumatic Neuroses ', ' Post-Traumatic Neuroses ', ' PTSD ', ' Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders ', ' Students ', ' Testing ', ' Training Programs ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Training ', ' Funding ', ' tool ', ' Knowledge ', ' Adopted ', ' Services ', ' international center ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' Reporting ', ' substance abuse ', ' abuse of substances ', ' Substance abuse problem ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Institution ', ' training project ', ' Address ', ' Chronic stress ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Research Training ', ' Process ', ' Clinical Services ', ' Healthcare professional ', ' Health Care Professional ', ' Health Professional ', ' resilience ', ' Trauma ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' addiction ', ' addictive disorder ', ' low and middle-income countries ', ' LMIC ', ' South African ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,D43,2016,270000,0.02588447557425704
"Systematically Adapted Delivery of the Family Check-Up in Underserved Communities ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): When disruptive behavior problems manifest in very young children, the risk of later antisocial behaviors- including substance abuse, school failure, and criminality-escalates significantly. Evidence-based behavioral parent training (BPT) interventions have demonstrated efficacy and effectiveness in a range of settings in preventing the negative outcomes and costs associated with disruptive behavior problems. However, the public health impact of these interventions has yet to be realized, in part due to reliance on delivery by trained mental health professionals in clinic or community settings. Although implementation studies of BPT have been reported, these results lack generalizability because of their methodological idiosyncrasies in implementation. To maximize the public health benefits of BPT, systematic implementation studies are needed, particularly in underserved community settings. In Appalachia, a region recognized for its dramatic health disparities, at least one in five children exhibits sub-clinical to clinical levels of disruptive behavior problems. Risk factor for child disruptive behavior problems are pervasive; Appalachian residents suffer high poverty rates, low education levels, disproportionately high rates of substance abuse and mental health disorders, and persistent disparities in a wide range of health problems. A challenging combination of cultural barriers and poor access to mental health services hinders the usual delivery model for BPT in Appalachia (i.e., by trained mental health professionals). The vast majority of Appalachian counties are designated as mental health provider shortage areas, and cultural considerations (e.g., distrust of outsiders, the primacy of kinship networks, history of authoritarian parenting styles, strong self-reliance) may limit uptake of the few services available. The goal of this mixed-methods pilot study is to prepare for a future large-scale hybrid effectiveness-implementation trial of an evidence-based BPT intervention across rural Appalachian communities. Our preliminary data revealed community preferences for brief BPT delivery by local community health workers. Thus, to increase the accessibility and acceptability of BPT in this region, we will use the ADAPT-ITT framework to systematically adapt the delivery model for the Family Check-Up, a brief BPT intervention previously shown to be effective in reducing behavior problems and preventing negative outcomes when delivered by trained mental health professionals in clinic and community settings. Following the systematic adaptation of the Family Check-Up delivery model, we will pilot-test its implementation by community health workers in four high-need, under- resourced Appalachian communities to assess feasibility, acceptability, and costs. Our primary questions are whether we can effectively train community health workers in these communities to deliver the Family Check- Up with fidelity; whether we can enroll parents/caregivers and children to initiate and complete the intervention; and whether the battery of assessments and measures planned for the subsequent R01 effectiveness- implementation trial are feasible and appropriate for these community settings. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Early childhood disruptive behavior problems lead to significant costs to families and society, but can be reduced with behavioral parent training interventions. To increase the public health impact of these interventions, their feasibility, accessibility, and acceptability in high-need, underserved communities must be ensured. This pilot project will systematically adapt and pilot-test the delivery model of an existing effective parent training intervention for implementation in rural Appalachia, a region with many documented health disparities, high levels of poverty, and shortages of mental health providers.",Systematically Adapted Delivery of the Family Check-Up in Underserved Communities,9021688,R34MH106661,"['Aggression ', ' Aggressive behavior ', ' Appalachia ', ' Appalachian Region ', ' authoritarian ', ' Authoritarianism ', ' psychological disorder ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Mental disorders ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Child Behavior ', ' childrearing ', ' Parenting behavior ', ' Parenting ', ' Child Rearing ', ' child well being ', ' adolescent welfare ', ' Child Welfare ', ' Communities ', ' disruptive behavioral disorder ', ' Disruptive Behavior Disorder ', ' Exhibits ', ' Family ', ' Feedback ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Health Personnel ', ' services research ', ' Medical Care Research ', ' Health Services Evaluation ', ' Health Services Research ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' Hybrids ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' lifespan ', ' life span ', ' Length of Life ', ' Longevity ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene Services ', ' Mental Health Services ', ' Methods ', ' NIMH ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' Parents ', ' pilot study ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' Poverty ', ' Public Health ', ' Research Support ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Schools ', ' preschool ', ' pre-kindergarten ', ' pre-k ', ' Nursery Schools ', ' Societies ', ' Specialty ', ' medical specialties ', ' Testing ', ' Training Programs ', ' Work ', ' County ', ' Measures ', ' Caregivers ', ' Care Givers ', ' Health Benefit ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Caring ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Nexus Junction ', ' Nexus ', ' Low-resistance Junction ', ' Communicating Junction ', ' Gap Junctions ', ' Ensure ', ' Training ', ' Failure ', ' Individual ', ' Rural ', ' Kinship Networks ', ' uptake ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' behavioral problem ', ' Problem behavior ', ' instructional intervention ', ' Training Intervention ', ' Instruction Intervention ', ' Education for Intervention ', ' Educational Intervention ', ' Education Level ', ' Educational Background ', ' Home ', ' Home environment ', ' Clinic ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Location ', ' Services ', ' preference ', ' Church ', ' experience ', ' checkup ', ' Check-up ', ' checkup examination ', ' early childhood ', ' self reliance ', ' Modality ', ' Reporting ', ' substance abuse ', ' abuse of substances ', ' Substance abuse problem ', ' Modeling ', ' stigma ', ' social stigma ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Effectiveness ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' Child Mental Health ', ' Data ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Community Health ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' Healthcare professional ', ' Health Care Professional ', ' Health Professional ', ' implementation trial ', ' cost ', ' Behavioral Model ', ' implementation research ', ' underserved people ', ' under served population ', ' Underserved Population ', ' Outcome ', ' Prevalence ', ' aged ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' Resistance ', ' resistant ', ' Evidence based intervention ', ' implementation science ', ' community setting ', ' evidence base ', ' behavioral study ', ' behavior study ', ' antisocial behavior ', ' anti-social behavior ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF KENTUCKY,R34,2016,221394,0.06877741493259552
"Integrating Mental Health into a HIV Clinic to Improve Outcomes in Tanzanian Youth DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Dr. Dorothy Dow has a Master's of Science in Global Health and will become junior faculty at Duke University Medical Center in the Division of Pediatric Infectious Diseases in July 2014. For nearly three years, she has been living and working in Moshi, Tanzania. Her long-term goal is to become an independent global health researcher integrating mental health into the prevention and treatment of HIV among adolescents. During HIV clinic both at Duke University and Kilimanjaro Christian Medical Centre (KCMC), Dr. Dow has come to realize the reality of the statement, ""no health without mental health."" Her preliminary research evaluating the prevalence of mental health difficulties among HIV-positive adolescents in Tanzania has demonstrated symptoms of depression and trauma are prevalent in the local HIV youth clinic. Despite these findings, there are no psychologists or psychiatrists currently available at KCMC. This proposed career development plan incorporates a multidisciplinary five-year program complete with didactic training in global mental health, research methods and trial design, advanced biostatistics, and management skills for implementing large clinical trials. These didactics closely align with a mentored, patient-oriented research experience designing, adapting, and implementing a mental health intervention in the HIV adolescent clinic. Dr. Dow will receive mentorship from Dr. Coleen Cunningham (Chief, Pediatric Infectious Diseases and Pediatric Global Health), Dr. Karen O'Donnell (Clinical Psychology), Dr. Kathryn Whetten (Director of the Center for Health Policy and Inequalities Research), Dr. Blandina Mmbaga (Co-Site leader KCMC-Duke Collaboration, Professor of Pediatrics), and consultants Dr. John Bartlett (Duke Global Health Institute, DGHI) and Dr. Kathleen Sikkema (Clinical Psychology). Dr. Dow proposes to integrate both a HIV educational curriculum and an intensive cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and life skills training program called SPARCS, into the HIV teen clinic. The first aim is to create a tool kit by adapting both a HIV educational curriculum and SPARCS to be culturally relevant and in Swahili language. The second aim is a feasibility study to determine if SPARCS improves mental health, adherence, and viral outcomes. Based on the work of Dr. Dow's mentors who have successfully implemented trauma-focused CBT among orphans in Tanzania, it is anticipated that SPARCS will also be feasible to implement in a resource-limited setting. The hypothesis is that by addressing mental health needs, youth will demonstrate improved ART adherence and improved virologic outcomes. This project is anticipated to improve both mental and physical health of HIV-positive adolescents in Tanzania and open a dialogue of discussion around mental health difficulties in this setting. Upon completion of this feasibility study and further didactics and mentorship, the candidate plans to submit a R01 grant to evaluate the efficacy of this intervention as a randomized controlled trial, fulfilling her goal of conducting independent global health research to improve the overall health of adolescents living in Tanzania and other resource-limited settings. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project aims to address the mental health treatment gap that exists in the HIV youth clinic in Moshi, Tanzania with the goal of improving adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART) and HIV outcomes. Addressing this treatment gap is highly relevant in two important ways. First, improved ART adherence is important not only for one's own health, but as these youth become sexually active, it also decreases the risk of sexual transmission of HIV to their partners. Second, as perinatally HIV-infected children age into adolescence, their mental health difficulties and traumatic experiences must be addressed to facilitate a healthy and productive adulthood.",Integrating Mental Health into a HIV Clinic to Improve Outcomes in Tanzanian Youth,9070050,K01TW009985,"['University Medical Centers ', ' Academic Medical Centers ', ' teenage ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' Adolescence ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Age ', ' Behavior ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Biometrics ', ' Biometry ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' cognitive behavioral treatment ', ' cognitive behavioral therapy ', ' cognitive behavioral modification ', ' cognitive behavioral intervention ', ' cognitive behavior therapy ', ' cognitive behavior modification ', ' cognitive behavior intervention ', ' Cognitive Psychotherapy ', ' Cognition Therapy ', ' Cognitive Therapy ', ' Infectious Disorder ', ' Infectious Diseases ', ' Infectious Disease Pathway ', ' Communicable Diseases ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Comorbidity ', ' Counselor ', ' Professional counselor ', ' lesson plans ', ' Curriculum ', ' Educational Curriculum ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' Information Disclosure ', ' Disclosure ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Faculty ', ' Feasibility Studies ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Hair ', ' Health ', ' Health Tutoring ', ' Health Instruction ', ' Health education ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Health Personnel ', ' healthcare policy ', ' health care policy ', ' Health Policy ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' antigen positive AIDS test ', ' antibody positive AIDS test ', ' HTLV-III Seropositivity ', ' HTLV-III Seroconversion ', ' HIV Seroconversion ', ' HIV Positivity ', ' HIV Positive ', ' HIV Antibody Positivity ', ' Anti-HIV Positivity ', ' AIDS Seropositivity ', ' AIDS Seroconversion ', ' HIV Seropositivity ', ' human T lymphotropic virus III ', ' human T cell leukemia virus III ', ' Human immunodeficiency virus 1 ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Virus Type 1 ', ' HIV1 ', ' HIV-I ', ' HIV-1 ', ' Institutes ', ' Language ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene Services ', ' Mental Health Services ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity -

"Addressing Mental Health Disparities in Refugee Children Through Family and Community-based Prevention: A CBPR Collaboration and Hybrid Implementation Effectiveness Trial ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Refugee children and families who are resettled in the United States face dramatic disparities in the incidence and treatment of mental health disorders. Resettlement stressors (poverty, limited access to care) and acculturative challenges (differences in cultural norms, discrimination) often exacerbate risks due to war- related trauma exposure. Commonly, refugee mental health services are limited-usually with a narrow focus on clinical treatment of PTSD-and rarely respond holistically to the needs or priorities of refugee communities; few interventions are designed for use across diverse cultures and refugee groups, despite rapidly evolving refugee demographics. Consequently, mental health service usage is low in resettled refugee populations. For refugee children and adolescents characterized by risk factors such as parental trauma, intergenerational conflict and other acculturative and resettlement stressors, preventive interventions hold great promise but are exceedingly rare. Cross-cultural application of community-based participatory research (CBPR) methods can increase understanding of risk and protective factors in refugee communities and contribute to development of responsive, flexible, interventions to promote healthy family functioning and child mental health and help prevent mental health disparities. We propose a CBPR-driven hybrid implementation effectiveness trial that builds upon ongoing collaborative research and community awareness-raising within Somali Bantu and Lhotshampas Bhutanese refugee communities in New England. Preliminary research and CBPR-based needs assessments with these groups has identified numerous cultural and community strengths as well as ongoing problems of difficult parent-child interactions, poor communication, and family conflict which interact with ongoing stressors to increase risks for child emotional and behavioral problems. Using a CBPR approach, a family based prevention model, the Family Strengthening Intervention for Refugees (FSI-R) was adapted from a tested model used in Africa and designed for delivery by refugee community health workers with through a process involving stakeholder consultation and local refugee Community Advisory Board input. Pilot data on the FSI-R demonstrates strong feasibility and acceptability, but further data are needed on effectiveness as well as barriers and facilitators to implementation by community health workers embedded in refugee-serving social services agencies. Specific aims are to (1) examine the impact of a family-based preventive intervention on outcomes of parent-child relationships, family functioning, and child mental health using a Hybrid Type 2Effectiveness-Implementation Design (families with children aged 7-17 in a two-arm randomized controlled trial); (2) identify barriers and facilitators to implementation of the FSI-R by community health workers by conducting a process evaluation concurrent with the delivery of the intervention; and (3) strengthen the science of community engagement to address health disparities by fortifying CBPR-based pathways of change via collaborative partnerships between refugee communities, service providers, and academic stakeholders.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed study will employ a cross-cultural CBPR approach to build from prior needs assessments and mixed methods research to evaluate the effectiveness of the Family Strengthening Intervention for Refugees (FSI-R), a preventative family home-based visiting intervention intended to mitigate mental health disparities among refugee children and families using a hybrid implementation-effectiveness design. Results of our trial will expand the evidence-base on community-based interventions for refugees and has the potential to be replicated to reduce mental health disparities affecting diverse groups of refugee children and families.        ",Addressing Mental Health Disparities in Refugee Children Through Family and Community-based Prevention: A CBPR Collaboration and Hybrid Implementation

"Improving Metabolic Screening in Diverse Severely Mentally Ill Populations DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application for a K23 Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award will support critical additional training for the candidate, Dr. Christina Mangurian, a psychiatrist at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF), based at San Francisco General Hospital. Dr. Mangurian's research plan focuses on improving metabolic screening among ethnically and racially diverse severely mentally ill populations served in community mental health clinics. To further develop her career as a mental health services researcher and to accomplish her research plan, she requires specific training in three areas: 1) clinical research methods (e.g., biostatistics, epidemiology, and mixed methods); 2) implementation research; and 3) mental health disparities research.  Dr. Mangurian has assembled a multidisciplinary team of mentors to facilitate her training and research. Her primary mentor is Dr. Dean Schillinger, a UCSF primary care internist with international expertise in primary care health services research, including implementation research in public health settings. He will oversee all training and research plans, providing his wealth of experience in this field, including his dedication to improving services for underserved populations. His expertise will be complemented by Dr. Martha Shumway, a UCSF mental health services researcher; and Dr. John Newcomer, a Washington University clinical investigator who is an expert in clinical and laboratory measurement of metabolic risk in severely mentally ill populations and in the translation of monitoring objectives into clinical practice.  People with severe mental illness die, on average, 25 years earlier than the general population, most often from cardiovascular disease. Metabolic abnormalities (e.g., diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia) resulting from antipsychotic medications used to treat this population can lead to increased rates of cardiovascular disease. Despite national guidelines emphasizing the importance of screening, metabolic screening rates for this population remain low. There is an urgent need for evidence-based, generalizable interventions that can be feasibly implemented to improve metabolic screening at community mental health clinics where this vulnerable population is primarily served. Therefore, in Aim 1, Dr. Mangurian proposes to characterize metabolic screening rates among adults with severe mental illness who receive services at community mental health clinics in San Francisco County. In Aim 2, she will tailor an intervention to improve metabolic screening for adults with severe mental illness by engaging multiple stakeholders and focusing on barriers that may impact high-risk racial/ethnic subpopulations. In Aim 3, she will conduct a pilot study of the intervention. The results of this research will contribute new information about implementation efforts to improve metabolic screening in community mental health clinics and will form the basis of an R01 application to study the effectiveness of this intervention. The majority of people with severe mental illness are prescribed antipsychotic medications, many of which result in metabolic abnormalities (e.g., dyslipidemia, diabetes) and in turn increase cardiovascular risk. We will evaluate whether a pragmatic intervention - a mandatory annual metabolic screening visit by a psychiatrist, which is linked to a web-based electronic referral and clinical decision support tool - can be feasibly implemented at community mental health clinics to enhance early detection and treatment of metabolic disorders and thereby reduce the high prevalence of cardiovascular disease among people with severe mental illness.",Improving Metabolic Screening in Diverse Severely Mentally Ill Populations,9119047,K23MH093689,"['adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Attention ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Biometrics ', ' Biometry ', ' California ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' Clinical Investigator ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Communities ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Complement ', ' Dedications ', ' diabetes ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' electronic device ', ' Electronics ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Goals ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' services research ', ' Medical Care Research ', ' Health Services Evaluation ', ' Health Services Research ', ' General Hospitals ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' high blood pressure ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Hypertension ', ' Laboratories ', ' Language ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Medicaid ', ' Medicine ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene Services ', ' Mental Health Services ', ' Mentally Ill ', ' Mental Patients ', ' Mentally Ill Persons ', ' Mentors ', ' metabolism disorder ', ' Thesaurismosis ', ' Metabolic Disorder ', ' Metabolic Diseases ', ' Methods ', ' web based ', ' online computer ', ' On-Line Systems ', ' Online Systems ', ' pilot study ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Primary Care ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Psychiatrist ', ' Public Health ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Publications ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Research Design ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Risk ', ' San Francisco ', ' Target Populations ', ' Time ', ' Neuroleptics ', ' Neuroleptic Drugs ', ' Neuroleptic Agents ', ' Major Tranquilizing Agents ', ' Major Tranquilizers ', ' Antipsychotics ', ' Antipsychotic Drugs ', ' Antipsychotic Agents ', ' Translations ', ' Universities ', ' Washington ', ' Weight Gain ', ' wt gain ', ' body weight increase ', ' body weight gain ', ' Weight Increase ', ' County ', ' Research Methodology ', ' Research Methods ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Surface ', ' Clinical ', ' Link ', ' Ensure ', ' Training ', ' Dyslipidemias ', ' Measurement ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' uptake ', ' Internist ', ' Metabolic ', ' tool ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Complex ', ' Clinic ', ' System ', ' Clinical Decision Support Systems ', ' Visit ', ' Services ', ' early detection ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' research study ', ' General Public ', ' General Population ', ' cardiovascular risk ', ' cardiovascular risk factor ', ' Modeling ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' Provider ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Effectiveness of Interventions ', ' Grant Proposals ', ' Applications Grants ', ' High Prevalence ', ' International ', ' Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award (K23) ', ' K23 Program ', ' K23 Mechanism ', ' K23 Award ', ' Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award ', ' Research Training ', ' Monitor ', ' implementation research ', ' underserved people ', ' under served population ', ' Underserved Population ', ' Minority ', ' severe mental disorder ', ' serious mental illness ', ' serious mental disorder ', ' persistent mental illness ', ' chronic mental illness ', ' severe mental illness ', ' Population ', ' Evidence based intervention ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' Early treatment ', ' early therapy ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' high risk ', ' evidence base ', ' clinical practice ', ' randomized trial ', ' Randomization trial ', ' screening ', ' metabolic rate ', ' support tools ', ' underserved minority ', ' ethnic diversity ', ' ethnically diverse ', ' racial diversity ', ' racially diverse ', ' ']",NIMH,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",K23,2016,177687,0.07961161349438568
"The Cultural Formulation Interview-Engagement Aid for Mental Health Treatment DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposed Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award (K23) is a four-year plan that will enable the candidate to develop as an intervention development, services researcher with an independent program of research. The goal of this research program is to improve the treatment engagement of underserved racial and ethnic minority populations in mental health settings by developing a cross-cultural communication engagement aid that ascertains relevant cultural views in starting, continuing, and participating in treatment. We will test the intervention's effects on medical communication and patient outcomes.  The training objectives are to: 1) train in intervention development; 2) study how to overcome cultural barriers to engagement, focusing on treatment entry, continuation, and participation; 3) acquire methodological skills to assess how cross-cultural miscommunication leads to treatment disengagement and health disparities; 4) train  in clinical trials methodology and longitudinal data analysis. The application integrates formal course work, mentorship from established investigators, and mentored research activities. Three studies, supported by the candidate's training plan, are proposed that move from intervention development to pilot testing. Project 1 consists of three separate focus groups with patients, clinicians, and administrators to define program objectives, methods, and strategies to promote treatment entry, participation, and continuation of minorities with mental illness. The candidate will present these diverse stakeholders with results from a literature review on these topics to translate theoretical methods into practical strategies. The goals of this 12-month program are to design the intervention, write the first instruction manual for clinicians, and to develop cliniian adherence and competence measures for the intervention. Project 2 is a small, pre-pilot, open study in which trained clinicians will deliver the intervention. Debriefing interviews with patient and clinicians will identify factors affecting feasibility and acceptability with subsequent revisin of the intervention's instruction manual.  An implementation plan will then be revised for clinicians based on the adapted intervention with fidelity indicators. Project 3 is a small pilot RCT to examine the feasibility and acceptability of the adapted intervention and explore its initia efficacy versus usual care at a public outpatient mental health clinic. Drawing from implementation mapping, a Scientific Advisory Board (SAB) consisting of patients, clinicians, administrators, mentors, and consultants will be used to incorporate the perspectives of multiple stakeholders in all projects.  Results from these projects will serve as pilot data to apply for subsequent grants. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This K23 prepares the candidate to initiate an independent research program on developing cross-cultural communication interventions to engage minorities in mental health treatment. This project responds to Objectives 3 and 4 of the NIMH Strategic Plan calling for the development of interventions that address the needs of diverse people with mental illness and that translate research findings into clinical practice to enhance the NIMH's public health mission.",The Cultural Formulation Interview-Engagement Aid for Mental Health Treatment,9102770,K23MH102334,"['Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' Interview ', ' Language ', ' Manuals ', ' Maps ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Mission ', ' NIMH ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' Out-patients ', ' Outpatients ', ' Patients ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Testing ', ' thoughts ', ' Thinking ', ' Translating ', ' Vocabulary ', ' Vocabulary Words ', ' Caucasians ', ' white race ', ' Occidental ', ' Caucasoid Race ', ' Caucasoid ', ' Caucasian Race ', ' Caucasian ', ' Work ', ' Writing ', ' chemotactic factor inactivator ', ' CFI ', ' Measures ', ' Administrator ', ' Competence ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' communication behavior ', ' improved ', ' prematurity ', ' premature ', ' Medical ', ' Training ', ' Research Activity ', ' instructional intervention ', ' Training Intervention ', ' Instruction Intervention ', ' Education for Intervention ', ' Educational Intervention ', ' Review Literature ', ' programs ', ' inattentiveness ', ' inattention ', ' Side ', ' Clinic ', ' System ', ' communication aid ', ' Services ', ' preference ', ' skills ', ' social ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Address ', ' Adherence ', ' Data ', ' Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award (K23) ', ' K23 Program ', ' K23 Mechanism ', ' K23 Award ', ' Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award ', ' Strategic Planning ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' Instruction ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' therapy design ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' therapy development ', ' treatment development ', ' intervention development ', ' develop therapy ', ' evidence base ', ' treatment as usual ', ' usual care ', ' intervention effect ', ' clinical practice ', ' Formulation ', ' racial minority ', ' Affect ', ' psychological disorder ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Communication ', ' data interpretation ', ' ']",NIMH,NEW YORK STATE PSYCHIATRIC INSTITUTE,K23,2016,184114,0.06436877254248255
"Emerging Regulatory Capacity in Low-income Mexican American Children DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The identification of early life precursors to psychopathology in a high risk population has considerable promise for efforts to mitigate the public health burden of mental disorders. Hispanic children, members of the fastest growing ethnic group in the US, are more than twice as likely as non-Hispanic white children to be raised in poverty, and considerable research documents deleterious effects of poverty and ethnic minority status on brain development, stress physiology, development of social and emotional regulatory capacity, and lifespan mental and physical health. To better understand developmental precursors to psychopathology in very low- income ethnic minority children, we propose to capitalize on data collected by an NIMH-funded longitudinal study of Mexican American mothers and infants (""Las Madres Nuevas"") that addressed maternal mental health and mother-infant coregulation across the first two postpartum years. The proposed project will focus on the children from Las Madres Nuevas as they approach a critical developmental transition period (ages 3-6). We will chart trajectories of cognitive, emotional, social, and behavioral competence, with the goal of early identification and predication of points at which elevated risk for disorder emerges. Our project will focus on the emergence of self-regulatory skills from early life mother-infant coregulation as a central mechanism by which early life risk factors translate into lifespan health outcomes for low-income children. The development of self- regulatory ability is a critical foundation for lifespan mental health, but Hispanic children and children from disadvantaged environments are at risk of impaired self-regulatory skills as they enter kindergarten. Our scientific approach emphasizes the cultural embeddedness of development, with the view that child outcomes must be examined with attention to cultural forces that shape and give meaning to self-regulation and mental health. We also address the role of early life biological susceptibility in shaping children's developing regulatory skills. In combination, this project holds great potential to address central questions about cultural, biological, and environmental contributions to adaptive regulatory capacity; identify early precursors to psychopathology in a high risk ethnic group; and enhance opportunities for translation to treatment and prevention. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Children raised in poverty face significantly elevated risk for developmental deficits, behavioral and emotional health problems, and poor lifespan mental and physical health. Ethnic minority status compounds the risk, but little is known about mechanisms of risk or cultural-contextual factors that may mitigate risk. A central goal of this project is to unravel developmental pathways that lead to positive or negative adaptation for minority children in a high risk context, information critical for identifying modifiable targets for intervention and prevention programs.",Emerging Regulatory Capacity in Low-income Mexican American Children,9049537,R01HD083027,"['Cultural Assimilation ', ' Acculturation ', ' Age ', ' Attention ', ' Behavior ', ' psychological disorder ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Biologic Factor ', ' Biological Factors ', ' Parturition ', ' Birth ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Brain ', ' Censuses ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' childrearing ', ' Parenting behavior ', ' Parenting ', ' Child Rearing ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Emotions ', ' Environment ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Ethnic group ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' Family ', ' Foundations ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Proctocort ', ' Nutracort ', ' Hytone ', ' Hydrocortone ', ' Eldecort ', ' Dermacort ', ' Cortril ', ' Cortispray ', ' Cortisol ', ' Cortenema ', ' Cortef ', ' Cort-Dome ', ' Cetacort ', ' Aeroseb-HC ', ' Hydrocortisone ', ' Immigrations ', ' In-Migration ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Income ', ' Infant ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' lifespan ', ' life span ', ' Length of Life ', ' Longevity ', ' long-term study ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Chicanos ', ' Chicanas ', ' Mexican Americans ', ' Mothers ', ' NIMH ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' Parents ', ' Physiology ', ' Poverty ', ' abnormal psychology ', ' Psychopathology ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Self Regulation ', ' Informal Social Control ', ' Social Development ', ' Socialization ', ' Stress ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' Translations ', ' Caucasians ', ' white race ', ' Occidental ', ' Caucasoid Race ', ' Caucasoid ', ' Caucasian Race ', ' Caucasian ', ' Adaptive Behaviors ', ' adaptive behavior ', ' adaptation behavior ', ' Competence ', ' Hispanics ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Postpartum Period ', ' post-partum ', ' Postpartum ', ' Biological ', ' Link ', ' Evaluation ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Predisposition ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' Individual ', ' Funding ', ' Immigrant ', ' Shapes ', ' Filamentous Fungi ', ' Molds ', ' Life ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' expression of emotion ', ' emotional expression ', ' showing emotion ', ' physical health ', ' physical conditioning ', ' Application Context ', ' contextual factors ', ' experience ', ' parallel processing ', ' intervention program ', ' unborn ', ' prenatal ', ' skills ', ' Prevention program ', ' member ', ' disease risk ', ' disorder risk ', ' Prevention ', ' social ', ' Early identification ', ' Impulsivity ', ' Emotional ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' behavioral health ', ' kindergarten ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Low income ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Cognitive ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' Process ', ' Cardiac ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socio-economically ', ' socio-economic ', ' socioeconomics ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' resilience ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Impairment ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' high risk ', ' Biological Markers ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' Research Domain Criteria ', ' RDoC ', ' minority children ', ' ']",NICHD,ARIZONA STATE UNIVERSITY-TEMPE CAMPUS,R01,2016,577428,0.035446469903747814
"Integrating Mental Health into a HIV Clinic to Improve Outcomes in Tanzanian Youth DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Dr. Dorothy Dow has a Master's of Science in Global Health and will become junior faculty at Duke University Medical Center in the Division of Pediatric Infectious Diseases in July 2014. For nearly three years, she has been living and working in Moshi, Tanzania. Her long-term goal is to become an independent global health researcher integrating mental health into the prevention and treatment of HIV among adolescents. During HIV clinic both at Duke University and Kilimanjaro Christian Medical Centre (KCMC), Dr. Dow has come to realize the reality of the statement, ""no health without mental health."" Her preliminary research evaluating the prevalence of mental health difficulties among HIV-positive adolescents in Tanzania has demonstrated symptoms of depression and trauma are prevalent in the local HIV youth clinic. Despite these findings, there are no psychologists or psychiatrists currently available at KCMC. This proposed career development plan incorporates a multidisciplinary five-year program complete with didactic training in global mental health, research methods and trial design, advanced biostatistics, and management skills for implementing large clinical trials. These didactics closely align with a mentored, patient-oriented research experience designing, adapting, and implementing a mental health intervention in the HIV adolescent clinic. Dr. Dow will receive mentorship from Dr. Coleen Cunningham (Chief, Pediatric Infectious Diseases and Pediatric Global Health), Dr. Karen O'Donnell (Clinical Psychology), Dr. Kathryn Whetten (Director of the Center for Health Policy and Inequalities Research), Dr. Blandina Mmbaga (Co-Site leader KCMC-Duke Collaboration, Professor of Pediatrics), and consultants Dr. John Bartlett (Duke Global Health Institute, DGHI) and Dr. Kathleen Sikkema (Clinical Psychology). Dr. Dow proposes to integrate both a HIV educational curriculum and an intensive cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and life skills training program called SPARCS, into the HIV teen clinic. The first aim is to create a tool kit by adapting both a HIV educational curriculum and SPARCS to be culturally relevant and in Swahili language. The second aim is a feasibility study to determine if SPARCS improves mental health, adherence, and viral outcomes. Based on the work of Dr. Dow's mentors who have successfully implemented trauma-focused CBT among orphans in Tanzania, it is anticipated that SPARCS will also be feasible to implement in a resource-limited setting. The hypothesis is that by addressing mental health needs, youth will demonstrate improved ART adherence and improved virologic outcomes. This project is anticipated to improve both mental and physical health of HIV-positive adolescents in Tanzania and open a dialogue of discussion around mental health difficulties in this setting. Upon completion of this feasibility study and further didactics and mentorship, the candidate plans to submit a R01 grant to evaluate the efficacy of this intervention as a randomized controlled trial, fulfilling her goal of conducting independent global health research to improve the overall health of adolescents living in Tanzania and other resource-limited settings. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project aims to address the mental health treatment gap that exists in the HIV youth clinic in Moshi, Tanzania with the goal of improving adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART) and HIV outcomes. Addressing this treatment gap is highly relevant in two important ways. First, improved ART adherence is important not only for one's own health, but as these youth become sexually active, it also decreases the risk of sexual transmission of HIV to their partners. Second, as perinatally HIV-infected children age into adolescence, their mental health difficulties and traumatic experiences must be addressed to facilitate a healthy and productive adulthood.",Integrating Mental Health into a HIV Clinic to Improve Outcomes in Tanzanian Youth,9294863,K01TW009985,"['University Medical Centers ', ' Academic Medical Centers ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' Adolescence ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' ages ', ' Age ', ' Behavior ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Biometrics ', ' Biometry ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' cognitive behavioral treatment ', ' cognitive behavioral therapy ', ' cognitive behavioral modification ', ' cognitive behavioral intervention ', ' cognitive behavior therapy ', ' cognitive behavior modification ', ' cognitive behavior intervention ', ' Cognitive Psychotherapy ', ' Cognition Therapy ', ' Cognitive Therapy ', ' Infectious Disorder ', ' Infectious Diseases ', ' Infectious Disease Pathway ', ' Communicable Diseases ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Comorbidity ', ' Counselor ', ' Professional counselor ', ' lesson plans ', ' Curriculum ', ' Educational Curriculum ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' Information Disclosure ', ' Disclosure ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Faculty ', ' Feasibility Studies ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Hair ', ' Health ', ' Health Tutoring ', ' Health Instruction ', ' Health education ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Health Personnel ', ' healthcare policy ', ' health care policy ', ' Health Policy ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' antigen positive AIDS test ', ' antibody positive AIDS test ', ' HTLV-III Seropositivity ', ' HTLV-III Seroconversion ', ' HIV Seroconversion ', ' HIV Positivity ', ' HIV Positive ', ' HIV Antibody Positivity ', ' Anti-HIV Positivity ', ' AIDS Seropositivity ', ' AIDS Seroconversion ', ' HIV Seropositivity ', ' human T lymphotropic virus III ', ' human T cell leukemia virus III ', ' Human immunodeficiency virus 1 ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Virus Type 1 ', ' HIV1 ', ' HIV-I ', ' HIV-1 ', ' Institutes ', ' Language ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health Services ', ' Mental Hygiene Services ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Morbidity -

"Advancing Stepped Care for Women's Common Mental Disorders in an LMIC Globally, young women bear a disproportionate burden of common mental disorders especially including depression and anxiety. Lifting this burden in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) requires task sharing, which entails using non-specialists and laypersons to deliver mental health services. Several trials of task sharing interventions in LMICs have shown modest improvement. Obstacles to further progress include lack of evidence regarding what conditions should be treated, with what interventions, by whom, and how to overcome access obstacles. This R21 application advances knowledge about task sharing by developing and testing for feasibility a stepped care model for LMICs using primary care (PC) nurses and mental health peers to treat depression and anxiety. It also integrates neuroscience-based prediction models by investigating how low-cost, brief Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) tools can assist in evaluating and targeting stepped care. RDoC is an NIMH initiative to use dimensional, disease agnostic, brain based tools to better understand the key features of mental illness. The research takes place in Tajikistan, a low-income country, where Dr. Weine has currently funded R01, K24, and D43 research on migration and mental health and health. In Tajikistan, women are exposed to separation from their migrant husbands, violence both within and outside of the home, STIs transmitted by their spouses, as well as high mental illness stigma, restricted service access, and severely limited treatment resources. Aim 1 better characterizes the mental health needs, supports, resources, and barriers to care of women with depression (including with co-occurring anxiety) recruited from one primary care clinic in Dushanbe, through qualitative interviews and focus groups. Aim 2 forms an intervention design team that builds on knowledge gained through Aim 1 and on two existing interventions (BRIDGES and Interpersonal Psychotherapy) to develop a novel stepped care model that includes: 1) PC nurse and physician led screening and triage; 2) peer and PC nurse co-led psycho-education and support groups; 3) peer or PC nurse led Interpersonal Psychotherapy, and; 4) PC physician led medication treatment. Aim 3 assesses the feasibility and acceptability of the stepped care model with 45 women who have depression (including with co-occurring anxiety) recruited from a primary care clinic in Dushanbe, and whether brief tools assessing RDoC subconstructs of acute threat and cognitive control, predict or moderate pre-post changes. It builds on Dr. Weine’s strong collaborative partnerships with Tajik mental health and health leaders and researchers at the Prisma Research Center in Dushanbe, as well as the Tajikistan Ministry of Health and the Republican Psychiatric Center. This study will result in an adapted and piloted stepped care model that we hope to test in a subsequent R01 study. It will also result in increased capacity for mental health research that will augment Weine’s K24 and D43 research training program. The study addresses Grand Challenges in Global Mental Health Goal C to foster integration of mental health into primary care, and NIMH Strategic Aim 3 by developing new and better interventions that incorporate the diverse needs and circumstances of people with mental illness. It will help to build an evidence-based program that can then be introduced into public health services in Tajikistan. In Tajikistan, as well as in other LMICs, women suffer disproportionally from common mental disorders and also experience separation from their migrant husbands, trauma, and STIs, as well as stigma, gender inequality, poverty, and access barriers to mental health services. This project uses a task sharing approach to develop and test for feasibility a novel stepped care model for women with depression delivered by primary care nurses and mental health peers. It also explores how RDoC neuroscience contributes to implementation science through enhancing the evaluation and targeting of a stepped care model. Augmenting an existing D43 research training program, the project will further advance the capacities of researchers and research institutions in Tajikistan, and will develop an evidence-based program that has potential for being introduced into the country’s public mental health service system.",Advancing Stepped Care for Women's Common Mental Disorders in an LMIC,9341380,R21MH108363,"['adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Anxiety ', ' Award ', ' bear ', ' Ursidae ', ' Bears ', ' Ursidae Family ', ' psychological disorder ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Chicago ', ' Communities ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Family ', ' Feedback ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' healthcare policy ', ' health care policy ', ' Health Policy ', ' Illinois ', ' Interview ', ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health Services ', ' Mental Hygiene Services ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methods ', ' Nomads ', ' Migrant ', ' Persons ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' NIMH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' Neurosciences ', ' Nurses ', ' Physicians ', ' Play ', ' Poverty ', ' Primary Care Physician ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Primary Care ', ' Primary Nursing Care ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' recruit ', ' active recruitment ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Running ', ' Support Groups ', ' self help organization ', ' Self-Help Groups ', ' Tajikistan ', ' Testing ', ' Training Programs ', ' Triage ', ' USPHS ', ' Public Health Service ', ' United States Public Health Service ', ' Universities ', ' violent behavior ', ' violent ', ' Violence ', ' Woman ', ' Womens Health Services ', ' Womans Health Services ', "" Women's Health Services "", ' Work ', ' Gender ', ' prisma ', ' Caring ', ' Married Persons ', ' Spouses ', ' base ', ' Acute ', ' Kosovo ', ' Lifting ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Fostering ', ' Research Activity ', ' Inequality ', ' Husband ', ' Wife ', ' Funding ', ' tool ', ' Consensus ', ' Retreatment ', ' Knowledge ', ' Investigation ', ' Dimensions ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' Clinic ', ' System ', ' Country ', ' Services ', ' experience ', ' Stretching ', ' novel ', ' peer ', ' Prevention ', ' Modeling ', ' social stigma ', ' stigma ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Provider ', ' Institution ', ' Address ', ' Advocate ', ' Base of the Brain ', ' Research Training ', ' cost ', ' care systems ', ' interpersonal psychotherapy ', ' interpersonal therapy ', ' therapy efficacy ', ' therapeutically effective ', ' therapeutic efficacy ', ' intervention efficacy ', ' Treatment Efficacy ', ' migration ', ' Trauma ', ' Evidence based program ', ' implementation science ', ' cognitive control ', ' therapy design ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' evidence base ', ' young woman ', ' adolescent women ', ' adolescent woman ', ' screening ', ' Research Domain Criteria ', ' RDoC ', ' low and middle-income countries ', ' LMIC ', ' brain dysfunction ', ' dysfunctional brain ', ' low income country ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT CHICAGO,R21,2017,176432,0.05434651426404011
"Distribution of Child Mental Health Workforce and Health Care for Children with Autism ABSTRACT  It has become an increasingly important public health issue to meet the needs of children with autism and other autism-spectrum disorders (ASDs), which are complex developmental disorders characterized by repetitive behavior and delayed social interaction and communication. Studies have indicated that the prevalence of ASDs among children has more than doubled during the past decade. Recent studies have also found substantial unmet mental health (MH) care needs among children with ASDs. While multiple factors contribute to the unmet needs, one important contributing factor is likely an insufficient child MH workforce, especially a “critical shortage” of child psychiatrists. Yet no work has been done to understand whether MH care is more accessible and patient experience and satisfaction are better for children with autism in areas with higher supply of child MH workforce than in those areas with lower supply.  To fill the gap, this study is designed to provide timely empirical evidence of the consequences of child MH workforce supply on MH care for children with autism. Our specific aims are:  Aim 1. Examine the relationship between the child MH workforce supply, by discipline, and access to, utilization of, and experience and satisfaction with mental health care for children with autism.  Aim 2. Examine the relationship between the child MH workforce supply, by discipline, and family burden of children with autism.  Aim 3. Examine whether the effects of child mental health workforce supply on mental health care access, satisfaction, and family burden differ by race and ethnicity or between rural and urban residence.  The proposed project is innovative because (1) unlike previous studies, we will examine the supply of multiple disciplines simultaneously, and (2) our structural, econometric model of physician entry and market structure is explicitly causal, thus providing an answer to the most common objections to the methods typically used in the previous studies of association between physician supply and geographic variations in health care.  The proposed research is highly significant for multiple reasons. First, without an adequate supply of MH providers, the current efforts to strengthen the public health impact of NIMH supported dissemination of research-tested interventions would not be able to achieve optimal effects. Second, some experts have called for more empirical studies of the challenging issue of insufficient and maldistributed supply of child MH workforce. This proposed study responds to the call, and it will generate empirical evidence that will provide policymakers critical information as they address this challenging issue. To our knowledge, the proposed project will be the first to assess how MH workforce supply affects mental health care access, satisfaction and family burden for children with autism. It will also be the first study to examine whether MH workforce supply ameliorates or exacerbates existing disparities in MH health care among this group of children. Despite the growth of research on children with autism, there is still a lack of studies examining how the supply of mental health workforce affects this group of children's mental health care access, utilization, and satisfaction, and their family burden. The proposed project will use large national datasets covering a recent 15-year period to examine these issues and fill the gaps in the literature.",Distribution of Child Mental Health Workforce and Health Care for Children with Autism,9446522,R01MH112760,"['Affect ', "" Kanner's Syndrome "", ' Infantile Autism ', ' Early Infantile Autism ', ' Autism ', ' Autistic Disorder ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Child Health ', ' Child health care ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Complement ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Expenditure ', ' Family ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Growth ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Health Personnel ', ' treatment access ', ' health services availability ', ' health service access ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' accessibility to health services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Access to Care ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' Insurance ', ' Literature ', ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health Services ', ' Mental Hygiene Services ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' NIMH ', ' Parents ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Psychiatrist ', ' Psychologist ', ' Public Health ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Research ', ' Research Support ', ' Social Interaction ', ' Social Workers ', ' medical specialties ', ' Specialty ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Waiting Lists ', ' Work ', ' Econometric Models ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Underinsured ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Caring ', ' child mental health service ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Discipline ', ' Individual ', ' satisfaction ', ' Early Intervention ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Empirical Research ', ' Life ', ' Insurance Coverage ', ' Insurance Status ', ' Complex ', ' System ', ' Services ', ' preference ', ' experience ', ' care seeking ', ' Structure ', ' response ', ' social stigma ', ' stigma ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' developmental disease/disorder ', ' developmental disorder ', ' Provider ', ' geographic difference ', ' geographic variation ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' research data dissemination ', ' research dissemination ', ' Address ', ' Child Mental Health ', ' Symptoms ', ' autism spectrum disorder ', ' autistic spectrum disorder ', ' Data ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' dissemination research ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Prevalence ', ' social communication ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' cognitive enhancement ', ' repetitive behavior ', ' urban residence ', ' rural residence ', ' rural households ', ' ']",NIMH,RAND CORPORATION,R01,2017,466321,0.09273236210131885
"Effects of Hospital-Community-Public Health Integration on Racial and Ethnic Disparities in Mental Health Summary Mental illness is a major public health concern in the U.S. and a significant source of morbidity and mortality. Racial and ethnic minority patients experience disproportionate burdens of common physical health conditions associated with mental illness, largely due to the lack of health care access and social stigma. Effectively treating mental illness and the associated conditions will depend on a comprehensive approach that crosses health systems and policies, such as the Community Benefit State Laws, to target “Population Health” and emphasize the value of social determinants of health. However, the current mental health care system works in a silo, and evidence of care coordination on health disparities is lacking. The goal of this study is to examine system-level care coordination among hospitals, communities, and public health agencies, and to estimate its impacts on unmet health care needs in African American and Latino patients with mental illness. The rationale for the proposed research is that once it is known what specific coordination practices (e.g. medical services, transportation, public housing) and policies are most successful for different patient populations, integration of mental and physical health care delivery systems can be designed in a more cost-effective way to overcome the barriers from stigma and limited health care access. In this project, we will first determine the effects of Community Benefit State Laws on racial and ethnic disparities in health care access, quality, and costs among people with mental illness (Aim 1). Within this context, we will further identify the variation of hospital-based adoption of care coordination practices and its correlation with patient and community level socio- demographics, local public health resources, and the extent of the implementation of community benefit laws (Aim 2); and determine the impact of care coordination practices between hospitals, communities, and public health agencies on racial and ethnic health disparities (Aim 3). We will use mixed methods: (1) we will construct a multi-level data set by linking multiple nationally representative data sets and use difference-in- differences approach to estimate the impact of system-level care coordination on different racial/ethnic groups; and (2) we will investigate challenges to implementing system-level coordination using focus groups of racial and ethnic minority patient representatives, hospital administrators and providers, and representatives from public health agencies. The proposed research is significant because (1) identified practices are expected to provide evidence on how to personalize mental health care coordination for racial and ethnic minority patients to address heterogeneous preferences in mental health treatment; (2) identified system-level care coordination practices are expected to be cost-effective, which in turn can make the coordination sustainable for underserved populations. Our results are expected to break down longstanding silos and bridge the gap between health care providers, community based organizations, social service agencies, and the public health sector delivery system, in addition to providing evidence to reduce health disparities through care coordination. Narrative The proposed research is relevant to public health because results will help us identify the specific sets of system-level care coordination practices (e.g., integrating physical and behavioral health, tracking readmissions, sharing clinical information across health sectors, mental health prevention interventions, transportation, public housing) that work best for minority populations with mental illness and provide evidence to reduce health disparities through care coordination across health care sectors. This timely study will inform the critical role of system-level care coordination in emerging health policy initiatives under the Affordable Care Act and a call for comprehensive mental health care reform. Thus, the proposed research is relevant to the NIMHD’s mission (PAR-16-221) to “conduct system-level health services research that can directly contribute to improve minority health and/or reduce health disparities in health care settings”.",Effects of Hospital-Community-Public Health Integration on Racial and Ethnic Disparities in Mental Health,9329801,R01MD011523,"['Adoption ', ' psychological disorder ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Communities ', ' health services delivery ', ' Healthcare Delivery ', ' health care delivery ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Health Personnel ', ' healthcare policy ', ' health care policy ', ' Health Policy ', ' Health Resources ', ' treatment access ', ' health services availability ', ' health service access ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' accessibility to health services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Access to Care ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' services research ', ' Medical Care Research ', ' Health Services Evaluation ', ' Health Services Research ', ' Level of Health ', ' Health Status ', ' Hospital Administrators ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Hospitals ', ' Community Hospitals ', ' Laws ', ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mentally Ill Persons ', ' Mentally Ill ', ' Mental Patients ', ' Methods ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Mission ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Patient Representative ', ' Patients ', ' Public Health ', ' Public Housing ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Social Values ', ' Social Work ', ' Social Service ', ' Target Populations ', ' Time ', ' Transportation ', ' Work ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Latino ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Medical ', ' Healthcare Reform ', ' Health Care Reform ', ' Link ', ' Individual ', ' Policies ', ' root ', ' Plant Roots ', ' programs ', ' Source ', ' System ', ' physical conditioning ', ' physical health ', ' Health Care Sector ', ' Healthcare Sector ', ' Services ', ' preference ', ' experience ', ' health care model ', ' care delivery ', ' Modeling ', ' behavioral health ', ' response ', ' social stigma ', ' stigma ', ' Provider ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Address ', ' Health system ', ' Data ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Preventative intervention ', ' Community Health ', ' minority health ', ' cost ', ' underserved people ', ' under served population ', ' Underserved Population ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' cost effective ', ' cost-effective ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' demographics ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' patient population ', ' population health ', ' social health determinants ', ' community partnership ', ' ethnic health disparity ', ' racial minority ', ' disparity reduction ', ' reduce disparity ', ' Affordable Care Act ', ' Obamacare ', ' ']",NIMHD,"UNIV OF MARYLAND, COLLEGE PARK",R01,2017,414285,0.0887779572828247
"Mental Health Services for Infants/Toddlers Receiving Part C Early Intervention Project Summary/Abstract This R34 resubmission proposes to develop and examine a mental health service model for families of infants/toddlers with developmental delay that reduces risk for mental health problems, and in turn, enhances readiness for preschool. Infants/toddlers with developmental delay exhibit significantly higher rates of disruptive behaviors, peer problems, impulsivity, and academic failure. Their parents also are at elevated risk for mental health problems and child maltreatment. Families of infants/toddlers with developmental delay are more likely to live in poverty with limited access to services, and most receive government-funded, home- based Early Intervention (EI) services (i.e., Part C of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act). We propose to leverage the unique position of Infant-Toddler Developmental Specialists (ITDS), front-line providers of EI services, to support parent-infant/toddler interactions and reduce family risks for mental health problems. Based on a rich empirical literature, we selected Child-Directed Interaction (CDI), the first phase of Parent-Child Interaction Therapy, as an evidence-based intervention to increase positive parent-infant/toddler interactions and reduce negative interactions. CDI aligns with the training, role, and function of ITDS, and responds to the needs of referred families. We will collaborate with EI provider agencies toward a service model that emphasizes initial training, ongoing supervision, and quality assurance to facilitate infant/toddler mental health (social, emotional, behavioral competence) and parent mental health (anxiety/depression, parenting stress, caregiver strain). We will examine feasibility, fidelity, and acceptability of the proposed model to identify facilitators and barriers to service delivery, and we will examine its promise compared to services as usual (n = 4 agencies, 16 ITDS, 112 families). In light of the extensive needs and depleting resources faced by families of infants/toddlers with developmental delay, the proposed work provides a unique opportunity to enhance the natural role and capacity of a skilled EI workforce to provide high quality services that minimize mental health problems and facilitate healthy child and family trajectories.

"Intervention to Overcome Mental Health Disparities in Criminally-Justice Involved Transgender Women Project Summary/Abstract Transgender women, assigned a male birth sex who identify along the female gender spectrum, experience substantial mental health disparities and high prevalence of incarceration relative to the US general population. Incarcerated transgender women experience widespread structural and interpersonal forms of stigma, including the denial of necessary healthcare. Cross-sectional research suggests that incarceration experiences contribute to the mental health disparities observed among transgender women with incarceration histories, but longitudinal research is lacking. While prisons provide a unique setting within which to clinically intervene to improve the health of disproportionately incarcerated populations, without culturally and clinically knowledgeable providers, transgender inmates are excluded from this benefit. This F31 aims to improve the health of transgender women across two research aims: (1) Examine the psychosocial health trajectories of transgender women according to their incarceration history using data from a prospective cohort study of US transgender women (n=300). Specifically, we will examine the magnitude of the disparity in depressive distress and substance use at 4, 8, and 12 months comparing transgender women with and without incarceration histories, and test for differences in the intercept and slope of the trajectory between these groups over time. Additionally, we will explore the interaction between person-level (incarceration, demographics) and time- variant (stigma, resilience) predictors of depressive distress and substance use for transgender women to determine risk and protective factors in this population. (2) Develop and pilot test an educational intervention to increase prison healthcare providers' ability to care for transgender inmates. Using an implementation science framework, we will adapt an existing transgender competency training for healthcare providers to be inclusive of the prison context; openly field test the intervention with 70 prison healthcare providers in a non-randomized pilot; and evaluate intervention feasibility and acceptability, and changes in providers' knowledge, attitudes, and behavioral intentions to care for transgender patients at baseline, and immediately and 3 months post- intervention. The proposed research addresses an urgent need to equip prison providers with the knowledge and skills to effectively care for transgender inmates. This pilot intervention will set the stage for future refinement and evaluation via a randomized controlled trial with the long-term goal of implementing this needed intervention in correctional institutions across the US. Thus, this research has far-reaching implications for improving the mental health of transgender women during and after incarceration. Through the completion of this 2-year research and training fellowship, the applicant will gain training in advanced statistical methods, intervention development, and scientific communication. The extensive training provided by a multidisciplinary mentoring team will prepare the applicant for a successful career as an academic mentor and independent researcher working to eliminate mental health disparities in gender minority populations. Project Narrative Transgender women are disproportionately incarcerated and experience structural and interpersonal forms of stigma while incarcerated, which negatively affects their physical and mental health. The proposed study will lead to (1) the first estimates of the long-term mental health effects of incarceration among transgender women with incarceration histories; (2) the development of the first transgender cultural and clinical competency training for correctional healthcare providers containing a detailed curriculum and supporting materials; and (3) the first state-wide delivery and evaluation of a transgender cultural and clinical competency training to prison healthcare providers in Connecticut. This research has the potential to improve the mental and physical health of transgender women during incarceration and upon release.",Intervention to Overcome Mental Health Disparities in Criminally-Justice Involved Transgender Women,9335186,F31MD011203,"['Affect ', ' Anxiety ', ' Attitude ', ' Behavior ', ' psychological disorder ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Parturition ', ' Birth ', ' Clinical Competence ', ' Communication ', ' Connecticut ', ' lesson plans ', ' Curriculum ', ' Educational Curriculum ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Discrimination ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Employment ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' Fellowship ', ' Female ', ' Future ', ' Gender Identity ', ' Goals ', ' Hand ', ' Health ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Health Personnel ', ' treatment access ', ' health services availability ', ' health service access ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' accessibility to health services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Access to Care ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' Income ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' male ', ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' Persons ', ' Patients ', ' Prisons ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Suicide ', ' suicidality ', ' intent to die ', ' fatal suicide ', ' fatal attempt ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Gender ', ' self injury ', ' self harm ', ' intentional self injury ', ' intentional self harm ', ' deliberate self harm ', ' Deliberate Self-Harm ', ' Self-Injurious Behavior ', ' Competence ', ' Criminal Justice ', ' depressive ', ' depression symptom ', ' Emotional Depression ', ' depressive symptoms ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Caring ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' incarceration ', ' incarcerated ', ' Imprisonment ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Medical ', ' Link ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Distress ', ' using substances ', ' substance using ', ' substance use ', ' AOD use ', ' Alcohol or Other Drugs use ', ' Policies ', ' instructional intervention ', ' Training Intervention ', ' Instruction Intervention ', ' Education for Intervention ', ' Educational Intervention ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' Knowledge ', ' Victimization ', ' Correctional Institutions ', ' physical conditioning ', ' physical health ', ' psychosocial ', ' transgender ', ' trans* ', ' experience ', ' field study ', ' field test ', ' field learning ', ' field based data ', ' stressor ', ' success ', ' Intercept ', ' skills ', ' Participant ', ' cultural competence ', ' General Population ', ' General Public ', ' Reporting ', ' Substance abuse problem ', ' substance abuse ', ' abuse of substances ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Quality of Care ', ' QOC ', ' social stigma ', ' stigma ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Provider ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' High Prevalence ', ' Research Training ', ' sex ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' post intervention ', ' convict ', ' resilience ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' demographics ', ' implementation science ', ' therapy development ', ' treatment development ', ' intervention development ', ' develop therapy ', ' transgender women ', ' transwomen ', ' transwoman ', ' trans-women ', ' gender minority ', ' negative affect ', ' negative affectivity ', ' Prospective cohort study ', ' ']",NIMHD,YALE UNIVERSITY,F31,2017,44044,0.05591486054611304
"The Cultural Formulation Interview-Engagement Aid for Mental Health Treatment DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposed Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award (K23) is a four-year plan that will enable the candidate to develop as an intervention development, services researcher with an independent program of research. The goal of this research program is to improve the treatment engagement of underserved racial and ethnic minority populations in mental health settings by developing a cross-cultural communication engagement aid that ascertains relevant cultural views in starting, continuing, and participating in treatment. We will test the intervention's effects on medical communication and patient outcomes.  The training objectives are to: 1) train in intervention development; 2) study how to overcome cultural barriers to engagement, focusing on treatment entry, continuation, and participation; 3) acquire methodological skills to assess how cross-cultural miscommunication leads to treatment disengagement and health disparities; 4) train  in clinical trials methodology and longitudinal data analysis. The application integrates formal course work, mentorship from established investigators, and mentored research activities. Three studies, supported by the candidate's training plan, are proposed that move from intervention development to pilot testing. Project 1 consists of three separate focus groups with patients, clinicians, and administrators to define program objectives, methods, and strategies to promote treatment entry, participation, and continuation of minorities with mental illness. The candidate will present these diverse stakeholders with results from a literature review on these topics to translate theoretical methods into practical strategies. The goals of this 12-month program are to design the intervention, write the first instruction manual for clinicians, and to develop cliniian adherence and competence measures for the intervention. Project 2 is a small, pre-pilot, open study in which trained clinicians will deliver the intervention. Debriefing interviews with patient and clinicians will identify factors affecting feasibility and acceptability with subsequent revisin of the intervention's instruction manual.  An implementation plan will then be revised for clinicians based on the adapted intervention with fidelity indicators. Project 3 is a small pilot RCT to examine the feasibility and acceptability of the adapted intervention and explore its initia efficacy versus usual care at a public outpatient mental health clinic. Drawing from implementation mapping, a Scientific Advisory Board (SAB) consisting of patients, clinicians, administrators, mentors, and consultants will be used to incorporate the perspectives of multiple stakeholders in all projects.  Results from these projects will serve as pilot data to apply for subsequent grants. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This K23 prepares the candidate to initiate an independent research program on developing cross-cultural communication interventions to engage minorities in mental health treatment. This project responds to Objectives 3 and 4 of the NIMH Strategic Plan calling for the development of interventions that address the needs of diverse people with mental illness and that translate research findings into clinical practice to enhance the NIMH's public health mission.",The Cultural Formulation Interview-Engagement Aid for Mental Health Treatment,9302850,K23MH102334,"['Affect ', ' psychological disorder ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Communication ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Decision Making ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Interview ', ' Language ', ' Manuals ', ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Mission ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' NIMH ', ' Outpatients ', ' Out-patients ', ' Patients ', ' Psychiatry ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Social support ', ' social support network ', ' Testing ', ' Translating ', ' Vocabulary Words ', ' Vocabulary ', ' white race ', ' Occidental ', ' Caucasoid Race ', ' Caucasoid ', ' Caucasian Race ', ' Caucasian ', ' Caucasians ', ' Work ', ' Writing ', ' Measures ', ' Administrator ', ' Competence ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Caring ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' communication behavior ', ' Label ', ' improved ', ' prematurity ', ' premature ', ' Medical ', ' Training ', ' Research Activity ', ' instructional intervention ', ' Training Intervention ', ' Instruction Intervention ', ' Education for Intervention ', ' Educational Intervention ', ' Review Literature ', ' programs ', ' inattention ', ' inattentiveness ', ' Clinic ', ' System ', ' communication aid ', ' Services ', ' preference ', ' skills ', ' Adverse effects ', ' treatment adverse effect ', ' therapy adverse effect ', ' side effect ', ' Treatment Side Effects ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Address ', ' Adherence ', ' Data ', ' Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award ', ' Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award (K23) ', ' K23 Program ', ' K23 Mechanism ', ' K23 Award ', ' Strategic Planning ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' Instruction ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' therapy design ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' therapy development ', ' treatment development ', ' intervention development ', ' develop therapy ', ' public health relevance ', ' alternative treatment ', ' evidence base ', ' standard care ', ' standard treatment ', ' treatment as usual ', ' usual care ', ' intervention effect ', ' clinical practice ', ' Formulation ', ' racial minority ', ' ']",NIMH,NEW YORK STATE PSYCHIATRIC INSTITUTE,K23,2017,177988,0.06436877254248255
"Medicare Policy Effects on Mental Health Care Disparities This project will assess the impact of recent Medicare policy changes on racial/ethnic disparities in mental health (MH) care. Medicare is the most common source of coverage for elderly and non-elderly disabled Americans with mental illness. Two recent policy changes have the potential to reduce wide disparities in access to mental health care, including care provided by primary care providers (PCPs) and specialty mental health providers (MHPs). Specifically, the Affordable Care Act (ACA) temporarily increased payments in 2013- 2014 by up to 25 percent for PCPs caring for Full Subsidy dual-eligible beneficiaries. Separately, the Medicare Improvements for Patients and Providers Act (MIPPA) gradually increased MHP payments (2009-2014) by up to 37 percent for Full Subsidy beneficiaries, and reduced beneficiary coinsurance for MHP visits from 50% to 20% for other beneficiaries (i.e., Partial Subsidy beneficiaries with incomes just above eligibility for Full Subsidies). In other settings, changes in provider payments and cost-sharing have been effective policy levers in modifying care utilization and access. In Medicare, these policies could reduce disparities by improving access to care for low-income income and Full Subsidy dual-eligibles, who are disproportionately racial/ethnic minorities; but there is little data on their effects. Despite the limited evidence, 34 states dropped PCP payment rates in 2015 (back to pre-2013 levels), while 16 states have continued the payment increase. We will use the natural experiments created by the ACA and MIPPA to assess the effects of these policy changes on racial/ethnic disparities in MH care within three sets of outcomes: Aim 1) medical care and quality process measures (e.g., outpatient visits to PCPs and MHPs for mental health diagnoses, antidepressant use in major depression); Aim 2) clinical events (e.g., emergency department visits and hospitalizations); and Aim 3) total and component medical spending. We will use comprehensive Medicare claims data (2006-2018) to compare longitudinal changes for Black, Hispanic, Asian, Native American and White beneficiaries affected vs. unaffected by the policies using a difference-in-difference approach with fixed effects (within-person) estimation. To estimate the effects of each policy, our identification strategy exploits the staggered implementation of each policy, differences across states in the magnitude of the payment changes based on baseline payment rates, and variations in exposure associated with eligibility for Full vs. Partial low-income subsidies. We will compare four resulting policy exposure groups: 1) beneficiaries affected by the PCP (2013- 2014) and MHP payment increases; 2) beneficiaries affected by the extended PCP (2013-2018) and MHP payment increases; 3) beneficiaries affected only by the MHP cost-sharing decrease; and 4) beneficiaries unaffected by either policy (concurrent controls). The findings from this study have the potential to inform decision-makers seeking to reduce the substantial disparities in MH care with actionable findings, especially as the federal government and states make ongoing decisions about payment policy and benefit design. Project Narrative The Federal Collaborative for Health Disparities Research has identified racial and ethnic disparities in mental health care access and treatment as a top area needing immediate national attention. Recently, the Medicare program implemented two policies that increased physician payments for care provided to the poorest beneficiaries and reduced beneficiary out-of-pocket costs for specialty mental health care. These policies could increase access to primary and mental health care for racial and ethnic minorities with mental illness and reduce existing disparities. This project will assess the impact of these major policy changes on disparities in access, treatment, patient outcomes, and medical spending.",Medicare Policy Effects on Mental Health Care Disparities,9236351,R01MD010456,"['National Government ', ' Federal Government ', ' individuals with disabilities ', ' disabled people ', ' disabled individual ', ' disabled ', ' Persons with Disabilities ', ' People with Disabilities ', ' Handicapped ', ' Disabled Population ', ' Disabled Persons ', ' Health ', ' health insurance for disabled ', ' Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Disabled Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Aged and Disabled, Title 18 ', ' Medicare ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Health Personnel ', ' treatment access ', ' health services availability ', ' health service access ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' accessibility to health services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Access to Care ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' Spanish Americans ', ' Hispanic Americans ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Income ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Medicaid ', ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' mortality ', ' Persons ', ' Outpatients ', ' Out-patients ', ' parity ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Primary Care ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Research ', ' medical specialties ', ' Specialty ', ' oriental ', ' Asians ', ' Measures ', ' Cost Sharing ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Hispanics ', ' Outcome Measure ', ' Process Measure ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Medical ', ' Policies ', ' Funding ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Native Americans ', ' programs ', ' Event ', ' Side ', ' Source ', ' Visit ', ' American ', ' Medicare/Medicaid ', ' payment ', ' Sentinel ', ' Drops ', ' Provider ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Major Depressive Disorder ', ' major depression disorder ', ' major depression ', ' clinical depression ', ' Low income ', ' Data ', ' Improve Access ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Patterns of Care ', ' beneficiary ', ' cost ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' Natural experiment ', ' dual eligible ', ' federal poverty level ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' Medicare claim ', ' Emergency department visit ', ' Emergency room visit ', ' Emergency care visit ', ' ER visit ', ' ED visit ', ' racial minority ', ' disparity reduction ', ' reduce disparity ', ' health care disparity ', ' healthcare disparity ', ' disparity in healthcare ', ' disparity in care ', ' Affordable Care Act ', ' Obamacare ', ' Affect ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Elderly ', ' Antidepressants ', ' Antidepressant Drugs ', ' Antidepressant Agent ', ' Antidepressive Agents ', ' Asian Americans ', ' Attention ', ' Dorsum ', ' Back ', ' psychological disorder ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Coinsurance ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Protocol Screening ', ' Eligibility ', ' Eligibility Determination ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' ']",NIMHD,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R01,2017,691664,0.06058846409091111
"Addressing Social Determinants to Reduce Refugee Mental Health Disparities DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this study is to test an ecological/empowerment approach to reducing mental health disparities among socioeconomically disadvantaged Central African and Iraqi refugee adults by examining the effectiveness of a community-based advocacy, learning, and social support intervention (Refugee Well-being Project, RWP) that addresses social determinants of mental health and incorporates an evidence-based trauma treatment (Narrative Exposure Therapy, NET) for refugees with PTSD. The waitlist randomized controlled trial with 180 African and Iraqi refugee adults is innovative and significant because it will rigorously test the effectiveness of addressin social determinants of mental health (poverty, social and physical environments, access to services, marginalization) to reduce mental health disparities, as well as examine the impact of a community-based, mutual learning intervention on improving engagement and retention in evidence-based trauma-focused treatment for those who need it. The RWP intervention emphasizes a sustainable and replicable partnership model between refugee resettlement agencies and universities/colleges that involves refugee adults and undergraduate advocates working together to: a) increase refugees' abilities to navigate their new communities; b) improve refugees' access to community resources; c) enhance meaningful social roles by valuing refugees' culture, experiences, and knowledge; d) reduce refugees' social isolation; and e) increase communities' responsiveness to refugees. The RWP intervention is administered by university undergraduate students enrolled in a service learning course, and has two elements: 1) Learning Circles, which involve cultural exchange and one-on-one learning opportunities, and; 2) Advocacy, which involves collaborative efforts to mobilize community resources related to health, housing, employment, education, and legal issues. Pilot testing of RWP demonstrated feasibility, appropriateness, acceptability, and preliminary evidence that the intervention decreased Hmong, Central African, and Iraqi participants' psychological distress and increased protective factors. A mixed methods strategy with data collected from each participant at four time points over a period of 14 months will be used to test the effectiveness of the 6- month intervention to reduce psychological distress (PTSD, depression, and culturally-specific distress), increase protective factors (access to resources, English proficiency, environmental mastery, mental health service use, and social support), and engage and retain refugee adults with PTSD in an evidence-based trauma treatment (NET). Mechanisms of intervention effectiveness will be explored by testing mediating relationships between protective factors and psychological distress. Qualitative components of interviews with refugee participants and paired qualitative interviews with refugees and undergraduates will explore participants' experiences in the intervention, inform interpretation of quantitative data, and investigate unexpected impacts. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This study tests the effectiveness of an innovative, community-based advocacy, learning, and social support intervention (Refugee Well-being Project) to reduce the mental health disparities experienced by low-income refugee adults by addressing several well-defined social determinants of mental health and increasing refugees' engagement in trauma treatment, when warranted. This is important not only for the large number of refugees in the United States and worldwide, but also because the intervention model has the potential to alleviate the disproportionate psychological distress experienced by other immigrant and minority populations throughout the United States who experience inequities in social and material resources and disproportionate exposure to trauma and stress and who are less likely to access formal mental health services because of lack of trust and concerns about culturally appropriateness.

"Mechanisms Underlying Racial/Ethnic Disparities in Mental Disorders ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  As part of the Affordable Health Care Act, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) must develop and evaluate an action plan to reduce racial/ethnic health disparities, including increased preventive care and investments in community health teams that can benefit minority communities. But for such a plan to be effective, thoughtful targeting is needed. The proposed research has the potential to build a solid research foundation for developing interventions to achieve mental health equity that could be implemented as part of the HHS agenda to reduce disparities. Nearly 40% of the US population develops a mental disorder in their lifetime, with racial/ethnic minority groups at particularly high risk of severe-persistent mental disorders and untreated mental illness. But fundamental questions remain unanswered given that few studies investigate the mechanisms that underlie these disparities. The research proposed here aims to attend to this knowledge gap by examining four sets of mechanisms hypothesized to play important roles in causing racial/ethnic disparities in mental disorders: (1) low socio-economic status (SES); 2) childhood adversities (e.g., maltreatment, family violence); (3) disadvantaged role constellations (e.g., early child-bearing, divorce); and (4) disadvantaged neighborhood context (e.g., residential segregation, concentrated disadvantage). We propose to study four mechanisms by carrying out secondary analysis of community epidemiological data across five surveys that provide unparalleled information about the lifetime onset of a wide range of these lifetime disorders, and disparities in the persistence and severity of these disorders once they occur. We also examine barriers to mental health care since untreated mental illness has devastating effect on minority communities. But because empirical findings typically do not bridge the distance between the people who produce the information and the people who could use the information, our last aim identifies how best to frame and use our research results as actionable targets for Intervention and/or policy change. We will work with community, consumer, and policy groups to generate recommendations for prevention, service, and policy interventions aimed at reducing racial/ethnic disparities in mental health outcomes and services. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed study investigates differential mechanisms that might help explain ethnic/racial disparities in mental health outcomes and in service delivery and to integrate these findings with processes for generating projected solutions. We propose to work iteratively with community, consumer and policymaker partners to interpret, further integrate, and generate potential recommendations for interventions and/or policy proposals that can address the identified disparities.",Mechanisms Underlying Racial/Ethnic Disparities in Mental Disorders,9119633,R01MD009719,"['adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', '

"Building Community Capacity for Disability Prevention for Minority Elders DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Although minority elders represent the fastest growing segment of an aging US population, they have less access to mental health care and prevention of disability, lagging well behind non-Latino whites, and suffering significant disparities. Blacks and Latinos have the greatest risk for disability, with striking disparities in healthy aging. This includes elderly immigrants who exhibit elevated depressive and anxiety symptoms, and higher rates of disability than the native-born population; yet, they often go undiagnosed or underdiagnosed. This is a missed opportunity given that mood disorder treatment has been shown to reduce disability days and that several risk factors for disability, such as functional mobility are modifiable. Research suggests that a contributing factor may be an insufficient supply of professional providers and the inability of evidence based treatments to reach and be acceptable to minority elders. An IOM committee recently reported that the severe workforce shortages in providing mental health care to elder adults required novel approaches to resolve. To address these disparities and prevent disability among minority elders, the proposed R01 examines how to successfully build collaborative research for the provision of evidence-based mental health and disability prevention treatments in community-based settings. Promising results in a few international studies show improved access and quality of mental health outcomes and reduced disability when interventions are delivered by Community Health Workers. Yet limited and inconsistent evidence of the efficacy of CHW-led interventions in the US context remains. While the number of community-based health interventions has grown exponentially to address these service disparities, there is a lack of systematic assessment of whether they lead to increased community capacity and systems change, and whether they improve the quality of care and potentially decrease disability. Our proposed study endeavors to address this limitation. As such, the proposed R01 will be one of few efforts that simultaneously study the three components necessary for a successful intervention: efficacy, since the intervention must work, acceptability among clients, and feasibility and sustainability within the organization. It seeks to understand the role of the partnerships in increasing community capacity for a combined mental health and disability prevention intervention, and evaluating the acceptability, efficacy, feasibility and sustainability of the intervention delivere by CHWs and exercise trainers to Latino, African American and Asian elders with moderate to severe mood symptoms and at risk of disability. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The rapid expansion of the aging population is outstripping the development of mental health and disability prevention services necessary to respond to their needs. The proposed revised R01 aims to evaluate whether partnerships between academic researchers, minority elders, and the community-based organizations which serve them can expand community resources and capabilities to effectively provide mental health services and reduce the risk of disability in minority elders.",Building Community Capacity for Disability Prevention for Minority Elders,9266764,R01AG046149,"['functional capacity ', ' functional ability ', ' daily living functionality ', ' Activities of everyday life ', ' Activities of Daily Living ', ' Adoption ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Affect ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Elderly ', ' Aging ', ' psychological disorder ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Client ', ' Communities ', ' community health worker ', ' Community Health Aides ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' Environment ', ' Exercise ', ' Exhibits ', ' Health ', ' Language ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health Services ', ' Mental Hygiene Services ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Patients ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Primary Care ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Support ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Employee Strikes ', ' Strikes ', ' Testing ', ' Work ', ' oriental ', ' Asians ', ' Native People ', ' Indigenous Population ', ' Native-Born ', ' generic ', ' Nonproprietary Drugs ', ' Generic Drugs ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' depressive ', ' depression symptom ', ' Emotional Depression ', ' depressive symptoms ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Latino ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Acute ', ' Chronic ', ' prematurity ', ' premature ', ' Training ', ' mental ', ' Psyche structure ', ' disability ', ' using substances ', ' substance using ', ' substance use ', ' AOD use ', ' Alcohol or Other Drugs use ', ' Relative Risks ', ' Immigrant ', ' bilingualism ', ' bilingual ', ' Depressed mood ', ' sadness ', ' depressed ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Adopted ', ' Clinic ', ' Source ', ' System ', ' body system ', ' Organ System ', ' Mood Disorders ', ' Affective Disorders ', ' Services ', ' mental development ', ' prevention service ', ' Prevention ', ' Human Resources ', ' personnel ', ' Manpower ', ' Reporting ', ' Emotional ', ' Modeling ', ' Quality of Care ', ' QOC ', ' social stigma ', ' stigma ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Provider ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Address ', ' Improve Access ', ' International ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Preventative intervention ', ' elder care ', ' Long-Term Care for Elderly ', ' Community Health ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Evidence based treatment ', ' years of life lost to disease ', ' years of life lost to disability ', ' disease burden ', ' burden of disease ', ' burden of illness ', ' Minority ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel approaches ', ' new approaches ', ' novel strategies ', ' therapy efficacy ', ' therapeutically effective ', ' therapeutic efficacy ', ' intervention efficacy ', ' Treatment Efficacy ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Evidence based intervention ', ' aging population ', ' population aging ', ' aged population ', ' healthy aging ', ' public health relevance ', ' community setting ', ' evidence base ', ' successful intervention ', ' efficacy testing ', ' anxiety symptoms ', ' anxious symptom ', ' community building ', ' disparity reduction ', ' reduce disparity ', ' mood symptom ', ' low income country ', ' ']",NIA,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R01,2017,758410,0.032416395899690656
"Lay Health Worker Mobilization to Address Disparities in Parent Training Services Project Summary/ Abstract The proposed K01 Mentored Research Scientist Development Award will provide the applicant with advanced training and skills to launch an independent research program focused on developing and evaluating implementation interventions that reduce mental health (MH) disparities for ethnically diverse families. This K01 proposal seeks to develop an evidence base for leveraging Lay Health Workers (LHW), community members without formalized MH training, to address determinants of MH disparities related to client demand for and the supply of behavioral parent training (BPT) programs in underserved communities. The community- partnered development and pilot evaluation of the LHW Enhancing Engagement for Parents (LEEP) implementation intervention will train LHW to conduct outreach and promote treatment engagement and skill acquisition for Latino families in Parent-Child Interaction Therapy (PCIT). Aim 1 of the study will assess the current context of LHW mobilization in children's evidence-based service delivery in community MH agencies through qualitative interviews with agency leaders and LHW, and quantitative surveys of LHW. Mixed-method analyses of these data will inform the development of LEEP. In Aim 2, the applicant will partner with community stakeholders to develop an implementation plan, structure, and process materials (e.g., fidelity measures) for LEEP. Aim 3 will pilot LEEP within an effectiveness/implementation hybrid design. Qualitative and quantitative data will inform the evaluation of LEEP including its feasibility, acceptability, and effects on client engagement, clinical outcomes, and implementation outcomes. The proposed study is well suited to the community setting and expertise the applicant brings to the project. Los Angeles County Department of MH (LACDMH) has invested considerable efforts in the implementation of evidence-based practices, including PCIT. The applicant's postdoctoral fellowship focused a MH policy reform within LACDMH, providing her insight into this large system of care. To meet her career objectives and the aims of this research project, the applicant requires additional training in: (1) implementation and health services research methodology to measure and reduce MH disparities; (2) application of implementation strategies and theories to inform the development of interventions to address supply and demand determinants of disparities; (3) approaches to improve parental entry into and engagement in treatment. Mentorship and consultation from primary sponsor, Dr. Jeanne Miranda (MH disparity reduction), co-sponsor, Dr. Anna Lau (MH disparities, implementation science), Dr. John Landsverk (implementation science), Dr. Lisa Saldana (economic evaluations of implementation efforts), Dr. Maryam Kia-Keating (community-partnered research, LHW models), Dr. Camille Nebeker (LHW training, responsible conduct of research), Dr. Emily Winslow (parent engagement), Dr. Karen Nylund-Gibson (multilevel statistical models) and Dr. Susan Ettner (health economics) will facilitate this training. Project Narrative The objective of this proposal is to develop an implementation intervention that leverages Lay Health Workers (LHW), community members without formalized mental health training, to increase the entry into and engagement in evidence-based behavioral parent training (BPT) programs for low-income, Latino as a strategy to reduce mental health disparities. This study has important public health implications, as challenges with engagement in BPT impact clinical and implementation outcomes, especially in underserved community settings.",Lay Health Worker Mobilization to Address Disparities in Parent Training Services,9314833,K01MH110608,"['Attitude ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' childrearing ', ' Parenting behavior ', ' Parenting ', ' Child Rearing ', ' Client ', ' Communities ', ' Consultations ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Family ', ' Fellowship ', ' Foundations ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' healthcare policy ', ' health care policy ', ' Health Policy ', ' services research ', ' Medical Care Research ', ' Health Services Evaluation ', ' Health Services Research ', ' Hybrids ', ' Interview ', ' Investments ', ' Los Angeles ', ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health Services ', ' Mental Hygiene Services ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methods ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Statistical Models ', ' statistical linear models ', ' statistical linear mixed models ', ' Probability Models ', ' Probabilistic Models ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' NIMH ', ' Parent-Child Relations ', ' parent offspring interaction ', ' parent child interaction ', ' Parent-Child Relationship ', ' Parents ', ' Public Health ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' recruit ', ' active recruitment ', ' Research ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Taxes ', ' Testing ', ' Training Programs ', ' County ', ' Measures ', ' Care Givers ', ' Caregivers ', ' Latino ', ' population diversity ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' diverse populations ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' Research Methods ', ' Research Methodology ', ' economic evaluation ', ' Caring ', ' career ', ' child mental health service ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Penetration ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' insight ', ' Early Intervention ', ' Funding ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Community Outreach ', ' tool ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' System ', ' Services ', ' preference ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' early childhood ', ' Speed ', ' Structure ', ' skills ', ' member ', ' outreach ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' theories ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Provider ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Effectiveness ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' low socioeconomic status ', ' low socioeconomic position ', ' low socio-economic status ', ' low socio-economic position ', ' low SES ', ' Low income ', ' Address ', ' Child Mental Health ', ' Evidence based practice ', ' Data ', ' Mentored Research Scientist Development Award ', ' Research Scientist Development Award ', ' Mentored Training Award ', ' K01 Program ', ' K01 Mechanism ', ' K01 Award ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Preventative intervention ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Monitor ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' cost ', ' health economics ', ' care systems ', ' underserved people ', ' under served population ', ' Underserved Population ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' skill acquisition ', ' skill development ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' community organizations ', ' trial comparing ', ' implementation science ', ' therapy development ', ' treatment development ', ' intervention development ', ' develop therapy ', ' health training ', ' community setting ', ' evidence base ', ' responsible research conduct ', ' community partnership ', ' ethnic diversity ', ' ethnically diverse ', ' racial minority ', ' disparity reduction ', ' reduce disparity ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SANTA BARBARA,K01,2017,149706,0.023926656534637606
"Increasing provider competence for treating stress-related mental health conditions in low resource settings  Project Summary Lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender individuals (LGBTI) present increased morbidity compared to the general population, which is attributed to healthcare discrimination and lack of LGBT-specific expertise, especially in high-stigma countries. Motivated by fear, Romanian LGBTI conceal their identities and report significantly more barriers to healthcare access than heterosexuals. Poor mental health, specifically anxiety and depression, is elevated for Romanian LGBTI, and associated with poor physical health (e.g., HIV risk, alcohol abuse.) However, LGBT-competent mental health professionals (MHPs) are nearly non-existent in Romania, and thus the negative impact of homophobia on mental health cannot be ameliorated. Neither universities nor continuing education include LGBT identity and health curricula, to the contrary, the dominant discourse promotes homosexuality as a dangerous anomaly in need of eradication. Given that a pilot of our in- person LGBT-affirmative MHP training we tested recently in Romania showed significant receptivity and increased competence among MHPs, this training is now ripe for testing its feasibility and efficacy in creating significant change via mobile delivery, in a randomized controlled trial (RCT). Proving the efficacy of this first mobile training and supervision model has high potential for cost-effective and expeditious boundless dissemination. In Aim 1, we will test the relative feasibility and efficacy of our mHealth MHP training by conducting an RCT comparing a mobile training (MT) of our MHP LGBT-competency program (n=60) to the equivalent in-person training (IPT) (n=60) we recently piloted. Both programs' content and structure will be identical (3-day trainings and two boosters 6 months apart). At baseline, 4, 8, and 12 months, we will assess, in a mobile fashion, all MHPs' LGBT-related attitudes, knowledge of LGBT health needs and clinical practice, and LGBT caseload. In Aim 2, we will test the efficacy of a companion mHealth supervision and consultation program in maintaining LGBT competency and enhancing LGBT-friendly practice. Half of the MHPs in each group will receive our mHealth supervision and expert consultation program, consisting of monthly 2-hour virtual group meetings to discuss case studies, in order to determine the added benefit of mobile supervision. After the training, 10 MHPs will provide interview-based program feedback. In Aim 3, we will build mHealth research capacity among MHPs by demonstrating how to integrate mobile data collection tools in clinical practice to monitor client progress for personalized treatment plans. We have chosen four types of partners to maximize the project's sustainability and benefit from the power of their multidisciplinarity: academics, direct service agencies supporting LGBTI, practicing MHPs, and a technical developer. This first RCT testing of an mHealth training in LGBT-competent mental healthcare in Romania affords us an unparalleled opportunity to introduce much needed expertize and mHealth methodologies in universities and clinical practice, and create a seed infrastructure for an implementation science R01 of national and global public health significance. Project Narrative The pervasive stigma and discrimination encountered by gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgender individuals (LGBTI) in Romania, coupled with the lack of resources to sustain their poor physical and mental health, are prompting the testing of this first mobile mental health professional (MHP) LGBT-competency training program in Romania, intended to build expertise to reduce health disparities. Our proposal aligns with PAR-16-292's objectives in being multidisciplinary, and using a mobile mechanism to reach MHPs efficiently with expert guidance to support their emerging LGBT-affirmative skills. The introduction and testing of mHealth tools in clinical practice represents state-of-the-science, evidence-based mental healthcare, while the project's significance is enhanced by the potential cost-effectiveness, scalability and generalizability of an implementation science-like mobile training model.",Increasing provider competence for treating stress-related mental health conditions in low resource settings ,9340890,R21MH113673,"['etoh use ', ' ethanol use ', ' ethanol product use ', ' ethanol intake ', ' ethanol ingestion ', ' ethanol drinking ', ' ethanol consumption ', ' alcoholic drink intake ', ' alcoholic beverage consumption ', ' alcohol use ', ' alcohol product use ', ' alcohol intake ', ' alcohol ingestion ', ' alcohol consumed ', ' EtOH drinking ', ' Alcohol Drinking ', ' Alcohol consumption ', ' Anxiety ', ' Attitude ', ' Client ', ' Clinical Skills ', ' Consultations ', ' cost effectiveness ', ' Counseling ', ' Counselor ', ' Professional counselor ', ' lesson plans ', ' Curriculum ', ' Educational Curriculum ', ' Dangerousness ', ' Data Collection ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' Information Disclosure ', ' Disclosure ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Discrimination ', ' Continuance of education ', ' Continuing Education ', ' Europe ', ' Fear ', ' Fright ', ' Feedback ', ' Group Meetings ', ' Health ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Health Personnel ', ' Health Services ', ' Health Surveys ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' Homosexuality ', ' Incidence ', ' Interview ', ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Methodology ', ' Morbidity -

"Engaging Young Adults in Their Mental Health Care Through a Brief Empirically-Based Meta-Intervention Project Summary  In response to RFA-MH-16-410, this R34 addresses key NIMH priorities, 1) focusing on health disparities, and 2) development and preliminary testing of an innovative services intervention. We propose to refine and test the efficacy of a brief meta-intervention for young adults when they begin treatment at adult mental health clinics (hence, treatment and meta-intervention run concurrently). The meta-intervention is designed to reduce treatment dropout, a documented problem of significant public health concern, by helping young adults put treatment into perspective, better understand the rationale and goals of care, and address barriers to continued treatment as they build attendance routines and relationships with providers.  To date, research has focused on `transition interventions,' namely programs within children's systems that serve transitioning youth into young adulthood, some of which have extended services into the early twenties. These programs create temporary additional support for youth while they are still in the children's systems. Our research suggests a complementary strategy that outreaches to youth who have formed tentative and initial engagement in services in the adult system, but who are at high risk of disengaging due to the failure of services to take into account the unique developmental needs and orientations of young adults.  Our team developed a mid-level theory to understand the underlying mechanisms of disengagement. The theory integrates theories of service use with theories of decision-making, and suggests a set of factors (individual and contextual) impact disengagement among young adults with serious mental illness. Our intervention uses novel communication strategies to maintain the attention of young adults and impact these factors and thus, overall engagement. We use narrative communication (e.g., strategic storytelling as a means of conveying health information) to keep young adults connected to care and, in turn, improve functioning. We use a recovery role model who is a person who has had similar difficulties that young adults have as they first engage the adult mental health system. S/he leads activities and is a key resource. Although the recovery role model is related to approaches of peer support, it is distinct from and appeals to different mechanisms.  One hundred ninety five young adults (3 groups, 65 per group) will be randomly assigned to either the intervention group, an active control group (curriculum on safe relationships), or the treatment as usual control group when they first enroll in services. Assessments are taken at baseline, 2-week posttest, 4-week follow-up and at a three month follow-up. The study aims are (1) to develop and preliminarily test the efficacy of a novel, 2-session engagement meta-intervention aimed at engagement and functioning outcomes for marginalized young adults with serious mental illness, and (2) to preliminarily identify the underlying mechanisms of change for disengagement in mental health care, i.e., mediators and moderators of intervention effectiveness. We will advance theory as well as strengthen the proposed intervention. Project Narrative The proposed R34 refines the protocols and examines the efficacy of an engagement intervention designed for (and with) low-income young adults, ages 18 to 28, who are largely racial and ethnic minorities. Research has shown that transitioning to young adulthood often includes the discontinuation of mental health care and/or premature termination of services. The proposed study examines a brief (2-session) meta-intervention designed to help young adults understand how mental health services can help them, and addresses barriers to service engagement (i.e., stigma, mistrust, hope), thus improving their engagement in services and their overall mental health and life outcomes, as well as advancing theory on the underlying mechanisms of mental health decision making.",Engaging Young Adults in Their Mental Health Care Through a Brief Empirically-Based Meta-Intervention,9228728,R34MH111861,"['adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' ages ', ' Age ', ' Anxiety ', ' Attention ', ' driving ', ' Automobile Driving ', ' Behavior ', ' psychological disorder ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Mental disorders ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' child well being ', ' adolescent welfare ', ' Child Welfare ', ' Client ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' Control Groups ', ' lesson plans ', ' Curriculum ', ' Educational Curriculum ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Decision Making ', ' Decision Theory ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Dropout ', ' Foundations ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' services research ', ' Medical Care Research ', ' Health Services Evaluation ', ' Health Services Research ', ' Institute of Medicine (U.S.) ', ' NAS/IOM ', ' Institute of Medicine ', ' Investments ', ' Medicaid ', ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health Services ', ' Mental Hygiene Services ', ' Mentors ', ' Moods ', ' Motivation ', ' Persons ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' NIMH ', ' New York ', ' Panic ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Running ', ' Schizophrenia ', ' schizophrenic ', ' dementia praecox ', ' Schizophrenic Disorders ', ' Social Work ', ' Social Service ', ' Stress ', ' Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders ', ' traumatic neurosis ', ' Posttraumatic Stress Disorders ', ' Posttraumatic Neuroses ', ' Post-Traumatic Neuroses ', ' PTSD ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Transportation ', ' violent behavior ', ' violent ', ' Violence ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Latino ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Youth ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' role model ', ' improved ', ' prematurity ', ' premature ', ' Randomized Clinical Trials ', ' Failure ', ' Individual ', ' Recovery ', ' young adulthood ', ' adult youth ', ' young adult ', ' Funding ', ' Letters ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Clinic ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' System ', ' Protocol Compliance ', ' Services ', ' preference ', ' rehabilitation service ', ' experience ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' outreach ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' Modeling ', ' communication theory ', ' response ', ' social stigma ', ' stigma ', ' theories ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Provider ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Low income ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' cognitive change ', ' Address ', ' Health system ', ' Symptoms ', ' Evidence based practice ', ' Qualitative Methods ', ' qualitative reasoning ', ' Adherence ', ' Effectiveness of Interventions ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' System for Public Use ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' active control ', ' health literacy ', ' care systems ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' improved functioning ', ' severe mental disorder ', ' serious mental illness ', ' serious mental disorder ', ' persistent mental illness ', ' chronic mental illness ', ' severe mental illness ', ' Outcome ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' Affective ', ' Evidence based intervention ', ' service intervention ', ' therapy design ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' high risk ', ' group intervention ', ' treatment as usual ', ' usual care ', ' efficacy testing ', ' adverse outcome ', ' adverse consequence ', ' behavioral outcome ', ' behavior outcome ', ' peer support ', ' racial minority ', ' ']",NIMH,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY,R34,2017,198125,0.07755633967507022
"Systematically Adapted Delivery of the Family Check-Up in Underserved Communities ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): When disruptive behavior problems manifest in very young children, the risk of later antisocial behaviors- including substance abuse, school failure, and criminality-escalates significantly. Evidence-based behavioral parent training (BPT) interventions have demonstrated efficacy and effectiveness in a range of settings in preventing the negative outcomes and costs associated with disruptive behavior problems. However, the public health impact of these interventions has yet to be realized, in part due to reliance on delivery by trained mental health professionals in clinic or community settings. Although implementation studies of BPT have been reported, these results lack generalizability because of their methodological idiosyncrasies in implementation. To maximize the public health benefits of BPT, systematic implementation studies are needed, particularly in underserved community settings. In Appalachia, a region recognized for its dramatic health disparities, at least one in five children exhibits sub-clinical to clinical levels of disruptive behavior problems. Risk factor for child disruptive behavior problems are pervasive; Appalachian residents suffer high poverty rates, low education levels, disproportionately high rates of substance abuse and mental health disorders, and persistent disparities in a wide range of health problems. A challenging combination of cultural barriers and poor access to mental health services hinders the usual delivery model for BPT in Appalachia (i.e., by trained mental health professionals). The vast majority of Appalachian counties are designated as mental health provider shortage areas, and cultural considerations (e.g., distrust of outsiders, the primacy of kinship networks, history of authoritarian parenting styles, strong self-reliance) may limit uptake of the few services available. The goal of this mixed-methods pilot study is to prepare for a future large-scale hybrid effectiveness-implementation trial of an evidence-based BPT intervention across rural Appalachian communities. Our preliminary data revealed community preferences for brief BPT delivery by local community health workers. Thus, to increase the accessibility and acceptability of BPT in this region, we will use the ADAPT-ITT framework to systematically adapt the delivery model for the Family Check-Up, a brief BPT intervention previously shown to be effective in reducing behavior problems and preventing negative outcomes when delivered by trained mental health professionals in clinic and community settings. Following the systematic adaptation of the Family Check-Up delivery model, we will pilot-test its implementation by community health workers in four high-need, under- resourced Appalachian communities to assess feasibility, acceptability, and costs. Our primary questions are whether we can effectively train community health workers in these communities to deliver the Family Check- Up with fidelity; whether we can enroll parents/caregivers and children to initiate and complete the intervention; and whether the battery of assessments and measures planned for the subsequent R01 effectiveness- implementation trial are feasible and appropriate for these community settings. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Early childhood disruptive behavior problems lead to significant costs to families and society, but can be reduced with behavioral parent training interventions. To increase the public health impact of these interventions, their feasibility, accessibility, and acceptability in high-need, underserved communities must be ensured. This pilot project will systematically adapt and pilot-test the delivery model of an existing effective parent training intervention for implementation in rural Appalachia, a region with many documented health disparities, high levels of poverty, and shortages of mental health providers.",Systematically Adapted Delivery of the Family Check-Up in Underserved Communities,9221363,R34MH106661,"['Aggression ', ' Aggressive behavior ', ' Appalachian ', ' Appalachia ', ' Appalachian Region ', ' authoritarian ', ' Authoritarianism ', ' psychological disorder ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Mental disorders ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Child Behavior ', ' childrearing ', ' Parenting behavior ', ' Parenting ', ' Child Rearing ', ' Communities ', ' community health worker ', ' Community Health Aides ', ' disruptive behavioral disorder ', ' Disruptive Behavior Disorder ', ' Exhibits ', ' Family ', ' Feedback ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Health Personnel ', ' treatment access ', ' health services availability ', ' health service access ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' accessibility to health services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Access to Care ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' services research ', ' Medical Care Research ', ' Health Services Evaluation ', ' Health Services Research ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' Hybrids ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Longevity ', ' lifespan ', ' life span ', ' Length of Life ', ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health Services ', ' Mental Hygiene Services ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' NIMH ', ' Parents ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Poverty ', ' Public Health ', ' Research Support ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Schools ', ' Nursery Schools ', ' preschool ', ' pre-kindergarten ', ' pre-k ', ' Societies ', ' medical specialties ', ' Specialty ', ' Standardization ', ' Testing ', ' Training Programs ', ' Work ', ' County ', ' Measures ', ' Care Givers ', ' Caregivers ', ' Health Benefit ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Caring ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Nexus Junction ', ' Nexus ', ' Low-resistance Junction ', ' Communicating Junction ', ' Gap Junctions ', ' Ensure ', ' Training ', ' Failure ', ' Individual ', ' Rural ', ' Kinship Networks ', ' uptake ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' behavioral problem ', ' Problem behavior ', ' instructional intervention ', ' Training Intervention ', ' Instruction Intervention ', ' Education for Intervention ', ' Educational Intervention ', ' Educational Background ', ' Education Level ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' Clinic ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' Location ', ' Services ', ' preference ', ' Church ', ' experience ', ' checkup examination ', ' checkup ', ' Check-up ', ' early childhood ', ' self reliance ', ' Modality ', ' Reporting ', ' Substance abuse problem ', ' substance abuse ', ' abuse of substances ', ' Modeling ', ' social stigma ', ' stigma ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Effectiveness ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Address ', ' Child Mental Health ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' Healthcare professional ', ' Health Care Professional ', ' Health Professional ', ' implementation trial ', ' cost ', ' Behavioral Model ', ' implementation research ', ' underserved people ', ' under served population ', ' Underserved Population ', ' Outcome ', ' Prevalence ', ' aged ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' Resistance ', ' resistant ', ' Evidence based intervention ', ' implementation science ', ' public health relevance ', ' community setting ', ' evidence base ', ' mental training ', ' Behavioral trial ', ' behavioral study ', ' behavior study ', ' antisocial behavior ', ' anti-social behavior ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF KENTUCKY,R34,2017,221205,0.06877741493259552
"Racial disparities in pediatric psychiatric emergencies: A Health systems approach Project Summary (30 lines) Less than half of the nine million children in the U.S. with a severe mental disorder ultimately receive care. This under-treatment occurs more among African American than among white children. Alarmingly, when they do receive psychiatric care, African American children appear in the emergency department (ED) 11% more than do whites. This relative reliance on the ED is not justified based on racial differences in mental health prevalence or need, and (for African Americans) portends poorly managed symptoms and increased disease severity into adulthood. Despite this racial disparity in children's psychiatric ED visits, no research examines whether “supply side” expansions over time in mental health services reduces this disparity. Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs) represent one dynamic aspect of the health system that focus on low-income populations. Psychiatric encounters for African American children seen in FQHCs, moreover, increased by over 31% from 2006-2011. This rapid expansion of care, as well as changes in the supply of mental health professionals, may reduce African American children's reliance on the ED. This issue requires further study given that previous expansions of primary care for low-income populations (e.g., Medicaid in Massachusetts and Oregon) show mixed results—especially in failing to reduce disparities. It is plausible but it remains unknown whether increasing FQHCs can treat previously untreated mentally ill African American children. Our project will merge data on FQHCs, county mental health professionals and all children's psychiatric ED visits (including mood, behavioral disorders, suicide attempts) for ten populous states that report all-payer ED data. We will retrieve county-level data (e.g., minority children served in FQHCs, mental health providers) from the Uniform Data System and other proprietary sources. Data on children's psychiatric ED visits will come from the Health Care Utilization Project. The large dataset (~1.4 million visits) collected across 437 counties and six years (2006-2011) provides substantial place and time variation in FQHC penetration. Importantly, we will also link multiple ED records within child to examine whether patterns of psychiatric ED care (i.e., repeat “treat and release”) decline following expansions in FQHC and mental health providers. Our rigorous identification strategy will control for state and county-level factors (e.g., Medicaid expansion, Mental Health Parity and Addition Equity Act) that affect help seeking. Results, consistent with goals of NIMH, are expected to advance the knowledge base on how features of FQHCs and the health system affect the delivery of psychiatric services to minorities. Our analyses, moreover, will directly inform health policy given that federal allocation of resources to combat disparities crucially depends on group-level results. Even a precisely estimated null result would amplify calls to focus financing and research on “demand-side” factors for African-Americans' help-seeking and efforts to coordinate referrals and follow-up care in low-income settings. Project Narrative (Relevance to Public Health 3 sentences) The proposed work directly tests whether expansions in community health centers and mental health provider supply reduces African American children's disproportionate use of the ED for psychiatric care. Our project may ultimately assist in targeting health policy interventions at the systems level to reduce ED overcrowding by augmenting primary care options. In addition, results will hold direct policy implications in determining the extent to which the $11 billion in annual investments in federally qualified health centers, from a disparities reduction perspective, is justified.",Racial disparities in pediatric psychiatric emergencies: A Health systems approach,9317203,R21MH110815,"['adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Affect ', ' ages ', ' Age ', ' behavioral disorder ', ' Behavior Disorders ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Communities ', ' Satellite Centers ', ' Community Health Centers ', ' Disease Frequency Surveys ', ' Cross-Sectional Survey ', ' Cross-Sectional Analyses ', ' Cross Sectional Analysis ', ' Cross-Sectional Studies ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Emergencies ', ' Emergency Situation ', ' Goals ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Health Personnel ', ' healthcare policy ', ' health care policy ', ' Health Policy ', ' Health Resources ', ' Health Services ', ' Level of Health ', ' Health Status ', ' Information Systems ', ' Information Technology Systems ', ' IT Systems ', ' Data Systems ', ' Inpatients ', ' Institutes ', ' Investments ', ' Literature ', ' Low Income Population ', ' Massachusetts ', ' Medicaid ', ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health Services ', ' Mental Hygiene Services ', ' Mentally Ill Persons ', ' Mentally Ill ', ' Mental Patients ', ' Moods ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' NIMH ', ' Oregon ', ' Outpatients ', ' Out-patients ', ' parity ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Primary Care ', ' Public Health ', ' Records ', ' Recurrence ', ' Recurrent ', ' Research ', ' Suicide attempt ', ' suicidal attempt ', ' non fatal attempt ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' County ', ' United States Agency for Health Care Policy and Research ', ' Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality ', ' Agency for Health Care Policy and Research ', ' AHRQ ', ' AHCPR ', ' United States Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality ', ' falls ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Resource Allocation ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Youth ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' psychiatric treatment ', ' psychiatric therapy ', ' psychiatric care ', ' Psychiatric therapeutic procedure ', ' Area ', ' Penetration ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Link ', ' white American ', ' caucasian American ', ' mental ', ' Psyche structure ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' healthcare utilization ', ' healthcare service utilization ', ' healthcare service use ', ' health care service use ', ' Health Care Utilization ', ' health care service utilization ', ' data repository ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Databases ', ' Policies ', ' Funding ', ' Community Outreach ', ' programs ', ' Side ', ' Source ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' Severity of illness ', ' disease severity ', ' Visit ', ' Services ', ' Accident and Emergency department ', ' Emergency room ', ' Emergency Department ', ' Surgeon ', ' American ', ' care seeking ', ' knowledge base ', ' knowledgebase ', ' Structure ', ' recidivism ', ' racial difference ', ' race differences ', ' help-seeking behavior ', ' help seeking ', ' Reporting ', ' Admission activity ', ' Admission ', ' behavioral health ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Provider ', ' Low income ', ' Address ', ' Health system ', ' Child Mental Health ', ' Data ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' Characteristics ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' Emergency medical care ', ' Emergency healthcare ', ' Emergency health care ', ' Emergency Room care ', ' Emergency Department care ', ' ER care ', ' ED care ', ' Emergency Care ', ' manage symptom ', ' symptom management ', ' Federally Qualified Health Center ', ' Healthcare professional ', ' Health Care Professional ', ' Health Professional ', ' cost ', ' neglect ', ' Minority ', ' severe mental disorder ', ' serious mental illness ', ' serious mental disorder ', ' persistent mental illness ', ' chronic mental illness ', ' severe mental illness ', ' Prevalence ', ' safety net ', ' combat ', ' policy implication ', ' longitudinal analysis ', ' Emergency department visit ', ' Emergency room visit ', ' Emergency care visit ', ' ER visit ', ' ED visit ', ' racial disparity ', ' race disparity ', ' disparities in race ', ' minority children ', ' disparity reduction ', ' reduce disparity ', ' Affordable Care Act ', ' Obamacare ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA-IRVINE,R21,2017,274013,0.0637159089278417
"Organizational Capacity to Eliminate Outcome Disparities under Healthcare Reform Project Summary/Abstract The substance abuse treatment field faces an unprecedented challenge to reduce health disparities among racial and ethnic minority populations. Access to integrated substance abuse, mental health, and HIV prevention care is associated with positive health outcomes and reduced cost. The overall goal of the proposed study is to identify how changes precipitated by the Affordable Care Act (ACA) impact community- based outpatient substance abuse treatment (OSAT) program capacity to expand service delivery in racial and ethnic minority communities and eliminate outcome disparities among African American and Latino clients. The objective for this application is to examine the organizational impact of the current expansion of Medicaid on the capacity of community-based OSAT programs to enhance treatment access and retention among minorities residing in Los Angeles County (L.A.), California by developing and analyzing a panel dataset. Our conceptual framework, grounded in organizational development frameworks investigates the role of organizational capacity (i.e., leadership, readiness for change, Medi-Cal billing) in mediating the effect of Medicaid expansion (referred as Medi-Cal in California) on service delivery (i.e., mental health and HIV prevention services) and on treatment access and retention among African American and Latino clients. In Aim 1 and 2 we will examine baseline data to refine our conceptual model of organizational capacity factors likely to impact the delivery of mental health and HIV prevention services in OSAT programs in racial and ethnic minority communities, prior to ACA enactment. We will resurvey in 2013, 2015 and 2017 the same representative sample of 147 OSAT programs located in minority communities to form a panel data set. These repeated measures of program data will be concatenated with administrative client outcome data (N~10,800 clients) at each data point to examine in Aims 3 and 4 the longitudinal impact of insurance expansion on service delivery in minority communities and rates of access and retention among African American and Latino clients with mental health and HIV risk conditions. The overall public health impact of the proposed study includes identifying promising organizational factors among publicly funded community-based OSAT programs that serve large proportions of low-income minority clients that play a mediating role between the ACA insurance expansion and client-centered process outcomes with the goal of eliminating health disparities. Project Narrative This study will identify how changes precipitated by the Affordable Care Act impact community-based outpatient substance abuse treatment program capacity to expand accessibility to mental health and HIV prevention care in racial and ethnic minority communities in Los Angeles County, California. As such, the public health relevance of this project relies on providing critical information for state insurance administrators, policy makers and community-based providers who seek to develop evidence-informed policies and practices to respond to health care reform and parity legislation and eliminate health disparities.",Organizational Capacity to Eliminate Outcome Disparities under Healthcare Reform,9256457,R33DA035634,"['California ', ' Client ', ' Communities ', ' Economics ', ' Elements ', ' Protocol Screening ', ' Eligibility ', ' Eligibility Determination ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' treatment access ', ' health services availability ', ' health service access ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' accessibility to health services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Access to Care ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' Incentives ', ' Insurance ', ' Leadership ', ' Statutes and Laws ', ' Legislation ', ' Los Angeles ', ' Medicaid ', ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Outpatients ', ' Out-patients ', ' parity ', ' Play ', ' Public Health ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Research ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Testing ', ' County ', ' Measures ', ' Administrator ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' Latino ', ' Mediating ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' HIV/AIDS prevention ', ' HIV Prevention ', ' AIDS/HIV prevention ', ' AIDS prevention ', ' Caring ', ' Organizational Models ', ' base ', ' Phase ', ' Medical ', ' Healthcare Reform ', ' Health Care Reform ', ' Policy Maker ', ' Policies ', ' Funding ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Nature ', ' programs ', ' System ', ' Services ', ' Performance ', ' prevention service ', ' treatment program ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' Substance abuse problem ', ' substance abuse ', ' abuse of substances ', ' HIV risk ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Quality of Care ', ' QOC ', ' response ', ' theories ', ' Provider ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Readiness ', ' Preparedness ', ' Low income ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Improve Access ', ' Subgroup ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' substance abuse therapy ', ' substance abuse treatment ', ' cost ', ' care systems ', ' treatment organization ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' addiction ', ' addictive disorder ', ' public health relevance ', ' evidence base ', ' underserved minority ', ' racial minority ', ' Affordable Care Act ', ' Obamacare ', ' minority communities ', ' ']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,R33,2017,471131,-0.010166100835864327
"Effect of Local Health Departments on Health Care Disparities for Individuals with Mental Health Disorders ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): African Americans and Latinos have less mental health care access and face substantial stigmatization in seeking and receiving treatment for mental health disorders (MHDs), compared to Whites. Untreated MHDs are associated with high mortality rates, increased risks of developing major chronic diseases, including heart disease and diabetes, and accelerating disease progression. Evidence demonstrates the cost effectiveness of improving health care for patients with coexisting MHDs and other diseases through the integration of individual and organizational factors, yet there remains a gap in our knowledge about how to best accomplish the integration of Local Health Departments (LHDs) with the communities they serve. The objective of this study is to identify effective LHD activitie that reduce racial and ethnic disparities in health care for individuals with MHDs, including those with MHDs and coexisting chronic diseases. Our central hypothesis is that LHDs' service provision and health promotion can reduce disparities. Our hypothesis is informed by an ecological model demonstrating that LHDs can reduce health care disparities for individuals with MHDs by providing critical health care resources to people with limited health care access and promoting health education and patient engagement that reflect community health needs. Since LHDs assume more responsibilities in underserved areas and provide a major source of health care for vulnerable populations, racial and ethnic minority patients with MHDs may gain more benefit from LHD activities. Specifically, we will assess the effect of LHD activities on health care for individuals with MHDs (Aim 1), and the effect of LHD activities on racial and ethnic disparities (African American vs. White; Latino vs. White) in mental health care (Aim 2). Given that MHDs are common comorbidities of major chronic diseases, we will assess the effect of LHD activities on racial and ethnic disparities in general health care for individuals with coexisting MHDs and other chronic diseases, such as diabetes and heart disease (Aim 3). We will assemble a unique multi-level (individual-, LHDs-, county-, and state-) data set for the years 2004-2014, and employ multi-level/hierarchical estimation, difference-in-differences analysis, and decomposition technique to quantify the contribution of LHDs' activities to the reduction of racial and ethnic disparities in health care for individuals with MHDs. Results of this exploratory study will generate substantial amounts of new evidence and insights about how to utilize LHDs' resources to integrate the care for individuals with MHDs, and to what extent the resources of LHDs can be used, or should be expanded, to improve mental health. Results of this study will provide preliminary data needed to build a more comprehensive and robust investigation to estimate the impact of LHDs on racial and ethnic disparities in health outcomes, and develop a scientifically sound and culturally tailored LHD-integrated health care model that will improve the efficiency of the health care delivery system and potentially accelerate sustainable efforts to reduce and ultimately eliminate health disparities for individuals with MHDs. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This study will provide critical evidence on how to utilize Local Health Department (LHD) resources to integrate and coordinate care for individuals with Mental Health Disorders (MHDs), and help us understand to what extent the resources of LHDs can be used, or should be expanded, to improve mental health and reduce disparities. Results of our exploratory study will provide preliminary data needed to build a more comprehensive and robust investigation to estimate the dynamic impact of LHDs on racial and ethnic disparities in health outcomes, and develop a scientifically sound and culturally tailored LHD-integrated health care model that will improve the efficiency of the health care delivery system and potentially accelerate sustainable efforts to reduce and ultimately eliminate health disparities fo individuals with MHDs.

"Exploring Pathways Among Discrimination and Health Among Somali Young Adults PROJECT SUMMARY Immigrant groups in the United States have long experienced challenges to community inclusion and participation such as experiences of discrimination and victimization. Today, however, we are experiencing unprecedented levels of such experiences. For Somali young adults, who are black, Muslim immigrants, these experiences may be linked to their race, religion or migration status. This has been compounded by historical and recent events linked to aspects of Somali identity and culture creating a socio-historical moment in which young Somalis face an unprecedented threat of discrimination and mistreatment. While there is growing evidence on the adverse effect of discrimination on health, less is known about the experiences of immigrant groups and the ways in which discrimination and experiences of racism across multiple sectors of public life relate to mental health and well-being; what factors mediate these relationships; and how immigrants themselves understand and make meaning of these experiences as well as their relationships to their mental health and well-being. This mixed-methods, community partnered, proposal builds on a decade-long Community Based Participatory Research program led by Dr. Ellis, and partnered with Dr. Lincoln and Ms. Abdi, a team of inter-disciplinary researchers, and leaders from Somali communities. Through this community- research partnership our team has developed unprecedented datasets: to our knowledge, we have the largest longitudinal empirical database of psychosocial factors and Somali youth in the world. The broad goal of this project is to expand our knowledge of the relationships among experiences of discrimination and health outcomes for young Somali adults and thus contribute to a research trajectory aimed at developing strategies and interventions to disrupt these associations and mitigate disparities in mental health and health outcomes experienced by immigrant young adults. This will be accomplished through three specific aims which first test a theoretical model of the associations between multiple co-occurring experiences of discrimination (i.e. daily discrimination, life events discrimination, discrimination by teachers, and negative interaction with police) and mental health (symptoms of PTSD, anxiety and depression, and substance use) in Wave 1 of our existing data set. Next we propose to test whether the theoretical model explaining the associations between co-occurring forms of discrimination, social marginalization and mental health developed in Aim 1explains symptoms of mental illness over time using multiple waves of data. Finally, we propose to conduct additional qualitative interviews in three U.S. cities to explore Somali young adults’ understanding of the health issues of concern to them and their communities, the ways they make meaning of experiences of discrimination and racism and how these relate to their health and well-being. Project Narrative Somali young adults in the United States face the triple challenge of discrimination and marginalization associated with race, religion and immigration status. We propose to build upon a long-standing CBPR partnership and our ongoing Somali Youth Risk and Resilience Study (SYRSS) to expand our inquiry to examine experiences of discrimination, risk and resilience factors, and their relationship to mental health outcomes. Results of this study will inform a line of research aimed at preventing negative health consequences associated with discrimination and reducing disparities in health and mental health outcomes experienced by Somali young adults.",Exploring Pathways Among Discrimination and Health Among Somali Young Adults,9444639,R21MD012405,"['adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Anxiety ', ' psychological disorder ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Cities ', ' Communities ', ' Data Collection ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Discrimination ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Level of Health ', ' Health Status ', ' Immigration ', ' Institutes ', ' Interview ', ' Justice ', ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Methods ', ' Theoretical model ', ' Theoretic Models ', ' Muslim population group ', ' Muslim ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Psychosocial Factor ', ' psychosocial variables ', ' Public Sector ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Religion ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Support ', ' Risk ', ' Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders ', ' traumatic neurosis ', ' Posttraumatic Stress Disorders ', ' Posttraumatic Neuroses ', ' Post-Traumatic Neuroses ', ' PTSD ', ' Testing ', ' United States ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', ' Police ', ' depressive ', ' depression symptom ', ' Emotional Depression ', ' depressive symptoms ', ' Mediating ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Youth ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Series ', ' racism ', ' Link ', ' teacher ', ' using substances ', ' substance using ', ' substance use ', ' AOD use ', ' Alcohol or Other Drugs use ', ' Individual ', ' young adulthood ', ' adult youth ', ' young adult ', ' data repository ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Databases ', ' Funding ', ' Immigrant ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Victimization ', ' Well in self ', ' self wellness ', ' psychological wellness ', ' mental wellbeing ', ' mental well-being ', ' Sense of well-being ', ' Psychological Well Being ', ' Normal psyche ', ' Normal mental state ', ' Normal mental condition ', ' Feels well ', ' Emotional well being ', ' Event ', ' experience ', ' gang ', ' Religion and Spirituality ', ' religious ', ' research study ', ' social ', ' Modeling ', ' Adverse effects ', ' treatment adverse effect ', ' therapy adverse effect ', ' side effect ', ' Treatment Side Effects ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Department of Defense ', ' Collection ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' time use ', ' Minority ', ' mistreatment ', ' maltreatment ', ' resilience ', ' Outcome ', ' migration ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' community based participatory research ', ' participatory action research ', ' community based research ', ' community based design ', ' anxiety symptoms ', ' anxious symptom ', ' social exclusion ', ' marginalization ', ' community partnership ', ' disparity reduction ', ' reduce disparity ', ' ']",NIMHD,NORTHEASTERN UNIVERSITY,R21,2017,260588,0.04888836519027568
"Amigas Latinas Motivando el Alma (ALMA): A Randomized Control Trial of an Intervention to Reduce Mental Health Disparities in Mexican Immigrant Women Project Summary Recent studies indicate that 30% of Latina women in the United States are living with clinically significant depressive and anxiety symptoms, and that these rates increase with time spent in the United States. Latina immigrants are particularly vulnerable to depression and anxiety due to the many social and economic stressors they face, including: high levels of poverty, low levels of education, family obligations, language barriers, and social isolation. Latina immigrants suffering from depression and anxiety are also less likely to access and utilize quality mental health care, due to lack of health insurance, few culturally and linguistically competent providers, and stigma associated with seeking mental health care. Community-based interventions that increase coping strategies and provide social support can help reduce mental health disparities among Mexican immigrant women. The proposed study aims to address National Institute of Health priorities by testing the efficacy of the Amigas Latinas Motivando el Alma (ALMA) intervention in a randomized waitlist control trial. ALMA is an 8-week program offered in a group format to teach women new coping strategies and enhance their social ties and social support to prevent and reduce their depression and anxiety. Aim 1 of the proposed study is to refine the ALMA intervention and study procedures to ensure they are culturally-relevant, using information gained from focus groups and cognitive interviews with Mexican immigrant women. Aim 2 is to determine the efficacy of the ALMA intervention to reduce depressive and anxiety symptoms using a randomized waitlist control study design. We will recruit women from community-based organizations serving Latino immigrants to participate in the program, which will be offered in community settings. We will assess process outcomes of recruitment, retention, fidelity, and participant satisfaction through observations and in- depth interviews with participants. We will assess the efficacy of the intervention by comparing changes in women’s depressive and anxiety symptoms in the intervention and waitlist control groups at four time points (pre-intervention, post-intervention, 3 months, 6 months). Aim 3 is to assess the potential impact of the intervention on both individual (stigma, stress, coping strategies) and interpersonal (social support, social ties) factors, and whether the impact of the intervention is mediated by these factors. The research team includes investigators in psychology, medicine, social work and public health, as well as community-based organizations serving Mexican immigrants. The study uses rigorous methods to test an innovative program that integrates both culturally relevant and evidenced-based strategies to address significant mental health disparities in a high-risk and underserved population. Findings will help inform future research and practice.

"Predictors of Achievement from Early Childhood to Adulthood ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project will significantly contribute to the growing body of research on physical attractiveness as a source of social stratification that has wide implications for health, akin to more frequently studied factors like race and gender. Health is an integral component of the approach to this project-as a dimension of physical attractiveness (e.g., weight), as a mechanism by which physical attractiveness has effects on social and academic achievement (e.g., mental health), and because the adult socioeconomic attainment that is expected to reflect histories of physical attractiveness is a fundamental component of lifelong health and health disparities. This project also will provide a practical service to the feld by expanding a public use data set so that it can be used to study the role of attractiveness in a wide variety of outcomes, including health behaviors and health disparities. Specifically, the project will create the most comprehensive longitudinal data ever amassed of physical attractiveness from infancy through adolescence by re-coding videotapes that were already gathered at nearly a dozen time points in the NICHD Study of Early Child Care and Youth Development. It will describe trajectories of beauty in this cohort and test important hypotheses derived from an integrative theoretical model put forward in a new book by the investigators. Based on status characteristics and life course theory as well as developmental systems and stigma perspectives, beauty's association with higher achievement is expected to operate through mental health mechanisms, including positive mood, perceived competence, and self esteem. These mental health resources are expected to counteract some of the ways being good looking could distract from schooling (i.e., physical assets might accentuate desires to climb the social ladder as young people move into and through adolescence and its associated peer contexts). Differences in the strength of associations by social location (gender, race/ethnicity, SES), by developmental period (early childhood, elementary, junior, and high school), and by ecological contexts (schools) will also be examined. The results of this project, and the new source of public use data created through the project, will stimulate future developmental, social psychological, and public health research on physical attractiveness as a stratifying force. These results will be written up for academic journal articles and also widely disseminated, which is important given the public, media and policy interest in the topic.

"UCLA-South Africa Center for Chronic Mental Disorders DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Fogarty International Center has recognized the need for collaborative research training programs between the U.S. and institutions in low and middle income countries that focus on chronic non-communicable diseases (NCD). In response to PAR 10-257, NCD Lifespan Award and the South African Governmental Report, Revitalizing Clinical Research, which calls for the training of master's-level students to improve their capacit to conduct addiction mental health research and provide additional clinical services, we propose to develop the Tirisano Training Project, or TTP (Tirisano means ""working together"" in Tswana). A collaborative training program between UCLA and several South African Universities and Institutions including faculty from the University of Cape Town (UCT), the University of Stellenbosch, the Human Sciences Research Council, and North West University will increase the clinical and research skills of South African post-bachelor, master's and doctoral-level students and early career mental health professionals. Expanding upon the infrastructure and lessons learned from our Fogarty-funded Phodiso trauma and health disparities research training program for South Africa scholars, TTP focuses on chronic stress and non-communicable chronic mental health disorders including substance abuse, depression, and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) across the life course. TTP addresses the dearth of South African researchers by targeting the ""pipeline"" challenge and training scholars at diverse points of the academic career path. Guided by a multi-dimensional conceptual model of risks and resilience resources over the lifespan, trainees will be provided the tools to develop and test novel models and methods to implement effective substance abuse and mental health interventions within the South African context. The Specific Aims are to: 1) Implement a short-, medium-, and long-term multidisciplinary training program at UCLA and in South Africa for master's and doctoral-level students and early career mental health professionals drawn from clinical staff working in nursing, social work, psychiatry and public health to enhance their knowledge and skills in the areas of chronic stress and non-communicable chronic mental health disorders (Track A Scholars; cumulative n=16); 2) Implement a short-term multidisciplinary training program in South Africa for post-bachelor, master's and doctoral-level students in nursing, social work, and public health to enhance their knowledge and skills in the area of chronic stress and non-communicable chronic mental health disorders (Track B Scholars; cumulative n=100); 3) Evaluate the TTP processes, including the mentoring, research skills, and career support provided, as well as the career trajectories and accomplishments of the Track A Scholars over 10 years; and 4) Assess the sustainability and integration of TTP into academic, private, and government agencies that provide substance abuse and mental health research and services. Future goals will include encouraging the South African government to support, endorse, and adopt TTP as a successful and replicable model of cross-cultural clinical research training. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The UCLA-South Africa Tirisano Training Project (TTP) seeks five years of funding to prepare future investigators to conduct research on chronic stress and non-communicable chronic mental health disorders including substance abuse, depression, and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) across the life course. As an international collaboration between UCLA and several South African Universities and Institutions, including the University of Cape Town (UCT), the University of Stellenbosch, the Human Sciences Research Council and North West University, Tirisano's public health mission is to: 1) Increase the number of well-trained South African chronic stress and non-communicable chronic mental health researchers; 2) Translate research findings to culturally congruent substance abuse and mental health treatment interventions and programs; and 3) Facilitate the building of community clinical and research capacity and infrastructure that benefit South African people.",UCLA-South Africa Center for Chronic Mental Disorders,9233786,D43MH108170,"['Award ', ' psychological disorder ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Mental disorders ', ' career track ', ' career pathway ', ' career interest ', ' career aspiration ', ' Career Path ', ' Career Choice ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Research ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' Faculty ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Government ', ' Government Agencies ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Life Cycle Stages ', ' life course ', ' Life Cycle ', ' Longevity ', ' lifespan ', ' life span ', ' Length of Life ', ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' Nurses ', ' Discipline of Nursing ', ' Nursing Profession ', ' Nursing Field ', ' Nursing ', ' Privatization ', ' Psychiatry ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Science ', ' Social Work ', ' Social Service ', ' South Africa ', ' Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders ', ' traumatic neurosis ', ' Posttraumatic Stress Disorders ', ' Posttraumatic Neuroses ', ' Post-Traumatic Neuroses ', ' PTSD ', ' Students ', ' Testing ', ' Training Programs ', ' Universities ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Training ', ' Funding ', ' tool ', ' Knowledge ', ' Adopted ', ' Services ', ' international center ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' Reporting ', ' Substance abuse problem ', ' substance abuse ', ' abuse of substances ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Institution ', ' training project ', ' Address ', ' Chronic stress ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Research Training ', ' Process ', ' Clinical Services ', ' Healthcare professional ', ' Health Care Professional ', ' Health Professional ', ' resilience ', ' Trauma ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' addiction ', ' addictive disorder ', ' low and middle-income countries ', ' LMIC ', ' South African ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,D43,2017,269120,0.02588447557425704
"A trauma informed intervention to improve mental health and school success for urban eighth graders ABSTRACT. Approximately half of all 14-17 years olds in the U.S. are estimated to be victims of physical assault; chronic stress and trauma exposure are particularly prevalent for youth growing up in high-crime urban communities. Emotion regulation difficulties due to stress and trauma exposure contribute to disparities in mental health problems and school failure, with low-income and African American youth at much higher risk than their higher-income, White counterparts. Schools serving high-crime communities, however, do not offer universal trauma-informed strategies to support student success. RAP Club is a school-based group prevention program aimed at improving emotion regulation and decision-making in urban upper middle school students to improve their transition to high school. The program fills key gaps in current school practices, including a trauma-informed approach, universal delivery to all students without pre-screening, transdiagnostic effects on internalizing problems as well as behavioral issues, and a focus on upper middle school students. Our team adapted RAP Club from Structured Psychotherapy for Adolescents Responding to Chronic Stress (SPARCS), a group treatment for adolescents based on empirically supported mindfulness and cognitive- behavioral techniques. Using a novel delivery method, RAP Club is co-facilitated by school mental health personnel and young adult community members to promote student engagement. In our NIMH-funded pilot research, the program improved classroom behavior, social functioning, and academic competence. The program improved outcomes for students at varying levels of baseline distress—even low levels—suggesting its appropriateness as a universal model. Building on that work, the proposed R01 trial will test whether urban eighth grade students randomly assigned to RAP Club show improved emotional, behavioral, and academic outcomes in eighth and ninth grades compared to those assigned to Healthy Topics, a health education control group. Intervention and control programs will each be delivered by different school personnel with co- facilitation by young adult community members. The research will be conducted in 32 Baltimore City Public Schools serving urban communities with high rates of violence exposure. We will collect teacher- and student- reported data on student self-regulation, emotional functioning, classroom behavior, and academic performance at pre- and post-intervention and 4-month follow up, as well as student data at 12-month follow up. We will gather school record data on academic indicators in the year before, year of, and year following study participation. We will evaluate factors relevant to program implementation and potential sustainability, including stakeholder perspectives and cost data. The RAP Club model of trauma-informed, universal support has potential for widespread dissemination in school districts serving disadvantaged youth nationwide. The proposed randomized controlled trial will evaluate the effects of RAP Club, an evidence-based trauma-informed intervention, on eighth graders in an urban school district characterized by high rates of violence and trauma exposure. Schools serving youth in trauma-affected communities currently lack universal, trauma-informed approaches for promoting mental health and school success in upper middle school students prior to high school entry. RAP Club has potential to reduce risk for emotional, behavioral, and academic problems in our most vulnerable young people across the nation, with significant implications for reducing disparities in achievement and health.",A trauma informed intervention to improve mental health and school success for urban eighth graders,9216026,R01HD090022,"['Achievement Attainment ', ' Achievement ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' Adolescence ', ' Affect ', ' ages ', ' Age ', ' assault ', ' Baltimore ', ' Behavior ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Biometrics ', ' Biometry ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Cities ', ' Communities ', ' Control Groups ', ' cost assessment ', ' assess cost ', ' Cost Analyses ', ' Cost Analysis ', ' Counselor ', ' Professional counselor ', ' Crime ', ' data representation ', ' Data Reporting ', ' Decision Making ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Family ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health Tutoring ', ' Health Instruction ', ' Health education ', ' Income ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Methods ', ' Mission ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' NIMH ', ' Occupations ', ' Professional Positions ', ' Jobs ', ' Perception ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Poverty ', ' Psychologist ', ' Psychotherapy ', ' Public Health ', ' Records ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' recruit ', ' active recruitment ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Schools ', ' Informal Social Control ', ' Self Regulation ', ' Social Workers ', ' medical specialties ', ' Specialty ', ' Standardization ', ' Stress ', ' Students ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Testing ', ' unemployed ', ' out of work ', ' joblessness ', ' jobless ', ' Unemployment ', ' violent behavior ', ' violent ', ' Violence ', ' Work ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' Competence ', ' depressive ', ' depression symptom ', ' Emotional Depression ', ' depressive symptoms ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Youth ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Adolescent ', ' Link ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' teacher ', ' Failure ', ' Distress ', ' Trust ', ' young adulthood ', ' adult youth ', ' young adult ', ' Funding ', ' behavioral problem ', ' Problem behavior ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' Shapes ', ' Nature ', ' programs ', ' Event ', ' Techniques ', ' inner city ', ' Services ', ' mental health personnel ', ' Performance ', ' success ', ' high school ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Prevention program ', ' member ', ' seventh grade ', ' 7th grade ', ' eighth grade ', ' 8th grade ', ' ninth grade ', ' high school freshman ', ' 9th grade ', ' Human Resources ', ' personnel ', ' Manpower ', ' Academic achievement ', ' physical assault ', ' physical attack ', ' positive youth development ', ' Emotional ', ' Modeling ', ' Adolescent Development ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Low income ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Address ', ' Child Mental Health ', ' Symptoms ', ' Chronic stress ', ' Data ', ' National Institute of Child Health and Human Development ', ' NICHD ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Cognitive ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' Behavioral ', ' active control ', ' post intervention ', ' cost ', ' Social Functioning ', ' Outcome ', ' scale up ', ' Child Traumatic Stress ', ' childhood traumatic stress ', ' aged ', ' Trauma ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' 17 year old ', ' seventeen years of age ', ' seventeen year old ', ' age 17 years ', ' 17 years of age ', ' implementation science ', ' emotion regulation ', ' emotional regulation ', ' high risk ', ' evidence base ', ' group intervention ', ' mindfulness ', ' screening ', ' Middle School Student ', ' Junior High Student ', ' Junior High School Student ', ' Prevention trial ', ' anxiety symptoms ', ' anxious symptom ', ' behavioral outcome ', ' behavior outcome ', ' student participation ', ' student motivation ', ' student engagement ', ' school district ', ' treatment group ', ' improved outcome ', ' neighborhood disadvantage ', ' disparity reduction ', ' reduce disparity ', ' trauma symptom ', ' urban school ', ' urban underserved ', ' ']",NICHD,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R01,2017,609338,0.022334204304437208
"Emerging Regulatory Capacity in Low-income Mexican American Children DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The identification of early life precursors to psychopathology in a high risk population has considerable promise for efforts to mitigate the public health burden of mental disorders. Hispanic children, members of the fastest growing ethnic group in the US, are more than twice as likely as non-Hispanic white children to be raised in poverty, and considerable research documents deleterious effects of poverty and ethnic minority status on brain development, stress physiology, development of social and emotional regulatory capacity, and lifespan mental and physical health. To better understand developmental precursors to psychopathology in very low- income ethnic minority children, we propose to capitalize on data collected by an NIMH-funded longitudinal study of Mexican American mothers and infants (""Las Madres Nuevas"") that addressed maternal mental health and mother-infant coregulation across the first two postpartum years. The proposed project will focus on the children from Las Madres Nuevas as they approach a critical developmental transition period (ages 3-6). We will chart trajectories of cognitive, emotional, social, and behavioral competence, with the goal of early identification and predication of points at which elevated risk for disorder emerges. Our project will focus on the emergence of self-regulatory skills from early life mother-infant coregulation as a central mechanism by which early life risk factors translate into lifespan health outcomes for low-income children. The development of self- regulatory ability is a critical foundation for lifespan mental health, but Hispanic children and children from disadvantaged environments are at risk of impaired self-regulatory skills as they enter kindergarten. Our scientific approach emphasizes the cultural embeddedness of development, with the view that child outcomes must be examined with attention to cultural forces that shape and give meaning to self-regulation and mental health. We also address the role of early life biological susceptibility in shaping children's developing regulatory skills. In combination, this project holds great potential to address central questions about cultural, biological, and environmental contributions to adaptive regulatory capacity; identify early precursors to psychopathology in a high risk ethnic group; and enhance opportunities for translation to treatment and prevention. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Children raised in poverty face significantly elevated risk for developmental deficits, behavioral and emotional health problems, and poor lifespan mental and physical health. Ethnic minority status compounds the risk, but little is known about mechanisms of risk or cultural-contextual factors that may mitigate risk. A central goal of this project is to unravel developmental pathways that lead to positive or negative adaptation for minority children in a high risk context, information critical for identifying modifiable targets for intervention and prevention programs.",Emerging Regulatory Capacity in Low-income Mexican American Children,9273929,R01HD083027,"['Cultural Assimilation ', ' Acculturation ', ' ages ', ' Age ', ' Attention ', ' Behavior ', ' psychological disorder ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Biologic Factor ', ' Biological Factors ', ' Parturition ', ' Birth ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Brain ', ' Censuses ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' childrearing ', ' Parenting behavior ', ' Parenting ', ' Child Rearing ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Emotions ', ' Environment ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Ethnic group ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' Family ', ' Foundations ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Proctocort ', ' Nutracort ', ' Hytone ', ' Hydrocortone ', ' Eldecort ', ' Dermacort ', ' Cortril ', ' Cortispray ', ' Cortisol ', ' Cortenema ', ' Cortef ', ' Cort-Dome ', ' Cetacort ', ' Aeroseb-HC ', ' Hydrocortisone ', ' Immigration ', ' Income ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Infant ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Longevity ', ' lifespan ', ' life span ', ' Length of Life ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mexican Americans ', ' Chicanos ', ' Chicanas ', ' Mothers ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' NIMH ', ' Parents ', ' Physiology ', ' Poverty ', ' Psychopathology ', ' abnormal psychology ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Informal Social Control ', ' Self Regulation ', ' Social Development ', ' Socialization ', ' Stress ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' Translations ', ' white race ', ' Occidental ', ' Caucasoid Race ', ' Caucasoid ', ' Caucasian Race ', ' Caucasian ', ' Caucasians ', ' adaptive behavior ', ' adaptation behavior ', ' Adaptive Behaviors ', ' Competence ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Hispanics ', ' post-partum ', ' Postpartum ', ' Postpartum Period ', ' Biological ', ' Link ', ' Evaluation ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Predisposition ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' Individual ', ' Funding ', ' Immigrant ', ' Shapes ', ' Molds ', ' Filamentous Fungi ', ' Life ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' showing emotion ', ' expression of emotion ', ' emotional expression ', ' physical conditioning ', ' physical health ', ' contextual factors ', ' Application Context ', ' experience ', ' intervention program ', ' prenatal ', ' unborn ', ' skills ', ' Prevention program ', ' member ', ' disorder risk ', ' disease risk ', ' Prevention ', ' social ', ' Early identification ', ' Impulsivity ', ' Emotional ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' behavioral health ', ' kindergarten ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Low income ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Cognitive ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' Process ', ' Cardiac ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socio-economically ', ' socio-economic ', ' socioeconomics ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' resilience ', ' Outcome ', ' Impairment ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' high risk ', ' public health relevance ', ' Biological Markers ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' Research Domain Criteria ', ' RDoC ', ' minority children ', ' high risk population ', ' high risk group ', ' health of the mother ', ' ']",NICHD,ARIZONA STATE UNIVERSITY-TEMPE CAMPUS,R01,2017,543047,0.035446469903747814
"Addressing Mental Health Disparities in Refugee Children Through Family and Community-based Prevention: A CBPR Collaboration and Hybrid Implementation Effectiveness Trial ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Refugee children and families who are resettled in the United States face dramatic disparities in the incidence and treatment of mental health disorders. Resettlement stressors (poverty, limited access to care) and acculturative challenges (differences in cultural norms, discrimination) often exacerbate risks due to war- related trauma exposure. Commonly, refugee mental health services are limited-usually with a narrow focus on clinical treatment of PTSD-and rarely respond holistically to the needs or priorities of refugee communities; few interventions are designed for use across diverse cultures and refugee groups, despite rapidly evolving refugee demographics. Consequently, mental health service usage is low in resettled refugee populations. For refugee children and adolescents characterized by risk factors such as parental trauma, intergenerational conflict and other acculturative and resettlement stressors, preventive interventions hold great promise but are exceedingly rare. Cross-cultural application of community-based participatory research (CBPR) methods can increase understanding of risk and protective factors in refugee communities and contribute to development of responsive, flexible, interventions to promote healthy family functioning and child mental health and help prevent mental health disparities. We propose a CBPR-driven hybrid implementation effectiveness trial that builds upon ongoing collaborative research and community awareness-raising within Somali Bantu and Lhotshampas Bhutanese refugee communities in New England. Preliminary research and CBPR-based needs assessments with these groups has identified numerous cultural and community strengths as well as ongoing problems of difficult parent-child interactions, poor communication, and family conflict which interact with ongoing stressors to increase risks for child emotional and behavioral problems. Using a CBPR approach, a family based prevention model, the Family Strengthening Intervention for Refugees (FSI-R) was adapted from a tested model used in Africa and designed for delivery by refugee community health workers with through a process involving stakeholder consultation and local refugee Community Advisory Board input. Pilot data on the FSI-R demonstrates strong feasibility and acceptability, but further data are needed on effectiveness as well as barriers and facilitators to implementation by community health workers embedded in refugee-serving social services agencies. Specific aims are to (1) examine the impact of a family-based preventive intervention on outcomes of parent-child relationships, family functioning, and child mental health using a Hybrid Type 2Effectiveness-Implementation Design (families with children aged 7-17 in a two-arm randomized controlled trial); (2) identify barriers and facilitators to implementation of the FSI-R by community health workers by conducting a process evaluation concurrent with the delivery of the intervention; and (3) strengthen the science of community engagement to address health disparities by fortifying CBPR-based pathways of change via collaborative partnerships between refugee communities, service providers, and academic stakeholders. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed study will employ a cross-cultural CBPR approach to build from prior needs assessments and mixed methods research to evaluate the effectiveness of the Family Strengthening Intervention for Refugees (FSI-R), a preventative family home-based visiting intervention intended to mitigate mental health disparities among refugee children and families using a hybrid implementation-effectiveness design. Results of our trial will expand the evidence-base on community-based interventions for refugees and has the potential to be replicated to reduce mental health disparities affecting diverse groups of

"Trauma-informed Collaborative Care for Low-income African Americans with PTSD PROJECT SUMMARY Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is prevalent in the general population. In physician offices, one in four patients may suffer from PTSD. PTSD is difficult and costly to treat because it often requires both traditional mental health treatment and other types of care in the community to address the trauma in patients' lives. PTSD is even more common among low-income African Americans, who are also less likely to receive care for mental health problems, in large part because of barriers such as mistrust in healthcare providers, skepticism about the benefits of treatment, and beliefs about the inability to cope with PTSD. There are also practical barriers including limited access to care and lack of transportation, childcare, and financial resources that make it difficult for low-income patients to get care for PTSD. Accumulating evidence has established that collaborative care for PTSD in primary care settings is effective, but only when patients engage in the intervention with the care manager. Successful engagement may be attributed in large part to the use of active strategies to connect patients to care and motivational interviewing for goal setting and teaching coping skills. Therefore, consistent with the Institute of Medicine's priority for effective delivery approaches that engage individuals with PTSD into care, a trauma-informed approach that addresses social psychological and logistical barriers may better engage patients, enhance collaborative care, and ultimately, improve outcomes. The objective of this proposal is to test whether an enhanced collaborative care intervention that targets social psychological and practical barriers can improve care for low-income African Americans with PTSD. We propose to optimize, culturally adapt, and pilot test a collaborative care intervention that uses a trauma- informed approach to identify the active ingredients that improve treatment engagement, and reduce PTSD diagnosis and symptoms in primary care settings that serve low-income African Americans. Specifically, we will compare PTSD collaborative care (PCM) with a minimally enhanced usual (MEU) care approach for underserved African Americans. We will recruit patients at two FQHCs in New Orleans, LA to assess the feasibility, tolerability, and acceptability of PCM. We will conduct a pilot randomized trial of the optimized and adapted PCM intervention compared with MEU with 40 African American patients to evaluate its impact on social psychological target mechanisms – outcome expectancy, coping efficacy, and trust in facilitating treatment engagement. We will also evaluate the effectiveness of the PCM intervention (compared with MEU) on outcomes – PTSD outcomes and use of mental health care and non-medical community services and resources either directly or indirectly as mediated by the target mechanisms before and one year after the start of the intervention. Preliminary data from this pilot study will pave the way for a larger-scale intervention. PROJECT NARRATIVE This proposed pilot effectiveness trial is relevant to public health because PTSD is a significant problem, particularly among low-income African American patients seen in the Nation's safety net health centers. However, we still do not know enough about how to improve care in this population. Our goal is to improve engagement in collaborative care interventions and ultimately, reduce PTSD diagnoses and symptoms among patients seen in safety net health care settings. We propose to improve public health by testing an optimized to collaborative care intervention that is culturally adapted to the low-income African American population to engage and retain patients in care for PTSD. This research will also identify the key social psychological mechanisms that can increase the impact of collaborative care. ",Trauma-informed Collaborative Care for Low-income African Americans with PTSD,9370448,R34MH111860,"['Affect ', ' Anxiety ', ' Anxiety Disorders ', ' psychological disorder ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Belief ', ' Communities ', ' Community Services ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Engineering ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Health Personnel ', ' treatment access ', ' health services availability ', ' health service access ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' accessibility to health services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Access to Care ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' Institute of Medicine (U.S.) ', ' NAS/IOM ', ' Institute of Medicine ', ' Institutes ', ' Learning ', ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health Services ', ' Mental Hygiene Services ', ' Patients ', "" Physicians' Offices "", ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Primary Care ', ' Problem Solving ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Safety ', ' Social Work ', ' Social Service ', ' Stress ', ' Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders ', ' traumatic neurosis ', ' Posttraumatic Stress Disorders ', ' Posttraumatic Neuroses ', ' Post-Traumatic Neuroses ', ' PTSD ', ' Educational process of instructing ', ' Teaching ', ' Testing ', ' Transportation ', ' Veterans ', ' violent behavior ', ' violent ', ' Violence ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' Coping Skills ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Mediating ', ' Caring ', ' Telemedicine ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Medical ', ' psychological ', ' psychologic ', ' Individual ', ' Trust ', ' Logistics ', ' Sample Size ', ' Patient Recruitments ', ' Collaborations ', ' Attenuated ', ' System ', ' Services ', ' success ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' cultural competence ', ' motivational enhancement therapy ', ' motivational interview ', ' General Population ', ' General Public ', ' Case Manager ', ' Case Management Nurse ', ' Care Manager ', ' social ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Low income ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Preventative intervention ', ' Subgroup ', ' trial treatment ', ' trial regimen ', ' Clinical Treatment ', ' Funding Opportunities ', ' trend ', ' Federally Qualified Health Center ', ' Behavioral ', ' effectiveness trial ', ' cost ', ' therapy efficacy ', ' therapeutically effective ', ' therapeutic efficacy ', ' intervention efficacy ', ' Treatment Efficacy ', ' Outcome ', ' Expectancy ', ' coping ', ' Population ', ' Trauma ', ' safety net ', ' service intervention ', ' collaborative care ', ' evidence base ', ' primary care setting ', ' primary outcome ', ' secondary outcome ', ' treatment as usual ', ' usual care ', ' randomized trial ', ' Randomization trial ', ' arm ', ' peer support ', ' improved outcome ', ' health care disparity ', ' healthcare disparity ', ' disparity in healthcare ', ' disparity in care ', ' ']",NIMH,RAND CORPORATION,R34,2017,291458,0.03237981537986505
"Impact of peer Support on Health Services and Social Disparities Among Minority Youth with SMI Project Summary/Abstract This mixed methods study aims to assess whether peer-support reduces disparities in mental health service utilization and social outcomes among transitional age youth (TAY) age 16-24 with severe mental illness (SMI). TAY with SMI face extraordinary challenges in their transition to adulthood and exhibit lower levels of educational attainment, and higher rates of unemployment, poverty, unplanned pregnancy, substance use, homelessness, and justice system involvement than TAY without SMI. These disparities are exacerbated among minority TAY. Therefore, there is a great need for evidence-based, culturally tailored interventions that effectively link TAY to resources that can improve their mental health and social outcomes. The 2004 California Mental Health Services Act funded hundreds of new TAY-specific programs; while TAY peer support services are now pervasive in mental health programs, evidence regarding their effectiveness for TAY with SMI is largely lacking. Therefore, this study aims to (1) Estimate quantitatively whether the use of peer support reduces racial / ethnic disparities in mental health services and social outcomes among TAY living with SMI; (2) Identify quantitatively which types or combinations of peer supports are most effective at improving mental health services and social outcomes and reducing racial / ethnic disparities among TAY; (3) Estimate the additional mental health service costs or cost savings associated with providing peer support services to TAY; (4) Qualitatively elucidate TAY clients’ and peer providers’ perceptions of how TAY peer support relates to mental health services and social outcomes disparities; and (5) Qualitatively characterize barriers and facilitators to the use of TAY peer support by TAY program managers and county administrators. To meet these aims, we will survey TAY programs (N=140), analyze five years of administrative data to assess costs or cost-savings associated with using peer support services (N=8,800, Aims 1-3) and conduct small group interviews with TAY peer providers (n=30-40), focus groups with TAY clients (n=60-80), and individual interviews with as TAY program managers (n=20) and county administrators (n=6-10) (Aims 4 and 5). This study leverages a major system redesign in California’s mental health system and aims to rigorously study a large-scale implementation of TAY peer support services. Findings will help providers and policy-makers make informed decisions about the effectiveness of peer support in reducing disparities among minority TAY living with SMI and enable us to make recommendations on potential best-practices in the use of TAY peer supports.

"Community Partnership to Identify Intervention Targets to Improve Mental Health Services to Transgender Individuals in Underserved Areas Abstract Individuals who fall outside of the binary male/female classification of gender that matches the sex they were assigned at birth—termed transgender or simply trans—face innumerable challenges to their personal, interpersonal, and cultural identity that provoke significant health disparities. Although standards of care and other guidelines have been established for mental health services for trans individuals, these documents tend to be broad and aspirational and provide little specific information for front line providers or evidence-based practice. Furthermore, the history of stigmatization and discrimination, including in health care settings, has created many barriers to treatment seeking by trans individuals. This project seeks to reduce these health disparities and improve psychological services through two specific aims: #1 Develop culturally sensitive evidence-based principles of care for psychological services and assessment for the trans community in service impoverished areas. #2. Assess the needs and barriers for mental health services through an iterative development process in partnership with the Central Great Plains trans community that includes a deep understanding of stigma that can then inform the principles of care. Using a community-based participatory research model, the research team will partner with the Central Great Plains rural and urban trans community and local mental health providers through an iterative series of focus groups. Transcripts of the focus groups will be subjected to two analyses – an inductive analysis based in grounded theory to identify themes and a critical, cultural, and rhetorical approach to link key topics in the transcripts to the cultural context to better understand trans stigma. The project will be guided by the already established local and national advisory boards. Deliverables include principles of care that can inform trans-affirmative adaptations of first-line psychological interventions for common disorders; a self- report instrument to inform process and outcomes for trans psychological services; and a publishable taxonomy of stigmatizing and destigmatizing discourse to provide critical information to clinicians about the way language is used to marginalize or heal trans people in the healthcare context. These deliverables and the establishment of a partnership with trans community will prepare the research team to apply the principles of care in a specific context (e.g., adapting a first-line treatment for anxiety) and, eventually, randomized controlled trials. This project will enhance public health services to a population subject to large health disparities, offering a pathway to improve best practices in mental health care for the trans population. Project Narrative  The proposed principles of psychological care in this application will have tangible public health benefits to the more than 700,000 self-identified transgender (trans) Americans. These principles will provide guidance for first-line interventions for mental health issues for a group with high health disparities, including elevated suicidality. Furthermore, the taxonomy of stigmatizing and destigmatizing language and discourse surrounding trans communities developed in this application will be a valuable resource to both the trans communities and health practitioners across the medical world when serving trans clients.",Community Partnership to Identify Intervention Targets to Improve Mental Health Services to Transgender Individuals in Underserved Areas,9348676,R21MH108897,"['Anxiety ', ' assault ', ' psychological disorder ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Systematic Bias ', ' Systematics ', ' Classification ', ' Client ', ' Communities ', ' Darkness ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Discrimination ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' Feedback ', ' Female ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Foundations ', ' Gender Identity ', ' Goals ', ' Group Interviews ', ' Health ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Health Personnel ', ' services research ', ' Medical Care Research ', ' Health Services Evaluation ', ' Health Services Research ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' interventions research ', ' interventional study ', ' interventional research ', ' intervention research ', ' Language ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' male ', ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health Services ', ' Mental Hygiene Services ', ' Methodology ', ' Moods ', ' Occupations ', ' Professional Positions ', ' Jobs ', ' Clinical Psychology ', ' Public Health ', ' Publishing ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' statistics ', ' Stigmatization ', ' Suicide ', ' suicidality ', ' intent to die ', ' fatal suicide ', ' fatal attempt ', ' Suicide attempt ', ' suicidal attempt ', ' non fatal attempt ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Translating ', ' USPHS ', ' Public Health Service ', ' United States Public Health Service ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', ' falls ', ' Health Benefit ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Specialist ', ' General Taxonomy ', ' Taxonomy ', ' Treatment Effectiveness ', ' Caring ', ' Social Network ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Surface ', ' Biological ', ' Medical ', ' psychological ', ' psychologic ', ' Series ', ' Link ', ' Feminine ', ' Masculine ', ' term newborn ', ' full-term birth ', ' Fullterm Birth ', ' Term Birth ', ' Discipline ', ' Individual ', ' Rural ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' instrument ', ' Research Priority ', ' Services ', ' transgender ', ' trans* ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' named group ', ' Special Population ', ' trait ', ' stress related disorder ', ' Structure ', ' member ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Self-Report ', ' General Population ', ' General Public ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' Modeling ', ' behavioral health ', ' social stigma ', ' stigma ', ' theories ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' anthrax lethal factor ', ' lethal toxin ', ' lethal factor ', ' anthrax toxin LF ', ' anthrax lethal toxin ', ' LeTx ', ' Bacillus anthracis lethal toxin ', ' Bacillus anthracis lef protein ', ' Bacillus anthracis LF protein ', ' B anthracis LeTx toxin ', ' B anthracis LeTx ', ' Provider ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Address ', ' Sexual Health ', ' Evidence based practice ', ' Data ', ' Transcript ', ' Preparation ', ' Process ', ' sex ', ' Community Health ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' healing ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' efficacy trial ', ' Outcome ', ' coping ', ' Population ', ' Trauma ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' community based participatory research ', ' participatory action research ', ' community based research ', ' community based design ', ' therapy development ', ' treatment development ', ' intervention development ', ' develop therapy ', ' evidence base ', ' gender dysphoria ', ' gender dysphoric ', ' Sexual and Gender Minorities ', ' Gender and Sexual Minorities ', ' gender nonconforming ', ' non-gender conforming ', ' gender non-conforming ', ' anxiety treatment ', ' social exclusion ', ' marginalization ', ' Assessment tool ', ' Assessment instrument ', ' community partnership ', ' cisgender ', ' disparity reduction ', ' reduce disparity ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF NEBRASKA LINCOLN,R21,2017,181321,0.10824179659849122
"Addressing Health Disparities among Transgender Women DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Rachel L. Kaplan, PhD, MPH is a public health researcher at the Center for Research and Education on Gender and Sexuality at San Francisco State University and a postdoctoral scholar at University of California, Berkeley's Mack Center on Mental Health and Social Conflict. Dr. Kaplan's long-term career objective is to become an independent researcher specializing in the development and implementation of sexual and mental health promoting interventions among sexual minority populations in international settings. The proposed training, mentorship, and research plan support this goal and will provide her with the theoretical and practical skills necessary to become an independent intervention researcher. Although transgender women are among the most-at-risk populations for contracting HIV, few studies have been conducted to determine the most feasible and acceptable ways to impact risk. Further, knowledge of sexual and mental health among transgender women has been derived mostly from the United States. There is an urgent need for culturally relevant interventions for this marginalized population in poorly-resourced, high-stigma settings. The proposed study will address these gaps by: (1) exploring the psycho-social and cultural factors that form the context in which transgender women's sexual and mental health are situated; (2) determining how to impact transgender women's sexual and mental health through adaptation of a prevention intervention; and (3) assessing the feasibility and accessibility of the prevention intervention through pilot testing among transgender women in Lebanon. It is expected that this research will reveal prevention needs and strategies specific to transgender women in the Middle East and provide unique and powerful results to inform efficacy testing in future larger- scale trials in international settings. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This study is important to public health because it will provide critical information about how to access and engage high-risk and highly stigmatized sexual minority populations such as transgender women. Because rates of HIV transmission and mental health problems are high among transwomen, it is crucial to examine this population's sexual and mental health. Transwomen are typically marginalized; they experience high rates of gender-related abuse, unstable housing, depression, and HIV risk behavior including the engagement in sex work for income. As public health researchers, we have only begun to understand which components of existing interventions might be efficacious for risk reduction and health promotion among transwomen in the U.S. This study will investigate the cultural acceptability and feasibility of an adapted HIV prevention intervention that was originally developed for use among transwomen in the U.S. A better understanding of culturally acceptable and feasible strategies for addressing sexual and mental health among transwomen in Lebanon will aid the development and adaptation of health-promoting approaches in other international settings.",Addressing Health Disparities among Transgender Women,9327063,K01MH102142,"['Affect ', ' North Africa ', ' Maghreb ', ' French-Speaking Africa ', ' Northern Africa ', ' California ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' CDC ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' Communities ', ' Conflict ', ' Conflict (Psychology) ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Discrimination ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Epidemic ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' Health Promotion ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' Incidence ', ' Income ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Lebanon ', ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mentorship ', ' Middle East ', ' Psychosocial Factor ', ' psychosocial variables ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' San Francisco ', ' Sexuality ', ' Social Sciences ', ' Social support ', ' social support network ', ' Stigmatization ', ' Testing ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' violent behavior ', ' violent ', ' Violence ', ' Work ', ' Gender ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' HIV/AIDS prevention ', ' HIV Prevention ', ' AIDS/HIV prevention ', ' AIDS prevention ', ' base ', ' career ', ' Area ', ' Training ', ' Populations at Risk ', ' Contracts ', ' Contracting Opportunities ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' psychosocial ', ' contextual factors ', ' Application Context ', ' experience ', ' Transact ', ' skills ', ' Prevention ', ' social ', ' AIDS/HIV problem ', ' HIV/AIDS problem ', ' HIV/AIDS ', ' AIDS/HIV ', ' HIV risk ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' social stigma ', ' stigma ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Risk Reduction ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Address ', ' Sexual Health ', ' Data ', ' Doctor of Philosophy ', ' PhD ', ' Ph.D. ', ' International ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Preventative intervention ', ' K-Series Research Career Programs ', ' Research Career Program ', ' K-Awards ', ' Career Development Programs K-Series ', ' Career Development Awards and Programs ', ' Career Development Awards ', ' Funding Mechanisms ', ' Low Prevalence ', ' Transmission ', ' transmission process ', ' sex ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' unstably housed ', ' unstable housing ', ' instably housed ', ' housing instability ', ' resilience ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' Evidence based intervention ', ' therapy development ', ' treatment development ', ' intervention development ', ' develop therapy ', ' high risk ', ' public health relevance ', ' successful intervention ', ' efficacy testing ', ' sexual minority ', ' transgender women ', ' transwomen ', ' transwoman ', ' trans-women ', ' ']",NIMH,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",K01,2017,183025,0.047340309351373545
"Increasing provider competence for treating stress-related mental health conditions in low resource settings  Project Summary Lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender individuals (LGBTI) present increased morbidity compared to the general population, which is attributed to healthcare discrimination and lack of LGBT-specific expertise, especially in high-stigma countries. Motivated by fear, Romanian LGBTI conceal their identities and report significantly more barriers to healthcare access than heterosexuals. Poor mental health, specifically anxiety and depression, is elevated for Romanian LGBTI, and associated with poor physical health (e.g., HIV risk, alcohol abuse.) However, LGBT-competent mental health professionals (MHPs) are nearly non-existent in Romania, and thus the negative impact of homophobia on mental health cannot be ameliorated. Neither universities nor continuing education include LGBT identity and health curricula, to the contrary, the dominant discourse promotes homosexuality as a dangerous anomaly in need of eradication. Given that a pilot of our in- person LGBT-affirmative MHP training we tested recently in Romania showed significant receptivity and increased competence among MHPs, this training is now ripe for testing its feasibility and efficacy in creating significant change via mobile delivery, in a randomized controlled trial (RCT). Proving the efficacy of this first mobile training and supervision model has high potential for cost-effective and expeditious boundless dissemination. In Aim 1, we will test the relative feasibility and efficacy of our mHealth MHP training by conducting an RCT comparing a mobile training (MT) of our MHP LGBT-competency program (n=60) to the equivalent in-person training (IPT) (n=60) we recently piloted. Both programs' content and structure will be identical (3-day trainings and two boosters 6 months apart). At baseline, 4, 8, and 12 months, we will assess, in a mobile fashion, all MHPs' LGBT-related attitudes, knowledge of LGBT health needs and clinical practice, and LGBT caseload. In Aim 2, we will test the efficacy of a companion mHealth supervision and consultation program in maintaining LGBT competency and enhancing LGBT-friendly practice. Half of the MHPs in each group will receive our mHealth supervision and expert consultation program, consisting of monthly 2-hour virtual group meetings to discuss case studies, in order to determine the added benefit of mobile supervision. After the training, 10 MHPs will provide interview-based program feedback. In Aim 3, we will build mHealth research capacity among MHPs by demonstrating how to integrate mobile data collection tools in clinical practice to monitor client progress for personalized treatment plans. We have chosen four types of partners to maximize the project's sustainability and benefit from the power of their multidisciplinarity: academics, direct service agencies supporting LGBTI, practicing MHPs, and a technical developer. This first RCT testing of an mHealth training in LGBT-competent mental healthcare in Romania affords us an unparalleled opportunity to introduce much needed expertize and mHealth methodologies in universities and clinical practice, and create a seed infrastructure for an implementation science R01 of national and global public health significance. Project Narrative The pervasive stigma and discrimination encountered by gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgender individuals (LGBTI) in Romania, coupled with the lack of resources to sustain their poor physical and mental health, are prompting the testing of this first mobile mental health professional (MHP) LGBT-competency training program in Romania, intended to build expertise to reduce health disparities.

"Delivering Church-based Interventions to Reduce Stigma and Mental Health Treatment Disparities among Latinos. Project Summary  Latinos are disproportionately affected by persistent, high levels of untreated mental illness. In California, rates of untreated mental illness are even more severe among foreign-born Latinos (67%) than U.S.-born Latinos (46%). Moreover, Latinos with limited English proficiency are less likely to recognize a need for treatment, put off treatment for longer periods of time, and access fewer mental health services compared to English-proficient Latinos. Stigma, limited mental health literacy, and cultural factors have been identified as major contributors to Latino mental health treatment disparities. Although Latinos may be reluctant to seek out mental health professionals, they often rely on religious congregations and spiritual forms of coping when confronted with mental health problems. However, religious congregations report major obstacles to collaborating with the mental health sector including the lack of mental health training, staffing, and resources. Strategic partnerships between religious congregations and community-based organizations can be leveraged to target sources of mental health treatment disparities among Latinos. The National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI), the nation's largest grassroots mental health organization has developed a host of programs tailored to the different needs and segments of the community affected by mental illness, including programs uniquely designed to address culturally diverse and faith-based communities. We propose a cluster randomized controlled trial of a multi-component, church-based, intervention that leverages NAMI's resources and programs to decrease stigma, increase mental health literacy, and improve access to mental health services among Latinos in Los Angeles and Riverside Counties.  Our specific aims are to:  1) Assess whether a multi-component, church-based intervention tailored for Latinos increases  needed mental health treatment use and support provision to individuals with a mental illness.  2) Examine whether mental health service use and support provision are related to targeted  mechanisms of change such as stigma and mental health literacy.  3) Explore differences in the effectiveness of the intervention by immigration status (e.g., U.S. vs.  non-U.S. born; English proficient vs. limited English proficient; years in the U.S.).  Nearly two decades have passed since a landmark Surgeon General's report highlighted the significant  mental health treatment disparities among Latinos, yet these disparities appear to be worsening. Partnering  with an established mental health awareness and advocacy organization makes this model highly sustainable  and could yield significant impact for the estimated 147.3 million Americans who are members of a religious congregation. Project Narrative We propose a cluster randomized controlled trial of a Latino church-based intervention in Los Angeles and Riverside Counties. Our proposed study aims to leverage the collective resources of Latino religious congregations and NAMI to test the effectiveness of a multi-component intervention directed at reducing stigma, increasing mental health literacy, and improving access to mental health services.

"Building Community Capacity for Disability Prevention for Minority Elders DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Although minority elders represent the fastest growing segment of an aging US population, they have less access to mental health care and prevention of disability, lagging well behind non-Latino whites, and suffering significant disparities. Blacks and Latinos have the greatest risk for disability, with striking disparities in healthy aging. This includes elderly immigrants who exhibit elevated depressive and anxiety symptoms, and higher rates of disability than the native-born population; yet, they often go undiagnosed or underdiagnosed. This is a missed opportunity given that mood disorder treatment has been shown to reduce disability days and that several risk factors for disability, such as functional mobility are modifiable. Research suggests that a contributing factor may be an insufficient supply of professional providers and the inability of evidence based treatments to reach and be acceptable to minority elders. An IOM committee recently reported that the severe workforce shortages in providing mental health care to elder adults required novel approaches to resolve. To address these disparities and prevent disability among minority elders, the proposed R01 examines how to successfully build collaborative research for the provision of evidence-based mental health and disability prevention treatments in community-based settings. Promising results in a few international studies show improved access and quality of mental health outcomes and reduced disability when interventions are delivered by Community Health Workers. Yet limited and inconsistent evidence of the efficacy of CHW-led interventions in the US context remains. While the number of community-based health interventions has grown exponentially to address these service disparities, there is a lack of systematic assessment of whether they lead to increased community capacity and systems change, and whether they improve the quality of care and potentially decrease disability. Our proposed study endeavors to address this limitation. As such, the proposed R01 will be one of few efforts that simultaneously study the three components necessary for a successful intervention: efficacy, since the intervention must work, acceptability among clients, and feasibility and sustainability within the organization. It seeks to understand the role of the partnerships in increasing community capacity for a combined mental health and disability prevention intervention, and evaluating the acceptability, efficacy, feasibility and sustainability of the intervention delivere by CHWs and exercise trainers to Latino, African American and Asian elders with moderate to severe mood symptoms and at risk of disability. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The rapid expansion of the aging population is outstripping the development of mental health and disability prevention services necessary to respond to their needs. The proposed revised R01 aims to evaluate whether partnerships between academic researchers, minority elders, and the community-based organizations which serve them can expand community resources and capabilities to effectively provide mental health services and reduce the risk of disability in minority elders.",Building Community Capacity for Disability Prevention for Minority Elders,9483601,R01AG046149,"['Activities of Daily Living ', ' functional capacity ', ' functional ability ', ' daily living functionality ', ' Activities of everyday life ', ' Adoption ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Affect ', ' Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aging ', ' Mental disorders ', ' psychological disorder ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Client ', ' Communities ', ' Community Health Aides ', ' community health worker ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Environment ', ' Exercise ', ' Exhibits ', ' Health ', ' Language ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health Services ', ' Mental Hygiene Services ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Patients ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Primary Care ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Support ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Testing ', ' Work ', ' Asians ', ' oriental ', ' Native-Born ', ' Native People ', ' Indigenous Population ', ' Generic Drugs ', ' generic ', ' Nonproprietary Drugs ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' depressive symptoms ', ' depressive ', ' depression symptom ', ' Emotional Depression ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Latino ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Acute ', ' Chronic ', ' prematurity ', ' premature ', ' Training ', ' mental ', ' Psyche structure ', ' disability ', ' using substances ', ' substance using ', ' substance use ', ' AOD use ', ' Alcohol or Other Drugs use ', ' Relative Risks ', ' Immigrant ', ' bilingualism ', ' bilingual ', ' Depressed mood ', ' sadness ', ' depressed ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Adopted ', ' Clinic ', ' Source ', ' System ', ' body system ', ' Organ System ', ' Mood Disorders ', ' Affective Disorders ', ' Services ', ' mental development ', ' prevention service ', ' Prevention ', ' Human Resources ', ' personnel ', ' Manpower ', ' Reporting ', ' Emotional ', ' Modeling ', ' Quality of Care ', ' QOC ', ' social stigma ', ' stigma ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Provider ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Address ', ' Improve Access ', ' International ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Preventative intervention ', ' longterm care for elderly ', ' elder care ', ' Long-Term Care for Elderly ', ' Community Health ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Evidence based treatment ', ' years of life lost to disease ', ' years of life lost to disability ', ' disease burden ', ' burden of disease ', ' burden of illness ', ' Minority ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel approaches ', ' new approaches ', ' novel strategies ', ' therapy efficacy ', ' therapeutically effective ', ' therapeutic efficacy ', ' intervention efficacy ', ' Treatment Efficacy ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Evidence based intervention ', ' population aging ', ' aged population ', ' aging population ', ' healthy aging ', ' public health relevance ', ' community setting ', ' evidence base ', ' successful intervention ', ' efficacy testing ', ' anxious symptom ', ' anxiety symptoms ', ' community building ', ' reduce disparity ', ' disparity reduction ', ' mood symptom ', ' low income country ', ' ']",NIA,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R01,2018,780305,0.032416395899690656
"UCLA-South Africa Center for Chronic Mental Disorders DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Fogarty International Center has recognized the need for collaborative research training programs between the U.S. and institutions in low and middle income countries that focus on chronic non-communicable diseases (NCD). In response to PAR 10-257, NCD Lifespan Award and the South African Governmental Report, Revitalizing Clinical Research, which calls for the training of master's-level students to improve their capacit to conduct addiction mental health research and provide additional clinical services, we propose to develop the Tirisano Training Project, or TTP (Tirisano means ""working together"" in Tswana). A collaborative training program between UCLA and several South African Universities and Institutions including faculty from the University of Cape Town (UCT), the University of Stellenbosch, the Human Sciences Research Council, and North West University will increase the clinical and research skills of South African post-bachelor, master's and doctoral-level students and early career mental health professionals. Expanding upon the infrastructure and lessons learned from our Fogarty-funded Phodiso trauma and health disparities research training program for South Africa scholars, TTP focuses on chronic stress and non-communicable chronic mental health disorders including substance abuse, depression, and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) across the life course. TTP addresses the dearth of South African researchers by targeting the ""pipeline"" challenge and training scholars at diverse points of the academic career path. Guided by a multi-dimensional conceptual model of risks and resilience resources over the lifespan, trainees will be provided the tools to develop and test novel models and methods to implement effective substance abuse and mental health interventions within the South African context. The Specific Aims are to: 1) Implement a short-, medium-, and long-term multidisciplinary training program at UCLA and in South Africa for master's and doctoral-level students and early career mental health professionals drawn from clinical staff working in nursing, social work, psychiatry and public health to enhance their knowledge and skills in the areas of chronic stress and non-communicable chronic mental health disorders (Track A Scholars; cumulative n=16); 2) Implement a short-term multidisciplinary training program in South Africa for post-bachelor, master's and doctoral-level students in nursing, social work, and public health to enhance their knowledge and skills in the area of chronic stress and non-communicable chronic mental health disorders (Track B Scholars; cumulative n=100); 3) Evaluate the TTP processes, including the mentoring, research skills, and career support provided, as well as the career trajectories and accomplishments of the Track A Scholars over 10 years; and 4) Assess the sustainability and integration of TTP into academic, private, and government agencies that provide substance abuse and mental health research and services. Future goals will include encouraging the South African government to support, endorse, and adopt TTP as a successful and replicable model of cross-cultural clinical research training. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The UCLA-South Africa Tirisano Training Project (TTP) seeks five years of funding to prepare future investigators to conduct research on chronic stress and non-communicable chronic mental health disorders including substance abuse, depression, and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) across the life course. As an international collaboration between UCLA and several South African Universities and Institutions, including the University of Cape Town (UCT), the University of Stellenbosch, the Human Sciences Research Council and North West University, Tirisano's public health mission is to: 1) Increase the number of well-trained South African chronic stress and non-communicable chronic mental health researchers; 2) Translate research findings to culturally congruent substance abuse and mental health treatment interventions and programs; and 3) Facilitate the building of community clinical and research capacity and infrastructure that benefit South African people.",UCLA-South Africa Center for Chronic Mental Disorders,9443671,D43MH108170,"['Award ', ' Mental disorders ', ' psychological disorder ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Career Choice ', ' career track ', ' career pathway ', ' career interest ', ' career aspiration ', ' Career Path ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Faculty ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Government ', ' Government Agencies ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Life Cycle Stages ', ' life course ', ' Life Cycle ', ' Longevity ', ' lifespan ', ' life span ', ' Length of Life ', ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' Discipline of Nursing ', ' Nursing Profession ', ' Nursing Field ', ' Nursing ', ' Privatization ', ' Psychiatry ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Science ', ' Social Work ', ' Social Service ', ' South Africa ', ' Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders ', ' traumatic neurosis ', ' Posttraumatic Stress Disorders ', ' Posttraumatic Neuroses ', ' Post-Traumatic Neuroses ', ' PTSD ', ' Students ', ' Testing ', ' Training Programs ', ' Universities ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Training ', ' Funding ', ' tool ', ' Knowledge ', ' Adopted ', ' Services ', ' international center ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' Reporting ', ' Substance abuse problem ', ' substance abuse ', ' abuse of substances ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Institution ', ' training project ', ' Address ', ' Chronic stress ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Research Training ', ' Process ', ' Clinical Services ', ' Healthcare professional ', ' Health Care Professional ', ' Health Professional ', ' resilience ', ' Trauma ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' addictive disorder ', ' addiction ', ' LMIC ', ' low and middle-income countries ', ' South African ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,D43,2018,269040,0.02588447557425704
"Integrating Mental Health into a HIV Clinic to Improve Outcomes in Tanzanian Youth DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Dr. Dorothy Dow has a Master's of Science in Global Health and will become junior faculty at Duke University Medical Center in the Division of Pediatric Infectious Diseases in July 2014. For nearly three years, she has been living and working in Moshi, Tanzania. Her long-term goal is to become an independent global health researcher integrating mental health into the prevention and treatment of HIV among adolescents. During HIV clinic both at Duke University and Kilimanjaro Christian Medical Centre (KCMC), Dr. Dow has come to realize the reality of the statement, ""no health without mental health."" Her preliminary research evaluating the prevalence of mental health difficulties among HIV-positive adolescents in Tanzania has demonstrated symptoms of depression and trauma are prevalent in the local HIV youth clinic. Despite these findings, there are no psychologists or psychiatrists currently available at KCMC. This proposed career development plan incorporates a multidisciplinary five-year program complete with didactic training in global mental health, research methods and trial design, advanced biostatistics, and management skills for implementing large clinical trials. These didactics closely align with a mentored, patient-oriented research experience designing, adapting, and implementing a mental health intervention in the HIV adolescent clinic. Dr. Dow will receive mentorship from Dr. Coleen Cunningham (Chief, Pediatric Infectious Diseases and Pediatric Global Health), Dr. Karen O'Donnell (Clinical Psychology), Dr. Kathryn Whetten (Director of the Center for Health Policy and Inequalities Research), Dr. Blandina Mmbaga (Co-Site leader KCMC-Duke Collaboration, Professor of Pediatrics), and consultants Dr. John Bartlett (Duke Global Health Institute, DGHI) and Dr. Kathleen Sikkema (Clinical Psychology). Dr. Dow proposes to integrate both a HIV educational curriculum and an intensive cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and life skills training program called SPARCS, into the HIV teen clinic. The first aim is to create a tool kit by adapting both a HIV educational curriculum and SPARCS to be culturally relevant and in Swahili language. The second aim is a feasibility study to determine if SPARCS improves mental health, adherence, and viral outcomes. Based on the work of Dr. Dow's mentors who have successfully implemented trauma-focused CBT among orphans in Tanzania, it is anticipated that SPARCS will also be feasible to implement in a resource-limited setting. The hypothesis is that by addressing mental health needs, youth will demonstrate improved ART adherence and improved virologic outcomes. This project is anticipated to improve both mental and physical health of HIV-positive adolescents in Tanzania and open a dialogue of discussion around mental health difficulties in this setting. Upon completion of this feasibility study and further didactics and mentorship, the candidate plans to submit a R01 grant to evaluate the efficacy of this intervention as a randomized controlled trial, fulfilling her goal of conducting independent global health research to improve the overall health of adolescents living in Tanzania and other resource-limited settings. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project aims to address the mental health treatment gap that exists in the HIV youth clinic in Moshi, Tanzania with the goal of improving adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART) and HIV outcomes. Addressing this treatment gap is highly relevant in two important ways. First, improved ART adherence is important not only for one's own health, but as these youth become sexually active, it also decreases the risk of sexual transmission of HIV to their partners. Second, as perinatally HIV-infected children age into adolescence, their mental health difficulties and traumatic experiences must be addressed to facilitate a healthy and productive adulthood.",Integrating Mental Health into a HIV Clinic to Improve Outcomes in Tanzanian Youth,9515659,K01TW009985,"['Academic Medical Centers ', ' University Medical Centers ', ' Adolescence ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Behavior ', ' Biometry ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Biometrics ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Cognitive Therapy ', ' cognitive behavioral treatment ', ' cognitive behavioral therapy ', ' cognitive behavioral modification ', ' cognitive behavioral intervention ', ' cognitive behavior therapy ', ' cognitive behavior modification ', ' cognitive behavior intervention ', ' Cognitive Psychotherapy ', ' Cognition Therapy ', ' Communicable Diseases ', ' Infectious Disorder ', ' Infectious Diseases ', ' Infectious Disease Pathway ', ' Comorbidity ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Professional counselor ', ' Counselor ', ' Educational Curriculum ', ' lesson plans ', ' Curriculum ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Disclosure ', ' Information Disclosure ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Faculty ', ' Feasibility Studies ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Hair ', ' Health ', ' Health education ', ' Health Tutoring ', ' Health Instruction ', ' Health Personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health workforce ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Health Policy ', ' healthcare policy ', ' health care policy ', ' HIV ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV Seropositivity ', ' antigen positive AIDS test ', ' antibody positive AIDS test ', ' HTLV-III Seropositivity ', ' HTLV-III Seroconversion ', ' HIV antibody positive ', ' HIV Seroconversion ', ' HIV Positivity ', ' HIV Positive ', ' Anti-HIV Positivity ', ' AIDS Seropositivity ', ' AIDS Seroconversion ', ' HIV-1 ', ' Human immunodeficiency virus 1 ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Virus Type 1 ', ' HIV1 ', ' HIV-I ', ' Institutes ', ' Language ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health Services ', ' Mental Hygiene Services ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Morbidity -

"Penn mental health AIDS research center Overview Abstract/Summary The overarching theme of the Penn Mental Health AIDS Research Center (PMHARC) at the University of Pennsylvania (Penn) and Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) is to transform how individuals with comorbid mental illness/AIDS are treated and managed by developing innovative, interdisciplinary, and integrative approaches to optimize psychiatric, behavioral, and medical outcomes and achieving a better understanding of the biological, psychological, and behavioral mechanisms underlying these combined illnesses and treatments. No other center in the U.S. is currently pursuing this explicit focus, making PMHARC unique in the NIMH ARC portfolio. A substantial body of work links psychiatric disorders to acquisition of HIV infection, accelerated immune dysfunction, poor access to HIV care, and poor adherence to antiretroviral treatment once in care. Yet, there is a relative paucity of evidence-based interventions focused on the combined treatment of mental illness/AIDS and related medical co-morbidities, and relatively little work in determining the relationships between mental health treatment and HIV/AIDS disease and understanding the underlying biology. PMHARC will stimulate novel approaches and strategies to address these problems by providing mentoring and resource support for both new and established investigators choosing to study comorbid mental illness/AIDS, in part through innovative pilot studies. PMHARC's leadership has extensive expertise in contemporary pharmacotherapy of mental illness and AIDS, cognitive behavioral treatments, and theory-based behavioral interventions. PMHARC will extend well-established collaborations at Penn and CHOP, including those in the Department of Psychiatry and the CFAR, as well as with the CTSA/CTRC, the Delaney Collaboratory, and community partners in Philadelphia. A unique feature of PMHARC is the collaboration of well- established mental health AIDS researchers, well-established mental health researchers who have not previously studied AIDS, well-established substance abuse AIDS researchers who have not previously studied mental health, and AIDS researchers not previously focused on mental health. PMHARC has an Administrative and Developmental Core, and four Shared Resource Cores. Overview Relevance: A growing body of research documents that persons with mental illness are at increased risk for contracting and transmitting HIV, and there are few evidence-based practices supporting treatment of persons with mental illnesses who are also HIV seropositive. Poor treatment outcomes and non-adherence pose a major public health threat due to poor individual outcomes and increased transmissibility and secondary infections. Thus, improving treatments for persons with these comorbid conditions has major public health significance.",Penn mental health AIDS research center,9560657,P30MH097488,"['Acquired Immunodeficiency

"Trauma-informed Collaborative Care for Low-income African Americans with PTSD PROJECT SUMMARY Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is prevalent in the general population. In physician offices, one in four patients may suffer from PTSD. PTSD is difficult and costly to treat because it often requires both traditional mental health treatment and other types of care in the community to address the trauma in patients' lives. PTSD is even more common among low-income African Americans, who are also less likely to receive care for mental health problems, in large part because of barriers such as mistrust in healthcare providers, skepticism about the benefits of treatment, and beliefs about the inability to cope with PTSD. There are also practical barriers including limited access to care and lack of transportation, childcare, and financial resources that make it difficult for low-income patients to get care for PTSD. Accumulating evidence has established that collaborative care for PTSD in primary care settings is effective, but only when patients engage in the intervention with the care manager. Successful engagement may be attributed in large part to the use of active strategies to connect patients to care and motivational interviewing for goal setting and teaching coping skills. Therefore, consistent with the Institute of Medicine's priority for effective delivery approaches that engage individuals with PTSD into care, a trauma-informed approach that addresses social psychological and logistical barriers may better engage patients, enhance collaborative care, and ultimately, improve outcomes. The objective of this proposal is to test whether an enhanced collaborative care intervention that targets social psychological and practical barriers can improve care for low-income African Americans with PTSD. We propose to optimize, culturally adapt, and pilot test a collaborative care intervention that uses a trauma- informed approach to identify the active ingredients that improve treatment engagement, and reduce PTSD diagnosis and symptoms in primary care settings that serve low-income African Americans. Specifically, we will compare PTSD collaborative care (PCM) with a minimally enhanced usual (MEU) care approach for underserved African Americans. We will recruit patients at two FQHCs in New Orleans, LA to assess the feasibility, tolerability, and acceptability of PCM. We will conduct a pilot randomized trial of the optimized and adapted PCM intervention compared with MEU with 40 African American patients to evaluate its impact on social psychological target mechanisms – outcome expectancy, coping efficacy, and trust in facilitating treatment engagement. We will also evaluate the effectiveness of the PCM intervention (compared with MEU) on outcomes – PTSD outcomes and use of mental health care and non-medical community services and resources either directly or indirectly as mediated by the target mechanisms before and one year after the start of the intervention. Preliminary data from this pilot study will pave the way for a larger-scale intervention. PROJECT NARRATIVE This proposed pilot effectiveness trial is relevant to public health because PTSD is a significant problem, particularly among low-income African American patients seen in the Nation's safety net health centers. However, we still do not know enough about how to improve care in this population. Our goal is to improve engagement in collaborative care interventions and ultimately, reduce PTSD diagnoses and symptoms among patients seen in safety net health care settings. We propose to improve public health by testing an optimized to collaborative care intervention that is culturally adapted to the low-income African American population to engage and retain patients in care for PTSD. This research will also identify the key social psychological mechanisms that can increase the impact of collaborative care. ",Trauma-informed Collaborative Care for Low-income African Americans with PTSD,9552269,R34MH111860,"['Affect ', ' Anxiety ', ' Anxiety Disorders ', ' Mental disorders ', ' psychological disorder ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Belief ', ' Communities ', ' Community Services ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Engineering ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health Personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health workforce ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' treatment access ', ' health services availability ', ' health service access ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' accessibility to health services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Access to Care ', ' Institute of Medicine (U.S.) ', ' NAS/IOM ', ' Institute of Medicine ', ' Institutes ', ' Learning ', ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health Services ', ' Mental Hygiene Services ', ' Patients ', "" Physicians' Offices "", ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Primary Care ', ' Problem Solving ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Safety ', ' Social Work ', ' Social Service ', ' Stress ', ' Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders ', ' traumatic neurosis ', ' Posttraumatic Stress Disorders ', ' Posttraumatic Neuroses ', ' Post-Traumatic Neuroses ', ' PTSD ', ' Educational process of instructing ', ' Teaching ', ' Testing ', ' Transportation ', ' Veterans ', ' Violence ', ' violent behavior ', ' violent ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Coping Skills ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Mediating ', ' Caring ', ' Telemedicine ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Medical ', ' psychological ', ' psychologic ', ' Individual ', ' Trust ', ' Logistics ', ' Sample Size ', ' participant recruitment ', ' Patient Recruitments ', ' Collaborations ', ' Attenuated ', ' System ', ' Services ', ' success ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' cultural competence ', ' motivational enhancement therapy ', ' motivational interview ', ' General Population ', ' General Public ', ' Case Manager ', ' Case Management Nurse ', ' Care Manager ', ' social ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Low income ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Preventative intervention ', ' Subgroup ', ' trial treatment ', ' trial regimen ', ' Clinical Treatment ', ' Funding Opportunities ', ' trend ', ' Federally Qualified Health Center ', ' Behavioral ', ' effectiveness trial ', ' cost ', ' therapy efficacy ', ' therapeutically effective ', ' therapeutic efficacy ', ' intervention efficacy ', ' Treatment Efficacy ', ' Outcome ', ' Expectancy ', ' coping ', ' Population ', ' Trauma ', ' safety net ', ' service intervention ', ' collaborative care ', ' evidence base ', ' primary care setting ', ' primary outcome ', ' secondary outcome ', ' usual care ', ' treatment as usual ', ' Randomization trial ', ' randomized trial ', ' arm ', ' peer support ', ' improved outcome ', ' healthcare disparity ', ' disparity in healthcare ', ' disparity in care ', ' health care disparity ', ' healthcare settings ', ' health care settings ', ' patient engagement ', ' ']",NIMH,RAND CORPORATION,R34,2018,124769,0.03237981537986505
"Impact of Telemedicine on Medicare Beneficiaries with Mental Illness PROJECT SUMMARY Access to mental health specialists is difficult for many patients in the U.S., particularly for the poor and those who live in rural communities. Telemental health is one potential solution for this access problem, and there has been rapid growth in the number of live video-based telemental health visits in the U.S. While there are numerous rigorous randomized-control trials comparing telemental health visits to in-person mental health specialist care, there have been little research on how telemental health is being used in real-world settings. The uptake of telemental health has been very uneven geographically, and what explains this variation is also largely unknown. Our mixed-methods proposal centers on filling these gaps in knowledge. Under the first aim, we will conduct a series of descriptive analyses of data on 75 million adults with Medicare or commercial insurance to understand how telemental health is being used in conjunction with in-person care and whether the growth of telemental health has decreased disparities in the use of mental health specialists among disadvantaged populations. Under the second aim, we seek to explain why there is geographic variation in uptake using robust statistical machine learning. Under the third aim, we exploit the variation in uptake to assess whether communities with greater telemental health penetration have experienced improvements in care for patients with mental illness. In the fourth aim we will conduct qualitative interviews with providers to complement the empirical analyses and understand the key contextual factors underlying our findings. Understanding how telemental health is being used, why there is variation in use of telemental health, and whether telemental health use is associated with higher quality care could help drive future telemental health interventions and influence the ongoing policy debate on telemedicine regulations and reimbursement. Together the results of these aims are consistent with the NIMH's expressed interest in innovative delivery models that can improve care for underserved communities. It is difficult for many patients with mental illness to access care from a mental health specialist. Telemental health is one way to potentially help these patients receive care and the number of such visits for mental illness has increased rapidly. In this project, we will study how telemental health is being used to care for patients with mental illness, what drives variation in use, and whether telemedicine is associated with receipt of higher quality care.",Impact of Telemedicine on Medicare Beneficiaries with Mental Illness,9472495,R01MH112829,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Affect ', ' Automobile Driving ', ' driving ', ' Mental disorders ', ' psychological disorder ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Communities ', ' Complement ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Congresses ', ' meeting reports ', ' Data Analyses ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Diffusion ', ' Future ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Geography ', ' Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Disabled Persons ', ' individuals with disabilities ', ' disabled people ', ' disabled individual ', ' disabled ', ' Persons with Disabilities ', ' People with Disabilities ', ' Handicapped ', ' Disabled Population ', ' Health ', ' Medicare ', ' health insurance for disabled ', ' Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Disabled Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Aged and Disabled, Title 18 ', ' Health Personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health workforce ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' treatment access ', ' health services availability ', ' health service access ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' accessibility to health services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Access to Care ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Insurance ', ' Interview ', ' Laws ', ' Literature ', ' Medicaid ', ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Methods ', ' Persons ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' NIMH ', ' Patients ', ' Psychotic Disorders ', ' psychotic illness ', ' Psychoses ', ' Research ', ' Schizophrenia ', ' schizophrenic ', ' dementia praecox ', ' Schizophrenic Disorders ', ' medical specialties ', ' Specialty ', ' Testing ', ' Work ', ' symposium ', ' symposia ', ' summit ', ' convention ', ' conference ', ' Rural Community ', ' Specialist ', ' Caring ', ' Telemedicine ', ' base ', ' rural area ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Penetration ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Series ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' mental ', ' Psyche structure ', ' Rural ', ' Policies ', ' uptake ', ' world wide web ', ' web ', ' WWW ', ' Internet ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Pattern ', ' contextual factors ', ' Application Context ', ' interest ', ' Visit ', ' experience ', ' Speed ', ' Structure ', ' Regulation ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Quality of Care ', ' QOC ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Provider ', ' geographic difference ', ' geographic variation ', ' Low income ', ' Address ', ' Health system ', ' Data ', ' Improve Access ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' trend ', ' beneficiary ', ' medication adherence ', ' drug compliance ', ' drug adherence ', ' medication compliance ', ' rapid growth ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' severe mental disorder ', ' serious mental illness ', ' serious mental disorder ', ' persistent mental illness ', ' chronic mental illness ', ' severe mental illness ', ' elderly patient ', ' older patient ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' trial comparing ', ' demographics ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' control trial ', ' population health ', ' Emergency room visit ', ' Emergency care visit ', ' ER visit ', ' ED visit ', ' Emergency department visit ', ' learning method ', ' learning activity ', ' learning strategy ', ' improved outcome ', ' disadvantaged population ', ' Telemental ', ' care costs ', ' ']",NIMH,HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL,R01,2018,698805,0.05345028552520458
"Engaging Young Adults in Their Mental Health Care Through a Brief Empirically-Based Meta-Intervention Project Summary  In response to RFA-MH-16-410, this R34 addresses key NIMH priorities, 1) focusing on health disparities, and 2) development and preliminary testing of an innovative services intervention. We propose to refine and test the efficacy of a brief meta-intervention for young adults when they begin treatment at adult mental health clinics (hence, treatment and meta-intervention run concurrently). The meta-intervention is designed to reduce treatment dropout, a documented problem of significant public health concern, by helping young adults put treatment into perspective, better understand the rationale and goals of care, and address barriers to continued treatment as they build attendance routines and relationships with providers.  To date, research has focused on `transition interventions,' namely programs within children's systems that serve transitioning youth into young adulthood, some of which have extended services into the early twenties. These programs create temporary additional support for youth while they are still in the children's systems. Our research suggests a complementary strategy that outreaches to youth who have formed tentative and initial engagement in services in the adult system, but who are at high risk of disengaging due to the failure of services to take into account the unique developmental needs and orientations of young adults.  Our team developed a mid-level theory to understand the underlying mechanisms of disengagement. The theory integrates theories of service use with theories of decision-making, and suggests a set of factors (individual and contextual) impact disengagement among young adults with serious mental illness. Our intervention uses novel communication strategies to maintain the attention of young adults and impact these factors and thus, overall engagement. We use narrative communication (e.g., strategic storytelling as a means of conveying health information) to keep young adults connected to care and, in turn, improve functioning. We use a recovery role model who is a person who has had similar difficulties that young adults have as they first engage the adult mental health system. S/he leads activities and is a key resource. Although the recovery role model is related to approaches of peer support, it is distinct from and appeals to different mechanisms.  One hundred ninety five young adults (3 groups, 65 per group) will be randomly assigned to either the intervention group, an active control group (curriculum on safe relationships), or the treatment as usual control group when they first enroll in services. Assessments are taken at baseline, 2-week posttest, 4-week follow-up and at a three month follow-up. The study aims are (1) to develop and preliminarily test the efficacy of a novel, 2-session engagement meta-intervention aimed at engagement and functioning outcomes for marginalized young adults with serious mental illness, and (2) to preliminarily identify the underlying mechanisms of change for disengagement in mental health care, i.e., mediators and moderators of intervention effectiveness. We will advance theory as well as strengthen the proposed intervention. Project Narrative The proposed R34 refines the protocols and examines the efficacy of an engagement intervention designed for (and with) low-income young adults, ages 18 to 28, who are largely racial and ethnic minorities. Research has shown that transitioning to young adulthood often includes the discontinuation of mental health care and/or premature termination of services. The proposed study examines a brief (2-session) meta-intervention designed to help young adults understand how mental health services can help them, and addresses barriers to service engagement (i.e., stigma, mistrust, hope), thus improving their engagement in services and their overall mental health and life outcomes, as well as advancing theory on the underlying mechanisms of mental health decision making.",Engaging Young Adults in Their Mental Health Care Through a Brief Empirically-Based Meta-Intervention,9421561,R34MH111861,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Anxiety ', ' Attention ', ' Automobile Driving ', ' driving ', ' Behavior ', ' Mental disorders ', ' psychological disorder ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Welfare ', ' child wellbeing ', ' child well being ', ' adolescent welfare ', ' Client ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' Control Groups ', ' Educational Curriculum ', ' lesson plans ', ' Curriculum ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Decision Making ', ' Decision Theory ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Dropout ', ' Foundations ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health Services Research ', ' services research ', ' Medical Care Research ', ' Health Services Evaluation ', ' Institute of Medicine (U.S.) ', ' NAS/IOM ', ' Institute of Medicine ', ' Investments ', ' Medicaid ', ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health Services ', ' Mental Hygiene Services ', ' Mentors ', ' Moods ', ' Motivation ', ' Persons ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' NIMH ', ' New York ', ' Panic ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Running ', ' Schizophrenia ', ' schizophrenic ', ' dementia praecox ', ' Schizophrenic Disorders ', ' Social Work ', ' Social Service ', ' Stress ', ' Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders ', ' traumatic neurosis ', ' Posttraumatic Stress Disorders ', ' Posttraumatic Neuroses ', ' Post-Traumatic Neuroses ', ' PTSD ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Transportation ', ' Violence ', ' violent behavior ', ' violent ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Latino ', ' Youth ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' role model ', ' improved ', ' prematurity ', ' premature ', ' Randomized Clinical Trials ', ' Failure ', ' Individual ', ' Recovery ', ' young adulthood ', ' adult youth ', ' young adult ', ' Funding ', ' Letters ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Clinic ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' System ', ' Protocol Compliance ', ' Services ', ' preference ', ' rehabilitation service ', ' experience ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' outreach ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' Modeling ', ' communication theory ', ' response ', ' social stigma ', ' stigma ', ' theories ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Provider ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Low income ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' cognitive change ', ' Address ', ' Health system ', ' Symptoms ', ' Evidence based practice ', ' Qualitative Methods ', ' qualitative reasoning ', ' Adherence ', ' Effectiveness of Interventions ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' System for Public Use ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' active control ', ' health literacy ', ' care services ', ' care systems ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' improved functioning ', ' severe mental disorder ', ' serious mental illness ', ' serious mental disorder ', ' persistent mental illness ', ' chronic mental illness ', ' severe mental illness ', ' Outcome ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' ethnic minority ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' Affective ', ' Evidence based intervention ', ' service intervention ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' therapy design ', ' high risk ', ' group intervention ', ' usual care ', ' treatment as usual ', ' efficacy testing ', ' adverse consequence ', ' adverse outcome ', ' behavior outcome ', ' behavioral outcome ', ' peer support ', ' racial minority ', ' service engagement ', ' ']",NIMH,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY,R34,2018,277375,0.07755633967507022
"Mental Health Services for Infants/Toddlers Receiving Part C Early Intervention Project Summary/Abstract This R34 resubmission proposes to develop and examine a mental health service model for families of infants/toddlers with developmental delay that reduces risk for mental health problems, and in turn, enhances readiness for preschool. Infants/toddlers with developmental delay exhibit significantly higher rates of disruptive behaviors, peer problems, impulsivity, and academic failure. Their parents also are at elevated risk for mental health problems and child maltreatment. Families of infants/toddlers with developmental delay are more likely to live in poverty with limited access to services, and most receive government-funded, home- based Early Intervention (EI) services (i.e., Part C of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act). We propose to leverage the unique position of Infant-Toddler Developmental Specialists (ITDS), front-line providers of EI services, to support parent-infant/toddler interactions and reduce family risks for mental health problems. Based on a rich empirical literature, we selected Child-Directed Interaction (CDI), the first phase of Parent-Child Interaction Therapy, as an evidence-based intervention to increase positive parent-infant/toddler interactions and reduce negative interactions. CDI aligns with the training, role, and function of ITDS, and responds to the needs of referred families. We will collaborate with EI provider agencies toward a service model that emphasizes initial training, ongoing supervision, and quality assurance to facilitate infant/toddler mental health (social, emotional, behavioral competence) and parent mental health (anxiety/depression, parenting stress, caregiver strain). We will examine feasibility, fidelity, and acceptability of the proposed model to identify facilitators and barriers to service delivery, and we will examine its promise compared to services as usual (n = 4 agencies, 16 ITDS, 112 families). In light of the extensive needs and depleting resources faced by families of infants/toddlers with developmental delay, the proposed work provides a unique opportunity to enhance the natural role and capacity of a skilled EI workforce to provide high quality services that minimize mental health problems and facilitate healthy child and family trajectories. Project Narrative Infants/toddlers with developmental delay and their families are at significant risk for mental health problems and more likely to live in poverty. We are collaborating with Early Intervention providers toward a mental health service model to support parent-infant/toddler interactions, improve family mental health, and prepare toddlers for preschool. In light of increasing needs and decreasing resources, this research enhances the role and capacity of a skilled workforce to provide high quality services for vulnerable families, and hence carries potential for significant public health impact.",Mental Health Services for Infants/Toddlers Receiving Part C Early Intervention,9648213,R34MH110541,"['Anxiety ', ' Behavior ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Rearing ', ' childrearing ', ' Parenting behavior ', ' Parenting ', ' Communities ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Exhibits ', ' Family ', ' Government ', ' Disabled Persons ', ' individuals with disabilities ', ' disabled people ', ' disabled individual ', ' disabled ', ' Persons with Disabilities ', ' People with Disabilities ', ' Handicapped ', ' Disabled Population ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' treatment access ', ' health services availability ', ' health service access ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' accessibility to health services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Access to Care ', ' Health Services Research ', ' services research ', ' Medical Care Research ', ' Health Services Evaluation ', ' Infant ', ' Infant Health Services ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Literature ', ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health Services ', ' Mental Hygiene Services ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' NIMH ', ' Parent-Child Relations ', ' parent offspring interaction ', ' parent child interaction ', ' Parent-Child Relationship ', ' Parents ', ' Poverty ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Nursery Schools ', ' preschool ', ' pre-kindergarten ', ' pre-k ', ' Science ', ' Stress ', ' Supervision ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Developmental Delay Disorders ', ' Specific Child Development Disorders ', ' Developmental Delay ', ' Competence ', ' Mediating ', ' Specialist ', ' base ', ' quality assurance ', ' improved ', ' Distal ', ' Phase ', ' Training ', ' Failure ', ' Sample Size ', ' Early Intervention ', ' Funding ', ' Collaborations ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' Review Literature ', ' programs ', ' Adopted ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' Services ', ' experience ', ' peer ', ' Toddler ', ' social ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' Impulsivity ', ' Emotional ', ' Modeling ', ' Caregiver Burden ', ' caregiver stress ', ' care giver stress ', ' Care giver Burden ', ' Provider ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Readiness ', ' Preparedness ', ' child maltreatment ', ' Childhood maltreatment ', ' Child Abuse and Neglect ', ' underrepresentation of minorities ', ' under-represented minority ', ' under-representation of minorities ', ' Underrepresented Ethnic Minority ', ' Underrepresented Minority ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' Evidence based intervention ', ' infant outcome ', ' service intervention ', ' provider intervention ', ' evidence base ', ' community partnership ', ' care giver strain ', ' caregiver strain ', ' healthcare delivery model ', ' care delivery model ', ' Service model ', ' Service delivery model ', ' service delivery ', ' ']",NIMH,FLORIDA INTERNATIONAL UNIVERSITY,R34,2018,119298,0.15918603972051615
"Impact of peer Support on Health Services and Social Disparities Among Minority Youth with SMI Project Summary/Abstract This mixed methods study aims to assess whether peer-support reduces disparities in mental health service utilization and social outcomes among transitional age youth (TAY) age 16-24 with severe mental illness (SMI). TAY with SMI face extraordinary challenges in their transition to adulthood and exhibit lower levels of educational attainment, and higher rates of unemployment, poverty, unplanned pregnancy, substance use, homelessness, and justice system involvement than TAY without SMI. These disparities are exacerbated among minority TAY. Therefore, there is a great need for evidence-based, culturally tailored interventions that effectively link TAY to resources that can improve their mental health and social outcomes. The 2004 California Mental Health Services Act funded hundreds of new TAY-specific programs; while TAY peer support services are now pervasive in mental health programs, evidence regarding their effectiveness for TAY with SMI is largely lacking. Therefore, this study aims to (1) Estimate quantitatively whether the use of peer support reduces racial / ethnic disparities in mental health services and social outcomes among TAY living with SMI; (2) Identify quantitatively which types or combinations of peer supports are most effective at improving mental health services and social outcomes and reducing racial / ethnic disparities among TAY; (3) Estimate the additional mental health service costs or cost savings associated with providing peer support services to TAY; (4) Qualitatively elucidate TAY clients’ and peer providers’ perceptions of how TAY peer support relates to mental health services and social outcomes disparities; and (5) Qualitatively characterize barriers and facilitators to the use of TAY peer support by TAY program managers and county administrators. To meet these aims, we will survey TAY programs (N=140), analyze five years of administrative data to assess costs or cost-savings associated with using peer support services (N=8,800, Aims 1-3) and conduct small group interviews with TAY peer providers (n=30-40), focus groups with TAY clients (n=60-80), and individual interviews with as TAY program managers (n=20) and county administrators (n=6-10) (Aims 4 and 5). This study leverages a major system redesign in California’s mental health system and aims to rigorously study a large-scale implementation of TAY peer support services. Findings will help providers and policy-makers make informed decisions about the effectiveness of peer support in reducing disparities among minority TAY living with SMI and enable us to make recommendations on potential best-practices in the use of TAY peer supports. Project Narrative This mixed methods study aims to test the effectiveness of peer-support in reducing disparities in mental health services and social outcomes among minority transitional age youth (TAY) ages 16-24 with severe mental illness (SMI).

"An implementation science approach to optimizing evidence-based treatments for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) for non-specialty settings PROJECT SUMMARY Background: An estimated 33-46% of clients seen in urban low-income primary care or behavioral health clinics have a current diagnosis of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), yet only 13% receive PTSD treatment. Further, only 57% of those who access care for PTSD receive a minimally adequate dose of therapy. The shortage of trained mental health specialists has led to concerning inequities in access to and quality of care in low-income community settings. To address workforce shortages, as well as client preferences, leaders in the field have advocated for the development of stepped care approaches that begin with brief, patient-centered interventions before progressing to intensive treatments. Despite promise, stepped approaches have not been developed for adults with PTSD. Specific Aims: This current study applies the Replicating Effective Programs Framework to guide the refinement and pre-implementation of a “Step 1” evidence-based treatment (EBT) for PTSD in primary care. A full stepped care approach will be tested in a future R01 (Step 1: brief, low intensity EBT in a non-specialty setting; Step 2: high intensity EBT in a specialty setting). Aim 1: To conduct a mixed-methods formative evaluation based on surveys and semi-structured interviews (N=25; 10 social worker and community health worker interventionists; 15 primary care stakeholders) to characterize the local integrated primary care setting and identify the need for augmentation to the intervention, protocol, or implementation blueprint. Aim 2: To optimize the intervention and operational procedures and to finalize the formal implementation blueprint (based on Aim 1 findings and consultation with the community advisory board [CAB]; N=10). Aim 3: To conduct a nonrandomized hybrid type 1 implementation-effectiveness pilot (N=60 clients) to assess the feasibility, effectiveness, and implementation of the adapted PTSD intervention (v. treatment as usual) in a primary care clinic. Candidate: This Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award (K23) builds upon the candidate’s previous experiences in clinical research focused on psychological adjustment following exposure to violence or discrimination among multiple minority populations. The candidate’s long-term goal is to be an independent implementation scientist focused on optimizing EBTs and care delivery models for PTSD. Training Objectives: (1) The development of implementation packages for delivery of EBTs in non-specialty settings; (2) Advanced training in pragmatic clinical trial design and mixed-methods data analysis and integration; and (3) Integrated primary care and stepped care models for mental health service delivery. Training Activities: Training will be achieved through mentorship by experts (Drs. A. Rani Elwy, Lisa Fortuna, Marylene Cloitre, Alisa Lincoln, Mark Bauer, Margarita Alegria, and Bindu Kalesan), formal coursework at Boston University School of Public Health, seminars, trainings, conferences, and workshop attendance. PROJECT NARRATIVE Only 13% of individuals with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in urban low-income communities receive mental health treatment; of those who receive treatment, only 56% receive minimally adequate psychotherapy. Low access to evidence-based psychotherapies for PTSD is foremost due to a shortage of trained mental health specialists; however, additional barriers exist, including: consumer preferences for care in non-specialty settings. Stepped care approaches that begin with the implementation of brief evidence-based psychotherapies for PTSD in non-specialty settings have the potential to improve the availability and quality of PTSD treatment in community settings.",An implementation science approach to optimizing evidence-based treatments for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) for non-specialty settings,9583282,K23MH117221,"['implementation science ', ' community setting ', ' evidence base ', ' primary care setting ', ' usual care ', ' treatment as usual ', ' pragmatic trial ', ' mental training ', ' formative evaluation ', ' formative assessment ', ' informal support ', ' Pragmatic clinical trial ', ' symptomatology ', ' healthcare delivery model ', ' care delivery model ', ' Service model ', ' Service delivery model ', ' Service setting ', ' clinical implementation ', ' implementation strategy ', ' exposure to trauma ', ' trauma exposure ', ' exposure to violence ', ' violence exposure ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Aftercare ', ' post treatment ', ' After-Treatment ', ' After Care ', ' Attitude ', ' Boston ', ' Client ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Communities ', ' Community Health Aides ', ' community health worker ', ' Consultations ', ' Continuity of Patient Care ', ' Continuum of Care ', ' Continuity of Care ', ' Data Analyses ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' health care delivery ', ' health services delivery ', ' Healthcare Delivery ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Family ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' treatment access ', ' health services availability ', ' health service access ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' accessibility to health services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Access to Care ', ' Hybrids ', ' Interview ', ' literacy ', ' Memory ', ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health Services ', ' Mental Hygiene Services ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methods ', ' Outpatients ', ' Out-patients ', ' Client satisfaction ', ' Patient Satisfaction ', ' Primary Care Physician ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Primary Care ', ' Psychotherapy ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Public Health Schools ', ' Shame ', ' Social Workers ', ' medical specialties ', ' Specialty ', ' Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders ', ' traumatic neurosis ', ' Posttraumatic Stress Disorders ', ' Posttraumatic Neuroses ', ' Post-Traumatic Neuroses ', ' PTSD ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Testing ', ' Training Activity ', ' training module ', ' Universities ', ' Intensive Care ', ' symposium ', ' symposia ', ' summit ', ' convention ', ' conference ', ' Consumer Preferences ', ' Specialist ', ' Step Tests ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Specified ', ' Specific qualifier value ', ' Medical ', ' Ensure ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Workshop ', ' Educational workshop ', ' uptake ', ' tool ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' Adopted ', ' Clinic ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' Source ', ' psychosocial ', ' Services ', ' preference ', ' skills training ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' Structure ', ' peer ', ' Psychological adjustment ', ' Psychological Adaptation ', ' Psychologic Adaptation ', ' Regulation ', ' Modeling ', ' behavioral health ', ' Quality of Care ', ' QOC ', ' social stigma ', ' stigma ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Low income ', ' Address ', ' Dose ', ' Symptoms ', ' Advocate ', ' Data ', ' Improve Access ', ' Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award ', ' Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award (K23) ', ' K23 Program ', ' K23 Mechanism ', ' K23 Award ', ' Clinical Trials Design ', ' Cognitive ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Evidence based treatment ', ' health literacy ', ' PC3 ', ' PC-3 cell line ', ' PC-3 ', ' PC3 cell line ', ' care services ', ' care systems ', ' implementation research ', ' data integration ', ' Minority ', ' care preference ', ' Clinical effectiveness ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Trauma ', ' Affective ', ' patient centered ', ' patient oriented ', ' ']",NIMH,BOSTON MEDICAL CENTER,K23,2018,186549,0.04264155780285376
"Impact of peer Support on Health Services and Social Disparities Among Minority Youth with SMI Project Summary/Abstract This mixed methods study aims to assess whether peer-support reduces disparities in mental health service utilization and social outcomes among transitional age youth (TAY) age 16-24 with severe mental illness (SMI). TAY with SMI face extraordinary challenges in their transition to adulthood and exhibit lower levels of educational attainment, and higher rates of unemployment, poverty, unplanned pregnancy, substance use, homelessness, and justice system involvement than TAY without SMI. These disparities are exacerbated among minority TAY. Therefore, there is a great need for evidence-based, culturally tailored interventions that effectively link TAY to resources that can improve their mental health and social outcomes. The 2004 California Mental Health Services Act funded hundreds of new TAY-specific programs; while TAY peer support services are now pervasive in mental health programs, evidence regarding their effectiveness for TAY with SMI is largely lacking. Therefore, this study aims to (1) Estimate quantitatively whether the use of peer support reduces racial / ethnic disparities in mental health services and social outcomes among TAY living with SMI; (2) Identify quantitatively which types or combinations of peer supports are most effective at improving mental health services and social outcomes and reducing racial / ethnic disparities among TAY; (3) Estimate the additional mental health service costs or cost savings associated with providing peer support services to TAY; (4) Qualitatively elucidate TAY clients’ and peer providers’ perceptions of how TAY peer support relates to mental health services and social outcomes disparities; and (5) Qualitatively characterize barriers and facilitators to the use of TAY peer support by TAY program managers and county administrators. To meet these aims, we will survey TAY programs (N=140), analyze five years of administrative data to assess costs or cost-savings associated with using peer support services (N=8,800, Aims 1-3) and conduct small group interviews with TAY peer providers (n=30-40), focus groups with TAY clients (n=60-80), and individual interviews with as TAY program managers (n=20) and county administrators (n=6-10) (Aims 4 and 5). This study leverages a major system redesign in California’s mental health system and aims to rigorously study a large-scale implementation of TAY peer support services. Findings will help providers and policy-makers make informed decisions about the effectiveness of peer support in reducing disparities among minority TAY living with SMI and enable us to make recommendations on potential best-practices in the use of TAY peer supports.

"Effects of Hospital-Community-Public Health Integration on Racial and Ethnic Disparities in Mental Health Summary Mental illness is a major public health concern in the U.S. and a significant source of morbidity and mortality. Racial and ethnic minority patients experience disproportionate burdens of common physical health conditions associated with mental illness, largely due to the lack of health care access and social stigma. Effectively treating mental illness and the associated conditions will depend on a comprehensive approach that crosses health systems and policies, such as the Community Benefit State Laws, to target “Population Health” and emphasize the value of social determinants of health. However, the current mental health care system works in a silo, and evidence of care coordination on health disparities is lacking. The goal of this study is to examine system-level care coordination among hospitals, communities, and public health agencies, and to estimate its impacts on unmet health care needs in African American and Latino patients with mental illness. The rationale for the proposed research is that once it is known what specific coordination practices (e.g. medical services, transportation, public housing) and policies are most successful for different patient populations, integration of mental and physical health care delivery systems can be designed in a more cost-effective way to overcome the barriers from stigma and limited health care access. In this project, we will first determine the effects of Community Benefit State Laws on racial and ethnic disparities in health care access, quality, and costs among people with mental illness (Aim 1). Within this context, we will further identify the variation of hospital-based adoption of care coordination practices and its correlation with patient and community level socio- demographics, local public health resources, and the extent of the implementation of community benefit laws (Aim 2); and determine the impact of care coordination practices between hospitals, communities, and public health agencies on racial and ethnic health disparities (Aim 3). We will use mixed methods: (1) we will construct a multi-level data set by linking multiple nationally representative data sets and use difference-in- differences approach to estimate the impact of system-level care coordination on different racial/ethnic groups; and (2) we will investigate challenges to implementing system-level coordination using focus groups of racial and ethnic minority patient representatives, hospital administrators and providers, and representatives from public health agencies. The proposed research is significant because (1) identified practices are expected to provide evidence on how to personalize mental health care coordination for racial and ethnic minority patients to address heterogeneous preferences in mental health treatment; (2) identified system-level care coordination practices are expected to be cost-effective, which in turn can make the coordination sustainable for underserved populations. Our results are expected to break down longstanding silos and bridge the gap between health care providers, community based organizations, social service agencies, and the public health sector delivery system, in addition to providing evidence to reduce health disparities through care coordination. Narrative The proposed research is relevant to public health because results will help us identify the specific sets of system-level care coordination practices (e.g., integrating physical and behavioral health, tracking readmissions, sharing clinical information across health sectors, mental health prevention interventions, transportation, public housing) that work best for minority populations with mental illness and provide evidence to reduce health disparities through care coordination across health care sectors. This timely study will inform the critical role of system-level care coordination in emerging health policy initiatives under the Affordable Care Act and a call for comprehensive mental health care reform. Thus, the proposed research is relevant to the NIMHD’s mission (PAR-16-221) to “conduct system-level health services research that can directly contribute to improve minority health and/or reduce health disparities in health care settings”.",Effects of Hospital-Community-Public Health Integration on Racial and Ethnic Disparities in Mental Health,9527183,R01MD011523,"['Adoption ', ' Mental disorders ', ' psychological disorder ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Communities ', ' health care delivery ', ' health services delivery ', ' Healthcare Delivery ', ' Ethnic group ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Health Personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health workforce ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Health Policy ', ' healthcare policy ', ' health care policy ', ' Health Resources ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' treatment access ', ' health services availability ', ' health service access ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' accessibility to health services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Access to Care ', ' Health Services Research ', ' services research ', ' Medical Care Research ', ' Health Services Evaluation ', ' Health Status ', ' Level of Health ', ' Hospital Administrators ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Hospitals ', ' Community Hospitals ', ' Laws ', ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mentally Ill Persons ', ' Mentally Ill ', ' Mental Patients ', ' Methods ', ' Mission ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Patient Representative ', ' Patients ', ' Public Health ', ' Public Housing ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Social Values ', ' Social Work ', ' Social Service ', ' Target Populations ', ' Time ', ' Transportation ', ' Work ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Latino ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Medical ', ' Healthcare Reform ', ' Health Reform ', ' Health Care Reform ', ' Link ', ' Individual ', ' Policies ', ' root ', ' Plant Roots ', ' programs ', ' Source ', ' System ', ' physical conditioning ', ' physical health ', ' Health Care Sector ', ' Healthcare Sector ', ' Services ', ' preference ', ' experience ', ' health care model ', ' Hospital Readmission ', ' readmission ', ' Modeling ', ' behavioral health ', ' response ', ' social stigma ', ' stigma ', ' Provider ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Address ', ' Health system ', ' Data ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Preventative intervention ', ' Community Health ', ' minority health ', ' cost ', ' underserved people ', ' under served population ', ' Underserved Population ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' cost-effective ', ' cost effective ', ' Population ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' ethnic minority ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' demographics ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' patient population ', ' population health ', ' social health determinants ', ' community partnership ', ' ethnic health disparity ', ' racial minority ', ' reduce disparity ', ' disparity reduction ', ' Obamacare ', ' Affordable Care Act ', ' healthcare settings ', ' health care settings ', ' patient engagement ', ' coordinating care ', ' care coordination ', ' ']",NIMHD,"UNIV OF MARYLAND, COLLEGE PARK",R01,2018,432111,0.0887779572828247
"Racial disparities in pediatric psychiatric emergencies: A Health systems approach Project Summary (30 lines) Less than half of the nine million children in the U.S. with a severe mental disorder ultimately receive care. This under-treatment occurs more among African American than among white children. Alarmingly, when they do receive psychiatric care, African American children appear in the emergency department (ED) 11% more than do whites. This relative reliance on the ED is not justified based on racial differences in mental health prevalence or need, and (for African Americans) portends poorly managed symptoms and increased disease severity into adulthood. Despite this racial disparity in children's psychiatric ED visits, no research examines whether “supply side” expansions over time in mental health services reduces this disparity. Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs) represent one dynamic aspect of the health system that focus on low-income populations. Psychiatric encounters for African American children seen in FQHCs, moreover, increased by over 31% from 2006-2011. This rapid expansion of care, as well as changes in the supply of mental health professionals, may reduce African American children's reliance on the ED. This issue requires further study given that previous expansions of primary care for low-income populations (e.g., Medicaid in Massachusetts and Oregon) show mixed results—especially in failing to reduce disparities. It is plausible but it remains unknown whether increasing FQHCs can treat previously untreated mentally ill African American children. Our project will merge data on FQHCs, county mental health professionals and all children's psychiatric ED visits (including mood, behavioral disorders, suicide attempts) for ten populous states that report all-payer ED data. We will retrieve county-level data (e.g., minority children served in FQHCs, mental health providers) from the Uniform Data System and other proprietary sources. Data on children's psychiatric ED visits will come from the Health Care Utilization Project. The large dataset (~1.4 million visits) collected across 437 counties and six years (2006-2011) provides substantial place and time variation in FQHC penetration. Importantly, we will also link multiple ED records within child to examine whether patterns of psychiatric ED care (i.e., repeat “treat and release”) decline following expansions in FQHC and mental health providers. Our rigorous identification strategy will control for state and county-level factors (e.g., Medicaid expansion, Mental Health Parity and Addition Equity Act) that affect help seeking. Results, consistent with goals of NIMH, are expected to advance the knowledge base on how features of FQHCs and the health system affect the delivery of psychiatric services to minorities. Our analyses, moreover, will directly inform health policy given that federal allocation of resources to combat disparities crucially depends on group-level results. Even a precisely estimated null result would amplify calls to focus financing and research on “demand-side” factors for African-Americans' help-seeking and efforts to coordinate referrals and follow-up care in low-income settings. Project Narrative (Relevance to Public Health 3 sentences) The proposed work directly tests whether expansions in community health centers and mental health provider supply reduces African American children's disproportionate use of the ED for psychiatric care. Our project may ultimately assist in targeting health policy interventions at the systems level to reduce ED overcrowding by augmenting primary care options. In addition, results will hold direct policy implications in determining the extent to which the $11 billion in annual investments in federally qualified health centers, from a disparities reduction perspective, is justified.",Racial disparities in pediatric psychiatric emergencies: A Health systems approach,9458796,R21MH110815,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', '

"Mechanisms Underlying Racial/Ethnic Disparities in Mental Disorders ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  As part of the Affordable Health Care Act, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) must develop and evaluate an action plan to reduce racial/ethnic health disparities, including increased preventive care and investments in community health teams that can benefit minority communities. But for such a plan to be effective, thoughtful targeting is needed. The proposed research has the potential to build a solid research foundation for developing interventions to achieve mental health equity that could be implemented as part of the HHS agenda to reduce disparities. Nearly 40% of the US population develops a mental disorder in their lifetime, with racial/ethnic minority groups at particularly high risk of severe-persistent mental disorders and untreated mental illness. But fundamental questions remain unanswered given that few studies investigate the mechanisms that underlie these disparities. The research proposed here aims to attend to this knowledge gap by examining four sets of mechanisms hypothesized to play important roles in causing racial/ethnic disparities in mental disorders: (1) low socio-economic status (SES); 2) childhood adversities (e.g., maltreatment, family violence); (3) disadvantaged role constellations (e.g., early child-bearing, divorce); and (4) disadvantaged neighborhood context (e.g., residential segregation, concentrated disadvantage). We propose to study four mechanisms by carrying out secondary analysis of community epidemiological data across five surveys that provide unparalleled information about the lifetime onset of a wide range of these lifetime disorders, and disparities in the persistence and severity of these disorders once they occur. We also examine barriers to mental health care since untreated mental illness has devastating effect on minority communities. But because empirical findings typically do not bridge the distance between the people who produce the information and the people who could use the information, our last aim identifies how best to frame and use our research results as actionable targets for Intervention and/or policy change. We will work with community, consumer, and policy groups to generate recommendations for prevention, service, and policy interventions aimed at reducing racial/ethnic disparities in mental health outcomes and services. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed study investigates differential mechanisms that might help explain ethnic/racial disparities in mental health outcomes and in service delivery and to integrate these findings with processes for generating projected solutions. We propose to work iteratively with community, consumer and policymaker partners to interpret, further integrate, and generate potential recommendations for interventions and/or policy proposals that can address the identified disparities.",Mechanisms Underlying Racial/Ethnic Disparities in Mental Disorders,9382904,R01MD009719,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Mental

"Lay Health Worker Mobilization to Address Disparities in Parent Training Services Project Summary/ Abstract The proposed K01 Mentored Research Scientist Development Award will provide the applicant with advanced training and skills to launch an independent research program focused on developing and evaluating implementation interventions that reduce mental health (MH) disparities for ethnically diverse families. This K01 proposal seeks to develop an evidence base for leveraging Lay Health Workers (LHW), community members without formalized MH training, to address determinants of MH disparities related to client demand for and the supply of behavioral parent training (BPT) programs in underserved communities. The community- partnered development and pilot evaluation of the LHW Enhancing Engagement for Parents (LEEP) implementation intervention will train LHW to conduct outreach and promote treatment engagement and skill acquisition for Latino families in Parent-Child Interaction Therapy (PCIT). Aim 1 of the study will assess the current context of LHW mobilization in children's evidence-based service delivery in community MH agencies through qualitative interviews with agency leaders and LHW, and quantitative surveys of LHW. Mixed-method analyses of these data will inform the development of LEEP. In Aim 2, the applicant will partner with community stakeholders to develop an implementation plan, structure, and process materials (e.g., fidelity measures) for LEEP. Aim 3 will pilot LEEP within an effectiveness/implementation hybrid design. Qualitative and quantitative data will inform the evaluation of LEEP including its feasibility, acceptability, and effects on client engagement, clinical outcomes, and implementation outcomes. The proposed study is well suited to the community setting and expertise the applicant brings to the project. Los Angeles County Department of MH (LACDMH) has invested considerable efforts in the implementation of evidence-based practices, including PCIT. The applicant's postdoctoral fellowship focused a MH policy reform within LACDMH, providing her insight into this large system of care. To meet her career objectives and the aims of this research project, the applicant requires additional training in: (1) implementation and health services research methodology to measure and reduce MH disparities; (2) application of implementation strategies and theories to inform the development of interventions to address supply and demand determinants of disparities; (3) approaches to improve parental entry into and engagement in treatment. Mentorship and consultation from primary sponsor, Dr. Jeanne Miranda (MH disparity reduction), co-sponsor, Dr. Anna Lau (MH disparities, implementation science), Dr. John Landsverk (implementation science), Dr. Lisa Saldana (economic evaluations of implementation efforts), Dr. Maryam Kia-Keating (community-partnered research, LHW models), Dr. Camille Nebeker (LHW training, responsible conduct of research), Dr. Emily Winslow (parent engagement), Dr. Karen Nylund-Gibson (multilevel statistical models) and Dr. Susan Ettner (health economics) will facilitate this training. Project Narrative The objective of this proposal is to develop an implementation intervention that leverages Lay Health Workers (LHW), community members without formalized mental health training, to increase the entry into and engagement in evidence-based behavioral parent training (BPT) programs for low-income, Latino as a strategy to reduce mental health disparities.

"The influence of intersections of race, gender, and sexual orientation discrimination for the mental health of LGB youth and adults Project Summary/Abstract  Mental illness costs the United States 1.93 billion in lost earnings per year and suicide, which often occurs in the context of mental health problems, is the 10th highest cause of death leading to an estimated 40,000 deaths annually. Lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) adults are twice as likely as heterosexual adults to have been diagnosed with a mental health disorder. Additionally, 60% of LGB adolescents compared to 26% of heterosexual adolescents report feeling sad and hopeless for most days in a two-week period. Thus, LGB youth and adults are disproportionally affected by these economic and mortality issues. Mental health disparities within the LGB population differ by race, gender, and sexual identity. Understanding health disparities among sexual minorities is a critical health imperative and focus the National Institutes of Health. The link between gender, race, sexual identity discrimination, underlying causes of health disparities, and mental health is an urgent concern for researchers and health care professionals. Few studies explore how gender, race and sexual identity discriminatory experiences are independently and concurrently associated with mental health trajectories in the LGB population. This Predoctoral Fellowship to Promote Diversity in Health-Related Research (F31-Diversity) would allow the applicant to address this gap through his research and training plan.  The main objective of Mr. Mallory’s project is to understand how race, gender, and sexual identity discrimination independently and in different combinations are associated with mental health trajectories. He will accomplish this objective with two aims: (Aim 1) elucidating the individual longitudinal associations between race, gender, and sexual identity discrimination and mental health trajectories for LGB youth and adults and (Aim 2) testing three competing explanations of how multiple forms of discrimination jointly to impact trajectories of mental health for LGB youth and adults. The competing explanations are that discrimination is (1) additive: for each additional form of discrimination, mental health will incrementally worsen; (2) exacerbating: mental health symptoms are two and three times worse when experiencing two and three forms of discrimination; and (3) inuring: mental health does not worsen beyond one form of discrimination.  To accomplish the objective and aims of his proposed research plan Mr. Mallory will seek out additional training in analyzing large longitudinal data sets with complex data structures, learning population health and life course theoretical perspectives, and applying an intersectional framework to his research which will augment his core training in Human Development and Family Sciences. His training plan combines formal coursework in population health and statistics, workshops that integrate method, theory, and analysis for analyzing quantitative data from an intersectional framework, one-on-one mentoring, conference presentations, and publishing research to prepare him for a career as an independent researcher. Project Narrative  This study examines how gender, race, and sexual identity discrimination independently and together are associated with LGB youth and adults trajectories of mental health. The results have implications for understanding mental health outcomes and targeting treatment for LGB youth and adults. This project is relevant to public health in the area of health disparities and mental health among LGB youth and adults.","The influence of intersections of race, gender, and sexual orientation discrimination for the mental health of LGB youth and adults",9611653,F31MH115608,"['Accounting ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Mental disorders ', ' psychological disorder ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Cities ', ' Cross-Sectional Studies ', ' Disease Frequency Surveys ', ' Cross-Sectional Survey ', ' Cross-Sectional Analyses ', ' Cross Sectional Analysis ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Economics ', ' Family ', ' Fellowship ', ' Health ', ' Human Development ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Learning ', ' Life Cycle Stages ', ' life course ', ' Life Cycle ', ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' mortality ', ' Persons ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' Population Statistics ', ' Probability Samples ', ' Public Health ', ' Publishing ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Science ', ' Social support ', ' social support network ', ' statistics ', ' Stress ', ' Suicide ', ' suicidality ', ' intent to die ', ' fatal suicide ', ' fatal attempt ', ' Suicide attempt ', ' suicidal attempt ', ' nonfatal attempt ', ' non fatal attempt ', ' Testing ', ' Texas ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', ' symposium ', ' symposia ', ' summit ', ' convention ', ' conference ', ' Youth ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Sickness Cost ', ' Disease Costs ', ' Cost of Illness ', ' base ', ' career ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Adolescent ', ' Sexual Orientation ', ' Sex Orientation ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Workshop ', ' Educational workshop ', ' Funding ', ' Shapes ', ' Depressed mood ', ' sadness ', ' depressed ', ' Consensus ', ' Complex ', ' early experience ', ' experience ', ' stressor ', ' austin ', ' Structure ', ' Prevention ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Deterioration ', ' Sampling ', ' boys ', ' girls ', ' social stress ', ' theories ', ' Adverse effects ', ' treatment adverse effect ', ' therapy adverse effect ', ' side effect ', ' Treatment Side Effects ', ' Latina ', ' Latinas ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' High Prevalence ', ' National Institute of Child Health and Human Development ', ' NICHD ', ' Population Research ', ' Population-level research ', ' Population-based research ', ' Research Training ', ' Subgroup ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' feelings ', ' Feeling ', ' Heterosexuals ', ' Healthcare professional ', ' Health Care Professional ', ' Health Professional ', ' lost earning ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' predoctoral ', ' predoc ', ' pre-doc ', ' pre-doctoral ', ' modifiable risk ', ' population health ', ' sexual minority ', ' lesbian, gay, bisexual ', ' race disparity ', ' disparities in race ', ' racial disparity ', ' rate of change ', ' Data Scientist ', ' Data Science ', ' longitudinal data set ', ' longitudinal dataset ', ' intersectionality ', ' ']",NIMH,"UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS, AUSTIN",F31,2018,41089,0.08849521351604545
"A trauma informed intervention to improve mental health and school success for urban eighth graders ABSTRACT. Approximately half of all 14-17 years olds in the U.S. are estimated to be victims of physical assault; chronic stress and trauma exposure are particularly prevalent for youth growing up in high-crime urban communities. Emotion regulation difficulties due to stress and trauma exposure contribute to disparities in mental health problems and school failure, with low-income and African American youth at much higher risk than their higher-income, White counterparts. Schools serving high-crime communities, however, do not offer universal trauma-informed strategies to support student success. RAP Club is a school-based group prevention program aimed at improving emotion regulation and decision-making in urban upper middle school students to improve their transition to high school. The program fills key gaps in current school practices, including a trauma-informed approach, universal delivery to all students without pre-screening, transdiagnostic effects on internalizing problems as well as behavioral issues, and a focus on upper middle school students. Our team adapted RAP Club from Structured Psychotherapy for Adolescents Responding to Chronic Stress (SPARCS), a group treatment for adolescents based on empirically supported mindfulness and cognitive- behavioral techniques. Using a novel delivery method, RAP Club is co-facilitated by school mental health personnel and young adult community members to promote student engagement. In our NIMH-funded pilot research, the program improved classroom behavior, social functioning, and academic competence. The program improved outcomes for students at varying levels of baseline distress—even low levels—suggesting its appropriateness as a universal model. Building on that work, the proposed R01 trial will test whether urban eighth grade students randomly assigned to RAP Club show improved emotional, behavioral, and academic outcomes in eighth and ninth grades compared to those assigned to Healthy Topics, a health education control group. Intervention and control programs will each be delivered by different school personnel with co- facilitation by young adult community members. The research will be conducted in 32 Baltimore City Public Schools serving urban communities with high rates of violence exposure. We will collect teacher- and student- reported data on student self-regulation, emotional functioning, classroom behavior, and academic performance at pre- and post-intervention and 4-month follow up, as well as student data at 12-month follow up. We will gather school record data on academic indicators in the year before, year of, and year following study participation. We will evaluate factors relevant to program implementation and potential sustainability, including stakeholder perspectives and cost data. The RAP Club model of trauma-informed, universal support has potential for widespread dissemination in school districts serving disadvantaged youth nationwide. The proposed randomized controlled trial will evaluate the effects of RAP Club, an evidence-based trauma-informed intervention, on eighth graders in an urban school district characterized by high rates of violence and trauma exposure. Schools serving youth in trauma-affected communities currently lack universal, trauma-informed approaches for promoting mental health and school success in upper middle school students prior to high school entry. RAP Club has potential to reduce risk for emotional, behavioral, and academic problems in our most vulnerable young people across the nation, with significant implications for reducing disparities in achievement and health.",A trauma informed intervention to improve mental health and school success for urban eighth graders,9563989,R01HD090022,"['Achievement ', ' Achievement Attainment ', ' Adolescence ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' assault ', ' Baltimore ', ' Behavior ', ' Biometry ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Biometrics ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Cities ', ' Communities ', ' Control Groups ', ' Cost Analysis ', ' cost assessment ', ' assess cost ', ' Cost Analyses ', ' Professional counselor ', ' Counselor ', ' Crime ', ' Data Reporting ', ' data representation ', ' Decision Making ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Family ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health education ', ' Health Tutoring ', ' Health Instruction ', ' Income ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Methods ', ' Mission ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' NIMH ', ' Occupations ', ' Professional Positions ', ' Jobs ', ' Perception ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Poverty ', ' Psychologist ', ' Psychotherapy ', ' Public Health ', ' Records ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Schools ', ' Informal Social Control ', ' Self Regulation ', ' Social Workers ', ' medical specialties ', ' Specialty ', ' Standardization ', ' Stress ', ' Students ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Testing ', ' Unemployment ', ' unemployed ', ' out of work ', ' joblessness ', ' jobless ', ' Violence ', ' violent behavior ', ' violent ', ' Work ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Competence ', ' depressive symptoms ', ' depressive ', ' depression symptom ', ' Emotional Depression ', ' Youth ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Adolescent ', ' Link ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' teacher ', ' Failure ', ' Distress ', ' Trust ', ' young adulthood ', ' adult youth ', ' young adult ', ' Funding ', ' behavioral problem ', ' Problem behavior ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' Shapes ', ' Nature ', ' programs ', ' Event ', ' Techniques ', ' inner city ', ' Services ', ' mental health personnel ', ' Performance ', ' success ', ' high school ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Prevention program ', ' member ', ' seventh grade ', ' 7th grade ', ' eighth grade ', ' 8th grade ', ' ninth grade ', ' high school freshman ', ' 9th grade ', ' Human Resources ', ' personnel ', ' Manpower ', ' Academic achievement ', ' physical assault ', ' physical attack ', ' positive youth development ', ' Emotional ', ' Modeling ', ' Adolescent Development ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Low income ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Address ', ' Child Mental Health ', ' Symptoms ', ' Chronic stress ', ' Data ', ' National Institute of Child Health and Human Development ', ' NICHD ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Cognitive ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' Behavioral ', ' active control ', ' post intervention ', ' cost ', ' Social Functioning ', ' Outcome ', ' scale up ', ' childhood traumatic stress ', ' Child Traumatic Stress ', ' aged ', ' Trauma ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' seventeen years of age ', ' seventeen year old ', ' age 17 years ', ' 17 years of age ', ' 17 year old ', ' implementation science ', ' emotional regulation ', ' emotion regulation ', ' high risk ', ' evidence base ', ' group intervention ', ' mindfulness ', ' screening ', ' Junior High Student ', ' Junior High School Student ', ' Middle School Student ', ' Prevention trial ', ' anxious symptom ', ' anxiety symptoms ', ' behavior outcome ', ' behavioral outcome ', ' student motivation ', ' student engagement ', ' student participation ', ' school district ', ' treatment group ', ' improved outcome ', ' neighborhood disadvantage ', ' reduce disparity ', ' disparity reduction ', ' trauma symptom ', ' urban school ', ' urban underserved ', ' recruit ', ' exposure to trauma ', ' trauma exposure ', ' exposure to violence ', ' violence exposure ', ' ']",NICHD,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,513551,0.022334204304437208
"Distribution of Child Mental Health Workforce and Health Care for Children with Autism ABSTRACT  It has become an increasingly important public health issue to meet the needs of children with autism and other autism-spectrum disorders (ASDs), which are complex developmental disorders characterized by repetitive behavior and delayed social interaction and communication. Studies have indicated that the prevalence of ASDs among children has more than doubled during the past decade. Recent studies have also found substantial unmet mental health (MH) care needs among children with ASDs. While multiple factors contribute to the unmet needs, one important contributing factor is likely an insufficient child MH workforce, especially a “critical shortage” of child psychiatrists. Yet no work has been done to understand whether MH care is more accessible and patient experience and satisfaction are better for children with autism in areas with higher supply of child MH workforce than in those areas with lower supply.  To fill the gap, this study is designed to provide timely empirical evidence of the consequences of child MH workforce supply on MH care for children with autism. Our specific aims are:  Aim 1. Examine the relationship between the child MH workforce supply, by discipline, and access to, utilization of, and experience and satisfaction with mental health care for children with autism.  Aim 2. Examine the relationship between the child MH workforce supply, by discipline, and family burden of children with autism.  Aim 3. Examine whether the effects of child mental health workforce supply on mental health care access, satisfaction, and family burden differ by race and ethnicity or between rural and urban residence.  The proposed project is innovative because (1) unlike previous studies, we will examine the supply of multiple disciplines simultaneously, and (2) our structural, econometric model of physician entry and market structure is explicitly causal, thus providing an answer to the most common objections to the methods typically used in the previous studies of association between physician supply and geographic variations in health care.  The proposed research is highly significant for multiple reasons. First, without an adequate supply of MH providers, the current efforts to strengthen the public health impact of NIMH supported dissemination of research-tested interventions would not be able to achieve optimal effects. Second, some experts have called for more empirical studies of the challenging issue of insufficient and maldistributed supply of child MH workforce. This proposed study responds to the call, and it will generate empirical evidence that will provide policymakers critical information as they address this challenging issue. To our knowledge, the proposed project will be the first to assess how MH workforce supply affects mental health care access, satisfaction and family burden for children with autism. It will also be the first study to examine whether MH workforce supply ameliorates or exacerbates existing disparities in MH health care among this group of children. Despite the growth of research on children with autism, there is still a lack of studies examining how the supply of mental health workforce affects this group of children's mental health care access, utilization, and satisfaction, and their family burden. The proposed project will use large national datasets covering a recent 15-year period to examine these issues and fill the gaps in the literature.",Distribution of Child Mental Health Workforce and Health Care for Children with Autism,9567224,R01MH112760,"['Affect ', ' Autistic Disorder ', "" Kanner's Syndrome "", ' Infantile Autism ', ' Early Infantile Autism ', ' Autism ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child health care ', ' child healthcare ', ' Complement ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Expenditure ', ' Family ', ' Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Health Personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health workforce ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' treatment access ', ' health services availability ', ' health service access ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' accessibility to health services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Access to Care ', ' Insurance ', ' Literature ', ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health Services ', ' Mental Hygiene Services ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' NIMH ', ' Parents ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Psychiatrist ', ' Psychologist ', ' Public Health ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Research ', ' Research Support ', ' Social Interaction ', ' Social Workers ', ' medical specialties ', ' Specialty ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Waiting Lists ', ' waitlist ', ' Work ', ' Econometric Models ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Underinsured ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Caring ', ' child mental health service ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Discipline ', ' Individual ', ' satisfaction ', ' Early Intervention ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Empirical Research ', ' Life ', ' Insurance Coverage ', ' Insurance Status ', ' Complex ', ' System ', ' Services ', ' preference ', ' experience ', ' care seeking ', ' Structure ', ' response ', ' social stigma ', ' stigma ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' developmental disease ', ' developmental disorder ', ' Provider ', ' geographic difference ', ' geographic variation ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' research data dissemination ', ' research dissemination ', ' Address ', ' Child Mental Health ', ' Symptoms ', ' autism spectrum disorder ', ' autistic spectrum disorder ', ' Data ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' dissemination research ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Prevalence ', ' social communication ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' cognitive enhancement ', ' repetitive behavior ', ' urban residence ', ' rural households ', ' rural residence ', ' ']",NIMH,RAND CORPORATION,R01,2018,444284,0.09273236210131885
"Exploring Pathways Among Discrimination and Health Among Somali Young Adults PROJECT SUMMARY Immigrant groups in the United States have long experienced challenges to community inclusion and participation such as experiences of discrimination and victimization. Today, however, we are experiencing unprecedented levels of such experiences. For Somali young adults, who are black, Muslim immigrants, these experiences may be linked to their race, religion or migration status. This has been compounded by historical and recent events linked to aspects of Somali identity and culture creating a socio-historical moment in which young Somalis face an unprecedented threat of discrimination and mistreatment. While there is growing evidence on the adverse effect of discrimination on health, less is known about the experiences of immigrant groups and the ways in which discrimination and experiences of racism across multiple sectors of public life relate to mental health and well-being; what factors mediate these relationships; and how immigrants themselves understand and make meaning of these experiences as well as their relationships to their mental health and well-being. This mixed-methods, community partnered, proposal builds on a decade-long Community Based Participatory Research program led by Dr. Ellis, and partnered with Dr. Lincoln and Ms. Abdi, a team of inter-disciplinary researchers, and leaders from Somali communities. Through this community- research partnership our team has developed unprecedented datasets: to our knowledge, we have the largest longitudinal empirical database of psychosocial factors and Somali youth in the world. The broad goal of this project is to expand our knowledge of the relationships among experiences of discrimination and health outcomes for young Somali adults and thus contribute to a research trajectory aimed at developing strategies and interventions to disrupt these associations and mitigate disparities in mental health and health outcomes experienced by immigrant young adults. This will be accomplished through three specific aims which first test a theoretical model of the associations between multiple co-occurring experiences of discrimination (i.e. daily discrimination, life events discrimination, discrimination by teachers, and negative interaction with police) and mental health (symptoms of PTSD, anxiety and depression, and substance use) in Wave 1 of our existing data set. Next we propose to test whether the theoretical model explaining the associations between co-occurring forms of discrimination, social marginalization and mental health developed in Aim 1explains symptoms of mental illness over time using multiple waves of data. Finally, we propose to conduct additional qualitative interviews in three U.S. cities to explore Somali young adults’ understanding of the health issues of concern to them and their communities, the ways they make meaning of experiences of discrimination and racism and how these relate to their health and well-being. Project Narrative Somali young adults in the United States face the triple challenge of discrimination and marginalization associated with race, religion and immigration status. We propose to build upon a long-standing CBPR partnership and our ongoing Somali Youth Risk and Resilience Study (SYRSS) to expand our inquiry to examine experiences of discrimination, risk and resilience factors, and their relationship to mental health outcomes.

"Amigas Latinas Motivando el Alma (ALMA): A Randomized Control Trial of an Intervention to Reduce Mental Health Disparities in Mexican Immigrant Women Project Summary Recent studies indicate that 30% of Latina women in the United States are living with clinically significant depressive and anxiety symptoms, and that these rates increase with time spent in the United States. Latina immigrants are particularly vulnerable to depression and anxiety due to the many social and economic stressors they face, including: high levels of poverty, low levels of education, family obligations, language barriers, and social isolation. Latina immigrants suffering from depression and anxiety are also less likely to access and utilize quality mental health care, due to lack of health insurance, few culturally and linguistically competent providers, and stigma associated with seeking mental health care. Community-based interventions that increase coping strategies and provide social support can help reduce mental health disparities among Mexican immigrant women. The proposed study aims to address National Institute of Health priorities by testing the efficacy of the Amigas Latinas Motivando el Alma (ALMA) intervention in a randomized waitlist control trial. ALMA is an 8-week program offered in a group format to teach women new coping strategies and enhance their social ties and social support to prevent and reduce their depression and anxiety. Aim 1 of the proposed study is to refine the ALMA intervention and study procedures to ensure they are culturally-relevant, using information gained from focus groups and cognitive interviews with Mexican immigrant women. Aim 2 is to determine the efficacy of the ALMA intervention to reduce depressive and anxiety symptoms using a randomized waitlist control study design. We will recruit women from community-based organizations serving Latino immigrants to participate in the program, which will be offered in community settings. We will assess process outcomes of recruitment, retention, fidelity, and participant satisfaction through observations and in- depth interviews with participants. We will assess the efficacy of the intervention by comparing changes in women’s depressive and anxiety symptoms in the intervention and waitlist control groups at four time points (pre-intervention, post-intervention, 3 months, 6 months). Aim 3 is to assess the potential impact of the intervention on both individual (stigma, stress, coping strategies) and interpersonal (social support, social ties) factors, and whether the impact of the intervention is mediated by these factors. The research team includes investigators in psychology, medicine, social work and public health, as well as community-based organizations serving Mexican immigrants. The study uses rigorous methods to test an innovative program that integrates both culturally relevant and evidenced-based strategies to address significant mental health disparities in a high-risk and underserved population. Findings will help inform future research and practice. Given the growth of the Latino population, identifying interventions that reduce mental health disparities among Mexican immigrant women can have a significant public health impact. Project Narrative Mexican immigrant women are at increased risk for poor mental health and have limited access to mental health care. This randomized control trial study will test whether an eight-week program to increase coping strategies and social support can prevent and reduce depression and anxiety among Mexican immigrant women in a community setting.",Amigas Latinas Motivando el Alma (ALMA): A Randomized Control Trial of an Intervention to Reduce Mental Health Disparities in Mexican Immigrant Women,9571124,R01MD012230,"['Anxiety ', ' Climate ', ' climatic ', ' Meteorological Climate ', ' Communities ', ' Control Groups ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Economics ', ' Face ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Faculty ', ' Family ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Health ', ' Health Priorities ', ' Immigration ', ' Health Insurance ', ' health insurance plan ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' interventions research ', ' interventional study ', ' interventional research ', ' intervention research ', ' Interview ', ' Language ', ' Linguistics ', ' Linguistic ', ' Medicine ', ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health Services ', ' Mental Hygiene Services ', ' Methods ', ' Mexico ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Politics ', ' Poverty ', ' Psychology ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Research Design ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Social isolation ', ' Social support ', ' social support network ', ' Social Work ', ' Social Service ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' Waiting Lists ', ' waitlist ', ' Washington ', ' Woman ', ' County ', ' Friends ', ' Measures ', ' depressive symptoms ', ' depressive ', ' depression symptom ', ' Emotional Depression ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Hispanics ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Latino ', ' Mediating ', ' base ', ' Procedures ', ' Area ', ' Series ', ' Link ', ' Ensure ', ' Individual ', ' healthcare utilization ', ' healthcare service utilization ', ' healthcare service use ', ' health care service use ', ' Health Care Utilization ', ' health care service utilization ', ' Mexican ', ' satisfaction ', ' Immigrant ', ' programs ', ' Educational Background ', ' Education Level ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' interest ', ' experience ', ' stressor ', ' Participant ', ' Prevention program ', ' treatment program ', ' member ', ' social ', ' Intervention Trial ', ' Interventional trial ', ' social stigma ', ' stigma ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Latina ', ' Latinas ', ' Provider ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Address ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Stress and Coping ', ' Cognitive ', ' Process ', ' post intervention ', ' underserved people ', ' under served population ', ' Underserved Population ', ' therapy efficacy ', ' therapeutically effective ', ' therapeutic efficacy ', ' intervention efficacy ', ' Treatment Efficacy ', ' Outcome ', ' coping ', ' Population ', ' migration ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' clinical significance ', ' clinically significant ', ' participatory action research ', ' community based research ', ' community based design ', ' community based participatory research ', ' treatment development ', ' intervention development ', ' develop therapy ', ' therapy development ', ' community setting ', ' control trial ', ' effective intervention ', ' evidence base ', ' efficacy testing ', ' compare efficacy ', ' comparative efficacy ', ' anxious symptom ', ' anxiety symptoms ', ' family support ', ' healthcare disparity ', ' disparity in healthcare ', ' disparity in care ', ' health care disparity ', ' stress symptom ', ' high risk group ', ' high risk population ', ' recruit ', ' service providers ', ' exposure to violence ', ' violence exposure ', ' ']",NIMHD,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2018,645959,0.02189400793948826
"Improving Child Mental Health Service Utilization in Ibadan Nigeria Using a Community Based Participatory Research Approach Summary/ Abstract In a lower middle-income country (LMIC) such as Nigeria where child and adolescent mental health (CAMH) services are available but limited, guardians’ willingness to utilize accessible treatment for their children is pivotal to ensuring that their mental health (MH) needs are met in a timely manner. However, it remains unclear how socio-cultural and individual factors interact in complex ways to influence guardians’ decision to utilize the few CAMH services that are accessible. A theoretical framework is crucial for guiding the development of interventions that strategically address barriers to care. Community-based participatory (CBP) approaches that engage parents in the conception, development, and delivery of interventions have been established in various settings yet implementing such methods have been difficult in regions where rigorous process and outcome evaluations are lacking. Notwithstanding the dearth of current MH services in Nigeria, an anticipatory understanding of factors that influence guardians’ willingness to utilize accessible services for their children with MH needs will provide critical direction for the development of theoretically driven and locally based interventions that optimize CAMH care in regions where MH services remain underutilized. Therefore, our research teams from Howard University (HU) and the University of Ibadan (UI) will identify determinants of guardians’ willingness to utilize accessible CAMH services for their children in Ibadan, Nigeria. The scientific aims of this 3-year study are to: (Aim 1) empirically test the CAMH Help Seeking Model developed by the UI research team that explains the interactive pathways of socio-cultural and individual factors that influence guardians’ willingness to utilize accessible MH services for their children at the University College Hospital in Ibadan (UCH). To meet this aim, a stratified two-stage cluster sample of 250 adult guardians of children 5 to 19-years-old living within 25km from UCH will be interviewed with standardized measures; and to (Aim 2) develop and evaluate a community-based participatory intervention that will be principally guided by the model we test and confirm in Aim 1. To meet this second aim, ten guardian consultants will co-develop and co- implement a group intervention whose goal is to increase 100 guardians’ willingness to use accessible services at UCH. Results from this study will empirically identify pathways that influence guardians’ willingness to utilize accessible CAMH services and help guide strategies to reduce CAMH disparities in LMICs. In addition, the current study will address a critical need to strengthen the methodological rigor of CBP programming that aims to reduce MH disparities in LMICs such as Nigeria by developing and evaluating a community intervention that is theoretically informed and locally-implemented by guardians. Ultimately, this study will enhance the global MH research infrastructure and student mentoring capacity in the Department of Psychology at Howard and will further provide the groundwork for a larger follow-up collaborative study with UI to evaluate the scalability and sustainability of a CBP intervention that addresses CAMH help-seeking behavior.

"Improving Satisfaction, Engagement and Clinical Outcomes Among Traditionally Underserved Children Through Cultural Formulation Project Summary/Abstract Economically disadvantaged and ethnic/racial minority children are more likely to suffer from disruptive behavior problems than their middle-to-upper-income Caucasian counterparts, yet they are less likely to receive quality care and are more likely to drop out of treatment services. Disparities in the reception of and engagement with mental health services suggests that standard mental health practices may not properly consider the unique issues and cultural context of child mental health problems in traditionally underserved families. Professional guidelines suggest that providing more culturally responsive services is one important method for increasing engagement in underserved population, however research on this front is quite limited. A broader patient-centered assessment of relevant cultural factors into evidence-based practices might yield improved care and maximize family engagement among traditionally underserved families. Initial research focused on adult populations has suggested that incorporating the Cultural Formulation Interview (CFI), a brief cultural assessment, as part of the baseline assessment can promote improved medical communication, leading to stronger rapport with the therapist, and overall patient satisfaction. Additionally, using critical culture- related information identified in the CFI to influence treatment planning for a given patient may lead to improved outcomes without the need to adapt a treatment for an entire population of individuals. To date, research on the benefits of augmenting usual mental health assessment with the CFI has only been conducted in the context of adult patients, and has yet to examine the potential for the CFI to improve treatment engagement in the context of children's mental health services. Further, studies on the CFI have only examined its impact on initial engagement and satisfaction with assessment services; research has yet to consider the effects of the CFI on prolonged engagement or clinical outcomes. Importantly, minority and economically disadvantaged families are disproportionately impacted by cultural, attitudinal, and stress-related barriers to care (i.e. stigma, ethnic identity, and daily stress). Research has yet to examine how these barriers may predict which families are more likely to benefit from the inclusion of the CFI. The current pilot study is being conducted within a large South Florida mental health network serving predominately low-income minority families obtaining parent training for early child behavior problems. Participating families (N=50) will be randomized at baseline to receive either the standard diagnostic and clinical assessment (DCA) or DCA+CFI. The dissertation pilot project will evaluate initial feasibility (Aim 1), and preliminary parent satisfaction, engagement in parent training, and clinical child outcomes (Aim 2). Further exploratory analyses will examine whether traditional barriers to care (i.e. stigma, ethnic identity, and daily stress) moderate the effects of the CFI on satisfaction, engagement and clinical outcomes (Aim 3).   Project Narrative This mental health research dissertation grant application will facilitate my development into an independent researcher who focuses on improving engagement and access to quality mental health care among high-risk and traditionally underserved populations (e.g., ethnic/racial minorities and economically disadvantages families). Specifically, the dissertation project at the center of this proposal will leverage a pilot randomized design to examine initial feasibility and preliminary effects of augmenting usual mental health evaluation procedures with a structured person-centered assessment tool that specifically considers the cultural context of patient mental health problems (i.e., the Cultural Formulation Interview; CFI) on parent satisfaction, engagement and clinical child outcomes in the treatment of early child behavior problems. Additional analyses will explore whether traditional barriers (e.g., stigma, ethnic identity, and daily stress) moderate the effects of the CFI on satisfaction, engagement and treatment outcomes. ","Improving Satisfaction, Engagement and Clinical Outcomes Among Traditionally Underserved Children Through Cultural Formulation",9548400,R36MH116677,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Behavior ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Behavior ', ' Communication ', ' Family ', ' Feasibility Studies ', ' Florida ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Grant ', ' Health Services Research ', ' services research ', ' Medical Care Research ', ' Health Services Evaluation ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Income ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Interview ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health Services ', ' Mental Hygiene Services ', ' Mentally Ill Persons ', ' Mentally Ill ', ' Mental Patients ', ' Methods ', ' Parents ', ' Client satisfaction ', ' Patient Satisfaction ', ' Patients ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Stress ', ' Caucasians ', ' white race ', ' Occidental ', ' Caucasoid Race ', ' Caucasoid ', ' Caucasian Race ', ' Caucasian ', ' Measures ', ' Treatment outcome ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Latino ', ' Youth ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Caring ', ' Guidelines ', ' child mental health service ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Fostering ', ' satisfaction ', ' Funding ', ' behavioral problem ', ' Problem behavior ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Diagnostic ', ' programs ', ' Services ', ' experience ', ' treatment planning ', ' Structure ', ' Economically Deprived Population ', ' underclass ', ' economically disadvantaged ', ' economic disadvantage ', ' Economically Deprived ', ' Reporting ', ' career development ', ' Quality of Care ', ' QOC ', ' social stigma ', ' stigma ', ' Drops ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Low income ', ' Child Mental Health ', ' Evidence based practice ', ' Applications Grants ', ' Grant Proposals ', ' Intake ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Monitor ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' underserved people ', ' under served population ', ' Underserved Population ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Minority ', ' Clinical assessments ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Individual Differences ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' early therapy ', ' Early treatment ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' patient centered ', ' patient oriented ', ' person centered ', ' high risk ', ' traditional care ', ' Assessment instrument ', ' Assessment tool ', ' Formulation ', ' improved outcome ', ' minority children ', ' racial minority ', ' ethnic identity ', ' reduce disparity ', ' disparity reduction ', ' healthcare disparity ', ' disparity in healthcare ', ' disparity in care ', ' health care disparity ', ' clinical diagnostics ', ' recruit ', ' treatment services ', ' obstacle to healthcare ', ' obstacle to care ', ' barrier to treatment ', ' barrier to healthcare ', ' barrier to health care ', ' barrier to care ', ' health assessment ', ' ']",NIMH,FLORIDA INTERNATIONAL UNIVERSITY,R36,2018,39968,0.09674349974882406
"Emerging Regulatory Capacity in Low-income Mexican American Children DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The identification of early life precursors to psychopathology in a high risk population has considerable promise for efforts to mitigate the public health burden of mental disorders. Hispanic children, members of the fastest growing ethnic group in the US, are more than twice as likely as non-Hispanic white children to be raised in poverty, and considerable research documents deleterious effects of poverty and ethnic minority status on brain development, stress physiology, development of social and emotional regulatory capacity, and lifespan mental and physical health. To better understand developmental precursors to psychopathology in very low- income ethnic minority children, we propose to capitalize on data collected by an NIMH-funded longitudinal study of Mexican American mothers and infants (""Las Madres Nuevas"") that addressed maternal mental health and mother-infant coregulation across the first two postpartum years. The proposed project will focus on the children from Las Madres Nuevas as they approach a critical developmental transition period (ages 3-6). We will chart trajectories of cognitive, emotional, social, and behavioral competence, with the goal of early identification and predication of points at which elevated risk for disorder emerges. Our project will focus on the emergence of self-regulatory skills from early life mother-infant coregulation as a central mechanism by which early life risk factors translate into lifespan health outcomes for low-income children. The development of self- regulatory ability is a critical foundation for lifespan mental health, but Hispanic children and children from disadvantaged environments are at risk of impaired self-regulatory skills as they enter kindergarten. Our scientific approach emphasizes the cultural embeddedness of development, with the view that child outcomes must be examined with attention to cultural forces that shape and give meaning to self-regulation and mental health. We also address the role of early life biological susceptibility in shaping children's developing regulatory skills. In combination, this project holds great potential to address central questions about cultural, biological, and environmental contributions to adaptive regulatory capacity; identify early precursors to psychopathology in a high risk ethnic group; and enhance opportunities for translation to treatment and prevention. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Children raised in poverty face significantly elevated risk for developmental deficits, behavioral and emotional health problems, and poor lifespan mental and physical health. Ethnic minority status compounds the risk, but little is known about mechanisms of risk or cultural-contextual factors that may mitigate risk. A central goal of this project is to unravel developmental pathways that lead to positive or negative adaptation for minority children in a high risk context, information critical for identifying modifiable targets for intervention and prevention programs.",Emerging Regulatory Capacity in Low-income Mexican American Children,9479635,R01HD083027,"['Acculturation ', ' Cultural Assimilation ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Attention ', ' Behavior ', ' Mental disorders ', ' psychological disorder ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Biological Factors ', ' Biologic Factor ', ' Birth ', ' Parturition ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Censuses ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Rearing ', ' childrearing ', ' Parenting behavior ', ' Parenting ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Emotions ', ' Environment ', ' Ethnic group ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Face ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Family ', ' Foundations ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Hydrocortisone ', ' Proctocort ', ' Nutracort ', ' Hytone ', ' Hydrocortone ', ' Eldecort ', ' Dermacort ', ' Cortril ', ' Cortispray ', ' Cortisol ', ' Cortenema ', ' Cortef ', ' Cort-Dome ', ' Cetacort ', ' Aeroseb-HC ', ' Immigration ', ' Income ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Infant ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Longevity ', ' lifespan ', ' life span ', ' Length of Life ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mexican Americans ', ' Chicanos ', ' Chicanas ', ' Mothers ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' NIMH ', ' Parents ', ' Physiology ', ' Poverty ', ' Psychopathology ', ' abnormal psychology ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Informal Social Control ', ' Self Regulation ', ' Social Development ', ' Socialization ', ' Stress ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' Translations ', ' Caucasians ', ' white race ', ' Occidental ', ' Caucasoid Race ', ' Caucasoid ', ' Caucasian Race ', ' Caucasian ', ' Adaptive Behaviors ', ' adaptive behavior ', ' adaptation behavior ', ' Competence ', ' Hispanics ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Postpartum Period ', ' post-partum ', ' Postpartum ', ' Biological ', ' Link ', ' Evaluation ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Predisposition ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' Individual ', ' Funding ', ' Immigrant ', ' Shapes ', ' Molds ', ' Filamentous Fungi ', ' Life ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' showing emotion ', ' expression of emotion ', ' emotional expression ', ' physical conditioning ', ' physical health ', ' contextual factors ', ' Application Context ', ' experience ', ' intervention program ', ' prenatal ', ' unborn ', ' skills ', ' Prevention program ', ' member ', ' disorder risk ', ' disease risk ', ' Prevention ', ' social ', ' Early identification ', ' Impulsivity ', ' Emotional ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' behavioral health ', ' kindergarten ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Low income ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Cognitive ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' Process ', ' Cardiac ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socio-economically ', ' socio-economic ', ' socioeconomics ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' resilience ', ' Outcome ', ' Impairment ', ' ethnic minority ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' high risk ', ' public health relevance ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' Biological Markers ', ' RDoC ', ' Research Domain Criteria ', ' minority children ', ' high risk group ', ' high risk population ', ' health of the mother ', ' ']",NICHD,ARIZONA STATE UNIVERSITY-TEMPE CAMPUS,R01,2018,465722,0.035446469903747814
"Medicare Policy Effects on Mental Health Care Disparities This project will assess the impact of recent Medicare policy changes on racial/ethnic disparities in mental health (MH) care. Medicare is the most common source of coverage for elderly and non-elderly disabled Americans with mental illness. Two recent policy changes have the potential to reduce wide disparities in access to mental health care, including care provided by primary care providers (PCPs) and specialty mental health providers (MHPs). Specifically, the Affordable Care Act (ACA) temporarily increased payments in 2013- 2014 by up to 25 percent for PCPs caring for Full Subsidy dual-eligible beneficiaries. Separately, the Medicare Improvements for Patients and Providers Act (MIPPA) gradually increased MHP payments (2009-2014) by up to 37 percent for Full Subsidy beneficiaries, and reduced beneficiary coinsurance for MHP visits from 50% to 20% for other beneficiaries (i.e., Partial Subsidy beneficiaries with incomes just above eligibility for Full Subsidies). In other settings, changes in provider payments and cost-sharing have been effective policy levers in modifying care utilization and access. In Medicare, these policies could reduce disparities by improving access to care for low-income income and Full Subsidy dual-eligibles, who are disproportionately racial/ethnic minorities; but there is little data on their effects. Despite the limited evidence, 34 states dropped PCP payment rates in 2015 (back to pre-2013 levels), while 16 states have continued the payment increase. We will use the natural experiments created by the ACA and MIPPA to assess the effects of these policy changes on racial/ethnic disparities in MH care within three sets of outcomes: Aim 1) medical care and quality process measures (e.g., outpatient visits to PCPs and MHPs for mental health diagnoses, antidepressant use in major depression); Aim 2) clinical events (e.g., emergency department visits and hospitalizations); and Aim 3) total and component medical spending. We will use comprehensive Medicare claims data (2006-2018) to compare longitudinal changes for Black, Hispanic, Asian, Native American and White beneficiaries affected vs. unaffected by the policies using a difference-in-difference approach with fixed effects (within-person) estimation. To estimate the effects of each policy, our identification strategy exploits the staggered implementation of each policy, differences across states in the magnitude of the payment changes based on baseline payment rates, and variations in exposure associated with eligibility for Full vs. Partial low-income subsidies. We will compare four resulting policy exposure groups: 1) beneficiaries affected by the PCP (2013- 2014) and MHP payment increases; 2) beneficiaries affected by the extended PCP (2013-2018) and MHP payment increases; 3) beneficiaries affected only by the MHP cost-sharing decrease; and 4) beneficiaries unaffected by either policy (concurrent controls). The findings from this study have the potential to inform decision-makers seeking to reduce the substantial disparities in MH care with actionable findings, especially as the federal government and states make ongoing decisions about payment policy and benefit design. Project Narrative The Federal Collaborative for Health Disparities Research has identified racial and ethnic disparities in mental health care access and treatment as a top area needing immediate national attention. Recently, the Medicare program implemented two policies that increased physician payments for care provided to the poorest beneficiaries and reduced beneficiary out-of-pocket costs for specialty mental health care.

"Mental Health Services for Infants/Toddlers Receiving Part C Early Intervention Project Summary/Abstract This R34 resubmission proposes to develop and examine a mental health service model for families of infants/toddlers with developmental delay that reduces risk for mental health problems, and in turn, enhances readiness for preschool. Infants/toddlers with developmental delay exhibit significantly higher rates of disruptive behaviors, peer problems, impulsivity, and academic failure. Their parents also are at elevated risk for mental health problems and child maltreatment. Families of infants/toddlers with developmental delay are more likely to live in poverty with limited access to services, and most receive government-funded, home- based Early Intervention (EI) services (i.e., Part C of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act). We propose to leverage the unique position of Infant-Toddler Developmental Specialists (ITDS), front-line providers of EI services, to support parent-infant/toddler interactions and reduce family risks for mental health problems. Based on a rich empirical literature, we selected Child-Directed Interaction (CDI), the first phase of Parent-Child Interaction Therapy, as an evidence-based intervention to increase positive parent-infant/toddler interactions and reduce negative interactions. CDI aligns with the training, role, and function of ITDS, and responds to the needs of referred families. We will collaborate with EI provider agencies toward a service model that emphasizes initial training, ongoing supervision, and quality assurance to facilitate infant/toddler mental health (social, emotional, behavioral competence) and parent mental health (anxiety/depression, parenting stress, caregiver strain). We will examine feasibility, fidelity, and acceptability of the proposed model to identify facilitators and barriers to service delivery, and we will examine its promise compared to services as usual (n = 4 agencies, 16 ITDS, 112 families). In light of the extensive needs and depleting resources faced by families of infants/toddlers with developmental delay, the proposed work provides a unique opportunity to enhance the natural role and capacity of a skilled EI workforce to provide high quality services that minimize mental health problems and facilitate healthy child and family trajectories. Project Narrative Infants/toddlers with developmental delay and their families are at significant risk for mental health problems and more likely to live in poverty. We are collaborating with Early Intervention providers toward a mental health service model to support parent-infant/toddler interactions, improve family mental health, and prepare toddlers for preschool. In light of increasing needs and decreasing resources, this research enhances the role and capacity of a skilled workforce to provide high quality services for vulnerable families, and hence carries potential for significant public health impact.",Mental Health Services for Infants/Toddlers Receiving Part C Early Intervention,9462671,R34MH110541,"['Anxiety ', ' Behavior ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Rearing ', ' childrearing ', ' Parenting behavior ', ' Parenting ', ' Communities ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Exhibits ', ' Family ', ' Government ', ' Disabled Persons ', ' individuals with disabilities ', ' disabled people ', ' disabled individual ', ' disabled ', ' Persons with Disabilities ', ' People with Disabilities ', ' Handicapped ', ' Disabled Population ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' treatment access ', ' health services availability ', ' health service access ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' accessibility to health services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Access to Care ', ' Health Services Research ', ' services research ', ' Medical Care Research ', ' Health Services Evaluation ', ' Infant ', ' Infant Health Services ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Literature ', ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health Services ', ' Mental Hygiene Services ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' NIMH ', ' Parent-Child Relations ', ' parent offspring interaction ', ' parent child interaction ', ' Parent-Child Relationship ', ' Parents ', ' Poverty ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Nursery Schools ', ' preschool ', ' pre-kindergarten ', ' pre-k ', ' Science ', ' Stress ', ' Supervision ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Developmental Delay Disorders ', ' Specific Child Development Disorders ', ' Developmental Delay ', ' Competence ', ' Mediating ', ' Specialist ', ' base ', ' quality assurance ', ' improved ', ' Distal ', ' Phase ', ' Training ', ' Failure ', ' Sample Size ', ' Early Intervention ', ' Funding ', ' Collaborations ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' Review Literature ', ' programs ', ' Adopted ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' Services ', ' experience ', ' peer ', ' Toddler ', ' social ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' Impulsivity ', ' Emotional ', ' Modeling ', ' Caregiver Burden ', ' caregiver stress ', ' care giver stress ', ' Care giver Burden ', ' Provider ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Readiness ', ' Preparedness ', ' child maltreatment ', ' Childhood maltreatment ', ' Child Abuse and Neglect ', ' underrepresentation of minorities ', ' under-represented minority ', ' under-representation of minorities ', ' Underrepresented Ethnic Minority ', ' Underrepresented Minority ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' Evidence based intervention ', ' infant outcome ', ' service intervention ', ' provider intervention ', ' evidence base ', ' community partnership ', ' care giver strain ', ' caregiver strain ', ' healthcare delivery model ', ' care delivery model ', ' Service model ', ' Service delivery model ', ' service delivery ', ' ']",NIMH,FLORIDA INTERNATIONAL UNIVERSITY,R34,2018,219750,0.15918603972051615
"Racial discrimination and mental health: Temporal dynamics and neurocognitive moderators 7. Project Summary/Abstract Long-term Objectives: African Americans routinely experience both subtle and overt racism and discrimination in their daily lives, which contributes to both physical and mental race-related health disparities. The proposed project seeks to extend understanding of the relationship between racial discrimination (RD) and psychological distress, as well as identify neurocognitive moderators that may function as vulnerability factors in the experience of negative psychological consequences of RD. The applicant's long-term goal is to establish a research program that investigates the cognitive, affective, and behavioral consequences of discrimination among members of minority groups, with a focus on health disparities related to race in the US and identifying interventions to mitigate the negative effect of discrimination. Specific Aims: The proposed project will combine a ecological momentary assessment (EMA) approach with an experimental lab component to 1) repeatedly measure experiences of racial discrimination (RD) and psychological distress in near real time, allowing the applicant to examine temporal precedence in the relationship between RD and psychological distress (Aim 1); and 2) examine attention to threat as a neurocognitive moderator that may function as a vulnerability factor in this relationship (Aim 2). Method: African American college students will complete three laboratory tasks during which EEG is recorded to assess attentional processes elicited by different types of threat. Participants will then report incidents of RD, momentary affect, anxiety, and depression-related symptoms (i.e., psychological distress) in near-real time using smartphones over the course of 4 weeks. Significance: The proposed project integrates a lab-based psychophysiological approach with an EMA approach to incorporate reliable measures of individual differences in neurocognitive attentional processes with tests of temporal associations between experiences of RD and psychological distress. Integration of the tightly controlled environment of the lab to measure individual differences with the ecological validity of EMA permits a much richer and more detailed analysis of the associations between RD, psychological distress, and neurocognitive moderators than has been possible in previous research on this topic. 8. Project Narrative Subtle, everyday experiences of racial discrimination are common among African Americans in the US and are associated with negative physical and mental health consequences. Existing research on racial discrimination and mental health relies heavily on cross-sectional and retrospective self-report measures, limiting researchers' ability to make causal inferences about the relationship between discrimination and mental health. Investigating the temporal dynamics of this relationship to establish causal precedence, as well as identifying neurocognitive vulnerability factors that may moderate this relationship, is important in developing interventions that mitigate the negative effects of discrimination on the mental health of individuals from racial minority groups.",Racial discrimination and mental health: Temporal dynamics and neurocognitive moderators,9541788,F31MD012751,"['Affect ', ' Anger ', ' angry ', ' angers ', ' Anxiety ', ' Anxiety Disorders ', ' Attention ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Electroencephalography ', ' EEG ', ' Electrophysiology (science) ', ' electrophysiological ', ' Neurophysiology / Electrophysiology ', ' Electrophysiology ', ' Controlled Environment ', ' artificial environment ', ' Face ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' indexing ', ' Laboratories ', ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Minority Groups ', ' neurophysiology ', ' neurophysiological ', ' Psychophysiology ', ' psycho-physiological ', ' physiopsychology ', ' Psychophysiological ', ' Physiological Psychology ', ' Physiologic Psychology ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Specificity ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' depressive symptoms ', ' depressive ', ' depression symptom ', ' Emotional Depression ', ' base ', ' psychological ', ' psychologic ', ' racism ', ' Training ', ' race-based discrimination ', ' race discrimination ', ' racial discrimination ', ' mental ', ' Psyche structure ', ' Distress ', ' selective attention ', ' insight ', ' Stimulus ', ' Individual ', ' Measurement ', ' event related potential ', ' Event-Related Potentials ', ' programs ', ' Event ', ' physical conditioning ', ' physical health ', ' Neurocognitive ', ' experience ', ' stressor ', ' university student ', ' college student ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' neural ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' member ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Self-Report ', ' Categories ', ' Reporting ', ' psychological distress ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Cellular Phone ', ' smartphone ', ' smart phone ', ' iPhone ', ' Cellular Telephone ', ' Cell Phone ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Research Training ', ' Cognitive ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' time use ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' Individual Differences ', ' Affective ', ' clinical relevance ', ' clinically relevant ', ' anxious symptom ', ' anxiety symptoms ', ' anxious individuals ', ' attentional bias ', ' Ecological momentary assessment ', ' racial minority ', ' racial identity ', ' negative affectivity ', ' negative affect ', ' mood symptom ', ' iPhone Application ', ' iPhone App ', ' iOS application ', ' iOS app ', ' Smartphone App ', ' Smart Phone Application ', ' Smart Phone App ', ' Cellular Phone Application ', ' Cellular Phone App ', ' Cell phone App ', ' Cell Phone Application ', ' Android Application ', ' Android App ', ' smartphone Application ', ' ']",NIMHD,UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI-COLUMBIA,F31,2018,43236,0.057819286419742856
"Kiara Moore Diversity Supplement to Engaging Young Adults in Their Mental Health Care Through a Brief Empirically- Based Meta-Intervention Project Summary  In response to RFA-MH-16-410, this R34 addresses key NIMH priorities, 1) focusing on health disparities, and 2) development and preliminary testing of an innovative services intervention. We propose to refine and test the efficacy of a brief meta-intervention for young adults when they begin treatment at adult mental health clinics (hence, treatment and meta-intervention run concurrently). The meta-intervention is designed to reduce treatment dropout, a documented problem of significant public health concern, by helping young adults put treatment into perspective, better understand the rationale and goals of care, and address barriers to continued treatment as they build attendance routines and relationships with providers.  To date, research has focused on `transition interventions,' namely programs within children's systems that serve transitioning youth into young adulthood, some of which have extended services into the early twenties. These programs create temporary additional support for youth while they are still in the children's systems. Our research suggests a complementary strategy that outreaches to youth who have formed tentative and initial engagement in services in the adult system, but who are at high risk of disengaging due to the failure of services to take into account the unique developmental needs and orientations of young adults.  Our team developed a mid-level theory to understand the underlying mechanisms of disengagement. The theory integrates theories of service use with theories of decision-making, and suggests a set of factors (individual and contextual) impact disengagement among young adults with serious mental illness. Our intervention uses novel communication strategies to maintain the attention of young adults and impact these factors and thus, overall engagement. We use narrative communication (e.g., strategic storytelling as a means of conveying health information) to keep young adults connected to care and, in turn, improve functioning. We use a recovery role model who is a person who has had similar difficulties that young adults have as they first engage the adult mental health system. S/he leads activities and is a key resource. Although the recovery role model is related to approaches of peer support, it is distinct from and appeals to different mechanisms.  One hundred ninety five young adults (3 groups, 65 per group) will be randomly assigned to either the intervention group, an active control group (curriculum on safe relationships), or the treatment as usual control group when they first enroll in services. Assessments are taken at baseline, 2-week posttest, 4-week follow-up and at a three month follow-up. The study aims are (1) to develop and preliminarily test the efficacy of a novel, 2-session engagement meta-intervention aimed at engagement and functioning outcomes for marginalized young adults with serious mental illness, and (2) to preliminarily identify the underlying mechanisms of change for disengagement in mental health care, i.e., mediators and moderators of intervention effectiveness. We will advance theory as well as strengthen the proposed intervention. Project Narrative The proposed R34 refines the protocols and examines the efficacy of an engagement intervention designed for (and with) low-income young adults, ages 18 to 28, who are largely racial and ethnic minorities. Research has shown that transitioning to young adulthood often includes the discontinuation of mental health care and/or premature termination of services. The proposed study examines a brief (2-session) meta-intervention designed to help young adults understand how mental health services can help them, and addresses barriers to service engagement (i.e., stigma, mistrust, hope), thus improving their engagement in services and their overall mental health and life outcomes, as well as advancing theory on the underlying mechanisms of mental health decision making.",Kiara Moore Diversity Supplement to Engaging Young Adults in Their Mental Health Care Through a Brief Empirically- Based Meta-Intervention,9589719,R34MH111861,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Anxiety ', ' Attention ', ' Automobile Driving ', ' driving ', ' Behavior ', ' Mental disorders ', ' psychological disorder ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Welfare ', ' child wellbeing ', ' child well being ', ' adolescent welfare ', ' Client ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' Control Groups ', ' Educational Curriculum ', ' lesson plans ', ' Curriculum ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Decision Making ', ' Decision Theory ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Dropout ', ' Foundations ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health Services Research ', ' services research ', ' Medical Care Research ', ' Health Services Evaluation ', ' Institute of Medicine (U.S.) ', ' NAS/IOM ', ' Institute of Medicine ', ' Investments ', ' Medicaid ', ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health Services ', ' Mental Hygiene Services ', ' Mentors ', ' Moods ', ' Motivation ', ' Persons ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' NIMH ', ' New York ', ' Panic ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Running ', ' Schizophrenia ', ' schizophrenic ', ' dementia praecox ', ' Schizophrenic Disorders ', ' Social Work ', ' Social Service ', ' Stress ', ' Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders ', ' traumatic neurosis ', ' Posttraumatic Stress Disorders ', ' Posttraumatic Neuroses ', ' Post-Traumatic Neuroses ', ' PTSD ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Transportation ', ' Violence ', ' violent behavior ', ' violent ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Latino ', ' Youth ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' role model ', ' improved ', ' prematurity ', ' premature ', ' Randomized Clinical Trials ', ' Failure ', ' Individual ', ' Recovery ', ' young adulthood ', ' adult youth ', ' young adult ', ' Funding ', ' Letters ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Clinic ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' System ', ' Protocol Compliance ', ' Services ', ' preference ', ' rehabilitation service ', ' experience ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' outreach ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' Modeling ', ' communication theory ', ' response ', ' social stigma ', ' stigma ', ' theories ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Provider ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Low income ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' cognitive change ', ' Address ', ' Health system ', ' Symptoms ', ' Evidence based practice ', ' Qualitative Methods ', ' qualitative reasoning ', ' Adherence ', ' Effectiveness of Interventions ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' System for Public Use ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' active control ', ' health literacy ', ' care services ', ' care systems ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' improved functioning ', ' severe mental disorder ', ' serious mental illness ', ' serious mental disorder ', ' persistent mental illness ', ' chronic mental illness ', ' severe mental illness ', ' Outcome ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' ethnic minority ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' Affective ', ' Evidence based intervention ', ' service intervention ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' therapy design ', ' high risk ', ' group intervention ', ' usual care ', ' treatment as usual ', ' efficacy testing ', ' adverse consequence ', ' adverse outcome ', ' behavior outcome ', ' behavioral outcome ', ' peer support ', ' racial minority ', ' service engagement ', ' ']",NIMH,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY,R34,2018,83447,0.07745285577573383
"Addressing Mental Health Disparities in Refugee Children Through Family and Community-based Prevention: A CBPR Collaboration and Hybrid Implementation Effectiveness Trial ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Refugee children and families who are resettled in the United States face dramatic disparities in the incidence and treatment of mental health disorders. Resettlement stressors (poverty, limited access to care) and acculturative challenges (differences in cultural norms, discrimination) often exacerbate risks due to war- related trauma exposure. Commonly, refugee mental health services are limited-usually with a narrow focus on clinical treatment of PTSD-and rarely respond holistically to the needs or priorities of refugee communities; few interventions are designed for use across diverse cultures and refugee groups, despite rapidly evolving refugee demographics. Consequently, mental health service usage is low in resettled refugee populations. For refugee children and adolescents characterized by risk factors such as parental trauma, intergenerational conflict and other acculturative and resettlement stressors, preventive interventions hold great promise but are exceedingly rare. Cross-cultural application of community-based participatory research (CBPR) methods can increase understanding of risk and protective factors in refugee communities and contribute to development of responsive, flexible, interventions to promote healthy family functioning and child mental health and help prevent mental health disparities. We propose a CBPR-driven hybrid implementation effectiveness trial that builds upon ongoing collaborative research and community awareness-raising within Somali Bantu and Lhotshampas Bhutanese refugee communities in New England. Preliminary research and CBPR-based needs assessments with these groups has identified numerous cultural and community strengths as well as ongoing problems of difficult parent-child interactions, poor communication, and family conflict which interact with ongoing stressors to increase risks for child emotional and behavioral problems. Using a CBPR approach, a family based prevention model, the Family Strengthening Intervention for Refugees (FSI-R) was adapted from a tested model used in Africa and designed for delivery by refugee community health workers with through a process involving stakeholder consultation and local refugee Community Advisory Board input. Pilot data on the FSI-R demonstrates strong feasibility and acceptability, but further data are needed on effectiveness as well as barriers and facilitators to implementation by community health workers embedded in refugee-serving social services agencies. Specific aims are to (1) examine the impact of a family-based preventive intervention on outcomes of parent-child relationships, family functioning, and child mental health using a Hybrid Type 2Effectiveness-Implementation Design (families with children aged 7-17 in a two-arm randomized controlled trial); (2) identify barriers and facilitators to implementation of the FSI-R by community health workers by conducting a process evaluation concurrent with the delivery of the intervention; and (3) strengthen the science of community engagement to address health disparities by fortifying CBPR-based pathways of change via collaborative partnerships between refugee communities, service providers, and academic stakeholders. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed study will employ a cross-cultural CBPR approach to build from prior needs assessments and mixed methods research to evaluate the effectiveness of the Family Strengthening Intervention for Refugees (FSI-R), a preventative family home-based visiting intervention intended to mitigate mental health disparities among refugee children and families using a hybrid implementation-effectiveness design. Results of our trial will expand the evidence-base on community-based interventions for refugees and has the potential to be replicated to reduce mental health disparities affecting diverse groups of

"Adapting and Implementing Family-Based Treatment for Youth with Anorexia Nervosa in Publicly-Funded Settings PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The objectives of this career development award are to acquire knowledge, develop skills, and gain practical experience that enable the applicant to pursue independent research in dissemination and implementation (D&I) of evidence-based treatments (EBTs) in underresourced settings for youth with eating disorders (EDs), particularly by leveraging technology to increase EBT adoption. Youth with EDs are poorly served in the public sector due to lack of EBT training, leaving such youth vulnerable to medical complications, hospitalization, and a prolonged course of illness. Under the mentorship of implementation scientist Joseph Guydish, PhD, MPH and a team of expert co-mentors and consultants, the applicant will pursue training designed to 1) learn implementation science models, methodology, and analytic techniques to increase EBT adoption, implementation, and sustainability for underserved youth; 2) gain expertise in developing and testing technologies that improve EBT implementation; and 3) build expertise in minority health and health disparities research. The proposed research includes two aims that build on each other to support these training goals. Aim 1 will study adaptations to family-based treatment (FBT) for youth with anorexia nervosa and atypical anorexia nervosa by examining implementation by five clinicians with fifteen families in a county mental health system. The primary implementation outcomes are fidelity and adaptations, which will be used to further adapt FBT for Aim 2. Semi-structured interviews will explore provider experiences (n = 5) in implementing FBT for youth with EDs (e.g., implementation challenges, rationale for treatment adaptations), as well as caregivers' experiences (n = 8) receiving FBT. These projects support treatment refinement and adaptations for Aim 2, which will develop and pilot test the acceptability, utilization, and preliminary effectiveness of a web-based training (n = 9) compared to in-person training (n = 9) in the adapted FBT model. The study results will serve as pilot data for an R01 study focused on cost-effective training models to support EBT implementation for youth with EDs, particularly informing efforts to improve access to care across diverse, underserved youth. This proposal aligns with NIMH Strategic Objectives (4.1, 4.2) to improve the “effectiveness of existing mental health services” and the “dissemination, implementation, and continuous improvement of evidence-based mental health services” through research and research-practice partnerships, particularly for “underserved populations.” The carefully-assembled mentoring team, exceptional scientific environment, and proposed training and research activities will support the candidate's career development to ultimately improve publicly- funded clinical care for high-risk, understudied youth with EDs. PROJECT NARRATIVE Given the mortality rate and the significant costs associated with a prolonged course of illness with medical complications and hospitalizations, individuals with eating disorders (EDs) represent a high-priority clinical population. This study will use implementation science theory and methods to first identify needed adaptations to family-based treatment (FBT) for youth with anorexia nervosa and atypical anorexia nervosa in publicly- funded settings, and then refine and pilot adapted FBT to determine its preliminary effectiveness. By increasing the implementation of an FBT for underserved diverse youth, this study has considerable potential to improve outcomes for youth with EDs, thereby reducing costs for this high-risk understudied population.",Adapting and Implementing Family-Based Treatment for Youth with Anorexia Nervosa in Publicly-Funded Settings,9805879,K23MH120347,"['Adoption ', ' Anorexia Nervosa ', ' Mental disorders ', ' psychological disorder ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Communities ', ' web-based training ', ' web-based instruction ', ' virtual learning ', ' virtual education ', ' technology-enhanced learning ', ' online learning ', ' online education ', ' on-line learning ', ' on-line education ', ' multimedia learning ', ' internet-based training ', ' internet-assisted education ', ' electronic learning ', ' eLearning ', ' digital learning ', ' digital education ', ' computer-based training ', ' computer-based learning ', ' computer-based instruction ', ' computer-based education ', ' computer-assisted instruction ', ' E-learning ', ' Consultations ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Eating Disorders ', ' Economics ', ' Environment ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' Family ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' treatment access ', ' service availability ', ' health services availability ', ' health service access ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' accessibility to health services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Access to Care ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' Hospital Admission ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Interview ', ' Learning ', ' Libraries ', ' Medicaid ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene Services ', ' Mental Health Services ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' mortality ', ' Persons ', ' NIMH ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' Partnership Practice ', ' abnormal psychology ', ' Psychopathology ', ' Public Health ', ' Public Sector ', ' Research ', ' Research Support ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' San Francisco ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' training module ', ' Training Activity ', ' Training Support ', ' Videotape ', ' Weight ', ' Work ', ' County ', ' Treatment outcome ', ' Care Givers ', ' Caregivers ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Treatment Effectiveness ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Youth ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Family Study ', ' Area ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Training ', ' medical complication ', ' Individual ', ' Research Activity ', ' Funding ', ' Collaborations ', ' Letters ', ' Knowledge ', ' Scientist ', ' Clinic ', ' Techniques ', ' Services ', ' experience ', ' Structure ', ' skills ', ' Treatment Factor ', ' Code ', ' Coding System ', ' Modeling ', ' career development ', ' theories ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Provider ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Health system ', ' Data ', ' Doctor of Philosophy ', ' PhD ', ' Ph.D. ', ' Improve Access ', ' K-Series Research Career Programs ', ' Research Career Program ', ' K-Awards ', ' Career Development Programs K-Series ', ' Career Development Awards and Programs ', ' Career Development Awards ', ' Underrepresented Minority ', ' underrepresentation of minorities ', ' under-representation of minorities ', ' Underrepresented Ethnic Minority ', ' Modification ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Evidence based treatment ', ' suicide rate ', ' minority health ', ' cost ', ' Underserved Population ', ' underserved people ', ' under served population ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' cost effective ', ' Population ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' implementation science ', ' high risk ', ' clinical care ', ' evidence base ', ' treatment response ', ' therapeutic response ', ' response to treatment ', ' effective therapy ', ' effective treatment ', ' health equity ', ' flexibility ', ' flexible ', ' socioeconomic disadvantage ', ' socioeconomically underprivileged ', ' Socioeconomically disadvantaged ', ' learning community ', ' improved outcome ', ' ethnic diversity ', ' ethnically diverse ', ' barrier to care ', ' obstacle to healthcare ', ' obstacle to care ', ' barrier to treatment ', ' barrier to healthcare ', ' barrier to health care ', ' sociodemographics ', ' socio-demographics ', ' ']",NIMH,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",K23,2019,199098,0.006269213950581808
"Penn mental health AIDS research center Overview Abstract/Summary The overarching theme of the Penn Mental Health AIDS Research Center (PMHARC) at the University of Pennsylvania (Penn) and Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) is to transform how individuals with comorbid mental illness/AIDS are treated and managed by developing innovative, interdisciplinary, and integrative approaches to optimize psychiatric, behavioral, and medical outcomes and achieving a better understanding of the biological, psychological, and behavioral mechanisms underlying these combined illnesses and treatments. No other center in the U.S. is currently pursuing this explicit focus, making PMHARC unique in the NIMH ARC portfolio. A substantial body of work links psychiatric disorders to acquisition of HIV infection, accelerated immune dysfunction, poor access to HIV care, and poor adherence to antiretroviral treatment once in care. Yet, there is a relative paucity of evidence-based interventions focused on the combined treatment of mental illness/AIDS and related medical co-morbidities, and relatively little work in determining the relationships between mental health treatment and HIV/AIDS disease and understanding the underlying biology. PMHARC will stimulate novel approaches and strategies to address these problems by providing mentoring and resource support for both new and established investigators choosing to study comorbid mental illness/AIDS, in part through innovative pilot studies. PMHARC's leadership has extensive expertise in contemporary pharmacotherapy of mental illness and AIDS, cognitive behavioral treatments, and theory-based behavioral interventions. PMHARC will extend well-established collaborations at Penn and CHOP, including those in the Department of Psychiatry and the CFAR, as well as with the CTSA/CTRC, the Delaney Collaboratory, and community partners in Philadelphia. A unique feature of PMHARC is the collaboration of well- established mental health AIDS researchers, well-established mental health researchers who have not previously studied AIDS, well-established substance abuse AIDS researchers who have not previously studied mental health, and AIDS researchers not previously focused on mental health. PMHARC has an Administrative and Developmental Core, and four Shared Resource Cores. Overview Relevance: A growing body of research documents that persons with mental illness are at increased risk for contracting and transmitting HIV, and there are few evidence-based practices supporting treatment of persons with mental illnesses who are also HIV seropositive. Poor treatment outcomes and non-adherence pose a major public health threat due to poor individual outcomes and increased transmissibility and secondary infections. Thus, improving treatments for persons with these comorbid conditions has major public health significance.",Penn mental health AIDS research center,9676974,P30MH097488,"['Acquired Immunodeficiency

"Impact of Telemedicine on Medicare Beneficiaries with Mental Illness PROJECT SUMMARY Access to mental health specialists is difficult for many patients in the U.S., particularly for the poor and those who live in rural communities. Telemental health is one potential solution for this access problem, and there has been rapid growth in the number of live video-based telemental health visits in the U.S. While there are numerous rigorous randomized-control trials comparing telemental health visits to in-person mental health specialist care, there have been little research on how telemental health is being used in real-world settings. The uptake of telemental health has been very uneven geographically, and what explains this variation is also largely unknown. Our mixed-methods proposal centers on filling these gaps in knowledge. Under the first aim, we will conduct a series of descriptive analyses of data on 75 million adults with Medicare or commercial insurance to understand how telemental health is being used in conjunction with in-person care and whether the growth of telemental health has decreased disparities in the use of mental health specialists among disadvantaged populations. Under the second aim, we seek to explain why there is geographic variation in uptake using robust statistical machine learning. Under the third aim, we exploit the variation in uptake to assess whether communities with greater telemental health penetration have experienced improvements in care for patients with mental illness. In the fourth aim we will conduct qualitative interviews with providers to complement the empirical analyses and understand the key contextual factors underlying our findings. Understanding how telemental health is being used, why there is variation in use of telemental health, and whether telemental health use is associated with higher quality care could help drive future telemental health interventions and influence the ongoing policy debate on telemedicine regulations and reimbursement. Together the results of these aims are consistent with the NIMH's expressed interest in innovative delivery models that can improve care for underserved communities. It is difficult for many patients with mental illness to access care from a mental health specialist. Telemental health is one way to potentially help these patients receive care and the number of such visits for mental illness has increased rapidly. In this project, we will study how telemental health is being used to care for patients with mental illness, what drives variation in use, and whether telemedicine is associated with receipt of higher quality care.",Impact of Telemedicine on Medicare Beneficiaries with Mental Illness,9600712,R01MH112829,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Affect ', ' Automobile Driving ', ' driving ', ' Mental disorders ', ' psychological disorder ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Communities ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Complement ', ' meeting reports ', ' Congresses ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' Diffusion ', ' Future ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Patient Care ', ' Geography ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Growth ', ' individuals with disabilities ', ' disabled people ', ' disabled individual ', ' disabled ', ' Persons with Disabilities ', ' People with Disabilities ', ' Handicapped ', ' Disabled Population ', ' Disabled Persons ', ' Health ', ' health insurance for disabled ', ' Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Disabled Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Aged and Disabled, Title 18 ', ' Medicare ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health workforce ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Health Personnel ', ' treatment access ', ' service availability ', ' health services availability ', ' health service access ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' accessibility to health services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Access to Care ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' Hospital Admission ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Insurance ', ' Interview ', ' Laws ', ' Literature ', ' Medicaid ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Methods ', ' Persons ', ' NIMH ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' Patients ', ' psychotic illness ', ' Psychoses ', ' Psychotic Disorders ', ' Research ', ' schizophrenic ', ' dementia praecox ', ' Schizophrenic Disorders ', ' Schizophrenia ', ' Specialty ', ' medical specialties ', ' Testing ', ' Work ', ' symposia ', ' summit ', ' convention ', ' conference ', ' symposium ', ' Rural Community ', ' Specialist ', ' Caring ', ' Telemedicine ', ' base ', ' rural area ', ' rural region ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Penetration ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Series ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Psyche structure ', ' mental ', ' Rural ', ' Policies ', ' uptake ', ' Internet ', ' world wide web ', ' web ', ' WWW ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Pattern ', ' contextual factors ', ' Application Context ', ' interest ', ' Visit ', ' experience ', ' Speed ', ' Structure ', ' Regulation ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Quality of Care ', ' QOC ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Provider ', ' geographic variation ', ' geographic difference ', ' Low income ', ' Address ', ' Health system ', ' Data ', ' Improve Access ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' trend ', ' beneficiary ', ' medication compliance ', ' medication adherence ', ' drug compliance ', ' drug adherence ', ' rapid growth ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' severe mental illness ', ' severe mental disorder ', ' serious mental illness ', ' serious mental disorder ', ' persistent mental illness ', ' chronic mental illness ', ' older patient ', ' elderly patient ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' trial comparing ', ' demographics ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' control trial ', ' population health ', ' Emergency department visit ', ' Emergency room visit ', ' Emergency care visit ', ' ER visit ', ' ED visit ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning method ', ' learning activity ', ' improved outcome ', ' disadvantaged population ', ' Telemental ', ' care costs ', ' ']",NIMH,HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL,R01,2019,734746,0.05345028552520458
"Integrating Mental Health into a HIV Clinic to Improve Outcomes in Tanzanian Youth DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Dr. Dorothy Dow has a Master's of Science in Global Health and will become junior faculty at Duke University Medical Center in the Division of Pediatric Infectious Diseases in July 2014. For nearly three years, she has been living and working in Moshi, Tanzania. Her long-term goal is to become an independent global health researcher integrating mental health into the prevention and treatment of HIV among adolescents. During HIV clinic both at Duke University and Kilimanjaro Christian Medical Centre (KCMC), Dr. Dow has come to realize the reality of the statement, ""no health without mental health."" Her preliminary research evaluating the prevalence of mental health difficulties among HIV-positive adolescents in Tanzania has demonstrated symptoms of depression and trauma are prevalent in the local HIV youth clinic. Despite these findings, there are no psychologists or psychiatrists currently available at KCMC. This proposed career development plan incorporates a multidisciplinary five-year program complete with didactic training in global mental health, research methods and trial design, advanced biostatistics, and management skills for implementing large clinical trials. These didactics closely align with a mentored, patient-oriented research experience designing, adapting, and implementing a mental health intervention in the HIV adolescent clinic. Dr. Dow will receive mentorship from Dr. Coleen Cunningham (Chief, Pediatric Infectious Diseases and Pediatric Global Health), Dr. Karen O'Donnell (Clinical Psychology), Dr. Kathryn Whetten (Director of the Center for Health Policy and Inequalities Research), Dr. Blandina Mmbaga (Co-Site leader KCMC-Duke Collaboration, Professor of Pediatrics), and consultants Dr. John Bartlett (Duke Global Health Institute, DGHI) and Dr. Kathleen Sikkema (Clinical Psychology). Dr. Dow proposes to integrate both a HIV educational curriculum and an intensive cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and life skills training program called SPARCS, into the HIV teen clinic. The first aim is to create a tool kit by adapting both a HIV educational curriculum and SPARCS to be culturally relevant and in Swahili language. The second aim is a feasibility study to determine if SPARCS improves mental health, adherence, and viral outcomes. Based on the work of Dr. Dow's mentors who have successfully implemented trauma-focused CBT among orphans in Tanzania, it is anticipated that SPARCS will also be feasible to implement in a resource-limited setting. The hypothesis is that by addressing mental health needs, youth will demonstrate improved ART adherence and improved virologic outcomes. This project is anticipated to improve both mental and physical health of HIV-positive adolescents in Tanzania and open a dialogue of discussion around mental health difficulties in this setting. Upon completion of this feasibility study and further didactics and mentorship, the candidate plans to submit a R01 grant to evaluate the efficacy of this intervention as a randomized controlled trial, fulfilling her goal of conducting independent global health research to improve the overall health of adolescents living in Tanzania and other resource-limited settings. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project aims to address the mental health treatment gap that exists in the HIV youth clinic in Moshi, Tanzania with the goal of improving adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART) and HIV outcomes. Addressing this treatment gap is highly relevant in two important ways. First, improved ART adherence is important not only for one's own health, but as these youth become sexually active, it also decreases the risk of sexual transmission of HIV to their partners. Second, as perinatally HIV-infected children age into adolescence, their mental health difficulties and traumatic experiences must be addressed to facilitate a healthy and productive adulthood.",Integrating Mental Health into a HIV Clinic to Improve Outcomes in Tanzanian Youth,9710467,K01TW009985,"['Academic Medical Centers ', ' University Medical Centers ', ' Adolescence ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Behavior ', ' Biometry ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Biometrics ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' cognitive behavioral treatment ', ' cognitive behavioral therapy ', ' cognitive behavioral modification ', ' cognitive behavioral intervention ', ' cognitive behavior therapy ', ' cognitive behavior modification ', ' cognitive behavior intervention ', ' Cognitive Psychotherapy ', ' Cognition Therapy ', ' Cognitive Therapy ', ' Infectious Disorder ', ' Infectious Diseases ', ' Infectious Disease Pathway ', ' Communicable Diseases ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Comorbidity ', ' Counselor ', ' Professional counselor ', ' lesson plans ', ' Curriculum ', ' Educational Curriculum ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' Information Disclosure ', ' Disclosure ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Faculty ', ' Feasibility Studies ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Hair ', ' Health ', ' Health Tutoring ', ' Health Instruction ', ' Health education ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health workforce ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Health Personnel ', ' healthcare policy ', ' health care policy ', ' Health Policy ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' HTLV-III Seropositivity ', ' HTLV-III Seroconversion ', ' HIV antibody positive ', ' HIV Seroconversion ', ' HIV Positivity ', ' HIV Positive ', ' Anti-HIV Positivity ', ' HIV Seropositivity ', ' Human immunodeficiency virus 1 ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Virus Type 1 ', ' HIV1 ', ' HIV-I ', ' HIV-1 ', ' Institutes ', ' Language ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene Services ', ' Mental Health Services ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity -

"An implementation science approach to optimizing evidence-based treatments for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) for non-specialty settings PROJECT SUMMARY Background: An estimated 33-46% of clients seen in urban low-income primary care or behavioral health clinics have a current diagnosis of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), yet only 13% receive PTSD treatment. Further, only 57% of those who access care for PTSD receive a minimally adequate dose of therapy. The shortage of trained mental health specialists has led to concerning inequities in access to and quality of care in low-income community settings. To address workforce shortages, as well as client preferences, leaders in the field have advocated for the development of stepped care approaches that begin with brief, patient-centered interventions before progressing to intensive treatments. Despite promise, stepped approaches have not been developed for adults with PTSD. Specific Aims: This current study applies the Replicating Effective Programs Framework to guide the refinement and pre-implementation of a “Step 1” evidence-based treatment (EBT) for PTSD in primary care. A full stepped care approach will be tested in a future R01 (Step 1: brief, low intensity EBT in a non-specialty setting; Step 2: high intensity EBT in a specialty setting). Aim 1: To conduct a mixed-methods formative evaluation based on surveys and semi-structured interviews (N=25; 10 social worker and community health worker interventionists; 15 primary care stakeholders) to characterize the local integrated primary care setting and identify the need for augmentation to the intervention, protocol, or implementation blueprint. Aim 2: To optimize the intervention and operational procedures and to finalize the formal implementation blueprint (based on Aim 1 findings and consultation with the community advisory board [CAB]; N=10). Aim 3: To conduct a nonrandomized hybrid type 1 implementation-effectiveness pilot (N=60 clients) to assess the feasibility, effectiveness, and implementation of the adapted PTSD intervention (v. treatment as usual) in a primary care clinic. Candidate: This Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award (K23) builds upon the candidate’s previous experiences in clinical research focused on psychological adjustment following exposure to violence or discrimination among multiple minority populations. The candidate’s long-term goal is to be an independent implementation scientist focused on optimizing EBTs and care delivery models for PTSD. Training Objectives: (1) The development of implementation packages for delivery of EBTs in non-specialty settings; (2) Advanced training in pragmatic clinical trial design and mixed-methods data analysis and integration; and (3) Integrated primary care and stepped care models for mental health service delivery. Training Activities: Training will be achieved through mentorship by experts (Drs. A. Rani Elwy, Lisa Fortuna, Marylene Cloitre, Alisa Lincoln, Mark Bauer, Margarita Alegria, and Bindu Kalesan), formal coursework at Boston University School of Public Health, seminars, trainings, conferences, and workshop attendance. PROJECT NARRATIVE Only 13% of individuals with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in urban low-income communities receive mental health treatment; of those who receive treatment, only 56% receive minimally adequate psychotherapy. Low access to evidence-based psychotherapies for PTSD is foremost due to a shortage of trained mental health specialists; however, additional barriers exist, including: consumer preferences for care in non-specialty settings. Stepped care approaches that begin with the implementation of brief evidence-based psychotherapies for PTSD in non-specialty settings have the potential to improve the availability and quality of PTSD treatment in community settings.",An implementation science approach to optimizing evidence-based treatments for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) for non-specialty settings,9709348,K23MH117221,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Aftercare ', ' post treatment ', ' After-Treatment ', ' After Care ', ' Attitude ', ' Boston ', ' Client ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Communities ', ' community health worker ', ' Community Health Aides ', ' Consultations ', ' Continuum of Care ', ' Continuity of Care ', ' Continuity of Patient Care ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' health services delivery ', ' Healthcare Delivery ', ' health care delivery ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Discrimination ', ' Family ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' treatment access ', ' service availability ', ' health services availability ', ' health service access ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' accessibility to health services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Access to Care ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' Hybrids ', ' Interview ', ' literacy ', ' Memory ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene Services ', ' Mental Health Services ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methods ', ' Out-patients ', ' Outpatients ', ' Patient Satisfaction ', ' Client satisfaction ', ' Primary Care Physician ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Primary Care ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Psychotherapy ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Public Health Schools ', ' Shame ', ' Social Workers ', ' Specialty ', ' medical specialties ', ' traumatic neurosis ', ' Posttraumatic Stress Disorders ', ' Posttraumatic Neuroses ', ' Post-Traumatic Neuroses ', ' PTSD ', ' Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Testing ', ' training module ', ' Training Activity ', ' Universities ', ' Intensive Care ', ' symposia ', ' summit ', ' convention ', ' conference ', ' symposium ', ' Consumer Preferences ', ' Specialist ', ' Step Tests ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Specific qualifier value ', ' Specified ', ' Medical ', ' Ensure ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Educational workshop ', ' Workshop ', ' uptake ', ' tool ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' Adopted ', ' Clinic ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' Source ', ' psychosocial ', ' Services ', ' preference ', ' skills training ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' Structure ', ' peer ', ' Psychological adjustment ', ' Psychological Adaptation ', ' Psychologic Adaptation ', ' Regulation ', ' Modeling ', ' behavioral health ', ' Quality of Care ', ' QOC ', ' social stigma ', ' stigma ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Low income ', ' Address ', ' Dose ', ' Symptoms ', ' Advocate ', ' Data ', ' Improve Access ', ' Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award ', ' Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award (K23) ', ' K23 Program ', ' K23 Mechanism ', ' K23 Award ', ' Clinical Trials Design ', ' Cognitive ', ' follow-up ', ' followup ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' active followup ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Evidence based treatment ', ' health literacy ', ' PC3 cell line ', ' PC3 ', ' PC-3 cell line ', ' PC-3 ', ' care systems ', ' care services ', ' implementation research ', ' data integration ', ' Minority ', ' care preference ', ' Clinical effectiveness ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Trauma ', ' Affective ', ' patient oriented ', ' patient centered ', ' implementation science ', ' community setting ', ' evidence base ', ' primary care setting ', ' treatment as usual ', ' usual care ', ' pragmatic trial ', ' mental training ', ' formative assessment ', ' formative evaluation ', ' informal support ', ' Pragmatic clinical trial ', ' symptomatology ', ' Service delivery model ', ' healthcare delivery model ', ' health care delivery model ', ' care delivery model ', ' Service model ', ' Service setting ', ' clinical implementation ', ' implementation strategy ', ' trauma exposure ', ' exposure to trauma ', ' violence exposure ', ' exposure to violence ', ' ']",NIMH,BOSTON MEDICAL CENTER,K23,2019,187023,0.04264155780285376
"A trauma informed intervention to improve mental health and school success for urban eighth graders ABSTRACT. Approximately half of all 14-17 years olds in the U.S. are estimated to be victims of physical assault; chronic stress and trauma exposure are particularly prevalent for youth growing up in high-crime urban communities. Emotion regulation difficulties due to stress and trauma exposure contribute to disparities in mental health problems and school failure, with low-income and African American youth at much higher risk than their higher-income, White counterparts. Schools serving high-crime communities, however, do not offer universal trauma-informed strategies to support student success. RAP Club is a school-based group prevention program aimed at improving emotion regulation and decision-making in urban upper middle school students to improve their transition to high school. The program fills key gaps in current school practices, including a trauma-informed approach, universal delivery to all students without pre-screening, transdiagnostic effects on internalizing problems as well as behavioral issues, and a focus on upper middle school students. Our team adapted RAP Club from Structured Psychotherapy for Adolescents Responding to Chronic Stress (SPARCS), a group treatment for adolescents based on empirically supported mindfulness and cognitive- behavioral techniques. Using a novel delivery method, RAP Club is co-facilitated by school mental health personnel and young adult community members to promote student engagement. In our NIMH-funded pilot research, the program improved classroom behavior, social functioning, and academic competence. The program improved outcomes for students at varying levels of baseline distress—even low levels—suggesting its appropriateness as a universal model. Building on that work, the proposed R01 trial will test whether urban eighth grade students randomly assigned to RAP Club show improved emotional, behavioral, and academic outcomes in eighth and ninth grades compared to those assigned to Healthy Topics, a health education control group. Intervention and control programs will each be delivered by different school personnel with co- facilitation by young adult community members. The research will be conducted in 32 Baltimore City Public Schools serving urban communities with high rates of violence exposure. We will collect teacher- and student- reported data on student self-regulation, emotional functioning, classroom behavior, and academic performance at pre- and post-intervention and 4-month follow up, as well as student data at 12-month follow up. We will gather school record data on academic indicators in the year before, year of, and year following study participation. We will evaluate factors relevant to program implementation and potential sustainability, including stakeholder perspectives and cost data. The RAP Club model of trauma-informed, universal support has potential for widespread dissemination in school districts serving disadvantaged youth nationwide. The proposed randomized controlled trial will evaluate the effects of RAP Club, an evidence-based trauma-informed intervention, on eighth graders in an urban school district characterized by high rates of violence and trauma exposure. Schools serving youth in trauma-affected communities currently lack universal, trauma-informed approaches for promoting mental health and school success in upper middle school students prior to high school entry. RAP Club has potential to reduce risk for emotional, behavioral, and academic problems in our most vulnerable young people across the nation, with significant implications for reducing disparities in achievement and health.",A trauma informed intervention to improve mental health and school success for urban eighth graders,9701263,R01HD090022,"['Achievement ', ' Achievement Attainment ', ' Adolescence ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' assault ', ' Baltimore ', ' Behavior ', ' Biometry ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Biometrics ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Cities ', ' Communities ', ' Control Groups ', ' cost assessment ', ' assess cost ', ' Cost Analyses ', ' Cost Analysis ', ' Counselor ', ' Professional counselor ', ' Crime ', ' data representation ', ' Data Reporting ', ' Decision Making ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Family ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health Tutoring ', ' Health Instruction ', ' Health education ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Income ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Methods ', ' Mission ', ' NIMH ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' Professional Positions ', ' Jobs ', ' Occupations ', ' Perception ', ' pilot study ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' Poverty ', ' Psychologist ', ' Psychotherapy ', ' Public Health ', ' Records ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Schools ', ' Self Regulation ', ' Informal Social Control ', ' Social Workers ', ' Specialty ', ' medical specialties ', ' Standardization ', ' Stress ', ' Students ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Testing ', ' unemployed ', ' out of work ', ' joblessness ', ' jobless ', ' Unemployment ', ' violent behavior ', ' violent ', ' Violence ', ' Work ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' Competence ', ' depressive ', ' depression symptom ', ' Emotional Depression ', ' depressive symptoms ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Youth ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Adolescent ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Link ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' teacher ', ' Failure ', ' Distress ', ' Trust ', ' young adult ', ' young adulthood ', ' adult youth ', ' Funding ', ' Problem behavior ', ' behavioral problem ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Shapes ', ' Nature ', ' programs ', ' Event ', ' Techniques ', ' inner city ', ' Services ', ' mental health personnel ', ' Performance ', ' success ', ' high school ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Prevention program ', ' member ', ' seventh grade ', ' 7th grade ', ' eighth grade ', ' 8th grade ', ' ninth grade ', ' high school freshman ', ' 9th grade ', ' Human Resources ', ' personnel ', ' Manpower ', ' Academic achievement ', ' physical assault ', ' physical attack ', ' positive youth development ', ' Emotional ', ' Modeling ', ' Adolescent Development ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Low income ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Address ', ' Child Mental Health ', ' Symptoms ', ' Chronic stress ', ' Data ', ' National Institute of Child Health and Human Development ', "" National Institute of Children's Health and Human Development "", ' NICHD ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Cognitive ', ' follow-up ', ' followup ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' active followup ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' Behavioral ', ' active control ', ' post intervention ', ' cost ', ' Social Functioning ', ' Outcome ', ' scale up ', ' Child Traumatic Stress ', ' childhood traumatic stress ', ' aged ', ' Trauma ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' 17 year old ', ' seventeen years of age ', ' seventeen year old ', ' age 17 years ', ' 17 years of age ', ' implementation science ', ' emotion regulation ', ' emotional regulation ', ' high risk ', ' evidence base ', ' group intervention ', ' mindfulness ', ' screening ', ' Middle School Student ', ' Junior High Student ', ' Junior High School Student ', ' Prevention trial ', ' anxiety symptoms ', ' anxious symptom ', ' behavioral outcome ', ' behavior outcome ', ' student participation ', ' student motivation ', ' student engagement ', ' school district ', ' treatment group ', ' improved outcome ', ' neighborhood disadvantage ', ' disparity reduction ', ' reduce disparity ', ' trauma symptom ', ' urban school ', ' urban underserved ', ' recruit ', ' trauma exposure ', ' exposure to trauma ', ' violence exposure ', ' exposure to violence ', ' ']",NICHD,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,514202,0.022334204304437208
"University of Miami Developmental HIV/AIDS Mental Health Research Center (D-ARC) Project Summary (Overall)  This application from the University of Miami (UM) for a Developmental AIDS Research Center (UM D- ARC) proposes to establish a behavioral science hub advancing mental health (MH) HIV research in a US region hardest hit by HIV/AIDS. The over-arching Center theme, “Reducing the Impact of Mental Health and Minority Health Disparities across the HIV Prevention and Care Continua,” is directly relevant to the uncontrolled HIV/AIDS epidemic in the Greater Miami area, and this developmental funding will provide a pathway for dynamic growth to a subsequent full ARC application. Over the initial funding period, we will consolidate, coordinate, and augment institutional resources as well as develop and expand regional and national collaborations. Miami has the highest HIV incidence and prevalence of any US city and fares worst, geographically, on every CDC indicator of HIV impact. Developing a D-ARC focused on MH at UM is also of high public health significance, as Miami’s diverse populations face significant MH disparities, making the area an ideal setting for MH research across diverse populations disproportionately affected by the epidemic.  The organization of the UM D-ARC Cores represents a logical and innovative approach to establishing a D-ARC in an institution that has a growing cadre of behavioral scientists and a strategic goal of increasing HIV research. We propose the required Administrative (Admin) Core and Developmental (Dev) Core and two (rather than the required one) complementary Research Cores: a Methods Core and a Mental Health Disparities (MHD) Core. The Admin Core will embody Center leadership, governance, and strategic planning and coordinate the bi-directional community engagement activities that are key to the work of all Cores. The Dev Core will focus on awarding pilot studies and mentoring early stage investigators. The Methods Core will provide innovative research design, biostatistical, and data management expertise and collaborate with the MHD Core to construct, expand, and maintain Center Common Data Elements (CDE), consent-to-contact databases, and a REDCap measures library to maximize resource sharing. The MHD Core will provide expertise and resources to promote culturally competent, theory-driven approaches, tools, and interventions in ethical, multi-level, community-engaged research addressing MH and minority health disparities in HIV.  The developmental activities proposed for the new UM D-ARC have the overarching goal of increasing local MH HIV/AIDS research consistent with the center theme and UM strategic goals regarding HIV/AIDS and will leverage strong institutional support. This structure allows for attainment of our Overall Aims, which are to establish the Developmental Center, and to grow by promoting research that mitigates the impact of MH and minority health disparities across the HIV prevention and treatment continuum.

"Improving Satisfaction, Engagement and Clinical Outcomes Among Traditionally Underserved Children Through Cultural Formulation Project Summary/Abstract Economically disadvantaged and ethnic/racial minority children are more likely to suffer from disruptive behavior problems than their middle-to-upper-income Caucasian counterparts, yet they are less likely to receive quality care and are more likely to drop out of treatment services. Disparities in the reception of and engagement with mental health services suggests that standard mental health practices may not properly consider the unique issues and cultural context of child mental health problems in traditionally underserved families. Professional guidelines suggest that providing more culturally responsive services is one important method for increasing engagement in underserved population, however research on this front is quite limited. A broader patient-centered assessment of relevant cultural factors into evidence-based practices might yield improved care and maximize family engagement among traditionally underserved families. Initial research focused on adult populations has suggested that incorporating the Cultural Formulation Interview (CFI), a brief cultural assessment, as part of the baseline assessment can promote improved medical communication, leading to stronger rapport with the therapist, and overall patient satisfaction. Additionally, using critical culture- related information identified in the CFI to influence treatment planning for a given patient may lead to improved outcomes without the need to adapt a treatment for an entire population of individuals. To date, research on the benefits of augmenting usual mental health assessment with the CFI has only been conducted in the context of adult patients, and has yet to examine the potential for the CFI to improve treatment engagement in the context of children's mental health services. Further, studies on the CFI have only examined its impact on initial engagement and satisfaction with assessment services; research has yet to consider the effects of the CFI on prolonged engagement or clinical outcomes. Importantly, minority and economically disadvantaged families are disproportionately impacted by cultural, attitudinal, and stress-related barriers to care (i.e. stigma, ethnic identity, and daily stress). Research has yet to examine how these barriers may predict which families are more likely to benefit from the inclusion of the CFI. The current pilot study is being conducted within a large South Florida mental health network serving predominately low-income minority families obtaining parent training for early child behavior problems. Participating families (N=50) will be randomized at baseline to receive either the standard diagnostic and clinical assessment (DCA) or DCA+CFI. The dissertation pilot project will evaluate initial feasibility (Aim 1), and preliminary parent satisfaction, engagement in parent training, and clinical child outcomes (Aim 2). Further exploratory analyses will examine whether traditional barriers to care (i.e. stigma, ethnic identity, and daily stress) moderate the effects of the CFI on satisfaction, engagement and clinical outcomes (Aim 3).   Project Narrative This mental health research dissertation grant application will facilitate my development into an independent researcher who focuses on improving engagement and access to quality mental health care among high-risk and traditionally underserved populations (e.g., ethnic/racial minorities and economically disadvantages families). Specifically, the dissertation project at the center of this proposal will leverage a pilot randomized design to examine initial feasibility and preliminary effects of augmenting usual mental health evaluation procedures with a structured person-centered assessment tool that specifically considers the cultural context of patient mental health problems (i.e., the Cultural Formulation Interview; CFI) on parent satisfaction, engagement and clinical child outcomes in the treatment of early child behavior problems. Additional analyses will explore whether traditional barriers (e.g., stigma, ethnic identity, and daily stress) moderate the effects of the CFI on satisfaction, engagement and treatment outcomes. ","Improving Satisfaction, Engagement and Clinical Outcomes Among Traditionally Underserved Children Through Cultural Formulation",9692799,R36MH116677,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Behavior ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Child Behavior ', ' Communication ', ' Family ', ' Feasibility Studies ', ' Florida ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Grant ', ' services research ', ' Medical Care Research ', ' Health Services Evaluation ', ' Health Services Research ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Income ', ' Interview ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene Services ', ' Mental Health Services ', ' Mentally Ill ', ' Mental Patients ', ' Mentally Ill Persons ', ' Methods ', ' Parents ', ' Patient Satisfaction ', ' Client satisfaction ', ' Patients ', ' pilot study ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Stress ', ' white race ', ' Occidental ', ' Caucasoid Race ', ' Caucasoid ', ' Caucasian Race ', ' Caucasian ', ' Caucasians ', ' Measures ', ' Treatment outcome ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Latino ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Youth ', ' Caring ', ' Guidelines ', ' child mental health service ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Fostering ', ' satisfaction ', ' Funding ', ' Problem behavior ', ' behavioral problem ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Diagnostic ', ' programs ', ' Services ', ' experience ', ' treatment planning ', ' Structure ', ' Economically Deprived Population ', ' underclass ', ' economically disadvantaged ', ' economic disadvantage ', ' Economically Deprived ', ' Reporting ', ' career development ', ' Quality of Care ', ' QOC ', ' social stigma ', ' stigma ', ' Drops ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Low income ', ' Child Mental Health ', ' Evidence based practice ', ' Applications Grants ', ' Grant Proposals ', ' Intake ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Monitor ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Underserved Population ', ' underserved people ', ' under served population ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Minority ', ' Clinical assessments ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Individual Differences ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' Early treatment ', ' early therapy ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' patient oriented ', ' patient centered ', ' person centered ', ' high risk ', ' traditional care ', ' Assessment tool ', ' Assessment instrument ', ' Formulation ', ' improved outcome ', ' minority children ', ' racial minority ', ' ethnic identity ', ' disparity reduction ', ' reduce disparity ', ' health care disparity ', ' healthcare disparity ', ' disparity in healthcare ', ' disparity in care ', ' clinical diagnostics ', ' recruit ', ' treatment services ', ' barrier to care ', ' obstacle to healthcare ', ' obstacle to care ', ' barrier to treatment ', ' barrier to healthcare ', ' barrier to health care ', ' health assessment ', ' ']",NIMH,FLORIDA INTERNATIONAL UNIVERSITY,R36,2019,8010,0.09674349974882406
"Lay Health Worker Mobilization to Address Disparities in Parent Training Services Project Summary/ Abstract The proposed K01 Mentored Research Scientist Development Award will provide the applicant with advanced training and skills to launch an independent research program focused on developing and evaluating implementation interventions that reduce mental health (MH) disparities for ethnically diverse families. This K01 proposal seeks to develop an evidence base for leveraging Lay Health Workers (LHW), community members without formalized MH training, to address determinants of MH disparities related to client demand for and the supply of behavioral parent training (BPT) programs in underserved communities. The community- partnered development and pilot evaluation of the LHW Enhancing Engagement for Parents (LEEP) implementation intervention will train LHW to conduct outreach and promote treatment engagement and skill acquisition for Latino families in Parent-Child Interaction Therapy (PCIT). Aim 1 of the study will assess the current context of LHW mobilization in children's evidence-based service delivery in community MH agencies through qualitative interviews with agency leaders and LHW, and quantitative surveys of LHW. Mixed-method analyses of these data will inform the development of LEEP. In Aim 2, the applicant will partner with community stakeholders to develop an implementation plan, structure, and process materials (e.g., fidelity measures) for LEEP. Aim 3 will pilot LEEP within an effectiveness/implementation hybrid design. Qualitative and quantitative data will inform the evaluation of LEEP including its feasibility, acceptability, and effects on client engagement, clinical outcomes, and implementation outcomes. The proposed study is well suited to the community setting and expertise the applicant brings to the project. Los Angeles County Department of MH (LACDMH) has invested considerable efforts in the implementation of evidence-based practices, including PCIT. The applicant's postdoctoral fellowship focused a MH policy reform within LACDMH, providing her insight into this large system of care. To meet her career objectives and the aims of this research project, the applicant requires additional training in: (1) implementation and health services research methodology to measure and reduce MH disparities; (2) application of implementation strategies and theories to inform the development of interventions to address supply and demand determinants of disparities; (3) approaches to improve parental entry into and engagement in treatment. Mentorship and consultation from primary sponsor, Dr. Jeanne Miranda (MH disparity reduction), co-sponsor, Dr. Anna Lau (MH disparities, implementation science), Dr. John Landsverk (implementation science), Dr. Lisa Saldana (economic evaluations of implementation efforts), Dr. Maryam Kia-Keating (community-partnered research, LHW models), Dr. Camille Nebeker (LHW training, responsible conduct of research), Dr. Emily Winslow (parent engagement), Dr. Karen Nylund-Gibson (multilevel statistical models) and Dr. Susan Ettner (health economics) will facilitate this training. Project Narrative The objective of this proposal is to develop an implementation intervention that leverages Lay Health Workers (LHW), community members without formalized mental health training, to increase the entry into and engagement in evidence-based behavioral parent training (BPT) programs for low-income, Latino as a strategy to reduce mental health disparities.

The organization of the UM D-ARC Cores represents a logical and innovative approach to establishing a D-ARC in an institution that has a growing cadre of behavioral scientists and a strategic goal of increasing HIV research. We propose the required Administrative (Admin) Core and Developmental (Dev) Core and two (rather than the required one) complementary Research Cores: a Methods Core and a Mental Health Disparities (MHD) Core. The Admin Core will embody Center leadership, governance, and strategic planning and coordinate the bi-directional community engagement activities that are key to the work of all Cores. The Dev Core will focus on awarding pilot studies and mentoring early stage investigators. The Methods Core will provide innovative research design, biostatistical, and data management expertise and collaborate with the MHD Core to construct, expand, and maintain Center Common Data Elements (CDE), consent-to-contact databases, and a REDCap measures library to maximize resource sharing. The MHD Core will provide expertise and resources to promote culturally competent, theory-driven approaches, tools, and interventions in ethical, multi-level, community-engaged research addressing MH and minority health disparities in HIV.  The developmental activities proposed for the new UM D-ARC have the overarching goal of increasing local MH HIV/AIDS research consistent with the center theme and UM strategic goals regarding HIV/AIDS and will leverage strong institutional support. This structure allows for attainment of our Overall Aims, which are to establish the Developmental Center, and to grow by promoting research that mitigates the impact of MH and minority health disparities across the HIV prevention and treatment continuum. The UM D-ARC has the unique potential for high-impact research addressing HIV among hardest-hit populations in greatest need and at greatest risk for falling off of the HIV prevention and treatment continua. PROJECT NARRITIVE  This proposal for what would be the first NIMH Developmental Mental Health HIV/AIDS Center (D- ARC) from the University Of Miami (UM) has exceptionally high public health significance; the D-ARC would be situated in one of the hardest hit geographic areas affected by the epidemic, at an institution with a strong and growing faculty of mental health HIV/AIDS researchers with ties to the local health departments, and to the local community. The proposed D-ARC will catalyze high-impact research efforts addressing mental health disparities, answering key questions related to HIV prevention and care starting in a domestic epicenter, with implications that can be applied broadly, and stimulate growth to a full-fledged MH-ARC. The focus of expertise and center activities on those most at risk for not achieving U.S. and U.N. end-the-epidemic goals is an excellent match for the geographic area facing health and mental health disparities driving the HIV epidemic.",University of Miami Developmental HIV/AIDS Mental Health Research Center (D-ARC),9987850,P30MH116867,"['Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immunologic Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immuno-Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency ', ' AIDS ', ' Affect ', ' Automobile Driving ', ' driving ', ' Award ', ' Ursidae Family ', ' bear ', ' Ursidae ', ' Bears ', ' Behavioral Research ', ' Behavioral Sciences ', ' Biometry ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Biometrics ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' CDC ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' Cities ', ' Communities ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Comorbidity ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Epidemic ', ' ethical ', ' Ethics ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' Faculty ', ' Florida ', ' Future ', ' geographic site ', ' Geographical Location ', ' Geographic Region ', ' Geographic Area ', ' Geographic Locations ', ' Geography ', ' Goals ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Growth ', ' Health ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' Hospitals ', ' Incidence ', ' Leadership ', ' Libraries ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' NIMH ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' Patients ', ' pilot study ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Research Design ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Support ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Science ', ' United Nations ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Hispanics ', ' Latino ', ' population diversity ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' diverse populations ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' Research Methods ', ' Research Methodology ', ' HIV/AIDS prevention ', ' HIV Prevention ', ' AIDS prevention ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' Area ', ' Failure ', ' Individual ', ' Databases ', ' data base ', ' Data Bases ', ' Funding ', ' uptake ', ' Collaborations ', ' tool ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' Clinic ', ' Viral ', ' meetings ', ' data management ', ' Structure ', ' Prevention Research ', ' Categories ', ' Prevention ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' AIDS/HIV problem ', ' HIV/AIDS problem ', ' HIV/AIDS ', ' AIDS/HIV ', ' theories ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' fall risk ', ' Institution ', ' Address ', ' Consent ', ' Data ', ' Resource Sharing ', ' Strategic Planning ', ' Common Data Element ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Behavioral ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' minority health ', ' biobehavior ', ' biobehavioral ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' high risk ', ' community partnership ', ' pre-exposure prophylaxis ', ' PrEP ', ' recruit ', ' barrier to care ', ' obstacle to healthcare ', ' obstacle to care ', ' barrier to treatment ', ' barrier to healthcare ', ' barrier to health care ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF MIAMI CORAL GABLES,P30,2019,150500,0.08198353810672049
"Simulated Conversation Training for Mental Healthcare Providers to Improve Care for Transgender and Gender Nonconforming Individuals. ABSTRACT SIMmersion LLC, in collaboration with Drs. Galupo, Schmidt, Matsuno, Bettergarcia, Hernández, Mastroleo, and Kukucka, is proposing to develop and evaluate Training Trans-Affirmative Communication Skills (TTACS), a suite of conversation simulations that provide mental health care providers with experience working with Transgender and gender nonconforming (TGNC) individuals. The proposed product utilizes SIMmersion’s PeopleSim® conversation software that has already been proven to improve clinical skills in a variety of areas. The diverse development team, which includes TGNC individuals and people of color at every level of input (including Key Personnel, Expert Panel, Actors, Focus Group, and Community Partners) will design and create four modules within TTACS that allow mental health care clinicians and clinicians-in-training to develop gender- affirming communication skills for clients with diverse needs. TTACS modules will focus on Intake, Traditional Needs, High-Risk Needs, and Social and Physical Transitions, and the fictional characters in the training will be represented by a diverse group of actors from the trans community. The proposed TTACS provides an innovative response to the call for training initiatives for implementing the American Psychological Association (APA) guidelines for trans-affirmative, culturally competent, and developmentally appropriate care into psychological practice for TGNC people. During Phase I of the fast-track research, the team will evaluate the feasibility of using a PeopleSim training to improve clinicians’ skills at meeting the needs of TGNC individuals. The team will create a design plan for the entire TTACS system (Aim 1), develop the Intake module (Aim 2), conduct a within-group pre-post knowledge assessment with clinicians-in-training (Aim 3a), and a focus group discussion with key decision makers and supervisors (Aim 3b). Success in Phase I will lead directly into Phase II development of the remaining TTACS modules (Aim 1) and the development of Standardized Patient Scenarios and checklists for evaluating the skills of clinicians-in-training working with TGNC clients (Aim 2), which will be used in a Randomized Controlled Trial (Aim 3) with 100 students enrolled in clinical and counseling psychology graduate programs. The team plans to begin commercializing TTACS (Aim 4) to university programs, independent training organizations, health care centers, and professional organizations, starting with the individuals and organizations that provided letters of support. If successful, the proposed research could help reduce the patterns of mistreatment, discrimination, and physical and mental health disparities TGNC individuals experience when they seek mental health care. PROJECT NARRATIVE Transgender and Gender Nonconforming (TGNC) individuals experience both physical and mental health disparities when compared to their cisgender counterparts. The skills required to provide gender-affirming, culturally competent care require extensive practice with feedback, which is difficult to obtain. The proposed research will produce an innovative training tool with the potential to increase learning and retention of knowledge, skills, awareness, and cultural competency among clinicians, thereby benefiting their TGNC clients and reducing the disparities they experience in health care settings.",Simulated Conversation Training for Mental Healthcare Providers to Improve Care for Transgender and Gender Nonconforming Individuals.,9796430,R44MD014112,"['American Psychological Association ', ' Award ', ' Awareness ', ' Client ', ' Clinical Skills ', ' Color ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' Control Groups ', ' Counseling ', ' Cues ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Discrimination ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' Feedback ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Future ', ' Grant ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health workforce ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Health Personnel ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Learning ', ' Logic ', ' Marketing ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Names ', ' Patient Satisfaction ', ' Client satisfaction ', ' Patients ', ' Play ', ' Prejudice ', ' professional society ', ' professional membership ', ' professional association ', ' Professional Organizations ', ' Psychology ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Software ', ' Computer software ', ' Standardization ', ' Students ', ' Teaching ', ' Educational process of instructing ', ' Technology ', ' training module ', ' Training Activity ', ' Universities ', ' Writing ', ' Gender ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Caring ', ' Guidelines ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' psychologic ', ' psychological ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' satisfaction ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Collaborations ', ' Letters ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' tool ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Hour ', ' Severities ', ' Complex ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' physical conditioning ', ' physical health ', ' meetings ', ' transgender ', ' trans* ', ' skills training ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' skills ', ' simulation ', ' Participant ', ' cultural competence ', ' help-seeking behavior ', ' help seeking ', ' Human Resources ', ' personnel ', ' Manpower ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' Gatekeeping ', ' gatekeeper ', ' medically necessary care ', ' medically necessary ', ' response ', ' Dehumanization ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Speech Recognition Software ', ' Voice Recognition Software ', ' Symptoms ', ' Educational Materials ', ' Intake ', ' Interruption ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Health Professional ', ' Healthcare professional ', ' Health Care Professional ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' maltreatment ', ' mistreatment ', ' Outcome ', ' cost effective ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' skill acquisition ', ' skill development ', ' commercialization ', ' high risk ', ' mental training ', ' gender nonconforming ', ' non-gender conforming ', ' gender non-conforming ', ' collaborative environment ', ' peer-group environment ', ' peer-group atmosphere ', ' interdisciplinary environment ', ' interdisciplinary atmosphere ', ' interactive environment ', ' interactive atmosphere ', ' collaborative atmosphere ', ' business-friendly environment ', ' Business-Friendly Atmosphere ', ' cisgender ', ' cis-gender ', ' gender diversity ', ' disparity reduction ', ' reduce disparity ', ' recruit ', ' health care settings ', ' healthcare settings ', ' ']",NIMHD,"SIMMERSION, LLC.",R44,2019,187769,0.09455819914525986
"Scaling-Up Stepped Care for Women's Mental Health in Primary Care in an LMIC This new R01 application responds to PAR-18-835 by advancing task sharing in testing the effectiveness and implementation of a stepped care model for LMICs. It uses nurses and mental health peers to treat depression and potential co-occurring anxiety among women in primary care. To improve implementation, this study examines the impact of clinic implementation teams in readying the clinics and service providers. The proposed project is located in Tajikistan, where the investigators have conducted NIH funded research since 2009. It builds upon and extends Dr. Weine’s R01, K24, and D43 research on migration and health and mental health, and especially his recent Global Brain R21 research which successfully adapted and tested stepped care for feasibility. Aim 1 assesses the effectiveness of the stepped care model with 420 women who have depression and potential co-occurring anxiety, recruited from 12 primary care clinics in Tajikistan, compared with standard of care plus provision of healthy lifestyle materials, with another 210 women recruited from 6 primary care clinics, including assessing mediators and moderators (e.g. executive control efficiency, trauma exposure). Aim 2 assesses whether a clinic implementation team moderates women’s reduction in depression post-intervention, as well as clinic-level (leadership support and degree of implementation) and provider-level (motivation and fidelity) moderators. Aim 3 establishes a national mental health research network that focuses on improving the standard of mental health care and access to services by building mental health implementation research capacity. The knowledge produced through this study will inform stepped care models for mental health in LMICs such as Tajikistan and in low-resource settings in the United States. In Tajikistan, as well as in other LMICs, women suffer disproportionally from common mental disorders and often experience trauma, separation from their migrant husbands, stigma, gender inequality, poverty, and access barriers to mental health services. This project will: test the effectiveness and implementation of a novel stepped care model for women with depression delivered by primary care nurses and mental health peers; examine the impact of clinic implementation teams in readying clinics and service providers and measure whether they improve implementation, and; explore how RDoC neuroscience contributes to implementation science through enhancing the evaluation and targeting of stepped care. Overall, it will develop a scalable evidence-based mental health program in primary care that could reduce the epidemic of common mental disorders among women, and augment an existing D43 and R21 research training program to further advance the implementation science capacities of mental health researchers in Tajikistan.",Scaling-Up Stepped Care for Women's Mental Health in Primary Care in an LMIC,9820059,R01MH120660,"['Amitriptyline ', ' amitryptiline ', ' Anxiety ', ' Ursidae Family ', ' bear ', ' Ursidae ', ' Bears ', ' Mental disorders ', ' psychological disorder ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Chicago ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Epidemic ', ' Health ', ' treatment access ', ' service availability ', ' health services availability ', ' health service access ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' accessibility to health services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Access to Care ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' Hybrids ', ' Illinois ', ' Leadership ', ' Lifestyle ', ' Life Style ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene Services ', ' Mental Health Services ', ' Mentorship ', ' Motivation ', ' NIMH ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' Neurosciences ', ' New York ', ' nurse ', ' Nurses ', ' Play ', ' Poverty ', ' Primary Care Physician ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Primary Care ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Primary Nursing Care ', ' Research ', ' R&D ', ' R & D ', ' Development and Research ', ' research and development ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Science ', ' traumatic neurosis ', ' Posttraumatic Stress Disorders ', ' Posttraumatic Neuroses ', ' Post-Traumatic Neuroses ', ' PTSD ', ' Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders ', ' Tajikistan ', ' Testing ', ' Training Programs ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' Utah ', ' Woman ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Self Management ', ' prisma ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Lifting ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Psyche structure ', ' mental ', ' Individual ', ' Fostering ', ' Research Activity ', ' Inequality ', ' Husband ', ' Funding ', ' Exposure to ', ' Evidence Based Medicine ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Clinic ', ' meetings ', ' Services ', ' experience ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' prevention service ', ' peer ', ' Modeling ', ' social stigma ', ' stigma ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' executive function ', ' executive control ', ' Provider ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Address ', ' Research Training ', ' post intervention ', ' implementation research ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' interpersonal therapy ', ' interpersonal psychotherapy ', ' Outcome ', ' scale up ', ' migration ', ' Trauma ', ' treatment effect ', ' implementation science ', ' evidence base ', ' standard of care ', ' standard care ', ' standard treatment ', ' young woman ', ' adolescent women ', ' adolescent woman ', ' Research Domain Criteria ', ' RDoC ', ' healthy lifestyle ', ' healthy life-style ', ' low and middle-income countries ', ' LMIC ', ' health care availability ', ' healthcare service availability ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare availability ', ' healthcare accessibility ', ' healthcare access ', ' health care service availability ', ' health care service access ', ' health care access ', ' accessibility to healthcare ', ' accessibility to health care ', ' accessibility of health care ', ' access to healthcare ', ' access to health care ', ' recruit ', ' treatment services ', ' service providers ', ' implementation strategy ', ' trauma exposure ', ' exposure to trauma ', ' health goals ', ' Migrant ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT CHICAGO,R01,2019,707692,0.0692971192070993
"Navigating Resource-Constrained Systems and Communities to Promote the Behavioral Health of Black Youth PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Black youth living in poverty-impacted communities are disproportionately burdened by behavioral health challenges, notably serious disruptive behavioral difficulties (DBDs). Without access to care, children with DBDs frequently suffer serious impairment. This study is based on the premise that if care navigation models are going to succeed in eliminating racial disparities in child mental health care, then the preparation and support for child behavioral health navigators (cbhNs) needs to include: 1) training to deliver evidence-based family engagement, psychoeducation and support interventions; 2) ongoing coaching and supervision focused on building collaborative relationships between families and provider partners and; 3) skills to enhance community/system buy-in, as well as to analyze and interrupt multi-level structural influences on disparities and system gaps. involves individuals STL. integrates education, The proposed study (in response to PAR 18-428) will be conducted in 2 phases.

"Mental health of at-risk women: the role of structural vulnerabilities and resilience Project Summary Female sex workers (FSW) bear a disproportionate burden of depression and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) compared to the general female population. There is some evidence of the role of structural vulnerabilities (i.e. homelessness, stigma, poverty) in poor mental health in the general population however there has been little research on the nature of this relationship FSW, a population that is characterized by a diverse array of structural vulnerabilities. Resilience has played a promising role in improving mental health in prior research yet it is unclear the role it may play for FSW. The proposed mentored research will examine patterns of structural vulnerabilities among a sample of FSW in Baltimore, Maryland collected at baseline (n=350) and how resilience moderates the relationship between these patterns and mental health at 12-month follow-up. Semi-structured in-depth interviews with free listing will be used to qualitatively examine how women (n=20-25) describe dimensions and experiences of resilience in their lives and how they acquire resources to strengthen resilience, including social support. (Aim 1). Using baseline survey data, latent class analysis (LCA) will be performed to determine patterns of structural vulnerabilities (Aim 2). Then, LCA with distal outcomes will be used to predict mental health (depression, PTSD, and co-occurring PTSD and depression) at 12-month follow-up based on structural vulnerability class (Aim 3). Finally, LCA models with distal outcomes will be used to explore the moderating role of resilience in the relationship between structural vulnerability class and mental health (Sub-aim 3a). This study uses a novel mixed methods approach to explore moderating factors that influence mental health among a population that experiences high rates of mental illness and structural vulnerabilities. Findings can elucidate the drivers of the mental health disparity between FSW and the general population. Results can also inform clinical and research interventions for addressing social and structural-level risks and protective factors among a vulnerable population. This project will prepare the applicant to become a leading independent researcher in the fields of mental health among vulnerable populations. The culminating results from this project can help NIMH meet Strategic Objectives 2, 3, and 4 by using advanced LCA methods to predict classes of risk factors for PTSD and depression in a sample of women who experience significant mental health disparities; these risk factor classes can better inform mental health prevention and clinical care. Project Narrative Female sex workers (FSW) experience a wide array of structural vulnerabilities and a disproportionate burden of mental illness yet little is known about modifiable factors that can improve mental health outcomes in this population. The proposed mentored research will examine patterns of structural vulnerabilities among a sample of FSW and how resilience moderates the relationship between structural vulnerability classes and mental health (i.e. depression, PTSD, and co-occurring depression and PTSD).

"Addressing Mental Health Disparities in Refugee Children Through Family and Community-based Prevention: A CBPR Collaboration and Hybrid Implementation Effectiveness Trial ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Refugee children and families who are resettled in the United States face dramatic disparities in the incidence and treatment of mental health disorders. Resettlement stressors (poverty, limited access to care) and acculturative challenges (differences in cultural norms, discrimination) often exacerbate risks due to war- related trauma exposure. Commonly, refugee mental health services are limited-usually with a narrow focus on clinical treatment of PTSD-and rarely respond holistically to the needs or priorities of refugee communities; few interventions are designed for use across diverse cultures and refugee groups, despite rapidly evolving refugee demographics. Consequently, mental health service usage is low in resettled refugee populations. For refugee children and adolescents characterized by risk factors such as parental trauma, intergenerational conflict and other acculturative and resettlement stressors, preventive interventions hold great promise but are exceedingly rare. Cross-cultural application of community-based participatory research (CBPR) methods can increase understanding of risk and protective factors in refugee communities and contribute to development of responsive, flexible, interventions to promote healthy family functioning and child mental health and help prevent mental health disparities. We propose a CBPR-driven hybrid implementation effectiveness trial that builds upon ongoing collaborative research and community awareness-raising within Somali Bantu and Lhotshampas Bhutanese refugee communities in New England. Preliminary research and CBPR-based needs assessments with these groups has identified numerous cultural and community strengths as well as ongoing problems of difficult parent-child interactions, poor communication, and family conflict which interact with ongoing stressors to increase risks for child emotional and behavioral problems. Using a CBPR approach, a family based prevention model, the Family Strengthening Intervention for Refugees (FSI-R) was adapted from a tested model used in Africa and designed for delivery by refugee community health workers with through a process involving stakeholder consultation and local refugee Community Advisory Board input. Pilot data on the FSI-R demonstrates strong feasibility and acceptability, but further data are needed on effectiveness as well as barriers and facilitators to implementation by community health workers embedded in refugee-serving social services agencies. Specific aims are to (1) examine the impact of a family-based preventive intervention on outcomes of parent-child relationships, family functioning, and child mental health using a Hybrid Type 2Effectiveness-Implementation Design (families with children aged 7-17 in a two-arm randomized controlled trial); (2) identify barriers and facilitators to implementation of the FSI-R by community health workers by conducting a process evaluation concurrent with the delivery of the intervention; and (3) strengthen the science of community engagement to address health disparities by fortifying CBPR-based pathways of change via collaborative partnerships between refugee communities, service providers, and academic stakeholders. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed study will employ a cross-cultural CBPR approach to build from prior needs assessments and mixed methods research to evaluate the effectiveness of the Family Strengthening Intervention for Refugees (FSI-R), a preventative family home-based visiting intervention intended to mitigate mental health disparities among refugee children and families using a hybrid implementation-effectiveness design. Results of our trial will expand the evidence-base on community-based interventions for refugees and has the potential to be replicated to reduce mental health disparities affecting diverse groups of refugee children and families.",Addressing Mental Health Disparities in Refugee Children Through Family and Community-based Prevention: A CBPR Collaboration and Hybrid Implementation Effectiveness

"Effects of Hospital-Community-Public Health Integration on Racial and Ethnic Disparities in Mental Health Summary Mental illness is a major public health concern in the U.S. and a significant source of morbidity and mortality. Racial and ethnic minority patients experience disproportionate burdens of common physical health conditions associated with mental illness, largely due to the lack of health care access and social stigma. Effectively treating mental illness and the associated conditions will depend on a comprehensive approach that crosses health systems and policies, such as the Community Benefit State Laws, to target “Population Health” and emphasize the value of social determinants of health. However, the current mental health care system works in a silo, and evidence of care coordination on health disparities is lacking. The goal of this study is to examine system-level care coordination among hospitals, communities, and public health agencies, and to estimate its impacts on unmet health care needs in African American and Latino patients with mental illness. The rationale for the proposed research is that once it is known what specific coordination practices (e.g. medical services, transportation, public housing) and policies are most successful for different patient populations, integration of mental and physical health care delivery systems can be designed in a more cost-effective way to overcome the barriers from stigma and limited health care access. In this project, we will first determine the effects of Community Benefit State Laws on racial and ethnic disparities in health care access, quality, and costs among people with mental illness (Aim 1). Within this context, we will further identify the variation of hospital-based adoption of care coordination practices and its correlation with patient and community level socio- demographics, local public health resources, and the extent of the implementation of community benefit laws (Aim 2); and determine the impact of care coordination practices between hospitals, communities, and public health agencies on racial and ethnic health disparities (Aim 3). We will use mixed methods: (1) we will construct a multi-level data set by linking multiple nationally representative data sets and use difference-in- differences approach to estimate the impact of system-level care coordination on different racial/ethnic groups; and (2) we will investigate challenges to implementing system-level coordination using focus groups of racial and ethnic minority patient representatives, hospital administrators and providers, and representatives from public health agencies. The proposed research is significant because (1) identified practices are expected to provide evidence on how to personalize mental health care coordination for racial and ethnic minority patients to address heterogeneous preferences in mental health treatment; (2) identified system-level care coordination practices are expected to be cost-effective, which in turn can make the coordination sustainable for underserved populations. Our results are expected to break down longstanding silos and bridge the gap between health care providers, community based organizations, social service agencies, and the public health sector delivery system, in addition to providing evidence to reduce health disparities through care coordination. Narrative The proposed research is relevant to public health because results will help us identify the specific sets of system-level care coordination practices (e.g., integrating physical and behavioral health, tracking readmissions, sharing clinical information across health sectors, mental health prevention interventions, transportation, public housing) that work best for minority populations with mental illness and provide evidence to reduce health disparities through care coordination across health care sectors. This timely study will inform the critical role of system-level care coordination in emerging health policy initiatives under the Affordable Care Act and a call for comprehensive mental health care reform. Thus, the proposed research is relevant to the NIMHD’s mission (PAR-16-221) to “conduct system-level health services research that can directly contribute to improve minority health and/or reduce health disparities in health care settings”.",Effects of Hospital-Community-Public Health Integration on Racial and Ethnic Disparities in Mental Health,10021780,R01MD011523,"['Adoption ', ' Mental disorders ', ' psychological disorder ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Communities ', ' health services delivery ', ' Healthcare Delivery ', ' health care delivery ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health workforce ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Health Personnel ', ' healthcare policy ', ' health care policy ', ' Health Policy ', ' Health Resources ', ' services research ', ' Medical Care Research ', ' Health Services Evaluation ', ' Health Services Research ', ' Level of Health ', ' Health Status ', ' Hospital Administrators ', ' Hospital Admission ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Hospitals ', ' Community Hospitals ', ' Laws ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mentally Ill ', ' Mental Patients ', ' Mentally Ill Persons ', ' Methods ', ' Mission ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' mortality ', ' Patient Representative ', ' Patients ', ' Public Health ', ' Public Housing ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Social Values ', ' Social Service ', ' Social Work ', ' Target Populations ', ' Time ', ' Transportation ', ' Work ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Latino ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Medical ', ' Health Care Reform ', ' Healthcare Reform ', ' Health Reform ', ' Link ', ' Individual ', ' Policies ', ' Plant Roots ', ' root ', ' programs ', ' Source ', ' System ', ' physical conditioning ', ' physical health ', ' Health Care Sector ', ' Healthcare Sector ', ' Services ', ' preference ', ' experience ', ' hospital readmission ', ' rehospitalization ', ' readmission ', ' re-hospitalization ', ' re-admission ', ' hospital re-admission ', ' Modeling ', ' behavioral health ', ' response ', ' social stigma ', ' stigma ', ' Provider ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Address ', ' Health system ', ' Data ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Preventative intervention ', ' Community Health ', ' minority health ', ' cost ', ' Underserved Population ', ' underserved people ', ' under served population ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' cost effective ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' patient population ', ' population health ', ' social health determinants ', ' community partnership ', ' ethnic health disparity ', ' racial minority ', ' disparity reduction ', ' reduce disparity ', ' Affordable Care Act ', ' Obamacare ', ' health care availability ', ' healthcare service availability ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare availability ', ' healthcare accessibility ', ' healthcare access ', ' health care service availability ', ' health care service access ', ' health care access ', ' accessibility to healthcare ', ' accessibility to health care ', ' accessibility of health care ', ' access to healthcare ', ' access to health care ', ' health care settings ', ' healthcare settings ', ' Service delivery model ', ' healthcare delivery model ', ' health care delivery model ', ' care delivery model ', ' Service model ', ' patient engagement ', ' care coordination ', ' coordinating care ', ' sociodemographics ', ' socio-demographics ', ' ']",NIMHD,"UNIV OF MARYLAND, COLLEGE PARK",R01,2019,83605,0.0887779572828247
"Impact of peer Support on Health Services and Social Disparities Among Minority Youth with SMI Project Summary/Abstract This mixed methods study aims to assess whether peer-support reduces disparities in mental health service utilization and social outcomes among transitional age youth (TAY) age 16-24 with severe mental illness (SMI). TAY with SMI face extraordinary challenges in their transition to adulthood and exhibit lower levels of educational attainment, and higher rates of unemployment, poverty, unplanned pregnancy, substance use, homelessness, and justice system involvement than TAY without SMI. These disparities are exacerbated among minority TAY. Therefore, there is a great need for evidence-based, culturally tailored interventions that effectively link TAY to resources that can improve their mental health and social outcomes. The 2004 California Mental Health Services Act funded hundreds of new TAY-specific programs; while TAY peer support services are now pervasive in mental health programs, evidence regarding their effectiveness for TAY with SMI is largely lacking. Therefore, this study aims to (1) Estimate quantitatively whether the use of peer support reduces racial / ethnic disparities in mental health services and social outcomes among TAY living with SMI; (2) Identify quantitatively which types or combinations of peer supports are most effective at improving mental health services and social outcomes and reducing racial / ethnic disparities among TAY; (3) Estimate the additional mental health service costs or cost savings associated with providing peer support services to TAY; (4) Qualitatively elucidate TAY clients’ and peer providers’ perceptions of how TAY peer support relates to mental health services and social outcomes disparities; and (5) Qualitatively characterize barriers and facilitators to the use of TAY peer support by TAY program managers and county administrators. To meet these aims, we will survey TAY programs (N=140), analyze five years of administrative data to assess costs or cost-savings associated with using peer support services (N=8,800, Aims 1-3) and conduct small group interviews with TAY peer providers (n=30-40), focus groups with TAY clients (n=60-80), and individual interviews with as TAY program managers (n=20) and county administrators (n=6-10) (Aims 4 and 5). This study leverages a major system redesign in California’s mental health system and aims to rigorously study a large-scale implementation of TAY peer support services. Findings will help providers and policy-makers make informed decisions about the effectiveness of peer support in reducing disparities among minority TAY living with SMI and enable us to make recommendations on potential best-practices in the use of TAY peer supports. Project Narrative This mixed methods study aims to test the effectiveness of peer-support in reducing disparities in mental health services and social outcomes among minority transitional age youth (TAY) ages 16-24 with severe mental illness (SMI). Our aims are: (1) To estimate quantitatively whether the use of peer support reduces racial / ethnic disparities in mental health services and social outcomes among TAY living with serious mental illness, (2) To identify quantitatively which types or combinations of peer supports are most effective at improving health services and social outcomes and reducing racial / ethnic disparities among TAY, (3) To estimate the additional mental health service costs or cost savings associated with providing peer support services to TAY with SMI, and (4) To qualitatively elucidate TAY clients’ and peer providers’ perceptions of how TAY peer support relates to reductions in disparities in mental health services and social outcomes and to asses barriers and facilitators to implementing peer support services among TAY program managers and county administrators. To meet these aims, we will survey TAY programs, analyze administrative data, and conduct small group interviews with TAY peer support providers and focus groups with TAY with SMI as well as individual interviews with decision-makers.",Impact of peer Support on Health Services and Social Disparities Among Minority Youth with SMI,9690457,R01MD011528,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' California ', ' Client ', ' Communities ', ' cost assessment ', ' assess cost ', ' Cost Analyses ', ' Cost Analysis ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' training status ', ' training level ', ' training achievement ', ' educational level ', ' Educational Achievement ', ' Educational Status ', ' emergency service ', ' Emergency medical service ', ' Empathy ', ' Employment ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Exhibits ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Goals ', ' Group Interviews ', ' Health ', ' Health Services ', ' treatment access ', ' service availability ', ' health services availability ', ' health service access ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' accessibility to health services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Access to Care ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' Housing ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Income ', ' Inpatients ', ' Interview ', ' Justice ', ' Los Angeles ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene Services ', ' Mental Health Services ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methods ', ' Perception ', ' Poverty ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' social support network ', ' Social support ', ' suicidal attempt ', ' nonfatal attempt ', ' non fatal attempt ', ' Suicide attempt ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Taxes ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' unemployed ', ' out of work ', ' joblessness ', ' jobless ', ' Unemployment ', ' County ', ' Treatment outcome ', ' Cost Savings ', ' Administrator ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Latino ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Youth ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Imprisonment ', ' incarceration ', ' incarcerated ', ' Link ', ' Alcohol or Other Drugs use ', ' using substances ', ' substance using ', ' substance use ', ' AOD use ', ' Homelessness ', ' unhoused ', ' homeless ', ' Individual ', ' Trust ', ' Policy Maker ', ' Funding ', ' Asses ', ' Equus asinus ', ' Donkey ', ' programs ', ' foster care ', ' Feeling suicidal ', ' thoughts about suicide ', ' suicide ideation ', ' suicidal thinking ', ' suicidal ideation ', ' Suicidal thoughts ', ' System ', ' interest ', ' Services ', ' preference ', ' experience ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' peer ', ' social ', ' Quality of Care ', ' QOC ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Provider ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Address ', ' Health system ', ' Data ', ' Improve Access ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' minority health ', ' unintended pregnancy ', ' Unplanned pregnancy ', ' cost ', ' virtual ', ' Underserved Population ', ' underserved people ', ' under served population ', ' Minority ', ' severe mental illness ', ' severe mental disorder ', ' serious mental illness ', ' serious mental disorder ', ' persistent mental illness ', ' chronic mental illness ', ' Outcome ', ' social disparities ', ' Population ', ' evidence based guidelines ', ' evidence based recommendations ', ' Evidence based practice guidelines ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' evidence base ', ' peer support ', ' disparity reduction ', ' reduce disparity ', ' health care service ', ' healthcare service ', ' health service use ', ' health service utilization ', ' outpatient programs ', ' outpatient services ', ' ']",NIMHD,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R01,2019,593969,0.10147361872957482
"Mental Health Research Network III Practice-based research has the potential to dramatically improve the speed, efficiency, relevance, and impact of mental health clinical and services research. Realizing those gains will require a practice-based research network capable of anticipating and adapting to changes in mental health care delivery, including: • Research fully embedded in real-world practice • Alignment of research goals with priorities of patient and health system stakeholders • Large-scale data infrastructure available for rapid analysis • A culture of trust and transparency to facilitate collaborative learning and improvement We propose to expand the existing Mental Health Research Network (MHRN) to include 14 research centers embedded in health systems serving a combined population of over 25 million patients in 16 states. MHRN infrastructure will be enhanced to support a next-generation practice-based network, including: • Increased engagement of patients, health system leaders, and other stakeholders in network governance • An expanded public, open-source library of software tools and other technical resources • More formal processes for conducting feasibility pilot projects and rapid response to stakeholder queries • Expanded outreach to external stakeholders and research partners This Overall application requests support for an Administrative Core, a Methods core, and four research projects. The Administrative Core will support all network activities, including ongoing affiliated research projects, new research projects proposed in this application, and new projects developed during the coming funding cycle. An Organizational Unit will include executive leadership, governance, strategic planning, and responsibility for financial management and regulatory compliance. An Outreach and External Collaboration Unit will be responsible for stakeholder engagement and developing collaborations with new research partners. An Emerging Issues Unit will support timely responses to emerging scientific and public health questions. The Methods Core will support optimal use of existing methods across all network research and develop new methods to address high-priority public health questions.

"Distribution of Child Mental Health Workforce and Health Care for Children with Autism ABSTRACT  It has become an increasingly important public health issue to meet the needs of children with autism and other autism-spectrum disorders (ASDs), which are complex developmental disorders characterized by repetitive behavior and delayed social interaction and communication. Studies have indicated that the prevalence of ASDs among children has more than doubled during the past decade. Recent studies have also found substantial unmet mental health (MH) care needs among children with ASDs. While multiple factors contribute to the unmet needs, one important contributing factor is likely an insufficient child MH workforce, especially a “critical shortage” of child psychiatrists. Yet no work has been done to understand whether MH care is more accessible and patient experience and satisfaction are better for children with autism in areas with higher supply of child MH workforce than in those areas with lower supply.  To fill the gap, this study is designed to provide timely empirical evidence of the consequences of child MH workforce supply on MH care for children with autism. Our specific aims are:  Aim 1. Examine the relationship between the child MH workforce supply, by discipline, and access to, utilization of, and experience and satisfaction with mental health care for children with autism.  Aim 2. Examine the relationship between the child MH workforce supply, by discipline, and family burden of children with autism.  Aim 3. Examine whether the effects of child mental health workforce supply on mental health care access, satisfaction, and family burden differ by race and ethnicity or between rural and urban residence.  The proposed project is innovative because (1) unlike previous studies, we will examine the supply of multiple disciplines simultaneously, and (2) our structural, econometric model of physician entry and market structure is explicitly causal, thus providing an answer to the most common objections to the methods typically used in the previous studies of association between physician supply and geographic variations in health care.  The proposed research is highly significant for multiple reasons. First, without an adequate supply of MH providers, the current efforts to strengthen the public health impact of NIMH supported dissemination of research-tested interventions would not be able to achieve optimal effects. Second, some experts have called for more empirical studies of the challenging issue of insufficient and maldistributed supply of child MH workforce. This proposed study responds to the call, and it will generate empirical evidence that will provide policymakers critical information as they address this challenging issue. To our knowledge, the proposed project will be the first to assess how MH workforce supply affects mental health care access, satisfaction and family burden for children with autism. It will also be the first study to examine whether MH workforce supply ameliorates or exacerbates existing disparities in MH health care among this group of children. Despite the growth of research on children with autism, there is still a lack of studies examining how the supply of mental health workforce affects this group of children's mental health care access, utilization, and satisfaction, and their family burden. The proposed project will use large national datasets covering a recent 15-year period to examine these issues and fill the gaps in the literature.",Distribution of Child Mental Health Workforce and Health Care for Children with Autism,9994570,R01MH112760,"['Affect ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' child healthcare ', ' Child health care ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Complement ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Expenditure ', ' Family ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Growth ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health workforce ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Health Personnel ', ' Insurance ', ' Literature ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene Services ', ' Mental Health Services ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' NIMH ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' Parents ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Psychiatrist ', ' Psychologist ', ' Public Health ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Research ', ' Research Support ', ' Social Interaction ', ' Social Workers ', ' Specialty ', ' medical specialties ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' waitlist ', ' Waiting Lists ', ' Work ', ' Econometric Models ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Underinsured ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Caring ', ' autistic children ', ' children with autism spectrum disorder ', ' children with autism ', ' child mental health service ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Discipline ', ' Individual ', ' satisfaction ', ' Early Intervention ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Empirical Research ', ' Life ', ' Insurance Coverage ', ' Insurance Status ', ' Complex ', ' System ', ' Services ', ' preference ', ' experience ', ' care seeking ', ' Structure ', ' response ', ' social stigma ', ' stigma ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' developmental disease ', ' developmental disorder ', ' Provider ', ' geographic variation ', ' geographic difference ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' research dissemination ', ' research data dissemination ', ' Address ', ' Child Mental Health ', ' Symptoms ', ' autism spectrum disorder ', ' autistic spectrum disorder ', "" Kanner's Syndrome "", ' Infantile Autism ', ' Early Infantile Autism ', ' Autistic Disorder ', ' Autism ', ' Data ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' dissemination research ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Prevalence ', ' social communication ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' cognitive enhancement ', ' repetitive behavior ', ' health care availability ', ' healthcare service availability ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare availability ', ' healthcare accessibility ', ' healthcare access ', ' health care service availability ', ' health care service access ', ' health care access ', ' accessibility to healthcare ', ' accessibility to health care ', ' accessibility of health care ', ' access to healthcare ', ' access to health care ', ' urban residence ', ' rural residence ', ' rural households ', ' rural dwelling ', ' ']",NIMH,"HARVARD PILGRIM HEALTH CARE, INC.",R01,2019,332655,0.09273236210131885
"Penn mental health AIDS research center Overview Abstract/Summary The overarching theme of the Penn Mental Health AIDS Research Center (PMHARC) at the University of Pennsylvania (Penn) and Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) is to transform how individuals with comorbid mental illness/AIDS are treated and managed by developing innovative, interdisciplinary, and integrative approaches to optimize psychiatric, behavioral, and medical outcomes and achieving a better understanding of the biological, psychological, and behavioral mechanisms underlying these combined illnesses and treatments. No other center in the U.S. is currently pursuing this explicit focus, making PMHARC unique in the NIMH ARC portfolio. A substantial body of work links psychiatric disorders to acquisition of HIV infection, accelerated immune dysfunction, poor access to HIV care, and poor adherence to antiretroviral treatment once in care. Yet, there is a relative paucity of evidence-based interventions focused on the combined treatment of mental illness/AIDS and related medical co-morbidities, and relatively little work in determining the relationships between mental health treatment and HIV/AIDS disease and understanding the underlying biology. PMHARC will stimulate novel approaches and strategies to address these problems by providing mentoring and resource support for both new and established investigators choosing to study comorbid mental illness/AIDS, in part through innovative pilot studies. PMHARC's leadership has extensive expertise in contemporary pharmacotherapy of mental illness and AIDS, cognitive behavioral treatments, and theory-based behavioral interventions. PMHARC will extend well-established collaborations at Penn and CHOP, including those in the Department of Psychiatry and the CFAR, as well as with the CTSA/CTRC, the Delaney Collaboratory, and community partners in Philadelphia. A unique feature of PMHARC is the collaboration of well- established mental health AIDS researchers, well-established mental health researchers who have not previously studied AIDS, well-established substance abuse AIDS researchers who have not previously studied mental health, and AIDS researchers not previously focused on mental health. PMHARC has an Administrative and Developmental Core, and four Shared Resource Cores. Overview Relevance: A growing body of research documents that persons with mental illness are at increased risk for contracting and transmitting HIV, and there are few evidence-based practices supporting treatment of persons with mental illnesses who are also HIV seropositive. Poor treatment outcomes and non-adherence pose a major public health threat due to poor individual outcomes and increased transmissibility and secondary infections. Thus, improving treatments for persons with these comorbid conditions has major public health significance.",Penn mental health AIDS research center,9987943,P30MH097488,"['Acquired Immunodeficiency

"Penn mental health AIDS research center Overview Abstract/Summary The overarching theme of the Penn Mental Health AIDS Research Center (PMHARC) at the University of Pennsylvania (Penn) and Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) is to transform how individuals with comorbid mental illness/AIDS are treated and managed by developing innovative, interdisciplinary, and integrative approaches to optimize psychiatric, behavioral, and medical outcomes and achieving a better understanding of the biological, psychological, and behavioral mechanisms underlying these combined illnesses and treatments. No other center in the U.S. is currently pursuing this explicit focus, making PMHARC unique in the NIMH ARC portfolio. A substantial body of work links psychiatric disorders to acquisition of HIV infection, accelerated immune dysfunction, poor access to HIV care, and poor adherence to antiretroviral treatment once in care. Yet, there is a relative paucity of evidence-based interventions focused on the combined treatment of mental illness/AIDS and related medical co-morbidities, and relatively little work in determining the relationships between mental health treatment and HIV/AIDS disease and understanding the underlying biology. PMHARC will stimulate novel approaches and strategies to address these problems by providing mentoring and resource support for both new and established investigators choosing to study comorbid mental illness/AIDS, in part through innovative pilot studies. PMHARC's leadership has extensive expertise in contemporary pharmacotherapy of mental illness and AIDS, cognitive behavioral treatments, and theory-based behavioral interventions. PMHARC will extend well-established collaborations at Penn and CHOP, including those in the Department of Psychiatry and the CFAR, as well as with the CTSA/CTRC, the Delaney Collaboratory, and community partners in Philadelphia. A unique feature of PMHARC is the collaboration of well- established mental health AIDS researchers, well-established mental health researchers who have not previously studied AIDS, well-established substance abuse AIDS researchers who have not previously studied mental health, and AIDS researchers not previously focused on mental health. PMHARC has an Administrative and Developmental Core, and four Shared Resource Cores. Overview Relevance: A growing body of research documents that persons with mental illness are at increased risk for contracting and transmitting HIV, and there are few evidence-based practices supporting treatment of persons with mental illnesses who are also HIV seropositive. Poor treatment outcomes and non-adherence pose a major public health threat due to poor individual outcomes and increased transmissibility and secondary infections. Thus, improving treatments for persons with these comorbid conditions has major public health significance.",Penn mental health AIDS research center,9987956,P30MH097488,"['Acquired Immunodeficiency

"Building Infrastructure for Community Capacity in Accelerating Integrated Care PROJECT SUMMARY Although individuals from racial/ethnic and linguistic minority groups make up a considerable—and growing— proportion of the US population, they experience greater unmet need for mental health care than non-Latino Whites. Members of these groups are heavily represented in Medicaid, the largest insurer covering the most vulnerable individuals. And although the Affordable Care Act expanded Medicaid eligibility, research to date has not found that expansions have decreased the gap in mental health treatment between Whites and racial/ethnic minorities. Experts have identified a lack of culturally competent, bilingual/bicultural mental health providers as a factor contributing to the maintenance of these disparities. Similar challenges have been addressed in lower-income countries facing severe workforce constraints through the training of community health workers (CHWs), who originate from the communities they serve and have shown promise internationally as mental health service providers. However, they have not yet typically served in this role in US care delivery systems. State Medicaid-based accountable care organizations (ACOs) are forming in large numbers to provide care coordination via team-based approaches, with accumulating evidence suggesting that this strategy can greatly benefit resource-poor populations. However, many ACOs have not yet incorporated mental health services into their networks, despite the observed link between addressing mental health needs and improving physical health. Building staff capacity to provide these needed services would help ACOs implement evidence-based mental health interventions and improve the overall well-being of their assigned patients. Thus, our proposed collaborative R01 will develop ACO-academic-community partnerships in two demographically different states at different stages of ACO development and test a model that trains CHWs to serve as mental health providers within clinics/physician's organization and community-based organizations linked to ACOs in North Carolina and Massachusetts. This effort should expand ACO infrastructures and increase access to and quality of mental health care for low-income racial/ethnic and linguistic minorities in resource-poor communities. If successful, we will work with our ACO site partners to assess implementation outcomes of adoption, fidelity, maintenance, and explore implementation processes (facilitators and contextual factors) as potential mediators of implementation within diverse clinics, CBOs, and ACO networks. PROJECT NARRATIVE Despite the promise of accountable care organizations (ACOs) in transforming the healthcare landscape, a recent study revealed that ACOs serving a greater proportion of racial/ethnic minorities scored worse on quality performance measures and that 37% of ACOs had no formal relationship with a mental health provider.

"Racial discrimination and mental health: Temporal dynamics and neurocognitive moderators 7. Project Summary/Abstract Long-term Objectives: African Americans routinely experience both subtle and overt racism and discrimination in their daily lives, which contributes to both physical and mental race-related health disparities. The proposed project seeks to extend understanding of the relationship between racial discrimination (RD) and psychological distress, as well as identify neurocognitive moderators that may function as vulnerability factors in the experience of negative psychological consequences of RD. The applicant's long-term goal is to establish a research program that investigates the cognitive, affective, and behavioral consequences of discrimination among members of minority groups, with a focus on health disparities related to race in the US and identifying interventions to mitigate the negative effect of discrimination. Specific Aims: The proposed project will combine a ecological momentary assessment (EMA) approach with an experimental lab component to 1) repeatedly measure experiences of racial discrimination (RD) and psychological distress in near real time, allowing the applicant to examine temporal precedence in the relationship between RD and psychological distress (Aim 1); and 2) examine attention to threat as a neurocognitive moderator that may function as a vulnerability factor in this relationship (Aim 2). Method: African American college students will complete three laboratory tasks during which EEG is recorded to assess attentional processes elicited by different types of threat. Participants will then report incidents of RD, momentary affect, anxiety, and depression-related symptoms (i.e., psychological distress) in near-real time using smartphones over the course of 4 weeks. Significance: The proposed project integrates a lab-based psychophysiological approach with an EMA approach to incorporate reliable measures of individual differences in neurocognitive attentional processes with tests of temporal associations between experiences of RD and psychological distress. Integration of the tightly controlled environment of the lab to measure individual differences with the ecological validity of EMA permits a much richer and more detailed analysis of the associations between RD, psychological distress, and neurocognitive moderators than has been possible in previous research on this topic. 8. Project Narrative Subtle, everyday experiences of racial discrimination are common among African Americans in the US and are associated with negative physical and mental health consequences. Existing research on racial discrimination and mental health relies heavily on cross-sectional and retrospective self-report measures, limiting researchers' ability to make causal inferences about the relationship between discrimination and mental health. Investigating the temporal dynamics of this relationship to establish causal precedence, as well as identifying neurocognitive vulnerability factors that may moderate this relationship, is important in developing interventions that mitigate the negative effects of discrimination on the mental health of individuals from racial minority groups.",Racial discrimination and mental health: Temporal dynamics and neurocognitive moderators,9706644,F31MD012751,"['Affect ', ' Anger ', ' angry ', ' angers ', ' Anxiety ', ' Anxiety Disorders ', ' Attention ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Discrimination ', ' EEG ', ' Electroencephalography ', ' electrophysiological ', ' Neurophysiology / Electrophysiology ', ' Electrophysiology ', ' Electrophysiology (science) ', ' artificial environment ', ' Controlled Environment ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' indexing ', ' Laboratories ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Minority Groups ', ' neurophysiological ', ' neurophysiology ', ' psycho-physiological ', ' physiopsychology ', ' Psychophysiological ', ' Physiological Psychology ', ' Physiologic Psychology ', ' Psychophysiology ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Specificity ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' depressive ', ' depression symptom ', ' Emotional Depression ', ' depressive symptoms ', ' base ', ' psychologic ', ' psychological ', ' racism ', ' Training ', ' racial discrimination ', ' race-based discrimination ', ' race discrimination ', ' Psyche structure ', ' mental ', ' Distress ', ' selective attention ', ' insight ', ' Stimulus ', ' Individual ', ' Measurement ', ' Event-Related Potentials ', ' event related potential ', ' programs ', ' Event ', ' physical conditioning ', ' physical health ', ' Neurocognitive ', ' experience ', ' stressor ', ' university student ', ' college student ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' neural ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' member ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Self-Report ', ' Categories ', ' Reporting ', ' psychological distress ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Cellular Phone ', ' smartphone ', ' smart phone ', ' iPhone ', ' Cellular Telephone ', ' Cell Phone ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Research Training ', ' Cognitive ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Behavioral ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' time use ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' Individual Differences ', ' Affective ', ' clinically relevant ', ' clinical relevance ', ' anxiety symptoms ', ' anxious symptom ', ' anxious individuals ', ' attentional bias ', ' Ecological momentary assessment ', ' racial minority ', ' racial identity ', ' negative affect ', ' negative affectivity ', ' mood symptom ', ' smartphone Application ', ' iPhone Application ', ' iPhone App ', ' iOS application ', ' iOS app ', ' Smartphone App ', ' Smart Phone Application ', ' Smart Phone App ', ' Cellular Phone Application ', ' Cellular Phone App ', ' Cell phone App ', ' Cell Phone Application ', ' Android Application ', ' Android App ', ' ']",NIMHD,UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI-COLUMBIA,F31,2019,44076,0.057819286419742856
"Medicare Policy Effects on Mental Health Care Disparities This project will assess the impact of recent Medicare policy changes on racial/ethnic disparities in mental health (MH) care. Medicare is the most common source of coverage for elderly and non-elderly disabled Americans with mental illness. Two recent policy changes have the potential to reduce wide disparities in access to mental health care, including care provided by primary care providers (PCPs) and specialty mental health providers (MHPs). Specifically, the Affordable Care Act (ACA) temporarily increased payments in 2013- 2014 by up to 25 percent for PCPs caring for Full Subsidy dual-eligible beneficiaries. Separately, the Medicare Improvements for Patients and Providers Act (MIPPA) gradually increased MHP payments (2009-2014) by up to 37 percent for Full Subsidy beneficiaries, and reduced beneficiary coinsurance for MHP visits from 50% to 20% for other beneficiaries (i.e., Partial Subsidy beneficiaries with incomes just above eligibility for Full Subsidies). In other settings, changes in provider payments and cost-sharing have been effective policy levers in modifying care utilization and access. In Medicare, these policies could reduce disparities by improving access to care for low-income income and Full Subsidy dual-eligibles, who are disproportionately racial/ethnic minorities; but there is little data on their effects. Despite the limited evidence, 34 states dropped PCP payment rates in 2015 (back to pre-2013 levels), while 16 states have continued the payment increase. We will use the natural experiments created by the ACA and MIPPA to assess the effects of these policy changes on racial/ethnic disparities in MH care within three sets of outcomes: Aim 1) medical care and quality process measures (e.g., outpatient visits to PCPs and MHPs for mental health diagnoses, antidepressant use in major depression); Aim 2) clinical events (e.g., emergency department visits and hospitalizations); and Aim 3) total and component medical spending. We will use comprehensive Medicare claims data (2006-2018) to compare longitudinal changes for Black, Hispanic, Asian, Native American and White beneficiaries affected vs. unaffected by the policies using a difference-in-difference approach with fixed effects (within-person) estimation. To estimate the effects of each policy, our identification strategy exploits the staggered implementation of each policy, differences across states in the magnitude of the payment changes based on baseline payment rates, and variations in exposure associated with eligibility for Full vs. Partial low-income subsidies. We will compare four resulting policy exposure groups: 1) beneficiaries affected by the PCP (2013- 2014) and MHP payment increases; 2) beneficiaries affected by the extended PCP (2013-2018) and MHP payment increases; 3) beneficiaries affected only by the MHP cost-sharing decrease; and 4) beneficiaries unaffected by either policy (concurrent controls). The findings from this study have the potential to inform decision-makers seeking to reduce the substantial disparities in MH care with actionable findings, especially as the federal government and states make ongoing decisions about payment policy and benefit design. Project Narrative The Federal Collaborative for Health Disparities Research has identified racial and ethnic disparities in mental health care access and treatment as a top area needing immediate national attention. Recently, the Medicare program implemented two policies that increased physician payments for care provided to the poorest beneficiaries and reduced beneficiary out-of-pocket costs for specialty mental health care. These policies could increase access to primary and mental health care for racial and ethnic minorities with mental illness and reduce existing disparities.

"Treatment Development of Yoga for Anger Management in Incarcerated Adults In the criminal justice (CJ) system in the US, there are high rates of mental health and substance use disorders. Although prisons must provide treatment, the CJ system is resource-poor and the presenting problems of prisoners are diverse. To maximize efficiency in the CJ context, recent efforts focus adjunctive interventions on symptoms that are most detrimental to prisoners, and that are shared across diverse conditions. Of particular interest has been anger dysregulation, as this is prevalent in CJ-involved populations, contributing not only to distress and exacerbation of other mental health problems, but also to risk of aggression. Overt aggression further increases risk for prison behavioral infractions or placement in restraints or seclusion, and may delay parole or release decisions. There are many limitations to existing approaches to anger management in prison. We propose that hatha yoga could serve as a useful adjunctive treatment for anger within prisons. In addition to preliminary research showing that yoga programs may improve anger regulation, research has also demonstrated benefits of yoga for related symptoms of depression, anxiety, and trauma-related emotion reactivity and arousal. Yoga may be delivered in a relatively low-cost fashion. Finally, prisoners may view yoga as less stigmatizing than more traditional anger management interventions, particularly given its focus on physical body awareness/movement and on overall wellness. Despite a recent proliferation of yoga programs for various problems in prisons, empirical research on this topic is minimal, with a small number of studies limited by significant methodological concerns. We propose to conduct systematic treatment development research that would prepare us to study whether yoga (vs. a health education control group) is an effective adjunctive treatment for prisoners with anger dysregulation. In Phase 1 (Treatment Development Stage 1A) of the proposed project, we will refine our current manualized Hatha yoga intervention and health education intervention for specific use with prisoners with high levels of anger dysregulation. We will conduct focus groups with prisoners and prison administrators, and solicit feedback from relevant experts, in order to make modifications to our yoga and health education treatment manuals. In Phase 2 (Treatment Development Stage 1B), we will conduct a pilot randomized clinical trial (n = 40) of Hatha yoga vs. a health education group (attention control) for prisoners high in self-reported anger dysregulation. Participants will be enrolled in the active intervention for 10 weeks, and then followed for 8 weeks. We will assess feasibility and acceptability of the yoga program, the health education control group, and research procedures. To assess safety, we will track all adverse events in a structured fashion. We do not expect to see any serious adverse events definitely or probably related to study participation. We will iteratively revise manuals and materials, making final revisions at the end of the pilot RCT. If successful, this project will provide us with materials, experience, and pilot data needed for the next stage of this line of research, namely, a fully powered RCT. Project Narrative Anger dysregulation is prevalent in prison populations, contributes to distress and exacerbation of mental health problems, increases risk of aggression within prison, and may precipitate future criminal offending after release. A hatha yoga program may effectively target anger dysregulation within the prison setting. The purpose of this project is to develop and pilot-test such a program, in preparation for a larger scale study, so that we may effectively help people in prison manage anger, improve their overall mental health, and decrease the risk of physical aggression in and out of prison.",Treatment Development of Yoga for Anger Management in Incarcerated Adults,9649587,R34AT010172,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Aggressive behavior ', ' Aggression ', ' Anger ', ' angry ', ' angers ', ' Anxiety ', ' Anxiety Disorders ', ' Arousal ', ' Awareness ', ' Control Groups ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Emotions ', ' Feedback ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Future ', ' Health Tutoring ', ' Health Instruction ', ' Health education ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' Impulse Control Disorders ', ' Interview ', ' Manuals ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Methodology ', ' mortality ', ' body movement ', ' Movement ', ' jail inmate ', ' correctional institution resident ', ' Prison Inmates ', ' Prisoner ', ' Prisons ', ' Psychotherapy ', ' Research ', ' R&D ', ' R & D ', ' Development and Research ', ' research and development ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Safety ', ' social support network ', ' Social support ', ' Stigmatization ', ' Substance Use Disorder ', ' Taxes ', ' Testing ', ' thoughts ', ' Thinking ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Yoga ', ' Measures ', ' Administrator ', ' Criminal Justice ', ' depressive ', ' depression symptom ', ' Emotional Depression ', ' depressive symptoms ', ' Injury ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Clinical ', ' premature ', ' prematurity ', ' Imprisonment ', ' incarceration ', ' incarcerated ', ' Phase ', ' Randomized Clinical Trials ', ' Distress ', ' Alcohol or Other Drugs use ', ' using substances ', ' substance using ', ' substance use ', ' AOD use ', ' satisfaction ', ' Educational Intervention ', ' instructional intervention ', ' Training Intervention ', ' Instruction Intervention ', ' Education for Intervention ', ' restraint ', ' Psychiatric Diagnosis ', ' Empirical Research ', ' programs ', ' Physical aggression ', ' fighting ', ' System ', ' Benchmarking ', ' Best Practice Analysis ', ' interest ', ' instructor ', ' anger management ', ' suicidal risk ', ' suicide risk ', ' experience ', ' Structure ', ' Participant ', ' recidivism ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Self-Report ', ' Reporting ', ' parole ', ' Impulsivity ', ' Emotional ', ' Regulation ', ' Deterioration ', ' social stigma ', ' stigma ', ' Adverse event ', ' Adverse Experience ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Symptoms ', ' Adherence ', ' Data ', ' Cognitive ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Serious Adverse Event ', ' serious adverse reaction ', ' serious adverse experience ', ' Severe Adverse Event ', ' Preparation ', ' Modification ', ' Behavioral ', ' cost ', ' Outcome ', ' Expectancy ', ' criminal offending ', ' Population ', ' Trauma ', ' addiction ', ' addictive disorder ', ' therapy development ', ' treatment development ', ' intervention development ', ' develop therapy ', ' primary outcome ', ' arm ', ' racial disparity ', ' race disparity ', ' disparities in race ', ' socioeconomic disparity ', ' attentional control ', ' ethnic disparity ', ' ethnicity disparity ', ' substance misuse ', ' recruit ', ' ']",NCCIH,BROWN UNIVERSITY,R34,2019,262145,0.03410163014679546
"Effects of Hospital-Community-Public Health Integration on Racial and Ethnic Disparities in Mental Health Summary Mental illness is a major public health concern in the U.S. and a significant source of morbidity and mortality. Racial and ethnic minority patients experience disproportionate burdens of common physical health conditions associated with mental illness, largely due to the lack of health care access and social stigma. Effectively treating mental illness and the associated conditions will depend on a comprehensive approach that crosses health systems and policies, such as the Community Benefit State Laws, to target “Population Health” and emphasize the value of social determinants of health. However, the current mental health care system works in a silo, and evidence of care coordination on health disparities is lacking. The goal of this study is to examine system-level care coordination among hospitals, communities, and public health agencies, and to estimate its impacts on unmet health care needs in African American and Latino patients with mental illness. The rationale for the proposed research is that once it is known what specific coordination practices (e.g. medical services, transportation, public housing) and policies are most successful for different patient populations, integration of mental and physical health care delivery systems can be designed in a more cost-effective way to overcome the barriers from stigma and limited health care access. In this project, we will first determine the effects of Community Benefit State Laws on racial and ethnic disparities in health care access, quality, and costs among people with mental illness (Aim 1). Within this context, we will further identify the variation of hospital-based adoption of care coordination practices and its correlation with patient and community level socio- demographics, local public health resources, and the extent of the implementation of community benefit laws (Aim 2); and determine the impact of care coordination practices between hospitals, communities, and public health agencies on racial and ethnic health disparities (Aim 3). We will use mixed methods: (1) we will construct a multi-level data set by linking multiple nationally representative data sets and use difference-in- differences approach to estimate the impact of system-level care coordination on different racial/ethnic groups; and (2) we will investigate challenges to implementing system-level coordination using focus groups of racial and ethnic minority patient representatives, hospital administrators and providers, and representatives from public health agencies. The proposed research is significant because (1) identified practices are expected to provide evidence on how to personalize mental health care coordination for racial and ethnic minority patients to address heterogeneous preferences in mental health treatment; (2) identified system-level care coordination practices are expected to be cost-effective, which in turn can make the coordination sustainable for underserved populations. Our results are expected to break down longstanding silos and bridge the gap between health care providers, community based organizations, social service agencies, and the public health sector delivery system, in addition to providing evidence to reduce health disparities through care coordination. Narrative The proposed research is relevant to public health because results will help us identify the specific sets of system-level care coordination practices (e.g., integrating physical and behavioral health, tracking readmissions, sharing clinical information across health sectors, mental health prevention interventions, transportation, public housing) that work best for minority populations with mental illness and provide evidence to reduce health disparities through care coordination across health care sectors. This timely study will inform the critical role of system-level care coordination in emerging health policy initiatives under the Affordable Care Act and a call for comprehensive mental health care reform. Thus, the proposed research is relevant to the NIMHD’s mission (PAR-16-221) to “conduct system-level health services research that can directly contribute to improve minority health and/or reduce health disparities in health care settings”.",Effects of Hospital-Community-Public Health Integration on Racial and Ethnic Disparities in Mental Health,9666969,R01MD011523,"['Adoption ', ' Mental disorders ', ' psychological disorder ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Communities ', ' health services delivery ', ' Healthcare Delivery ', ' health care delivery ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health workforce ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Health Personnel ', ' healthcare policy ', ' health care policy ', ' Health Policy ', ' Health Resources ', ' services research ', ' Medical Care Research ', ' Health Services Evaluation ', ' Health Services Research ', ' Level of Health ', ' Health Status ', ' Hospital Administrators ', ' Hospital Admission ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Hospitals ', ' Community Hospitals ', ' Laws ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mentally Ill ', ' Mental Patients ', ' Mentally Ill Persons ', ' Methods ', ' Mission ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' mortality ', ' Patient Representative ', ' Patients ', ' Public Health ', ' Public Housing ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Social Values ', ' Social Service ', ' Social Work ', ' Target Populations ', ' Time ', ' Transportation ', ' Work ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Latino ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Medical ', ' Health Care Reform ', ' Healthcare Reform ', ' Health Reform ', ' Link ', ' Individual ', ' Policies ', ' Plant Roots ', ' root ', ' programs ', ' Source ', ' System ', ' physical conditioning ', ' physical health ', ' Health Care Sector ', ' Healthcare Sector ', ' Services ', ' preference ', ' experience ', ' hospital readmission ', ' rehospitalization ', ' readmission ', ' re-hospitalization ', ' re-admission ', ' hospital re-admission ', ' Modeling ', ' behavioral health ', ' response ', ' social stigma ', ' stigma ', ' Provider ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Address ', ' Health system ', ' Data ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Preventative intervention ', ' Community Health ', ' minority health ', ' cost ', ' Underserved Population ', ' underserved people ', ' under served population ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' cost effective ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' patient population ', ' population health ', ' social health determinants ', ' community partnership ', ' ethnic health disparity ', ' racial minority ', ' disparity reduction ', ' reduce disparity ', ' Affordable Care Act ', ' Obamacare ', ' health care availability ', ' healthcare service availability ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare availability ', ' healthcare accessibility ', ' healthcare access ', ' health care service availability ', ' health care service access ', ' health care access ', ' accessibility to healthcare ', ' accessibility to health care ', ' accessibility of health care ', ' access to healthcare ', ' access to health care ', ' health care settings ', ' healthcare settings ', ' Service delivery model ', ' healthcare delivery model ', ' health care delivery model ', ' care delivery model ', ' Service model ', ' patient engagement ', ' care coordination ', ' coordinating care ', ' sociodemographics ', ' socio-demographics ', ' ']",NIMHD,"UNIV OF MARYLAND, COLLEGE PARK",R01,2019,428276,0.0887779572828247
"University of Miami Developmental HIV/AIDS Mental Health Research Center (D-ARC) Project Summary (Overall)  This application from the University of Miami (UM) for a Developmental AIDS Research Center (UM D- ARC) proposes to establish a behavioral science hub advancing mental health (MH) HIV research in a US region hardest hit by HIV/AIDS. The over-arching Center theme, “Reducing the Impact of Mental Health and Minority Health Disparities across the HIV Prevention and Care Continua,” is directly relevant to the uncontrolled HIV/AIDS epidemic in the Greater Miami area, and this developmental funding will provide a pathway for dynamic growth to a subsequent full ARC application. Over the initial funding period, we will consolidate, coordinate, and augment institutional resources as well as develop and expand regional and national collaborations. Miami has the highest HIV incidence and prevalence of any US city and fares worst, geographically, on every CDC indicator of HIV impact. Developing a D-ARC focused on MH at UM is also of high public health significance, as Miami’s diverse populations face significant MH disparities, making the area an ideal setting for MH research across diverse populations disproportionately affected by the epidemic.  The organization of the UM D-ARC Cores represents a logical and innovative approach to establishing a D-ARC in an institution that has a growing cadre of behavioral scientists and a strategic goal of increasing HIV research. We propose the required Administrative (Admin) Core and Developmental (Dev) Core and two (rather than the required one) complementary Research Cores: a Methods Core and a Mental Health Disparities (MHD) Core. The Admin Core will embody Center leadership, governance, and strategic planning and coordinate the bi-directional community engagement activities that are key to the work of all Cores. The Dev Core will focus on awarding pilot studies and mentoring early stage investigators. The Methods Core will provide innovative research design, biostatistical, and data management expertise and collaborate with the MHD Core to construct, expand, and maintain Center Common Data Elements (CDE), consent-to-contact databases, and a REDCap measures library to maximize resource sharing. The MHD Core will provide expertise and resources to promote culturally competent, theory-driven approaches, tools, and interventions in ethical, multi-level, community-engaged research addressing MH and minority health disparities in HIV.  The developmental activities proposed for the new UM D-ARC have the overarching goal of increasing local MH HIV/AIDS research consistent with the center theme and UM strategic goals regarding HIV/AIDS and will leverage strong institutional support. This structure allows for attainment of our Overall Aims, which are to establish the Developmental Center, and to grow by promoting research that mitigates the impact of MH and minority health disparities across the HIV prevention and treatment continuum. The UM D-ARC has the unique potential for high-impact research addressing HIV among hardest-hit populations in greatest need and at greatest risk for falling off of the HIV prevention and treatment continua. PROJECT NARRITIVE  This proposal for what would be the first NIMH Developmental Mental Health HIV/AIDS Center (D- ARC) from the University Of Miami (UM) has exceptionally high public health significance; the D-ARC would be situated in one of the hardest hit geographic areas affected by the epidemic, at an institution with a strong and growing faculty of mental health HIV/AIDS researchers with ties to the local health departments, and to the local community. The proposed D-ARC will catalyze high-impact research efforts addressing mental health disparities, answering key questions related to HIV prevention and care starting in a domestic epicenter, with implications that can be applied broadly, and stimulate growth to a full-fledged MH-ARC. The focus of expertise and center activities on those most at risk for not achieving U.S. and U.N. end-the-epidemic goals is an excellent match for the geographic area facing health and mental health disparities driving the HIV epidemic.",University of Miami Developmental HIV/AIDS Mental Health Research Center (D-ARC),9987782,P30MH116867,"['Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immunologic Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immuno-Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency ', ' AIDS ', ' Affect ', ' Automobile Driving ', ' driving ', ' Award ', ' Ursidae Family ', ' bear ', ' Ursidae ', ' Bears ', ' Behavioral Research ', ' Behavioral Sciences ', ' Biometry ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Biometrics ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' CDC ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' Cities ', ' Communities ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Comorbidity ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Epidemic ', ' ethical ', ' Ethics ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' Faculty ', ' Florida ', ' Future ', ' geographic site ', ' Geographical Location ', ' Geographic Region ', ' Geographic Area ', ' Geographic Locations ', ' Geography ', ' Goals ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Growth ', ' Health ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' Hospitals ', ' Incidence ', ' Leadership ', ' Libraries ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' NIMH ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' Patients ', ' pilot study ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Research Design ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Support ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Science ', ' United Nations ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Hispanics ', ' Latino ', ' population diversity ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' diverse populations ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' Research Methods ', ' Research Methodology ', ' HIV/AIDS prevention ', ' HIV Prevention ', ' AIDS prevention ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' Area ', ' Failure ', ' Individual ', ' Databases ', ' data base ', ' Data Bases ', ' Funding ', ' uptake ', ' Collaborations ', ' tool ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' Clinic ', ' Viral ', ' meetings ', ' data management ', ' Structure ', ' Prevention Research ', ' Categories ', ' Prevention ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' AIDS/HIV problem ', ' HIV/AIDS problem ', ' HIV/AIDS ', ' AIDS/HIV ', ' theories ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' fall risk ', ' Institution ', ' Address ', ' Consent ', ' Data ', ' Resource Sharing ', ' Strategic Planning ', ' Common Data Element ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Behavioral ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' minority health ', ' biobehavior ', ' biobehavioral ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' high risk ', ' community partnership ', ' pre-exposure prophylaxis ', ' PrEP ', ' recruit ', ' barrier to care ', ' obstacle to healthcare ', ' obstacle to care ', ' barrier to treatment ', ' barrier to healthcare ', ' barrier to health care ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF MIAMI CORAL GABLES,P30,2019,150500,0.08198353810672049
"Trauma-informed Collaborative Care for Low-income African Americans with PTSD PROJECT SUMMARY Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is prevalent in the general population. In physician offices, one in four patients may suffer from PTSD. PTSD is difficult and costly to treat because it often requires both traditional mental health treatment and other types of care in the community to address the trauma in patients' lives. PTSD is even more common among low-income African Americans, who are also less likely to receive care for mental health problems, in large part because of barriers such as mistrust in healthcare providers, skepticism about the benefits of treatment, and beliefs about the inability to cope with PTSD. There are also practical barriers including limited access to care and lack of transportation, childcare, and financial resources that make it difficult for low-income patients to get care for PTSD. Accumulating evidence has established that collaborative care for PTSD in primary care settings is effective, but only when patients engage in the intervention with the care manager. Successful engagement may be attributed in large part to the use of active strategies to connect patients to care and motivational interviewing for goal setting and teaching coping skills. Therefore, consistent with the Institute of Medicine's priority for effective delivery approaches that engage individuals with PTSD into care, a trauma-informed approach that addresses social psychological and logistical barriers may better engage patients, enhance collaborative care, and ultimately, improve outcomes. The objective of this proposal is to test whether an enhanced collaborative care intervention that targets social psychological and practical barriers can improve care for low-income African Americans with PTSD. We propose to optimize, culturally adapt, and pilot test a collaborative care intervention that uses a trauma- informed approach to identify the active ingredients that improve treatment engagement, and reduce PTSD diagnosis and symptoms in primary care settings that serve low-income African Americans. Specifically, we will compare PTSD collaborative care (PCM) with a minimally enhanced usual (MEU) care approach for underserved African Americans. We will recruit patients at two FQHCs in New Orleans, LA to assess the feasibility, tolerability, and acceptability of PCM. We will conduct a pilot randomized trial of the optimized and adapted PCM intervention compared with MEU with 40 African American patients to evaluate its impact on social psychological target mechanisms – outcome expectancy, coping efficacy, and trust in facilitating treatment engagement. We will also evaluate the effectiveness of the PCM intervention (compared with MEU) on outcomes – PTSD outcomes and use of mental health care and non-medical community services and resources either directly or indirectly as mediated by the target mechanisms before and one year after the start of the intervention. Preliminary data from this pilot study will pave the way for a larger-scale intervention. PROJECT NARRATIVE This proposed pilot effectiveness trial is relevant to public health because PTSD is a significant problem, particularly among low-income African American patients seen in the Nation's safety net health centers. However, we still do not know enough about how to improve care in this population. Our goal is to improve engagement in collaborative care interventions and ultimately, reduce PTSD diagnoses and symptoms among patients seen in safety net health care settings. We propose to improve public health by testing an optimized to collaborative care intervention that is culturally adapted to the low-income African American population to engage and retain patients in care for PTSD. This research will also identify the key social psychological mechanisms that can increase the impact of collaborative care. ",Trauma-informed Collaborative Care for Low-income African Americans with PTSD,9775211,R34MH111860,"['Affect ', ' Anxiety ', ' Anxiety Disorders ', ' Mental disorders ', ' psychological disorder ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Belief ', ' Communities ', ' Community Services ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Engineering ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health workforce ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Health Personnel ', ' treatment access ', ' service availability ', ' health services availability ', ' health service access ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' accessibility to health services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Access to Care ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' NAS/IOM ', ' Institute of Medicine ', ' Institute of Medicine (U.S.) ', ' Learning ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene Services ', ' Mental Health Services ', ' Patients ', "" Physicians' Offices "", ' pilot study ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Primary Care ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Problem Solving ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Safety ', ' Social Service ', ' Social Work ', ' Stress ', ' traumatic neurosis ', ' Posttraumatic Stress Disorders ', ' Posttraumatic Neuroses ', ' Post-Traumatic Neuroses ', ' PTSD ', ' Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders ', ' Teaching ', ' Educational process of instructing ', ' Testing ', ' Transportation ', ' Veterans ', ' violent behavior ', ' violent ', ' Violence ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' Coping Skills ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Mediating ', ' Caring ', ' Telemedicine ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Medical ', ' psychologic ', ' psychological ', ' Individual ', ' Trust ', ' Logistics ', ' Sample Size ', ' Patient Recruitments ', ' participant recruitment ', ' Collaborations ', ' Attenuated ', ' System ', ' Services ', ' success ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' cultural competence ', ' motivational enhancement therapy ', ' motivational interview ', ' General Population ', ' General Public ', ' Case Manager ', ' Case Management Nurse ', ' Care Manager ', ' social ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Low income ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Preventative intervention ', ' Subgroup ', ' Clinical Treatment ', ' trial treatment ', ' trial regimen ', ' Funding Opportunities ', ' trend ', ' Federally Qualified Health Center ', ' Behavioral ', ' effectiveness trial ', ' cost ', ' Treatment Efficacy ', ' therapy efficacy ', ' therapeutically effective ', ' therapeutic efficacy ', ' intervention efficacy ', ' Outcome ', ' Expectancy ', ' coping ', ' Population ', ' Trauma ', ' safety net ', ' service intervention ', ' collaborative care ', ' evidence base ', ' primary care setting ', ' primary outcome ', ' secondary outcome ', ' treatment as usual ', ' usual care ', ' randomized trial ', ' Randomization trial ', ' arm ', ' peer support ', ' improved outcome ', ' health care disparity ', ' healthcare disparity ', ' disparity in healthcare ', ' disparity in care ', ' health care settings ', ' healthcare settings ', ' patient engagement ', ' ']",NIMH,RAND CORPORATION,R34,2019,226502,0.03237981537986505

Thus, the proposed research is relevant to the NIMHD’s mission (PAR-16-221) to “conduct system-level health services research that can directly contribute to improve minority health and/or reduce health disparities in health care settings”.",Effects of Hospital-Community-Public Health Integration on Racial and Ethnic Disparities in Mental Health,9966077,R01MD011523,"['Adoption ', ' Mental disorders ', ' psychological disorder ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Communities ', ' health services delivery ', ' Healthcare Delivery ', ' health care delivery ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health workforce ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Health Personnel ', ' healthcare policy ', ' health care policy ', ' Health Policy ', ' Health Resources ', ' services research ', ' Medical Care Research ', ' Health Services Evaluation ', ' Health Services Research ', ' Level of Health ', ' Health Status ', ' Hospital Administrators ', ' Hospital Admission ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Hospitals ', ' Community Hospitals ', ' Laws ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mentally Ill ', ' Mental Patients ', ' Mentally Ill Persons ', ' Methods ', ' Mission ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' mortality ', ' Patient Representative ', ' Patients ', ' Public Health ', ' Public Housing ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Social Values ', ' Social Service ', ' Social Work ', ' Target Populations ', ' Time ', ' Transportation ', ' Work ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Latino ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Medical ', ' Health Care Reform ', ' Healthcare Reform ', ' Health Reform ', ' Link ', ' Individual ', ' Policies ', ' Plant Roots ', ' root ', ' programs ', ' Source ', ' System ', ' physical conditioning ', ' physical health ', ' Health Care Sector ', ' Healthcare Sector ', ' Services ', ' preference ', ' experience ', ' hospital readmission ', ' rehospitalization ', ' readmission ', ' re-hospitalization ', ' re-admission ', ' hospital re-admission ', ' Modeling ', ' behavioral health ', ' response ', ' social stigma ', ' stigma ', ' Provider ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Address ', ' Health system ', ' Data ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Preventative intervention ', ' Community Health ', ' minority health ', ' cost ', ' Underserved Population ', ' underserved people ', ' under served population ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' cost effective ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' patient population ', ' population health ', ' social health determinants ', ' community partnership ', ' ethnic health disparity ', ' racial minority ', ' disparity reduction ', ' reduce disparity ', ' Affordable Care Act ', ' Obamacare ', ' health care availability ', ' healthcare service availability ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare availability ', ' healthcare accessibility ', ' healthcare access ', ' health care service availability ', ' health care service access ', ' health care access ', ' accessibility to healthcare ', ' accessibility to health care ', ' accessibility of health care ', ' access to healthcare ', ' access to health care ', ' health care settings ', ' healthcare settings ', ' Service delivery model ', ' healthcare delivery model ', ' health care delivery model ', ' care delivery model ', ' Service model ', ' patient engagement ', ' care coordination ', ' coordinating care ', ' sociodemographics ', ' socio-demographics ', ' ']",NIMHD,"UNIV OF MARYLAND, COLLEGE PARK",R01,2019,363902,0.0887779572828247
"Engaging Young Adults in Their Mental Health Care Through a Brief Empirically-Based Meta-Intervention Project Summary  In response to RFA-MH-16-410, this R34 addresses key NIMH priorities, 1) focusing on health disparities, and 2) development and preliminary testing of an innovative services intervention. We propose to refine and test the efficacy of a brief meta-intervention for young adults when they begin treatment at adult mental health clinics (hence, treatment and meta-intervention run concurrently). The meta-intervention is designed to reduce treatment dropout, a documented problem of significant public health concern, by helping young adults put treatment into perspective, better understand the rationale and goals of care, and address barriers to continued treatment as they build attendance routines and relationships with providers.  To date, research has focused on `transition interventions,' namely programs within children's systems that serve transitioning youth into young adulthood, some of which have extended services into the early twenties. These programs create temporary additional support for youth while they are still in the children's systems. Our research suggests a complementary strategy that outreaches to youth who have formed tentative and initial engagement in services in the adult system, but who are at high risk of disengaging due to the failure of services to take into account the unique developmental needs and orientations of young adults.  Our team developed a mid-level theory to understand the underlying mechanisms of disengagement. The theory integrates theories of service use with theories of decision-making, and suggests a set of factors (individual and contextual) impact disengagement among young adults with serious mental illness. Our intervention uses novel communication strategies to maintain the attention of young adults and impact these factors and thus, overall engagement. We use narrative communication (e.g., strategic storytelling as a means of conveying health information) to keep young adults connected to care and, in turn, improve functioning. We use a recovery role model who is a person who has had similar difficulties that young adults have as they first engage the adult mental health system. S/he leads activities and is a key resource. Although the recovery role model is related to approaches of peer support, it is distinct from and appeals to different mechanisms.  One hundred ninety five young adults (3 groups, 65 per group) will be randomly assigned to either the intervention group, an active control group (curriculum on safe relationships), or the treatment as usual control group when they first enroll in services. Assessments are taken at baseline, 2-week posttest, 4-week follow-up and at a three month follow-up. The study aims are (1) to develop and preliminarily test the efficacy of a novel, 2-session engagement meta-intervention aimed at engagement and functioning outcomes for marginalized young adults with serious mental illness, and (2) to preliminarily identify the underlying mechanisms of change for disengagement in mental health care, i.e., mediators and moderators of intervention effectiveness. We will advance theory as well as strengthen the proposed intervention. Project Narrative The proposed R34 refines the protocols and examines the efficacy of an engagement intervention designed for (and with) low-income young adults, ages 18 to 28, who are largely racial and ethnic minorities. Research has shown that transitioning to young adulthood often includes the discontinuation of mental health care and/or premature termination of services. The proposed study examines a brief (2-session) meta-intervention designed to help young adults understand how mental health services can help them, and addresses barriers to service engagement (i.e., stigma, mistrust, hope), thus improving their engagement in services and their overall mental health and life outcomes, as well as advancing theory on the underlying mechanisms of mental health decision making.",Engaging Young Adults in Their Mental Health Care Through a Brief Empirically-Based Meta-Intervention,9636620,R34MH111861,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Anxiety ', ' Attention ', ' Automobile Driving ', ' driving ', ' Behavior ', ' Mental disorders ', ' psychological disorder ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' child wellbeing ', ' child well being ', ' adolescent welfare ', ' Child Welfare ', ' Client ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' Control Groups ', ' lesson plans ', ' Curriculum ', ' Educational Curriculum ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Decision Making ', ' Decision Theory ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Dropout ', ' Foundations ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' services research ', ' Medical Care Research ', ' Health Services Evaluation ', ' Health Services Research ', ' NAS/IOM ', ' Institute of Medicine ', ' Institute of Medicine (U.S.) ', ' Investments ', ' Medicaid ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene Services ', ' Mental Health Services ', ' Mentors ', ' Moods ', ' Motivation ', ' Persons ', ' NIMH ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' New York ', ' Panic ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Running ', ' schizophrenic ', ' dementia praecox ', ' Schizophrenic Disorders ', ' Schizophrenia ', ' Social Service ', ' Social Work ', ' Stress ', ' traumatic neurosis ', ' Posttraumatic Stress Disorders ', ' Posttraumatic Neuroses ', ' Post-Traumatic Neuroses ', ' PTSD ', ' Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Transportation ', ' violent behavior ', ' violent ', ' Violence ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Latino ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Youth ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' role model ', ' improved ', ' premature ', ' prematurity ', ' Randomized Clinical Trials ', ' Failure ', ' Individual ', ' Recovery ', ' young adult ', ' young adulthood ', ' adult youth ', ' Funding ', ' Letters ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Clinic ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' System ', ' Protocol Compliance ', ' Services ', ' preference ', ' rehabilitation service ', ' experience ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' outreach ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' Modeling ', ' communication theory ', ' response ', ' social stigma ', ' stigma ', ' theories ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Provider ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Low income ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' cognitive change ', ' Address ', ' Health system ', ' Symptoms ', ' Evidence based practice ', ' Qualitative Methods ', ' qualitative reasoning ', ' Adherence ', ' Effectiveness of Interventions ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' System for Public Use ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' follow-up ', ' followup ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' active followup ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' active control ', ' health literacy ', ' care systems ', ' care services ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' improved functioning ', ' severe mental illness ', ' severe mental disorder ', ' serious mental illness ', ' serious mental disorder ', ' persistent mental illness ', ' chronic mental illness ', ' Outcome ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' Affective ', ' Evidence based intervention ', ' service intervention ', ' therapy design ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' high risk ', ' group intervention ', ' treatment as usual ', ' usual care ', ' efficacy testing ', ' adverse outcome ', ' adverse consequence ', ' behavioral outcome ', ' behavior outcome ', ' peer support ', ' racial minority ', ' service engagement ', ' ']",NIMH,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY,R34,2019,345842,0.07755633967507022
"Amigas Latinas Motivando el Alma (ALMA): A Randomized Control Trial of an Intervention to Reduce Mental Health Disparities in Mexican Immigrant Women Project Summary Recent studies indicate that 30% of Latina women in the United States are living with clinically significant depressive and anxiety symptoms, and that these rates increase with time spent in the United States. Latina immigrants are particularly vulnerable to depression and anxiety due to the many social and economic stressors they face, including: high levels of poverty, low levels of education, family obligations, language barriers, and social isolation. Latina immigrants suffering from depression and anxiety are also less likely to access and utilize quality mental health care, due to lack of health insurance, few culturally and linguistically competent providers, and stigma associated with seeking mental health care. Community-based interventions that increase coping strategies and provide social support can help reduce mental health disparities among Mexican immigrant women. The proposed study aims to address National Institute of Health priorities by testing the efficacy of the Amigas Latinas Motivando el Alma (ALMA) intervention in a randomized waitlist control trial. ALMA is an 8-week program offered in a group format to teach women new coping strategies and enhance their social ties and social support to prevent and reduce their depression and anxiety. Aim 1 of the proposed study is to refine the ALMA intervention and study procedures to ensure they are culturally-relevant, using information gained from focus groups and cognitive interviews with Mexican immigrant women. Aim 2 is to determine the efficacy of the ALMA intervention to reduce depressive and anxiety symptoms using a randomized waitlist control study design. We will recruit women from community-based organizations serving Latino immigrants to participate in the program, which will be offered in community settings. We will assess process outcomes of recruitment, retention, fidelity, and participant satisfaction through observations and in- depth interviews with participants. We will assess the efficacy of the intervention by comparing changes in women’s depressive and anxiety symptoms in the intervention and waitlist control groups at four time points (pre-intervention, post-intervention, 3 months, 6 months). Aim 3 is to assess the potential impact of the intervention on both individual (stigma, stress, coping strategies) and interpersonal (social support, social ties) factors, and whether the impact of the intervention is mediated by these factors. The research team includes investigators in psychology, medicine, social work and public health, as well as community-based organizations serving Mexican immigrants. The study uses rigorous methods to test an innovative program that integrates both culturally relevant and evidenced-based strategies to address significant mental health disparities in a high-risk and underserved population. Findings will help inform future research and practice. Given the growth of the Latino population, identifying interventions that reduce mental health disparities among Mexican immigrant women can have a significant public health impact. Project Narrative Mexican immigrant women are at increased risk for poor mental health and have limited access to mental health care. This randomized control trial study will test whether an eight-week program to increase coping strategies and social support can prevent and reduce depression and anxiety among Mexican immigrant women in a community setting.",Amigas Latinas Motivando el Alma (ALMA): A Randomized Control Trial of an Intervention to Reduce Mental Health Disparities in Mexican Immigrant Women,9699950,R01MD012230,"['Anxiety ', ' climatic ', ' Meteorological Climate ', ' Climate ', ' Communities ', ' Control Groups ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Discrimination ', ' Economics ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' Faculty ', ' Family ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Group Interviews ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Growth ', ' Health ', ' Health Priorities ', ' Immigration ', ' health insurance plan ', ' Health Insurance ', ' interventions research ', ' interventional study ', ' interventional research ', ' intervention research ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' Interview ', ' Language ', ' Linguistic ', ' Linguistics ', ' Medicine ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene Services ', ' Mental Health Services ', ' Methods ', ' Mexico ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' pilot study ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' Politics ', ' Poverty ', ' Psychology ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Research Design ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Social isolation ', ' social support network ', ' Social support ', ' Social Service ', ' Social Work ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' waitlist ', ' Waiting Lists ', ' Washington ', ' Woman ', ' County ', ' Friends ', ' Measures ', ' depressive ', ' depression symptom ', ' Emotional Depression ', ' depressive symptoms ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Hispanics ', ' Latino ', ' Mediating ', ' base ', ' Procedures ', ' Area ', ' Series ', ' Link ', ' Ensure ', ' Individual ', ' health care service utilization ', ' healthcare utilization ', ' healthcare service utilization ', ' healthcare service use ', ' health care service use ', ' Health Care Utilization ', ' Mexican ', ' satisfaction ', ' Immigrant ', ' programs ', ' Educational Background ', ' Education Level ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' interest ', ' experience ', ' stressor ', ' Participant ', ' Prevention program ', ' treatment program ', ' member ', ' social ', ' Intervention Trial ', ' Interventional trial ', ' social stigma ', ' stigma ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Latina ', ' Latinas ', ' Provider ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Address ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Stress and Coping ', ' Process ', ' post intervention ', ' Underserved Population ', ' underserved people ', ' under served population ', ' Treatment Efficacy ', ' therapy efficacy ', ' therapeutically effective ', ' therapeutic efficacy ', ' intervention efficacy ', ' Outcome ', ' coping ', ' Population ', ' migration ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' clinically significant ', ' clinical significance ', ' community based participatory research ', ' participatory action research ', ' community based research ', ' community based design ', ' therapy development ', ' treatment development ', ' intervention development ', ' develop therapy ', ' community setting ', ' control trial ', ' effective intervention ', ' evidence base ', ' efficacy testing ', ' comparative efficacy ', ' compare efficacy ', ' anxiety symptoms ', ' anxious symptom ', ' family support ', ' health care disparity ', ' healthcare disparity ', ' disparity in healthcare ', ' disparity in care ', ' stress symptom ', ' high risk population ', ' high risk group ', ' recruit ', ' service providers ', ' violence exposure ', ' exposure to violence ', ' cognitive interview ', ' ']",NIMHD,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2019,599517,0.02189400793948826
"UCLA-South Africa Center for Chronic Mental Disorders DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Fogarty International Center has recognized the need for collaborative research training programs between the U.S. and institutions in low and middle income countries that focus on chronic non-communicable diseases (NCD). In response to PAR 10-257, NCD Lifespan Award and the South African Governmental Report, Revitalizing Clinical Research, which calls for the training of master's-level students to improve their capacit to conduct addiction mental health research and provide additional clinical services, we propose to develop the Tirisano Training Project, or TTP (Tirisano means ""working together"" in Tswana). A collaborative training program between UCLA and several South African Universities and Institutions including faculty from the University of Cape Town (UCT), the University of Stellenbosch, the Human Sciences Research Council, and North West University will increase the clinical and research skills of South African post-bachelor, master's and doctoral-level students and early career mental health professionals. Expanding upon the infrastructure and lessons learned from our Fogarty-funded Phodiso trauma and health disparities research training program for South Africa scholars, TTP focuses on chronic stress and non-communicable chronic mental health disorders including substance abuse, depression, and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) across the life course. TTP addresses the dearth of South African researchers by targeting the ""pipeline"" challenge and training scholars at diverse points of the academic career path. Guided by a multi-dimensional conceptual model of risks and resilience resources over the lifespan, trainees will be provided the tools to develop and test novel models and methods to implement effective substance abuse and mental health interventions within the South African context. The Specific Aims are to: 1) Implement a short-, medium-, and long-term multidisciplinary training program at UCLA and in South Africa for master's and doctoral-level students and early career mental health professionals drawn from clinical staff working in nursing, social work, psychiatry and public health to enhance their knowledge and skills in the areas of chronic stress and non-communicable chronic mental health disorders (Track A Scholars; cumulative n=16); 2) Implement a short-term multidisciplinary training program in South Africa for post-bachelor, master's and doctoral-level students in nursing, social work, and public health to enhance their knowledge and skills in the area of chronic stress and non-communicable chronic mental health disorders (Track B Scholars; cumulative n=100); 3) Evaluate the TTP processes, including the mentoring, research skills, and career support provided, as well as the career trajectories and accomplishments of the Track A Scholars over 10 years; and 4) Assess the sustainability and integration of TTP into academic, private, and government agencies that provide substance abuse and mental health research and services. Future goals will include encouraging the South African government to support, endorse, and adopt TTP as a successful and replicable model of cross-cultural clinical research training. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The UCLA-South Africa Tirisano Training Project (TTP) seeks five years of funding to prepare future investigators to conduct research on chronic stress and non-communicable chronic mental health disorders including substance abuse, depression, and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) across the life course. As an international collaboration between UCLA and several South African Universities and Institutions, including the University of Cape Town (UCT), the University of Stellenbosch, the Human Sciences Research Council and North West University, Tirisano's public health mission is to: 1) Increase the number of well-trained South African chronic stress and non-communicable chronic mental health researchers; 2) Translate research findings to culturally congruent substance abuse and mental health treatment interventions and programs; and 3) Facilitate the building of community clinical and research capacity and infrastructure that benefit South African people.",UCLA-South Africa Center for Chronic Mental Disorders,9695268,D43MH108170,"['Award ', ' Mental disorders ', ' psychological disorder ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' career track ', ' career pathway ', ' career interest ', ' career aspiration ', ' Career Path ', ' Career Choice ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Research ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' Faculty ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Government ', ' Government Agencies ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' life course ', ' Life Cycle ', ' Life Cycle Stages ', ' lifespan ', ' life span ', ' Length of Life ', ' Longevity ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' Nursing Profession ', ' Nursing Field ', ' Nursing ', ' Discipline of Nursing ', ' Privatization ', ' Psychiatry ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Science ', ' Social Service ', ' Social Work ', ' South Africa ', ' traumatic neurosis ', ' Posttraumatic Stress Disorders ', ' Posttraumatic Neuroses ', ' Post-Traumatic Neuroses ', ' PTSD ', ' Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders ', ' Students ', ' Testing ', ' Training Programs ', ' Universities ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Training ', ' Funding ', ' tool ', ' Knowledge ', ' Adopted ', ' Services ', ' international center ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' Reporting ', ' Substance abuse problem ', ' substance abuse ', ' abuse of substances ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Institution ', ' training project ', ' Address ', ' Chronic stress ', ' Research Training ', ' Process ', ' Clinical Services ', ' Health Professional ', ' Healthcare professional ', ' Health Care Professional ', ' resilience ', ' Trauma ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' addiction ', ' addictive disorder ', ' low and middle-income countries ', ' LMIC ', ' South African ', ' Infrastructure ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,D43,2019,269033,0.02588447557425704
"Mechanisms Underlying Racial/Ethnic Disparities in Mental Disorders ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  As part of the Affordable Health Care Act, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) must develop and evaluate an action plan to reduce racial/ethnic health disparities, including increased preventive care and investments in community health teams that can benefit minority communities. But for such a plan to be effective, thoughtful targeting is needed. The proposed research has the potential to build a solid research foundation for developing interventions to achieve mental health equity that could be implemented as part of the HHS agenda to reduce disparities. Nearly 40% of the US population develops a mental disorder in their lifetime, with racial/ethnic minority groups at particularly high risk of severe-persistent mental disorders and untreated mental illness. But fundamental questions remain unanswered given that few studies investigate the mechanisms that underlie these disparities. The research proposed here aims to attend to this knowledge gap by examining four sets of mechanisms hypothesized to play important roles in causing racial/ethnic disparities in mental disorders: (1) low socio-economic status (SES); 2) childhood adversities (e.g., maltreatment, family violence); (3) disadvantaged role constellations (e.g., early child-bearing, divorce); and (4) disadvantaged neighborhood context (e.g., residential segregation, concentrated disadvantage). We propose to study four mechanisms by carrying out secondary analysis of community epidemiological data across five surveys that provide unparalleled information about the lifetime onset of a wide range of these lifetime disorders, and disparities in the persistence and severity of these disorders once they occur. We also examine barriers to mental health care since untreated mental illness has devastating effect on minority communities. But because empirical findings typically do not bridge the distance between the people who produce the information and the people who could use the information, our last aim identifies how best to frame and use our research results as actionable targets for Intervention and/or policy change. We will work with community, consumer, and policy groups to generate recommendations for prevention, service, and policy interventions aimed at reducing racial/ethnic disparities in mental health outcomes and services. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed study investigates differential mechanisms that might help explain ethnic/racial disparities in mental health outcomes and in service delivery and to integrate these findings with processes for generating projected solutions. We propose to work iteratively with community, consumer and policymaker partners to interpret, further integrate, and generate potential recommendations for interventions and/or policy proposals that can address the identified disparities.",Mechanisms Underlying Racial/Ethnic Disparities in Mental Disorders,9607120,R01MD009719,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Mental

"Delivering Church-based Interventions to Reduce Stigma and Mental Health Treatment Disparities among Latinos. Project Summary  Latinos are disproportionately affected by persistent, high levels of untreated mental illness. In California, rates of untreated mental illness are even more severe among foreign-born Latinos (67%) than U.S.-born Latinos (46%). Moreover, Latinos with limited English proficiency are less likely to recognize a need for treatment, put off treatment for longer periods of time, and access fewer mental health services compared to English-proficient Latinos. Stigma, limited mental health literacy, and cultural factors have been identified as major contributors to Latino mental health treatment disparities. Although Latinos may be reluctant to seek out mental health professionals, they often rely on religious congregations and spiritual forms of coping when confronted with mental health problems. However, religious congregations report major obstacles to collaborating with the mental health sector including the lack of mental health training, staffing, and resources. Strategic partnerships between religious congregations and community-based organizations can be leveraged to target sources of mental health treatment disparities among Latinos. The National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI), the nation's largest grassroots mental health organization has developed a host of programs tailored to the different needs and segments of the community affected by mental illness, including programs uniquely designed to address culturally diverse and faith-based communities. We propose a cluster randomized controlled trial of a multi-component, church-based, intervention that leverages NAMI's resources and programs to decrease stigma, increase mental health literacy, and improve access to mental health services among Latinos in Los Angeles and Riverside Counties.  Our specific aims are to:  1) Assess whether a multi-component, church-based intervention tailored for Latinos increases  needed mental health treatment use and support provision to individuals with a mental illness.  2) Examine whether mental health service use and support provision are related to targeted  mechanisms of change such as stigma and mental health literacy.  3) Explore differences in the effectiveness of the intervention by immigration status (e.g., U.S. vs.  non-U.S. born; English proficient vs. limited English proficient; years in the U.S.).  Nearly two decades have passed since a landmark Surgeon General's report highlighted the significant  mental health treatment disparities among Latinos, yet these disparities appear to be worsening. Partnering  with an established mental health awareness and advocacy organization makes this model highly sustainable  and could yield significant impact for the estimated 147.3 million Americans who are members of a religious congregation.

"Trauma and Mental Health Among Latinx LGBT Immigrant Youth: A Mixed-Method Study The mental health needs of foreign-born (FB) Latinx lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) youth have been rarely studied and deserve examination. FB Latinx LGBT youth are likely to be fleeing from trauma in their countries of origin, experiencing in-transit trauma en route to the U.S., or experiencing acculturation-related traumas upon arrival. The corresponding result is likely to be unusually high levels of stress and poor mental health. Add to these traumas the strain of having a stigmatized LGBT identity, and mental health burden is likely to be even more elevated. Thus, the intersectional impact of being a FB, Latinx, and LGBT youth likely leads to serious poor mental health, warranting investigation into this underrepresented population. Indeed, pilot study findings confirm that youth who are both Latinx and LGB (non-transgender) are at high risk for school and sexual trauma and mental health burden, especially suicidality. However, trauma and mental health among youth who are both Latinx and transgender remains largely unknown. Pilot study findings also indicate that FB Latinx youth (non-LGBT) suffer from high rates of trauma and mental health burden, including suicidality. However, trauma and mental health among FB Latinx LGBT youth remains predominantly unexplored. Aim 1 is to quantitatively assess trauma and mental health among Latinx transgender youth using YRBS 2017 data. The main hypothesis is that Latinx transgender youth will report the highest levels of school and sexual trauma, depression, and suicidality compared to other youth defined by different racial, ethnic, sexual orientation, and gender identity categories. Aim 2 is to qualitatively explore the lived experiences of trauma and mental health among FB Latinx LGBT youth. To achieve Aim 2, 12 FB Latinx LGBT youth will be interviewed (or until saturation is reached) using a narrative-design life-history approach, and findings will be analyzed thematically and chronologically. Aim 3 is to integrate Aim 1 and Aim 2 findings to produce a meaningful meta-inference via a convergent-parallel mixed- methods design framework and a comparative convergent-divergent synthesis strategy. The proposed mixed- methods study will be guided by the minority stress theory, which emphasizes the impact of LGBT stigma on stress and mental health, and the intersectionality framework, which emphasizes the impact of intersectional social identity membership and oppressive experiences on mental health. The study will provide one of the first quantitative subgroup analyses to date examining trauma and mental health specifically among Latinx transgender youth and one of the first in-depth qualitative understandings of trauma and mental health among FB Latinx LGBT youth. This research will help improve mental health care practice for Latinx LGBT youth (especially transgender and FB) and encourage more investigation into their mental health. Lastly, this research will help the principal investigator achieve his long-term goal of becoming an independent mental health researcher committed to improving mental health among Latinx and LGBT youth, well-position him for a post- doctoral or assistant professor position, and set a strong foundation for a future F32 or K01 NIH grant application. Project Narrative Latino LGBT (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender) youth may be at increased risk for trauma and poor mental health, especially those that are foreign-born due to their risk of experiencing traumas in their home countries and during migration to the United States. The current study seeks to explore trauma and mental health among Latino transgender youth using the latest Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Youth Risk Behavior Survey data, as this specific group has been underrepresented in mental health research, and also among foreign-born Latino LGBT youth via conducting interviews. The findings from this research will be able to inform practice in school, health, mental health, child welfare, and immigration systems that serve Latino LGBT youth (including foreign-born) and help improve mental health among these vulnerable individuals.",Trauma and Mental Health Among Latinx LGBT Immigrant Youth: A Mixed-Method Study,9990004,R36MH123043,"['Acculturation ', ' Cultural Assimilation ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' CDC ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' Child Welfare ', ' adolescent welfare ', ' child well being ', ' child wellbeing ', ' Chronology ', ' Face ', ' faces ', ' facial ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Gender Identity ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Immigration ', ' Interview ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Methods ', ' Persons ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' school health ', ' health in school ', ' Schools ', ' Social Identification ', ' Social Identity ', ' Stigmatization ', ' Stress ', ' Suicide ', ' fatal attempt ', ' fatal suicide ', ' intent to die ', ' suicidality ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' United States ', ' Work ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Latino ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Youth ', ' improved ', ' Sexual Orientation ', ' Sex Orientation ', ' mental ', ' Psyche structure ', ' Individual ', ' Policies ', ' Gays ', ' Immigrant ', ' Investigation ', ' Home ', ' Home environment ', ' Route ', ' System ', ' Country ', ' Postdoc ', ' Research Associate ', ' post-doc ', ' post-doctoral ', ' Postdoctoral Fellow ', ' trans* ', ' transgender ', ' experience ', ' life history ', ' high school ', ' professor ', ' Categories ', ' Reporting ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Sampling ', ' stigma ', ' social stigma ', ' theories ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Grant Proposals ', ' Applications Grants ', ' Subgroup ', ' Principal Investigator ', ' depression and suicidality ', ' Depression and Suicide ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' Youth Risk Behavior ', ' adolescent risk taking ', ' risk behavior in youth ', ' Adolescent Risk Behavior ', ' Population ', ' migration ', ' Trauma ', ' sexual trauma ', "" man's "", ' man ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' comparative ', ' high risk ', ' LGBT ', ' Lesbian Gay Bisexual Transgender ', ' LGB ', ' Lesbian Gay Bisexual ', ' Underrepresented Populations ', ' intersectionalities ', ' intersectionality ', ' ']",NIMH,"UNIV OF MARYLAND, COLLEGE PARK",R36,2020,60076,0.11288401063374436
"Delivering Church-based Interventions to Reduce Stigma and Mental Health Treatment Disparities among Latinos. Project Summary  Latinos are disproportionately affected by persistent, high levels of untreated mental illness. In California, rates of untreated mental illness are even more severe among foreign-born Latinos (67%) than U.S.-born Latinos (46%). Moreover, Latinos with limited English proficiency are less likely to recognize a need for treatment, put off treatment for longer periods of time, and access fewer mental health services compared to English-proficient Latinos. Stigma, limited mental health literacy, and cultural factors have been identified as major contributors to Latino mental health treatment disparities. Although Latinos may be reluctant to seek out mental health professionals, they often rely on religious congregations and spiritual forms of coping when confronted with mental health problems. However, religious congregations report major obstacles to collaborating with the mental health sector including the lack of mental health training, staffing, and resources. Strategic partnerships between religious congregations and community-based organizations can be leveraged to target sources of mental health treatment disparities among Latinos. The National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI), the nation's largest grassroots mental health organization has developed a host of programs tailored to the different needs and segments of the community affected by mental illness, including programs uniquely designed to address culturally diverse and faith-based communities. We propose a cluster randomized controlled trial of a multi-component, church-based, intervention that leverages NAMI's resources and programs to decrease stigma, increase mental health literacy, and improve access to mental health services among Latinos in Los Angeles and Riverside Counties.  Our specific aims are to:  1) Assess whether a multi-component, church-based intervention tailored for Latinos increases  needed mental health treatment use and support provision to individuals with a mental illness.  2) Examine whether mental health service use and support provision are related to targeted  mechanisms of change such as stigma and mental health literacy.  3) Explore differences in the effectiveness of the intervention by immigration status (e.g., U.S. vs.  non-U.S. born; English proficient vs. limited English proficient; years in the U.S.).  Nearly two decades have passed since a landmark Surgeon General's report highlighted the significant  mental health treatment disparities among Latinos, yet these disparities appear to be worsening. Partnering  with an established mental health awareness and advocacy organization makes this model highly sustainable  and could yield significant impact for the estimated 147.3 million Americans who are members of a religious congregation.

"Jim Crow in the Asylum: Psychiatry and Civil Rights in the American South Dr Kylie M. Smith NLM G13 Application. Title: Jim Crow in the Asylum: Psychiatry and Civil Rights in the American South Abstract:  Disparities in mental health, especially for minorities and African Americans, have a long and complex history. Jim Crow in the Asylum: Psychiatry and Civil Rights in the American South, analyzes the practices and politics of segregation in psychiatric institutions in Georgia, Alabama and Mississippi in the 1960s and 70s. The project pays particular attention to the impact of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and Medicare and Medicaid in 1965 on the operation of state institutions, demonstrating that different approaches to the issues of racial segregation had varied consequences for services in these states. During the 1960s a number of mental health professionals and Civil Rights lawyers attempted to change the ways in which services were provided and patients cared for. Alabama was particularly significant in this period as the judicial activism of Judge Frank Johnson, who ruled in favour of patients in a number of medical segregation and minimum standards cases, set national precedents. Despite the significance of Johnson's court for national mental health law, there is no existing research on the process of desegregation in the psychiatric hospitals of Alabama or neighboring states Georgia or Mississippi who had their own particular responses to legislative and cultural change. Similarly, there is no analysis of the long-term implications of the racist psychiatric thinking which underpinned disparities in these states. This project aims to expand on recent scholarship in the history of psychiatry that focuses on Northern states, by analyzing the ways in which the legacy of segregation has shaped the development of mental health services in the South. The advent of Medicare and Medicaid funds gave leverage to government and judicial enforcement of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act, finally forcing the formal desegregation of these facilities. However, underlying racist attitudes were harder to shift. These attitudes can be linked to current disparities in mental health care and to the complex relationship between mental illness and mass incarceration. Project Narrative: Disparities in mental health service provision have a long history and disproportionately affect minorities and African Americans. This project analyzes this history in Georgia, Alabama and Mississippi, focusing on the impact of the Civil Rights Act on psychiatric facilities. It examines the ways in which segregation was maintained and then challenged and considers the long term consequences of these processes for the mental health of African Americans in the South today.",Jim Crow in the Asylum: Psychiatry and Civil Rights in the American South,9880686,G13LM013010,"['Affect ', ' Alabama ', ' Attention ', ' Attitude ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' psychological disorder ', ' Belief ', ' Civil Rights ', ' Communities ', ' Deinstitutionalization ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Government ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Hospitals ', ' Psychiatric Hospitals ', ' Mental Hospitals ', ' Mental Institutions ', ' mental health facility ', ' State Hospitals ', ' Humanities ', ' Involuntary Commitment ', ' Language ', ' Laws ', ' Statutes and Laws ', ' Legislation ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Health Services ', ' Mental Hygiene Services ', ' Mental Processes ', ' Mississippi ', ' Movement ', ' body movement ', ' North Carolina ', ' Patient Admission ', ' Patients ', ' Politics ', ' Professional Organizations ', ' professional association ', ' professional membership ', ' professional society ', ' Psychiatry ', ' Publishing ', ' Race ', ' Racial Group ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Records ', ' Research ', ' Scholarship ', ' Shame ', ' statistics ', ' Thinking ', ' thoughts ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' segregation ', ' Racial Segregation ', ' Afro American ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Black Populations ', ' black American ', ' African American ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Attorneys ', ' Lawyers ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' socio-economic position ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' Magazine ', ' Journals ', ' court ', ' psychiatric care ', ' psychiatric therapy ', ' psychiatric treatment ', ' Psychiatric therapeutic procedure ', ' Site ', ' incarcerated ', ' incarceration ', ' Imprisonment ', ' Medical ', ' Link ', ' Desegregation ', ' Inequality ', ' Funding ', ' Collaborations ', ' Monograph ', ' Crows ', ' Nature ', ' South American ', ' Complex ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' Inferior ', ' Services ', ' Medicare/Medicaid ', ' mental development ', ' Structure ', ' social ', ' response ', ' stigma ', ' social stigma ', ' Institution ', ' Length ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Health Care Professional ', ' Healthcare professional ', ' Health Professional ', ' neglect ', ' digital ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' resistant ', ' Resistance ', ' operation ', ' Service provision ', ' ']",NLM,EMORY UNIVERSITY,G13,2020,49983,0.0738633293592829
"The Elders' Resilience Curriculum: Toward Building Empirical Evidence for a Culturally Grounded American Indian Youth Suicide Prevention Intervention PROJECT SUMMARY Suicide disproportionately affects American Indian/Alaska Native (AI/AN) communities, with the greatest burden experienced by AI/AN children and adolescents. A paucity of mental health care resources in AI/AN settings points to a critical need to deliver suicide prevention interventions outside conventional mental health clinical settings. Past research has shown cultural protective factor approaches will be more effective than risk- focused interventions to reduce AI/AN youth suicide. Culturally grounded (or “ground up”) prevention interventions—which place local culture and values at the forefront of intervention design, implementation, and evaluation—hold strong promise to prevent AI/AN youth suicide. However, we know little about core components, mechanisms, and constructs through which culturally grounded interventions can prevent suicide. The Elders’ Resilience Curriculum (ERC) is a school-based, culturally grounded, suicide prevention intervention currently delivered by White Mountain Apache Tribe (WMAT) Elders through monthly lessons about tribal cultural values, beliefs, ways of life, and Apache language to youth ages 9-14, a nascent stage prior to the highest risk period for suicide (15-24 years old) in this community. The proposed research builds upon the Johns Hopkins Center for American Indian Health and WMAT’s 35+ year research and public health partnership that continues to innovate and scale prevention interventions through community-based participatory research. The candidate will engage with the tribal-university partners to conduct an Exploratory Sequential Mixed Methods study to identify key suicide protective factors and ERC core components that target these factors, refine a theoretical model specifying causal mechanisms and outcomes, develop a culturally adapted assessment battery, and pilot a rigorous evaluation to test the theoretical model and culturally adapted measures to prepare for a larger R01 effectiveness study. If successful, new understanding of the mechanisms and constructs through which ERC operates to prevent AI/AN youth suicide will support replication and scaling of this intervention to other AI/AN communities suffering youth suicide disparities. The proposed K01 will provide the candidate, who is from the Cherokee/Seminole Nations, with critical training in qualitative and mixed methods research, culturally grounded intervention design and evaluation, and child/adolescent development as it relates to resiliency, cultural identity, and suicide prevention. The candidate will receive guidance and targeted training from a mentorship team of national experts at the forefront of Indigenous mental health prevention science. This K01 award will support her to become an Indigenous NIMH independent investigator focused on culturally-informed, strengths-based mental health promotion research. The proposed research and candidate’s career goals align with NIMH Strategic Objective 4 to “strengthen the public health impact of NIMH-supported research” and “identify, validate, and scale-up innovative programs currently in use that improve mental health services for underserved populations” (4.1). PROJECT NARRATIVE Culturally grounded mental health prevention interventions hold significant promise to reduce suicide among American Indian/Alaska Native (AI/AN) youth, a group at highest risk in the nation. However, there is little research to understand how core components included in these interventions impact mental health outcomes and promote resiliency against suicide. The proposed study with White Mountain Apache Tribe research partners will focus on an innovative, culturally grounded AI youth suicide prevention intervention, “The Elders’ Resilience Curriculum,” to: a) identify core components that impact protective factors against suicide; b) develop a youth resilience theoretical model; c) culturally adapt measures to assess outcomes; and d) pilot a culturally acceptable and rigorous evaluation to inform future research and scaling of this intervention to other AI/AN communities.",The Elders' Resilience Curriculum: Toward Building Empirical Evidence for a Culturally Grounded American Indian Youth Suicide Prevention Intervention,9952684,K01MH122702,"['Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', ' American Indians ', ' American Indian ', ' Belief ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' children ', "" childrens' "", ' youngster ', ' Communities ', ' Educational Curriculum ', ' Curriculum ', ' lesson plans ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Family ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Interview ', ' Language ', ' Maps ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Health Services ', ' Mental Hygiene Services ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methods ', ' Theoretical model ', ' Theoretic Models ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' NIMH ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' well-being ', ' wellbeing ', ' Program Evaluation ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Research Support ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Schools ', ' Science ', ' Suicide ', ' fatal attempt ', ' fatal suicide ', ' intent to die ', ' suicidality ', ' Educational process of instructing ', ' Teaching ', ' Testing ', ' Tribes ', ' United States Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration ', ' SAMHSA ', ' Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Research Methods ', ' Research Methodology ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Youth ', ' Comprehension ', ' base ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Mental health promotion ', ' Suicide precaution ', ' prevent suicidality ', ' prevent suicide ', ' suicidality prevention ', ' suicide intervention ', ' Suicide prevention ', ' Distal ', ' Clinical ', ' Specified ', ' Specific qualifier value ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' juvenile ', ' juvenile human ', ' Adolescent ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Spiritualities ', ' Spirituality ', ' Individual ', ' Measurement ', ' Review Literature ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Suicidal thoughts ', ' suicidal ideation ', ' suicidal thinking ', ' suicide ideation ', ' thoughts about suicide ', ' Feeling suicidal ', ' suicide risk ', ' suicidal risk ', ' experience ', ' Participant ', ' Prevention Research ', ' Cherokee ', ' Cherokee Indian ', ' Alaska Indian ', ' Alaskan American ', ' Alaskan Indian ', ' Alaskan Native ', ' Alaskan Native American ', ' Alaska Native ', ' cultural values ', ' suicidal mortality ', ' suicide mortality rate ', ' suicide mortality ', ' Prevention ', ' Modeling ', ' Adolescent Development ', ' response ', ' theories ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Effectiveness ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Indigenous ', ' K01 Award ', ' K01 Mechanism ', ' K01 Program ', ' Mentored Training Award ', ' Research Scientist Development Award ', ' Mentored Research Scientist Development Award ', ' Preventative intervention ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' Career Development Awards ', ' Career Development Awards and Programs ', ' Career Development Programs K-Series ', ' K-Awards ', ' Research Career Program ', ' K-Series Research Career Programs ', ' Research Training ', ' Cognitive ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' suicide behavior ', ' suicidal behavior ', ' cost ', ' under served population ', ' underserved people ', ' Underserved Population ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' tribal community ', ' resilience ', ' tribal university ', ' tribal college ', ' Outcome ', ' scale up ', ' tribe elders ', ' Tribal Elders ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' native youth ', ' community based design ', ' community based research ', ' participatory action research ', ' community based participatory research ', ' intervention design ', ' treatment design ', ' therapy design ', ' high risk ', ' reduce suicidality ', ' reduce suicide ', ' reducing suicidality ', ' reducing suicide ', ' Apache ', ' White Mountain Apache ', ' protective factors ', ' ']",NIMH,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,K01,2020,183970,0.04171810807060291
"Amigas Latinas Motivando el Alma (ALMA): A Randomized Control Trial of an Intervention to Reduce Mental Health Disparities in Mexican Immigrant Women Project Summary Recent studies indicate that 30% of Latina women in the United States are living with clinically significant depressive and anxiety symptoms, and that these rates increase with time spent in the United States. Latina immigrants are particularly vulnerable to depression and anxiety due to the many social and economic stressors they face, including: high levels of poverty, low levels of education, family obligations, language barriers, and social isolation. Latina immigrants suffering from depression and anxiety are also less likely to access and utilize quality mental health care, due to lack of health insurance, few culturally and linguistically competent providers, and stigma associated with seeking mental health care. Community-based interventions that increase coping strategies and provide social support can help reduce mental health disparities among Mexican immigrant women. The proposed study aims to address National Institute of Health priorities by testing the efficacy of the Amigas Latinas Motivando el Alma (ALMA) intervention in a randomized waitlist control trial. ALMA is an 8-week program offered in a group format to teach women new coping strategies and enhance their social ties and social support to prevent and reduce their depression and anxiety. Aim 1 of the proposed study is to refine the ALMA intervention and study procedures to ensure they are culturally-relevant, using information gained from focus groups and cognitive interviews with Mexican immigrant women. Aim 2 is to determine the efficacy of the ALMA intervention to reduce depressive and anxiety symptoms using a randomized waitlist control study design. We will recruit women from community-based organizations serving Latino immigrants to participate in the program, which will be offered in community settings. We will assess process outcomes of recruitment, retention, fidelity, and participant satisfaction through observations and in- depth interviews with participants. We will assess the efficacy of the intervention by comparing changes in women’s depressive and anxiety symptoms in the intervention and waitlist control groups at four time points (pre-intervention, post-intervention, 3 months, 6 months). Aim 3 is to assess the potential impact of the intervention on both individual (stigma, stress, coping strategies) and interpersonal (social support, social ties) factors, and whether the impact of the intervention is mediated by these factors. The research team includes investigators in psychology, medicine, social work and public health, as well as community-based organizations serving Mexican immigrants. The study uses rigorous methods to test an innovative program that integrates both culturally relevant and evidenced-based strategies to address significant mental health disparities in a high-risk and underserved population. Findings will help inform future research and practice. Given the growth of the Latino population, identifying interventions that reduce mental health disparities among Mexican immigrant women can have a significant public health impact. Project Narrative Mexican immigrant women are at increased risk for poor mental health and have limited access to mental health care. This randomized control trial study will test whether an eight-week program to increase coping strategies and social support can prevent and reduce depression and anxiety among Mexican immigrant women in a community setting.",Amigas Latinas Motivando el Alma (ALMA): A Randomized Control Trial of an Intervention to Reduce Mental Health Disparities in Mexican Immigrant Women,9929451,R01MD012230,"['Anxiety ', ' Climate ', ' Meteorological Climate ', ' climatic ', ' Communities ', ' Control Groups ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Economics ', ' Face ', ' faces ', ' facial ', ' Faculty ', ' Family ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Group Interviews ', ' Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Health ', ' Health Priorities ', ' Immigration ', ' Health Insurance ', ' health insurance plan ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' intervention research ', ' interventional research ', ' interventional study ', ' interventions research ', ' Interview ', ' Language ', ' Linguistics ', ' Linguistic ', ' Medicine ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Health Services ', ' Mental Hygiene Services ', ' Methods ', ' Mexico ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Politics ', ' Poverty ', ' Psychology ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Research Design ', ' Study Type ', ' study design ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Social isolation ', ' Social support ', ' social support network ', ' Social Work ', ' Social Service ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' Waiting Lists ', ' waitlist ', ' Washington ', ' Woman ', ' County ', ' Friends ', ' Measures ', ' Emotional Depression ', ' depression symptom ', ' depressive ', ' depressive symptoms ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Latino Population ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' hispanic community ', ' Hispanics ', ' Latino ', ' Mediating ', ' base ', ' Procedures ', ' Area ', ' Series ', ' Link ', ' Ensure ', ' Individual ', ' Health Care Utilization ', ' health care service use ', ' healthcare service use ', ' healthcare service utilization ', ' healthcare utilization ', ' health care service utilization ', ' Mexican ', ' satisfaction ', ' Immigrant ', ' programs ', ' Education Level ', ' Educational Background ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' interest ', ' experience ', ' stressor ', ' Participant ', ' Prevention program ', ' treatment program ', ' member ', ' social ', ' Interventional trial ', ' Intervention Trial ', ' stigma ', ' social stigma ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Latinas ', ' Latina ', ' Provider ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Mediator ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Address ', ' randomisation ', ' randomization ', ' randomly assigned ', ' Randomized ', ' Stress and Coping ', ' Process ', ' post intervention ', ' under served population ', ' underserved people ', ' Underserved Population ', ' intervention efficacy ', ' therapeutic efficacy ', ' therapeutically effective ', ' therapy efficacy ', ' Treatment Efficacy ', ' Outcome ', ' coping ', ' Population ', ' migration ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' clinical significance ', ' clinically significant ', ' community based design ', ' community based research ', ' participatory action research ', ' community based participatory research ', ' develop therapy ', ' intervention development ', ' treatment development ', ' therapy development ', ' community setting ', ' control trial ', ' effective intervention ', ' evidence base ', ' efficacy testing ', ' compare efficacy ', ' comparative efficacy ', ' anxious symptom ', ' anxiety symptoms ', ' family support ', ' disparity in care ', ' disparity in healthcare ', ' healthcare disparity ', ' health care disparity ', ' stress symptom ', ' high risk group ', ' high risk population ', ' recruit ', ' service providers ', ' exposure to violence ', ' violence exposure ', ' cognitive interview ', ' ']",NIMHD,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2020,582296,0.02189400793948826
"Lay Health Worker Mobilization to Address Disparities in Parent Training Services Project Summary/ Abstract The proposed K01 Mentored Research Scientist Development Award will provide the applicant with advanced training and skills to launch an independent research program focused on developing and evaluating implementation interventions that reduce mental health (MH) disparities for ethnically diverse families.

The community- partnered development and pilot evaluation of the LHW Enhancing Engagement for Parents (LEEP) implementation intervention will train LHW to conduct outreach and promote treatment engagement and skill acquisition for Latino families in Parent-Child Interaction Therapy (PCIT). Aim 1 of the study will assess the current context of LHW mobilization in children's evidence-based service delivery in community MH agencies through qualitative interviews with agency leaders and LHW, and quantitative surveys of LHW. Mixed-method analyses of these data will inform the development of LEEP. In Aim 2, the applicant will partner with community stakeholders to develop an implementation plan, structure, and process materials (e.g., fidelity measures) for LEEP. Aim 3 will pilot LEEP within an effectiveness/implementation hybrid design. Qualitative and quantitative data will inform the evaluation of LEEP including its feasibility, acceptability, and effects on client engagement, clinical outcomes, and implementation outcomes. The proposed study is well suited to the community setting and expertise the applicant brings to the project. Los Angeles County Department of MH (LACDMH) has invested considerable efforts in the implementation of evidence-based practices, including PCIT. The applicant's postdoctoral fellowship focused a MH policy reform within LACDMH, providing her insight into this large system of care. To meet her career objectives and the aims of this research project, the applicant requires additional training in: (1) implementation and health services research methodology to measure and reduce MH disparities; (2) application of implementation strategies and theories to inform the development of interventions to address supply and demand determinants of disparities; (3) approaches to improve parental entry into and engagement in treatment. Mentorship and consultation from primary sponsor, Dr. Jeanne Miranda (MH disparity reduction), co-sponsor, Dr. Anna Lau (MH disparities, implementation science), Dr. John Landsverk (implementation science), Dr. Lisa Saldana (economic evaluations of implementation efforts), Dr. Maryam Kia-Keating (community-partnered research, LHW models), Dr. Camille Nebeker (LHW training, responsible conduct of research), Dr. Emily Winslow (parent engagement), Dr. Karen Nylund-Gibson (multilevel statistical models) and Dr. Susan Ettner (health economics) will facilitate this training. Project Narrative The objective of this proposal is to develop an implementation intervention that leverages Lay Health Workers (LHW), community members without formalized mental health training, to increase the entry into and engagement in evidence-based behavioral parent training (BPT) programs for low-income, Latino as a strategy to reduce mental health disparities. This study has important public health implications, as challenges with engagement in BPT impact clinical and implementation outcomes, especially in underserved community settings.",Lay Health Worker Mobilization to Address Disparities in Parent Training Services,9914373,K01MH110608,"['Attitude ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' children ', "" childrens' "", ' youngster ', ' Child Rearing ', ' Parenting ', ' Parenting behavior ', ' childrearing ', ' Client ', ' Communities ', ' Consultations ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Family ', ' Fellowship ', ' Foundations ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health Policy ', ' health care policy ', ' healthcare policy ', ' Health Services Research ', ' Health Services Evaluation ', ' Medical Care Research ', ' services research ', ' Interview ', ' Investments ', ' Los Angeles ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Health Services ', ' Mental Hygiene Services ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methods ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Statistical Models ', ' Probabilistic Models ', ' Probability Models ', ' statistical linear mixed models ', ' statistical linear models ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' NIMH ', ' Parent-Child Relations ', ' Parent-Child Relationship ', ' parent child interaction ', ' parent offspring interaction ', ' Parents ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Taxes ', ' Training Programs ', ' County ', ' Measures ', ' Caregivers ', ' Care Givers ', ' Latino ', ' diverse populations ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' population diversity ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' Research Methods ', ' Research Methodology ', ' economic analysis ', ' economic evaluation ', ' Caring ', ' career ', ' child mental health service ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Penetration ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' insight ', ' Early Intervention ', ' Funding ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R01 Program ', ' Research Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Community Outreach ', ' tool ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Home ', ' Home environment ', ' System ', ' Services ', ' preference ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' early childhood ', ' Speed ', ' Structure ', ' skills ', ' member ', ' outreach ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' theories ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Provider ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' low SES ', ' low socio-economic position ', ' low socio-economic status ', ' low socioeconomic position ', ' low socioeconomic status ', ' Low income ', ' Address ', ' Child Mental Health ', ' Evidence based practice ', ' Data ', ' K01 Award ', ' K01 Mechanism ', ' K01 Program ', ' Mentored Training Award ', ' Research Scientist Development Award ', ' Mentored Research Scientist Development Award ', ' Preventative intervention ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Monitor ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' cost ', ' health economics ', ' care services ', ' care systems ', ' under served population ', ' underserved people ', ' Underserved Population ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' skill development ', ' skill acquisition ', ' ethnic minority ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' community organizations ', ' trial comparing ', ' implementation science ', ' develop therapy ', ' intervention development ', ' treatment development ', ' therapy development ', ' health training ', ' community setting ', ' evidence base ', ' responsible research conduct ', ' community partnership ', ' ethnic health disparity ', ' ethnically diverse ', ' ethnic diversity ', ' racial minority ', ' reduce disparity ', ' disparity reduction ', ' recruit ', ' service delivery ', ' clinical implementation ', ' implementation strategy ', ' effectiveness implementation hybrid ', ' effectiveness implementation study ', ' effectiveness testing ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SANTA BARBARA,K01,2020,149718,0.023926656534637606
"Adapting and Implementing Family-Based Treatment for Youth with Anorexia Nervosa in Publicly-Funded Settings PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The objectives of this career development award are to acquire knowledge, develop skills, and gain practical experience that enable the applicant to pursue independent research in dissemination and implementation (D&I) of evidence-based treatments (EBTs) in underresourced settings for youth with eating disorders (EDs), particularly by leveraging technology to increase EBT adoption. Youth with EDs are poorly served in the public sector due to lack of EBT training, leaving such youth vulnerable to medical complications, hospitalization, and a prolonged course of illness. Under the mentorship of implementation scientist Joseph Guydish, PhD, MPH and a team of expert co-mentors and consultants, the applicant will pursue training designed to 1) learn implementation science models, methodology, and analytic techniques to increase EBT adoption, implementation, and sustainability for underserved youth; 2) gain expertise in developing and testing technologies that improve EBT implementation; and 3) build expertise in minority health and health disparities research. The proposed research includes two aims that build on each other to support these training goals. Aim 1 will study adaptations to family-based treatment (FBT) for youth with anorexia nervosa and atypical anorexia nervosa by examining implementation by five clinicians with fifteen families in a county mental health system. The primary implementation outcomes are fidelity and adaptations, which will be used to further adapt FBT for Aim 2. Semi-structured interviews will explore provider experiences (n = 5) in implementing FBT for youth with EDs (e.g., implementation challenges, rationale for treatment adaptations), as well as caregivers' experiences (n = 8) receiving FBT. These projects support treatment refinement and adaptations for Aim 2, which will develop and pilot test the acceptability, utilization, and preliminary effectiveness of a web-based training (n = 9) compared to in-person training (n = 9) in the adapted FBT model. The study results will serve as pilot data for an R01 study focused on cost-effective training models to support EBT implementation for youth with EDs, particularly informing efforts to improve access to care across diverse, underserved youth. This proposal aligns with NIMH Strategic Objectives (4.1, 4.2) to improve the “effectiveness of existing mental health services” and the “dissemination, implementation, and continuous improvement of evidence-based mental health services” through research and research-practice partnerships, particularly for “underserved populations.” The carefully-assembled mentoring team, exceptional scientific environment, and proposed training and research activities will support the candidate's career development to ultimately improve publicly- funded clinical care for high-risk, understudied youth with EDs. PROJECT NARRATIVE Given the mortality rate and the significant costs associated with a prolonged course of illness with medical complications and hospitalizations, individuals with eating disorders (EDs) represent a high-priority clinical population. This study will use implementation science theory and methods to first identify needed adaptations to family-based treatment (FBT) for youth with anorexia nervosa and atypical anorexia nervosa in publicly- funded settings, and then refine and pilot adapted FBT to determine its preliminary effectiveness. By increasing the implementation of an FBT for underserved diverse youth, this study has considerable potential to improve outcomes for youth with EDs, thereby reducing costs for this high-risk understudied population.",Adapting and Implementing Family-Based Treatment for Youth with Anorexia Nervosa in Publicly-Funded Settings,9996798,K23MH120347,"['Adoption ', ' Anorexia Nervosa ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' psychological disorder ', ' Communities ', ' E-learning ', ' computer-assisted instruction ', ' computer-based education ', ' computer-based instruction ', ' computer-based learning ', ' computer-based training ', ' digital education ', ' digital learning ', ' eLearning ', ' electronic learning ', ' internet-assisted education ', ' internet-based training ', ' multimedia learning ', ' on-line education ', ' on-line learning ', ' online education ', ' online learning ', ' technology-enhanced learning ', ' virtual learning ', ' web-based instruction ', ' web-based training ', ' Consultations ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Eating Disorders ', ' Economics ', ' Environment ', ' Face ', ' faces ', ' facial ', ' Family ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' Access to Care ', ' access to health services ', ' access to services ', ' access to treatment ', ' accessibility to health services ', ' availability of services ', ' care access ', ' health service access ', ' health services availability ', ' service availability ', ' treatment access ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Hospital Admission ', ' Interview ', ' Learning ', ' Libraries ', ' Medicaid ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Health Services ', ' Mental Hygiene Services ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' mortality ', ' Persons ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' NIMH ', ' Partnership Practice ', ' Psychopathology ', ' abnormal psychology ', ' Public Health ', ' Public Sector ', ' Research ', ' Research Support ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' San Francisco ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Training Activity ', ' training module ', ' Training Support ', ' Videotape ', ' Weight ', ' Work ', ' County ', ' Treatment outcome ', ' Caregivers ', ' Care Givers ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Treatment Effectiveness ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Youth ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Family Study ', ' Area ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Training ', ' medical complication ', ' Individual ', ' Research Activity ', ' Funding ', ' Collaborations ', ' Letters ', ' Knowledge ', ' Scientist ', ' Clinic ', ' Techniques ', ' Services ', ' experience ', ' Structure ', ' skills ', ' Treatment Factor ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Modeling ', ' career development ', ' theories ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' Provider ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Health system ', ' Data ', ' Ph.D. ', ' PhD ', ' Doctor of Philosophy ', ' Improve Access ', ' Career Development Awards ', ' Career Development Awards and Programs ', ' Career Development Programs K-Series ', ' K-Awards ', ' Research Career Program ', ' K-Series Research Career Programs ', ' Underrepresented Ethnic Minority ', ' under-representation of minorities ', ' underrepresentation of minorities ', ' Underrepresented Minority ', ' Modification ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Evidence based treatment ', ' suicide rate ', ' minority health ', ' cost ', ' under served population ', ' underserved people ', ' Underserved Population ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' cost effective ', ' Population ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' implementation science ', ' high risk ', ' clinical care ', ' evidence base ', ' response to treatment ', ' therapeutic response ', ' treatment response ', ' effective treatment ', ' effective therapy ', ' health equity ', ' flexible ', ' flexibility ', ' Socioeconomically disadvantaged ', ' socio-economic disadvantage ', ' socio-economically disadvantaged ', ' socio-economically underprivileged ', ' socioeconomically underprivileged ', ' socioeconomic disadvantage ', ' learning community ', ' improved outcome ', ' ethnically diverse ', ' ethnic diversity ', ' barrier to health care ', ' barrier to healthcare ', ' barrier to treatment ', ' obstacle to care ', ' obstacle to healthcare ', ' barrier to care ', ' socio-demographics ', ' sociodemographics ', ' ']",NIMH,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",K23,2020,199098,0.006269213950581808
"Scaling-Up Stepped Care for Women's Mental Health in Primary Care in an LMIC This new R01 application responds to PAR-18-835 by advancing task sharing in testing the effectiveness and implementation of a stepped care model for LMICs. It uses nurses and mental health peers to treat depression and potential co-occurring anxiety among women in primary care. To improve implementation, this study examines the impact of clinic implementation teams in readying the clinics and service providers. The proposed project is located in Tajikistan, where the investigators have conducted NIH funded research since 2009. It builds upon and extends Dr. Weine’s R01, K24, and D43 research on migration and health and mental health, and especially his recent Global Brain R21 research which successfully adapted and tested stepped care for feasibility. Aim 1 assesses the effectiveness of the stepped care model with 420 women who have depression and potential co-occurring anxiety, recruited from 12 primary care clinics in Tajikistan, compared with standard of care plus provision of healthy lifestyle materials, with another 210 women recruited from 6 primary care clinics, including assessing mediators and moderators (e.g. executive control efficiency, trauma exposure). Aim 2 assesses whether a clinic implementation team moderates women’s reduction in depression post-intervention, as well as clinic-level (leadership support and degree of implementation) and provider-level (motivation and fidelity) moderators. Aim 3 establishes a national mental health research network that focuses on improving the standard of mental health care and access to services by building mental health implementation research capacity. The knowledge produced through this study will inform stepped care models for mental health in LMICs such as Tajikistan and in low-resource settings in the United States. In Tajikistan, as well as in other LMICs, women suffer disproportionally from common mental disorders and often experience trauma, separation from their migrant husbands, stigma, gender inequality, poverty, and access barriers to mental health services. This project will: test the effectiveness and implementation of a novel stepped care model for women with depression delivered by primary care nurses and mental health peers; examine the impact of clinic implementation teams in readying clinics and service providers and measure whether they improve implementation, and; explore how RDoC neuroscience contributes to implementation science through enhancing the evaluation and targeting of stepped care. Overall, it will develop a scalable evidence-based mental health program in primary care that could reduce the epidemic of common mental disorders among women, and augment an existing D43 and R21 research training program to further advance the implementation science capacities of mental health researchers in Tajikistan.",Scaling-Up Stepped Care for Women's Mental Health in Primary Care in an LMIC,10001626,R01MH120660,"['Amitriptyline ', ' amitryptiline ', ' Anxiety ', ' Ursidae Family ', ' Bears ', ' Ursidae ', ' bear ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' psychological disorder ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Chicago ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Epidemic ', ' Health ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' Access to Care ', ' access to health services ', ' access to services ', ' access to treatment ', ' accessibility to health services ', ' availability of services ', ' care access ', ' health service access ', ' health services availability ', ' service availability ', ' treatment access ', ' Illinois ', ' Leadership ', ' Life Style ', ' Lifestyle ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Health Services ', ' Mental Hygiene Services ', ' Mentorship ', ' Motivation ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' NIMH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Neurosciences ', ' New York ', ' Nurses ', ' nurse ', ' Play ', ' Poverty ', ' Primary Care Physician ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Primary Care ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Primary Nursing Care ', ' Research ', ' research and development ', ' Development and Research ', ' R & D ', ' R&D ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Science ', ' Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders ', ' PTSD ', ' Post-Traumatic Neuroses ', ' Posttraumatic Neuroses ', ' Posttraumatic Stress Disorders ', ' post-trauma stress disorder ', ' posttrauma stress disorder ', ' traumatic neurosis ', ' Tajikistan ', ' Testing ', ' Training Programs ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' Utah ', ' Woman ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Self Management ', ' prisma ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Lifting ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' mental ', ' Psyche structure ', ' Individual ', ' Fostering ', ' Research Activity ', ' Inequality ', ' Husband ', ' Funding ', ' Exposure to ', ' Evidence Based Medicine ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Clinic ', ' meetings ', ' Services ', ' experience ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' prevention service ', ' peer ', ' Modeling ', ' stigma ', ' social stigma ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' executive control ', ' executive function ', ' Provider ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Mediator ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Address ', ' Research Training ', ' post intervention ', ' implementation research ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' interpersonal psychotherapy ', ' interpersonal therapy ', ' Outcome ', ' scale up ', ' migration ', ' Trauma ', ' treatment effect ', ' implementation science ', ' evidence base ', ' standard of care ', ' standard treatment ', ' standard care ', ' adolescent woman ', ' adolescent women ', ' young woman ', ' RDoC ', ' Research Domain Criteria ', ' healthy life-style ', ' healthy lifestyle ', ' LMIC ', ' low and middle-income countries ', ' access to health care ', ' access to healthcare ', ' accessibility of health care ', ' accessibility to health care ', ' accessibility to healthcare ', ' health care access ', ' health care service access ', ' health care service availability ', ' healthcare access ', ' healthcare accessibility ', ' healthcare availability ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare service availability ', ' health care availability ', ' recruit ', ' treatment services ', ' service providers ', ' implementation strategy ', ' exposure to trauma ', ' trauma exposure ', ' health goals ', ' Migrant ', ' effectiveness implementation hybrid ', ' effectiveness implementation study ', ' effectiveness testing ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT CHICAGO,R01,2020,641059,0.0692971192070993
"University of Miami Developmental HIV/AIDS Mental Health Research Center (D-ARC) Project Summary (Overall)  This application from the University of Miami (UM) for a Developmental AIDS Research Center (UM D- ARC) proposes to establish a behavioral science hub advancing mental health (MH) HIV research in a US region hardest hit by HIV/AIDS. The over-arching Center theme, “Reducing the Impact of Mental Health and Minority Health Disparities across the HIV Prevention and Care Continua,” is directly relevant to the uncontrolled HIV/AIDS epidemic in the Greater Miami area, and this developmental funding will provide a pathway for dynamic growth to a subsequent full ARC application. Over the initial funding period, we will consolidate, coordinate, and augment institutional resources as well as develop and expand regional and national collaborations. Miami has the highest HIV incidence and prevalence of any US city and fares worst, geographically, on every CDC indicator of HIV impact. Developing a D-ARC focused on MH at UM is also of high public health significance, as Miami’s diverse populations face significant MH disparities, making the area an ideal setting for MH research across diverse populations disproportionately affected by the epidemic.  The organization of the UM D-ARC Cores represents a logical and innovative approach to establishing a D-ARC in an institution that has a growing cadre of behavioral scientists and a strategic goal of increasing HIV research. We propose the required Administrative (Admin) Core and Developmental (Dev) Core and two (rather than the required one) complementary Research Cores: a Methods Core and a Mental Health Disparities (MHD) Core. The Admin Core will embody Center leadership, governance, and strategic planning and coordinate the bi-directional community engagement activities that are key to the work of all Cores. The Dev Core will focus on awarding pilot studies and mentoring early stage investigators. The Methods Core will provide innovative research design, biostatistical, and data management expertise and collaborate with the MHD Core to construct, expand, and maintain Center Common Data Elements (CDE), consent-to-contact databases, and a REDCap measures library to maximize resource sharing. The MHD Core will provide expertise and resources to promote culturally competent, theory-driven approaches, tools, and interventions in ethical, multi-level, community-engaged research addressing MH and minority health disparities in HIV.  The developmental activities proposed for the new UM D-ARC have the overarching goal of increasing local MH HIV/AIDS research consistent with the center theme and UM strategic goals regarding HIV/AIDS and will leverage strong institutional support. This structure allows for attainment of our Overall Aims, which are to establish the Developmental Center, and to grow by promoting research that mitigates the impact of MH and minority health disparities across the HIV prevention and treatment continuum. The UM D-ARC has the unique potential for high-impact research addressing HIV among hardest-hit populations in greatest need and at greatest risk for falling off of the HIV prevention and treatment continua. PROJECT NARRITIVE  This proposal for what would be the first NIMH Developmental Mental Health HIV/AIDS Center (D- ARC) from the University Of Miami (UM) has exceptionally high public health significance; the D-ARC would be situated in one of the hardest hit geographic areas affected by the epidemic, at an institution with a strong and growing faculty of mental health HIV/AIDS researchers with ties to the local health departments, and to the local community. The proposed D-ARC will catalyze high-impact research efforts addressing mental health disparities, answering key questions related to HIV prevention and care starting in a domestic epicenter, with implications that can be applied broadly, and stimulate growth to a full-fledged MH-ARC. The focus of expertise and center activities on those most at risk for not achieving U.S. and U.N. end-the-epidemic goals is an excellent match for the geographic area facing health and mental health disparities driving the HIV epidemic.",University of Miami Developmental HIV/AIDS Mental Health Research Center (D-ARC),10220192,P30MH116867,"['Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome ', ' AIDS ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immuno-Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immunologic Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Affect ', ' Automobile Driving ', ' driving ', ' Award ', ' Ursidae Family ', ' Bears ', ' Ursidae ', ' bear ', ' Behavioral Research ', ' Behavioral Sciences ', ' Biometry ', ' Biometrics ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' CDC ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' Cities ', ' Communities ', ' comorbidity ', ' co-morbid ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Epidemic ', ' Ethics ', ' ethical ', ' Face ', ' faces ', ' facial ', ' Faculty ', ' Florida ', ' Future ', ' Geographic Locations ', ' Geographic Area ', ' Geographic Region ', ' Geographical Location ', ' geographic site ', ' Geography ', ' Goals ', ' Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Health ', ' HIV ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Hospitals ', ' Incidence ', ' Leadership ', ' Libraries ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' NIMH ', ' Patients ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Research Design ', ' Study Type ', ' study design ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Research Support ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Science ', ' United Nations ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Latino Population ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' hispanic community ', ' Hispanics ', ' Latino ', ' diverse populations ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' population diversity ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' Research Methods ', ' Research Methodology ', ' HIV Prevention ', ' HIV/AIDS prevention ', ' AIDS prevention ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' Area ', ' Failure ', ' Individual ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Databases ', ' Funding ', ' uptake ', ' Collaborations ', ' tool ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' Clinic ', ' Viral ', ' meetings ', ' data management ', ' Structure ', ' Prevention Research ', ' Categories ', ' Prevention ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' AIDS/HIV ', ' HIV/AIDS ', ' HIV/AIDS problem ', ' AIDS/HIV problem ', ' theories ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' fall risk ', ' Institution ', ' Address ', ' Consent ', ' Data ', ' Resource Sharing ', ' Strategic Planning ', ' Common Data Element ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' minority health ', ' biobehavioral ', ' biobehavior ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' high risk ', ' community partnership ', ' PrEP ', ' pre-exposure prophylaxis ', ' recruit ', ' barrier to health care ', ' barrier to healthcare ', ' barrier to treatment ', ' obstacle to care ', ' obstacle to healthcare ', ' barrier to care ', ' social structural ', ' socio-structural ', ' sociostructural ', ' social structure ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF MIAMI CORAL GABLES,P30,2020,301000,0.08198353810672049

"COVID-19 supplement to a computational examination of threat and reward constructs in a predominantly low-income, longitudinal sample at increased risk for internalizing disorders Abstract The novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has had a far-reaching impact on the US population, and has disproportionately affected race-ethnic minorities, individuals living in or near poverty, and those living in large urban areas. Based on past literature we expect COVID-19 related stressors to have large negative effects on mental health, but we do not yet understand how social and economic factors might moderate those effects. The current supplement would add time-sensitive data by collecting real-time online surveys of both target young adults and their parents (n=1,200) in a representative sample of a disadvantaged population. To better understand how major stressors, like the COVID-19 pandemic, are moderated, we must assess these social, occupational, economic, health, and mental health impacts as they happen, across different cities/states (with different pandemic policies) and in those most at-risk for poor outcomes: low-income and minority families and young adults who are showing disparities in infection and mortality. Thus, by adding this critical, time-sensitive assessment, we will be even better positioned to understand how adversity shapes the ongoing development of RDoC threat and reward circuits, as well as a broader assessment of how COVID-19 is impacting mental health in marginalized, low-income, minority populations. Moreover, we will document the way in which resilience factors including social support, economic policies, and family resources moderate the negative effect of COVID-19 related stressors on mental health. This builds on the parent grant's focus to use data- driven analytics and hypothesis testing to validate multilevel-multimodal models of Threat and Reward constructs in an existing representative longitudinal cohort at risk for psychopathology and to delineate how a history of exposure to adversity links to these domains. The parent grant is assessing 600 young adults twice (at age 20 and 24) from The Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study (FFCWS), an ongoing study of 4900 children born 1998-200 in large US cities. Attributes of the FFCWS are: 1) parents and children were surveyed and assessed at birth, 1, 3, 5, 9, 15 years; 2) the sample is nationally representative; 3) Substantial enrichment for low-income (median income to needs ratio=1.4) and minority families (66%), populations are often under- represented in research; and 4) participants are entering early adulthood, a period of heightened risk for psychopathology. Because of the unique social distancing required by COVID-19, having data from multiple family members will be particularly powerful in understanding the economic and social, and in turn, mental health consequences of COVID-19. To predict internalizing symptoms, we will identify biotypes cross- sectionally and longitudinally.

"Latino Youths Coping with Discrimination: A Multi-Level Investigation in Micro- and Macro-Time Project Summary  Exposure to discrimination-related stressors (e.g., racial/ethnic discrimination, unfair treatment) continues to pose a public health challenge to minority populations as a social determinant of health. Although discrimination-related stressors have been consistently associated with poor mental health outcomes, there is a critical need to identify mechanisms and malleable risk/protective factors to integrate in the design of community and clinical interventions. The overall objective of this R01 application is to investigate mediators and moderators at multiple ecological (individual, family/peer and school/neighborhood levels) and time-scale (micro- and macro-time) levels in the link between discrimination-related stressors and mental health among 340 Mexican-origin youth. Guided by a socioecological, life course perspective, the proposed project has three specific aims: (1) determine within-person discrimination-related stressors that impact Mexican-American origin youth’s mental health outcomes as well as the mechanisms of action at both micro- and macro-time levels; (2) identify protective factors that could help youth to successfully cope with discrimination-related stressors and the conditions under which those protective factors work; and (3) elucidate the youth, parent, and neighborhood risk factors that moderate the link between discrimination-related stressors and mental health in youth.  The project’s long-term goal is to improve the mental health of Mexican-origin youth by reducing the deleterious effects of racism, “othering,” and negative neighborhood interactions. The central hypothesis is that this link will be mediated by cognitive and/or affective mechanisms (i.e. anger, hypervigilance, emotion regulation, low social position as threats to self-worth) and moderated by coping resources (parental adaptation and racial socialization) and family, peer, and neighborhood supports, thus representing multiple ecological levels. Community-based collaboration will help ensure recruitment of the targeted sample of Mexican-origin adolescents, mothers, and fathers; the inclusion of fathers will be a valuable contribution to the literature, given the dearth of studies on Latinx fathers/stepfathers. Through the innovative integration of both yearly longitudinal (macro-time) and daily diary (micro-time) research design features, important questions about how mediating and moderating processes unfold over time will be addressed. The proposed analyses also reflect the multi-layered sociocultural niches occupied by Latinx adolescents by employing individual-level methods as well as dyadic (adolescent-mother; adolescent-father) and triadic (adolescent-mother-father) analyses to test key study hypotheses. Considering the current growth of Latinx immigrants, it is imperative to test a socioecological model of risk and resilience for Mexican-origin adolescents that is responsive to both their immediate context and the larger global forces around migration. This research is highly translational in that it will facilitate the development of more effective, culturally sensitive prevention and intervention strategies for Latinx youth and their families. Project Narrative Few longitudinal studies have explored why and how discrimination-related stressors for Latinx youth, the largest minority group (17.9 million under the age of 18), convey risk for negative mental health outcomes, and the mechanisms leading to or moderating such risk. This revised R01 aims to evaluate specific malleable risk and protective factors at multiple ecological levels so that findings can aid in the development of targeted, culturally sensitive preventive interventions.",Latino Youths Coping with Discrimination: A Multi-Level Investigation in Micro- and Macro-Time,10052270,R01MD014737,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Anger ', ' angers ', ' angry ', ' Attention ', ' Buffers ', ' Communities ', ' Conflict (Psychology) ', ' Conflict ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Environment ', ' Ethnic group ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Family ', ' Fathers ', ' Goals ', ' Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Health ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Indiana ', ' Life Cycle Stages ', ' Life Cycle ', ' life course ', ' Literature ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' longitudinal outcome studies ', ' longterm study ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Mexican Americans ', ' Chicanas ', ' Chicanos ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Theoretical model ', ' Theoretic Models ', ' Persons ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Parents ', ' Play ', ' Public Health ', ' Puerto Rican ', ' Race ', ' Racial Group ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Research ', ' Research Design ', ' Study Type ', ' study design ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Schools ', ' Sleep ', ' Social Environment ', ' social climate ', ' social context ', ' socioenvironment ', ' socioenvironmental ', ' Social Interaction ', ' Social Mobility ', ' Socialization ', ' Stress ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Triad Acrylic Resin ', ' Triad ', ' Triad resin ', ' Criminal Justice ', ' Latino ', ' Mediating ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Youth ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Acute ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' juvenile ', ' juvenile human ', ' Adolescent ', ' racism ', ' Link ', ' Ensure ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Predisposition ', ' Individual ', ' adolescent mother ', ' teen mom ', ' teen mother ', ' teenage mom ', ' teenage mother ', ' Mexican ', ' Rural ', ' Collaborations ', ' Immigrant ', ' Exposure to ', ' Research Priority ', ' diaries ', ' Investigation ', ' Dimensions ', ' Home ', ' Home environment ', ' Country ', ' experience ', ' stressor ', ' mental development ', ' peer ', ' social position ', ' social standing ', ' Social status ', ' sleep diseases ', ' sleep dysfunction ', ' sleep dysregulation ', ' sleep problem ', ' Sleep Disorders ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' ethnic discrimination ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Mediator ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Address ', ' Mechanisms of Behavior and Behavior Change ', ' behavior mechanism ', ' Behavioral Mechanisms ', ' Preventative intervention ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' Cognitive ', ' Seminal ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Minority ', ' resilience ', ' Outcome ', ' coping ', ' Population ', ' migration ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' malleable risk ', ' ethnic minority ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' Affective ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' emotional regulation ', ' emotion regulation ', ' social health determinants ', ' racial minority ', ' recruit ', ' protective factors ', ' Migrant ', ' socio-cultural ', ' sociocultural ', ' social culture ', ' ']",NIMHD,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R01,2020,717460,0.005920206098210185
"Development and Pilot Testing of a Remote Training Strategy for the Implementation of Mental Health Evidence-Based Practices in Rural K-8 Schools PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Rural areas have fewer, and less well trained, health care providers than non-rural areas. Schools have become more involved in the delivery of mental health services and hold great potential for increasing access to children and adolescents. Innovations in training and service delivery are needed to improve mental health care quality and availability in rural schools. Evidence-based practices (EBPs) can be incorporated into school- wide multi-tiered systems that are currently used to improve school climate and safety. School-wide Positive Behavioral Interventions and Supports (PBIS), a service-delivery strategy based on the public health model is one example. A growing number of schools in rural areas are employing PBIS. Our research team has used PBIS to incorporate EBPs at Tier 2 for children with, or at risk for, mental health disorders. Given the large service disparities for children in rural areas, offering EBPs through PBIS can improve access and lead to better long-term outcomes. School personnel, with or without prior mental health training, can implement Tier 2 interventions with fidelity and clinical effectiveness if given adequate consultation support. In urban and suburban schools, this support can be provided to school staff on site. However, providing ongoing on-site support is not feasible or sustainable in rural schools, due to their remote physical location. For this reason, telehealth technology has been recommended for the training of behavioral health staff (BHS) in under-served rural communities. The purpose of this study is to use an iterative process (Rapid Prototyping) to develop and evaluate the appropriateness, feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of a remote training strategy that provides resources to support use of Tier 2 EBPs and effective support for care coordination practices in rural schools. Participants will be school personnel with and without prior mental health training and K-8 students in rural schools in Pennsylvania who are deemed at risk for externalizing and internalizing mental health disorders. The Aims of the study are to (1) obtain input from school stakeholders employing community-based participatory research, (2) use the iterative rapid prototyping approach to develop an asynchronous and synchronous remote training strategy based on preliminary studies and Aim 1 data, and (3) conduct a pilot trial of a remote training strategy vs. a control condition. The study will employ a pragmatic design comprised of a mixed-method approach for Aims 1-2, and a pilot randomized clinical trial for Aim 3. Participants will be 68 behavioral health staff and 156 children in grades K- 8. The interventions to be implemented by school personnel are EBPs for the most common externalizing and internalizing mental health disorders. Our guiding framework is the Interactive Systems Framework for dissemination and implementation research. We will use data from this study to submit an R01 grant proposal to test the effectiveness of a free-standing online training platform with a large number of rural schools. PROJECT NARRATIVE This study is likely to result in a feasible and effective strategy for the training of behavioral health staff and other school personnel in under-resourced rural schools. Linking PBIS with state-of-the-art mental health supports and well-trained school personnel will likely lead to improvement and sustainment of student mental health and academic engagement in rural schools.",Development and Pilot Testing of a Remote Training Strategy for the Implementation of Mental Health Evidence-Based Practices in Rural K-8 Schools,10088734,R18HS027755,[''],AHRQ,CHILDREN'S HOSP OF PHILADELPHIA,R18,2020,399999,0.11648699524578567
"Simulated Conversation Training for Mental Healthcare Providers to Improve Care for Transgender and Gender Nonconforming Individuals. ABSTRACT SIMmersion LLC, in collaboration with Drs. Galupo, Schmidt, Matsuno, Bettergarcia, Hernández, Mastroleo, and Kukucka, is proposing to develop and evaluate Training Trans-Affirmative Communication Skills (TTACS), a suite of conversation simulations that provide mental health care providers with experience working with Transgender and gender nonconforming (TGNC) individuals. The proposed product utilizes SIMmersion’s PeopleSim® conversation software that has already been proven to improve clinical skills in a variety of areas. The diverse development team, which includes TGNC individuals and people of color at every level of input (including Key Personnel, Expert Panel, Actors, Focus Group, and Community Partners) will design and create four modules within TTACS that allow mental health care clinicians and clinicians-in-training to develop gender- affirming communication skills for clients with diverse needs. TTACS modules will focus on Intake, Traditional Needs, High-Risk Needs, and Social and Physical Transitions, and the fictional characters in the training will be represented by a diverse group of actors from the trans community. The proposed TTACS provides an innovative response to the call for training initiatives for implementing the American Psychological Association (APA) guidelines for trans-affirmative, culturally competent, and developmentally appropriate care into psychological practice for TGNC people. During Phase I of the fast-track research, the team will evaluate the feasibility of using a PeopleSim training to improve clinicians’ skills at meeting the needs of TGNC individuals. The team will create a design plan for the entire TTACS system (Aim 1), develop the Intake module (Aim 2), conduct a within-group pre-post knowledge assessment with clinicians-in-training (Aim 3a), and a focus group discussion with key decision makers and supervisors (Aim 3b). Success in Phase I will lead directly into Phase II development of the remaining TTACS modules (Aim 1) and the development of Standardized Patient Scenarios and checklists for evaluating the skills of clinicians-in-training working with TGNC clients (Aim 2), which will be used in a Randomized Controlled Trial (Aim 3) with 100 students enrolled in clinical and counseling psychology graduate programs. The team plans to begin commercializing TTACS (Aim 4) to university programs, independent training organizations, health care centers, and professional organizations, starting with the individuals and organizations that provided letters of support. If successful, the proposed research could help reduce the patterns of mistreatment, discrimination, and physical and mental health disparities TGNC individuals experience when they seek mental health care. PROJECT NARRATIVE Transgender and Gender Nonconforming (TGNC) individuals experience both physical and mental health disparities when compared to their cisgender counterparts. The skills required to provide gender-affirming, culturally competent care require extensive practice with feedback, which is difficult to obtain. The proposed research will produce an innovative training tool with the potential to increase learning and retention of knowledge, skills, awareness, and cultural competency among clinicians, thereby benefiting their TGNC clients and reducing the disparities they experience in health care settings.",Simulated Conversation Training for Mental Healthcare Providers to Improve Care for Transgender and Gender Nonconforming Individuals.,9993732,R44MD014112,"['American Psychological Association ', ' Award ', ' Awareness ', ' Client ', ' Clinical Skills ', ' Color ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' Control Groups ', ' Counseling ', ' Cues ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Face ', ' faces ', ' facial ', ' Feedback ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Future ', ' Grant ', ' Health Personnel ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' health care worker ', ' health provider ', ' health workforce ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' medical personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Learning ', ' Logic ', ' Marketing ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Names ', ' Client satisfaction ', ' Patient Satisfaction ', ' Patients ', ' Play ', ' Prejudice ', ' Professional Organizations ', ' professional association ', ' professional membership ', ' professional society ', ' Psychology ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Standardization ', ' Students ', ' Educational process of instructing ', ' Teaching ', ' Technology ', ' Training Activity ', ' training module ', ' Universities ', ' Writing ', ' Gender ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Caring ', ' Guidelines ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' psychological ', ' psychologic ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' satisfaction ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R01 Program ', ' Research Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Collaborations ', ' Letters ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' tool ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Hour ', ' Severities ', ' Complex ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' physical health ', ' physical conditioning ', ' meetings ', ' trans* ', ' transgender ', ' skills training ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' skills ', ' simulation ', ' Participant ', ' cultural competence ', ' help seeking ', ' help-seeking behavior ', ' Manpower ', ' personnel ', ' Human Resources ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' gatekeeper ', ' Gatekeeping ', ' medically necessary ', ' medically necessary care ', ' response ', ' Dehumanization ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Voice Recognition Software ', ' Speech Recognition Software ', ' Symptoms ', ' Educational Materials ', ' Intake ', ' Interruption ', ' randomisation ', ' randomization ', ' randomly assigned ', ' Randomized ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Health Care Professional ', ' Healthcare professional ', ' Health Professional ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' mistreatment ', ' maltreatment ', ' Outcome ', ' cost effective ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' skill development ', ' skill acquisition ', ' commercialization ', ' high risk ', ' mental training ', ' gender non-conforming ', ' non-gender conforming ', ' gender nonconforming ', ' Business-Friendly Atmosphere ', ' business-friendly environment ', ' collaborative atmosphere ', ' interactive atmosphere ', ' interactive environment ', ' interdisciplinary atmosphere ', ' interdisciplinary environment ', ' peer-group atmosphere ', ' peer-group environment ', ' collaborative environment ', ' cis-gender ', ' cisgender ', ' gender diversity ', ' reduce disparity ', ' disparity reduction ', ' recruit ', ' healthcare settings ', ' health care settings ', ' ']",NIMHD,"SIMMERSION, LLC.",R44,2020,471013,0.09455819914525986
"Effects of Hospital-Community-Public Health Integration on Racial and Ethnic Disparities in Mental Health Summary Mental illness is a major public health concern in the U.S. and a significant source of morbidity and mortality. Racial and ethnic minority patients experience disproportionate burdens of common physical health conditions associated with mental illness, largely due to the lack of health care access and social stigma. Effectively treating mental illness and the associated conditions will depend on a comprehensive approach that crosses health systems and policies, such as the Community Benefit State Laws, to target “Population Health” and emphasize the value of social determinants of health. However, the current mental health care system works in a silo, and evidence of care coordination on health disparities is lacking. The goal of this study is to examine system-level care coordination among hospitals, communities, and public health agencies, and to estimate its impacts on unmet health care needs in African American and Latino patients with mental illness. The rationale for the proposed research is that once it is known what specific coordination practices (e.g. medical services, transportation, public housing) and policies are most successful for different patient populations, integration of mental and physical health care delivery systems can be designed in a more cost-effective way to overcome the barriers from stigma and limited health care access. In this project, we will first determine the effects of Community Benefit State Laws on racial and ethnic disparities in health care access, quality, and costs among people with mental illness (Aim 1). Within this context, we will further identify the variation of hospital-based adoption of care coordination practices and its correlation with patient and community level socio- demographics, local public health resources, and the extent of the implementation of community benefit laws (Aim 2); and determine the impact of care coordination practices between hospitals, communities, and public health agencies on racial and ethnic health disparities (Aim 3). We will use mixed methods: (1) we will construct a multi-level data set by linking multiple nationally representative data sets and use difference-in- differences approach to estimate the impact of system-level care coordination on different racial/ethnic groups; and (2) we will investigate challenges to implementing system-level coordination using focus groups of racial and ethnic minority patient representatives, hospital administrators and providers, and representatives from public health agencies. The proposed research is significant because (1) identified practices are expected to provide evidence on how to personalize mental health care coordination for racial and ethnic minority patients to address heterogeneous preferences in mental health treatment; (2) identified system-level care coordination practices are expected to be cost-effective, which in turn can make the coordination sustainable for underserved populations. Our results are expected to break down longstanding silos and bridge the gap between health care providers, community based organizations, social service agencies, and the public health sector delivery system, in addition to providing evidence to reduce health disparities through care coordination. Narrative The proposed research is relevant to public health because results will help us identify the specific sets of system-level care coordination practices (e.g., integrating physical and behavioral health, tracking readmissions, sharing clinical information across health sectors, mental health prevention interventions, transportation, public housing) that work best for minority populations with mental illness and provide evidence to reduce health disparities through care coordination across health care sectors. This timely study will inform the critical role of system-level care coordination in emerging health policy initiatives under the Affordable Care Act and a call for comprehensive mental health care reform. Thus, the proposed research is relevant to the NIMHD’s mission (PAR-16-221) to “conduct system-level health services research that can directly contribute to improve minority health and/or reduce health disparities in health care settings”.",Effects of Hospital-Community-Public Health Integration on Racial and Ethnic Disparities in Mental Health,9924656,R01MD011523,"['Adoption ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' psychological disorder ', ' Communities ', ' health care delivery ', ' Healthcare Delivery ', ' health services delivery ', ' Ethnic group ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Health Personnel ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' health care worker ', ' health provider ', ' health workforce ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' medical personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' Health Policy ', ' health care policy ', ' healthcare policy ', ' Health Resources ', ' Health Services Research ', ' Health Services Evaluation ', ' Medical Care Research ', ' services research ', ' Health Status ', ' Level of Health ', ' Hospital Administrators ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Hospital Admission ', ' Hospitals ', ' Community Hospitals ', ' Laws ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mentally Ill Persons ', ' Mental Patients ', ' Mentally Ill ', ' Methods ', ' Mission ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Patient Representative ', ' Patients ', ' Public Health ', ' Public Housing ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Social Values ', ' Social Work ', ' Social Service ', ' Target Populations ', ' Time ', ' Transportation ', ' Work ', ' Afro American ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Black Populations ', ' black American ', ' African American ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Latino ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Medical ', ' Health Reform ', ' Healthcare Reform ', ' Health Care Reform ', ' Link ', ' Individual ', ' Policies ', ' root ', ' Plant Roots ', ' programs ', ' Source ', ' System ', ' physical health ', ' physical conditioning ', ' Healthcare Sector ', ' Health Care Sector ', ' Services ', ' preference ', ' experience ', ' hospital re-admission ', ' re-admission ', ' re-hospitalization ', ' readmission ', ' rehospitalization ', ' hospital readmission ', ' Modeling ', ' behavioral health ', ' response ', ' stigma ', ' social stigma ', ' Provider ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Address ', ' Health system ', ' Data ', ' Preventative intervention ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' Community Health ', ' minority health ', ' cost ', ' under served population ', ' underserved people ', ' Underserved Population ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' cost effective ', ' Population ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' ethnic minority ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' patient population ', ' population health ', ' social health determinants ', ' community partnership ', ' ethnic health disparity ', ' racial minority ', ' reduce disparity ', ' disparity reduction ', ' Obamacare ', ' Affordable Care Act ', ' access to health care ', ' access to healthcare ', ' accessibility of health care ', ' accessibility to health care ', ' accessibility to healthcare ', ' health care access ', ' health care service access ', ' health care service availability ', ' healthcare access ', ' healthcare accessibility ', ' healthcare availability ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare service availability ', ' health care availability ', ' healthcare settings ', ' health care settings ', ' Service model ', ' care delivery model ', ' health care delivery model ', ' healthcare delivery model ', ' Service delivery model ', ' patient engagement ', ' coordinating care ', ' care coordination ', ' socio-demographics ', ' sociodemographics ', ' ']",NIMHD,"UNIV OF MARYLAND, COLLEGE PARK",R01,2020,540887,0.0887779572828247
"1/2-Building Infrastructure for Community Capacity in Accelerating Integrated Care PROJECT SUMMARY Although individuals from racial/ethnic and linguistic minority groups make up a considerable—and growing— proportion of the US population, they experience greater unmet need for mental health care than non-Latino Whites. Members of these groups are heavily represented in Medicaid, the largest insurer covering the most vulnerable individuals. And although the Affordable Care Act expanded Medicaid eligibility, research to date has not found that expansions have decreased the gap in mental health treatment between Whites and racial/ethnic minorities. Experts have identified a lack of culturally competent, bilingual/bicultural mental health providers as a factor contributing to the maintenance of these disparities. Similar challenges have been addressed in lower-income countries facing severe workforce constraints through the training of community health workers (CHWs), who originate from the communities they serve and have shown promise internationally as mental health service providers. However, they have not yet typically served in this role in US care delivery systems. State Medicaid-based accountable care organizations (ACOs) are forming in large numbers to provide care coordination via team-based approaches, with accumulating evidence suggesting that this strategy can greatly benefit resource-poor populations. However, many ACOs have not yet incorporated mental health services into their networks, despite the observed link between addressing mental health needs and improving physical health. Building staff capacity to provide these needed services would help ACOs implement evidence-based mental health interventions and improve the overall well-being of their assigned patients. Thus, our proposed collaborative R01 will develop ACO-academic-community partnerships in two demographically different states at different stages of ACO development and test a model that trains CHWs to serve as mental health providers within clinics/physician's organization and community-based organizations linked to ACOs in North Carolina and Massachusetts. This effort should expand ACO infrastructures and increase access to and quality of mental health care for low-income racial/ethnic and linguistic minorities in resource-poor communities. If successful, we will work with our ACO site partners to assess implementation outcomes of adoption, fidelity, maintenance, and explore implementation processes (facilitators and contextual factors) as potential mediators of implementation within diverse clinics, CBOs, and ACO networks. PROJECT NARRATIVE Despite the promise of accountable care organizations (ACOs) in transforming the healthcare landscape, a recent study revealed that ACOs serving a greater proportion of racial/ethnic minorities scored worse on quality performance measures and that 37% of ACOs had no formal relationship with a mental health provider. Thus, our proposed collaborative R01 seeks to establish community-ACO-academic partnerships to expand capacity for mental health care in North Carolina and Massachusetts. We propose to test an innovative model that includes training community health workers to provide an integrated, evidence-based intervention in community settings linked to ACOs, and to assess implementation outcomes within ACO networks.",1/2-Building Infrastructure for Community Capacity in Accelerating Integrated Care,9902546,R01MH117247,"['Adoption ', ' Automobile Driving ', ' driving ', ' Client ', ' Communities ', ' Community Health Aides ', ' community health worker ', ' health care delivery ', ' Healthcare Delivery ', ' health services delivery ', ' Elements ', ' Face ', ' faces ', ' facial ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health Personnel ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' health care worker ', ' health provider ', ' health workforce ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' medical personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' Immigration ', ' Insurance Carriers ', ' Insurers ', ' Language ', ' Linguistics ', ' Linguistic ', ' Maintenance ', ' Massachusetts ', ' Medicaid ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Health Services ', ' Mental Hygiene Services ', ' Minority Groups ', ' North Carolina ', ' Patients ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' well-being ', ' wellbeing ', ' Physicians ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Social Work ', ' Social Service ', ' Testing ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Emotional Depression ', ' depression symptom ', ' depressive ', ' depressive symptoms ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' Caring ', ' Chinese ', ' Chinese People ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' mental ', ' Psyche structure ', ' Individual ', ' Fees for Service ', ' Fee-for-Service Plans ', ' Patient-Centered Care ', ' bilingual ', ' bilingualism ', ' Home ', ' Home environment ', ' Clinic ', ' System ', ' physical health ', ' physical conditioning ', ' Application Context ', ' contextual factors ', ' Services ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' care delivery ', ' intervention program ', ' Participant ', ' member ', ' Care Manager ', ' Case Management Nurse ', ' Case Manager ', ' Manpower ', ' personnel ', ' Human Resources ', ' social ', ' Modeling ', ' QOC ', ' Quality of Care ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Provider ', ' Low income ', ' Mediator ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Address ', ' International ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' health literacy ', ' care services ', ' care systems ', ' computerized ', ' Minority ', ' improved functioning ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' community based service ', ' ethnic minority ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' Evidence based intervention ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' eligible participant ', ' collaborative care ', ' community setting ', ' evidence base ', ' patient population ', ' population based ', ' intervention effect ', ' population health ', ' anxious symptom ', ' anxiety symptoms ', ' training opportunity ', ' community partnership ', ' LMIC ', ' low and middle-income countries ', ' racial disparities in health ', ' racial health disparity ', ' reduce disparity ', ' disparity reduction ', ' Obamacare ', ' Affordable Care Act ', ' low income country ', ' primary care services ', ' provider networks ', ' barrier to health care ', ' barrier to healthcare ', ' barrier to treatment ', ' obstacle to care ', ' obstacle to healthcare ', ' barrier to care ', ' service providers ', ' Medicaid eligibility ', ' coordinating care ', ' care coordination ', ' Infrastructure ', ' effectiveness testing ', ' ']",NIMH,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R01,2020,976090,0.15437035428864435
"Addressing Mental Health Disparities in Refugee Children Through Family and Community-based Prevention: A CBPR Collaboration and Hybrid Implementation Effectiveness Trial ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Refugee children and families who are resettled in the United States face dramatic disparities in the incidence and treatment of mental health disorders. Resettlement stressors (poverty, limited access to care) and acculturative challenges (differences in cultural norms, discrimination) often exacerbate risks due to war- related trauma exposure. Commonly, refugee mental health services are limited-usually with a narrow focus on clinical treatment of PTSD-and rarely respond holistically to the needs or priorities of refugee communities; few interventions are designed for use across diverse cultures and refugee groups, despite rapidly evolving refugee demographics. Consequently, mental health service usage is low in resettled refugee populations. For refugee children and adolescents characterized by risk factors such as parental trauma, intergenerational conflict and other acculturative and resettlement stressors, preventive interventions hold great promise but are exceedingly rare. Cross-cultural application of community-based participatory research (CBPR) methods can increase understanding of risk and protective factors in refugee communities and contribute to development of responsive, flexible, interventions to promote healthy family functioning and child mental health and help prevent mental health disparities. We propose a CBPR-driven hybrid implementation effectiveness trial that builds upon ongoing collaborative research and community awareness-raising within Somali Bantu and Lhotshampas Bhutanese refugee communities in New England. Preliminary research and CBPR-based needs assessments with these groups has identified numerous cultural and community strengths as well as ongoing problems of difficult parent-child interactions, poor communication, and family conflict which interact with ongoing stressors to increase risks for child emotional and behavioral problems. Using a CBPR approach, a family based prevention model, the Family Strengthening Intervention for Refugees (FSI-R) was adapted from a tested model used in Africa and designed for delivery by refugee community health workers with through a process involving stakeholder consultation and local refugee Community Advisory Board input. Pilot data on the FSI-R demonstrates strong feasibility and acceptability, but further data are needed on effectiveness as well as barriers and facilitators to implementation by community health workers embedded in refugee-serving social services agencies. Specific aims are to (1) examine the impact of a family-based preventive intervention on outcomes of parent-child relationships, family functioning, and child mental health using a Hybrid Type 2Effectiveness-Implementation Design (families with children aged 7-17 in a two-arm randomized controlled trial); (2) identify barriers and facilitators to implementation of the FSI-R by community health workers by conducting a process evaluation concurrent with the delivery of the intervention; and (3) strengthen the science of community engagement to address health disparities by fortifying CBPR-based pathways of change via collaborative partnerships between refugee communities, service providers, and academic stakeholders. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed study will employ a cross-cultural CBPR approach to build from prior needs assessments and mixed methods research to evaluate the effectiveness of the Family Strengthening Intervention for Refugees (FSI-R), a preventative family home-based visiting intervention intended to mitigate mental health disparities among refugee children and families using a hybrid implementation-effectiveness design. Results of our trial will expand the evidence-base on community-based interventions for refugees and has the potential to be replicated to reduce mental health disparities affecting diverse groups of refugee children and families.",Addressing Mental Health Disparities in Refugee Children Through Family and Community-based Prevention: A CBPR Collaboration and Hybrid Implementation Effectiveness

"An implementation science approach to optimizing evidence-based treatments for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) for non-specialty settings PROJECT SUMMARY Background: An estimated 33-46% of clients seen in urban low-income primary care or behavioral health clinics have a current diagnosis of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), yet only 13% receive PTSD treatment. Further, only 57% of those who access care for PTSD receive a minimally adequate dose of therapy. The shortage of trained mental health specialists has led to concerning inequities in access to and quality of care in low-income community settings. To address workforce shortages, as well as client preferences, leaders in the field have advocated for the development of stepped care approaches that begin with brief, patient-centered interventions before progressing to intensive treatments. Despite promise, stepped approaches have not been developed for adults with PTSD. Specific Aims: This current study applies the Replicating Effective Programs Framework to guide the refinement and pre-implementation of a “Step 1” evidence-based treatment (EBT) for PTSD in primary care. A full stepped care approach will be tested in a future R01 (Step 1: brief, low intensity EBT in a non-specialty setting; Step 2: high intensity EBT in a specialty setting). Aim 1: To conduct a mixed-methods formative evaluation based on surveys and semi-structured interviews (N=25; 10 social worker and community health worker interventionists; 15 primary care stakeholders) to characterize the local integrated primary care setting and identify the need for augmentation to the intervention, protocol, or implementation blueprint. Aim 2: To optimize the intervention and operational procedures and to finalize the formal implementation blueprint (based on Aim 1 findings and consultation with the community advisory board [CAB]; N=10). Aim 3: To conduct a nonrandomized hybrid type 1 implementation-effectiveness pilot (N=60 clients) to assess the feasibility, effectiveness, and implementation of the adapted PTSD intervention (v. treatment as usual) in a primary care clinic. Candidate: This Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award (K23) builds upon the candidate’s previous experiences in clinical research focused on psychological adjustment following exposure to violence or discrimination among multiple minority populations. The candidate’s long-term goal is to be an independent implementation scientist focused on optimizing EBTs and care delivery models for PTSD. Training Objectives: (1) The development of implementation packages for delivery of EBTs in non-specialty settings; (2) Advanced training in pragmatic clinical trial design and mixed-methods data analysis and integration; and (3) Integrated primary care and stepped care models for mental health service delivery. Training Activities: Training will be achieved through mentorship by experts (Drs. A. Rani Elwy, Lisa Fortuna, Marylene Cloitre, Alisa Lincoln, Mark Bauer, Margarita Alegria, and Bindu Kalesan), formal coursework at Boston University School of Public Health, seminars, trainings, conferences, and workshop attendance. PROJECT NARRATIVE Only 13% of individuals with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in urban low-income communities receive mental health treatment; of those who receive treatment, only 56% receive minimally adequate psychotherapy. Low access to evidence-based psychotherapies for PTSD is foremost due to a shortage of trained mental health specialists; however, additional barriers exist, including: consumer preferences for care in non-specialty settings. Stepped care approaches that begin with the implementation of brief evidence-based psychotherapies for PTSD in non-specialty settings have the potential to improve the availability and quality of PTSD treatment in community settings.",An implementation science approach to optimizing evidence-based treatments for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) for non-specialty settings,9971578,K23MH117221,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Aftercare ', ' After Care ', ' After-Treatment ', ' post treatment ', ' Attitude ', ' Boston ', ' Client ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Communities ', ' Community Health Aides ', ' community health worker ', ' Consultations ', ' Continuity of Patient Care ', ' Continuity of Care ', ' Continuum of Care ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' health care delivery ', ' Healthcare Delivery ', ' health services delivery ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Family ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' Access to Care ', ' access to health services ', ' access to services ', ' access to treatment ', ' accessibility to health services ', ' availability of services ', ' care access ', ' health service access ', ' health services availability ', ' service availability ', ' treatment access ', ' Hybrids ', ' Interview ', ' literacy ', ' Memory ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Health Services ', ' Mental Hygiene Services ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methods ', ' Outpatients ', ' Out-patients ', ' Client satisfaction ', ' Patient Satisfaction ', ' Primary Care Physician ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Primary Care ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Psychotherapy ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Public Health Schools ', ' Shame ', ' Social Workers ', ' medical specialties ', ' Specialty ', ' Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders ', ' PTSD ', ' Post-Traumatic Neuroses ', ' Posttraumatic Neuroses ', ' Posttraumatic Stress Disorders ', ' post-trauma stress disorder ', ' posttrauma stress disorder ', ' traumatic neurosis ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Testing ', ' Training Activity ', ' training module ', ' Universities ', ' Intensive Care ', ' conference ', ' convention ', ' summit ', ' symposia ', ' symposium ', ' Consumer Preferences ', ' Specialist ', ' Step Tests ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Specified ', ' Specific qualifier value ', ' Medical ', ' Ensure ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Workshop ', ' Educational workshop ', ' uptake ', ' tool ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' Adopted ', ' Clinic ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Source ', ' psychosocial ', ' Services ', ' preference ', ' skills training ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' Structure ', ' peer ', ' Psychologic Adaptation ', ' Psychological Adaptation ', ' Psychological adjustment ', ' Regulation ', ' Modeling ', ' behavioral health ', ' QOC ', ' Quality of Care ', ' stigma ', ' social stigma ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Low income ', ' Address ', ' Dose ', ' Symptoms ', ' Advocate ', ' Data ', ' Improve Access ', ' K23 Award ', ' K23 Mechanism ', ' K23 Program ', ' Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award (K23) ', ' Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award ', ' Clinical Trials Design ', ' Cognitive ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' follow-up ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Evidence based treatment ', ' health literacy ', ' PC-3 ', ' PC-3 cell line ', ' PC3 ', ' PC3 cell line ', ' care services ', ' care systems ', ' implementation research ', ' data integration ', ' Minority ', ' care preference ', ' Clinical effectiveness ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Trauma ', ' Affective ', ' patient centered ', ' patient oriented ', ' implementation science ', ' community setting ', ' evidence base ', ' primary care setting ', ' usual care ', ' treatment as usual ', ' pragmatic effectiveness trial ', ' pragmatic trial ', ' mental training ', ' formative evaluation ', ' formative assessment ', ' informal support ', ' Pragmatic clinical trial ', ' symptomatology ', ' Service model ', ' care delivery model ', ' health care delivery model ', ' healthcare delivery model ', ' Service delivery model ', ' Service setting ', ' clinical implementation ', ' implementation strategy ', ' exposure to trauma ', ' trauma exposure ', ' exposure to violence ', ' violence exposure ', ' ']",NIMH,BOSTON MEDICAL CENTER,K23,2020,185759,0.04264155780285376
"Prediction of therapist cultural competency using Natural Language Processing (NLP) models PROJECT SUMMARY  Racial-ethnic minorities (REM) and lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ) individuals experience high levels of psychological distress. Psychological treatments can be effective in addressing mental health concerns, but disparities in quality of care still exist. Although systemic and institutional factors contribute to disparities in care, mental health providers are also critical to examine. A primary focus of efforts to understand and reduce provider contributions to mental health care disparities has been to examine cultural competency (CC), which involves a provider’s ability to navigate the cultural aspects of clinical interactions. Patient ratings of CC are generally associated with treatment outcomes and therapeutic processes. While patient perceptions of provider CC are important, a reliance on retrospective patient ratings limits what we know about how cultural identities are discussed, and the language that constitutes culturally sensitive care. Many studies of provider CC also require observers or patients to make complex judgments based on internal provider characteristics that are not reliably observable (e.g. rate provider awareness of their own cultural values). More studies are needed that examine patient-provider interactions in treatment in order to assess the impact of specific provider behaviors, and how they relate to perceptions of provider CC. Recently, Natural Language Processing (NLP) models have been applied to psychotherapy conversations to automatically capture the use of evidence based treatments, topics of conversation, empathy, and emotional expression. Prior research demonstrating the feasibility of automatically identifying topics of conversation in psychotherapy suggest that NLP models could be trained to automatically identify specific moments in sessions where patients and providers are talking about cultural issues. NLP models could allow researchers to not only examine how specific patterns of provider-patient interactions drive CC, but might also provide rapid feedback to providers, and in turn help address disparities in care. The purpose of the current study is to do the foundational work to develop and evaluate NLP tools that capture the cultural content of provider-patient interactions among REM and LGBTQ patients. First, utilizing 32,436 labeled talk turns from 200 psychotherapy sessions we will evaluate the accuracy of NLP models in recognizing the discussion of cultural topics in psychotherapy. Second, we will use NLP models to explore differences in the content of 1,235 psychotherapy sessions that were rated as highly positive or negative on a measure of cultural competence. PROJECT NARRATIVE Although disparities in the quality of mental health treatment for racial-ethnic minority (REM) and lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ) patients are well known, to date there are no tools that can identify specific patterns of provider-patient interactions that drive disparities in care. This project will evaluate the ability of Natural Language Processing (NLP) models to recognize discussion of cultural topics in psychotherapy among REM and LGBTQ patients, and explore differences in patient-provider interactions with low and high patient ratings of provider cultural competency.",Prediction of therapist cultural competency using Natural Language Processing (NLP) models,9906653,F31MD014941,"['Anxiety ', ' Awareness ', ' Behavior ', ' Client ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Empathy ', ' Face ', ' faces ', ' facial ', ' Feedback ', ' Foundations ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Health Personnel ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' health care worker ', ' health provider ', ' health workforce ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' medical personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' Judgment ', ' Language ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Methods ', ' Natural Language Processing ', ' natural language understanding ', ' Patients ', ' Perception ', ' Psychotherapy ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Suicide ', ' fatal attempt ', ' fatal suicide ', ' intent to die ', ' suicidality ', ' Technology ', ' Work ', ' Computerized Medical Record ', ' Electronic Medical Record ', ' Measures ', ' Treatment outcome ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' Label ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' psychological ', ' psychologic ', ' Training ', ' AOD use ', ' substance use ', ' substance using ', ' using substances ', ' Alcohol or Other Drugs use ', ' Individual ', ' Funding ', ' Therapeutic ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Complex ', ' Pattern ', ' emotional expression ', ' expression of emotion ', ' showing emotion ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' college student ', ' university student ', ' cultural competence ', ' cultural values ', ' Reporting ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' psychological distress ', ' Modeling ', ' QOC ', ' Quality of Care ', ' Provider ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' Text ', ' Evidence based treatment ', ' substance abuse therapy ', ' substance abuse treatment ', ' willingness ', ' Outcome ', ' NIAAA ', ' National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism ', ' ethnic minority ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' commercial application ', ' community setting ', ' effective intervention ', ' improve symptom ', ' symptom improvement ', ' symptomatic improvement ', ' reduce disparity ', ' disparity reduction ', ' disparities in treatment ', ' treatment disparity ', ' disparity in care ', ' disparity in healthcare ', ' healthcare disparity ', ' health care disparity ', ' sexual identity ', ' LGBTQ ', ' Lesbian Gay Bisexual Transgender Queer ', ' ']",NIMHD,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,F31,2020,45016,0.052850038319240664
"Foster Care Mental Health Family Navigator Project Summary Youth in the child welfare system have documented high rates of mental health symptoms and experience significant disparities in mental health care services access and engagement relative to youth not in the child welfare system. Navigator models have been developed in the healthcare field to address challenges of service access, fragmentation and continuity that impact quality of care, but at present there is no empirically supported mental health navigator model to address the unique and complex mental health needs of child welfare involved (CWI) youth. This developmental study will be conducted in three phases consistent with study aims. The study will take a mixed-methods, multi-informant participatory research approach to developing, iteratively refining and pilot testing a Foster Care Family Navigator (FCFN) model to improve mental health service outcomes for adolescents (ages 12-17) involved in the child welfare system. The navigator model will leverage digital health technology to engage with and improve care coordination, tracking and monitoring of mental health service needs for these youth and families. The study will adapt the JJ- TRIALS Behavioral Health Services Cascade framework to support a data-driven decision-making approach to improving identification of mental health service needs and outcomes. The study will first utilize a combination of interagency collaborative meetings, youth and family focus groups and qualitative individual interviews with multisystem stakeholders to guide the development of the FCFN protocol. Next an open trial of the 6-month FCFN intervention will be conducted and the protocol iteratively refined through direct participant feedback. The last phase of the study will focus on conducting a modified roll-out design of the FCFN intervention with 75 child welfare involved youth. Three cohorts of 25 youth and caregivers each will receive FCFN services for 6 months and will be compared on primary outcomes of mental health initiation and engagement to 50 youth and caregivers who receive services as usual. We will explore mediators (e.g., satisfaction with navigator, youth treatment motivation, perceived barriers to care) and moderators (e.g., race, ethnicity, sex) of intervention impact to inform intervention mechanisms of change and key demographic and other contextual factors associated with trial outcomes. Finally, we will also conduct qualitative exit interviews with trial participants and navigators to gain a deeper understanding of influences on pilot outcomes that can inform future larger efficacy and effectiveness trials. PROJECT NARRATIVE Youth in the child welfare system have documented high rates of mental health symptoms but experience significant disparities in mental health care services access and engagement. System fragmentation, challenges with treatment engagement and poor coordination and continuity of care exacerbate existing disparities.

"A trauma informed intervention to improve mental health and school success for urban eighth graders ABSTRACT. Approximately half of all 14-17 years olds in the U.S. are estimated to be victims of physical assault; chronic stress and trauma exposure are particularly prevalent for youth growing up in high-crime urban communities. Emotion regulation difficulties due to stress and trauma exposure contribute to disparities in mental health problems and school failure, with low-income and African American youth at much higher risk than their higher-income, White counterparts. Schools serving high-crime communities, however, do not offer universal trauma-informed strategies to support student success. RAP Club is a school-based group prevention program aimed at improving emotion regulation and decision-making in urban upper middle school students to improve their transition to high school. The program fills key gaps in current school practices, including a trauma-informed approach, universal delivery to all students without pre-screening, transdiagnostic effects on internalizing problems as well as behavioral issues, and a focus on upper middle school students. Our team adapted RAP Club from Structured Psychotherapy for Adolescents Responding to Chronic Stress (SPARCS), a group treatment for adolescents based on empirically supported mindfulness and cognitive- behavioral techniques. Using a novel delivery method, RAP Club is co-facilitated by school mental health personnel and young adult community members to promote student engagement. In our NIMH-funded pilot research, the program improved classroom behavior, social functioning, and academic competence. The program improved outcomes for students at varying levels of baseline distress—even low levels—suggesting its appropriateness as a universal model. Building on that work, the proposed R01 trial will test whether urban eighth grade students randomly assigned to RAP Club show improved emotional, behavioral, and academic outcomes in eighth and ninth grades compared to those assigned to Healthy Topics, a health education control group. Intervention and control programs will each be delivered by different school personnel with co- facilitation by young adult community members. The research will be conducted in 32 Baltimore City Public Schools serving urban communities with high rates of violence exposure. We will collect teacher- and student- reported data on student self-regulation, emotional functioning, classroom behavior, and academic performance at pre- and post-intervention and 4-month follow up, as well as student data at 12-month follow up. We will gather school record data on academic indicators in the year before, year of, and year following study participation. We will evaluate factors relevant to program implementation and potential sustainability, including stakeholder perspectives and cost data. The RAP Club model of trauma-informed, universal support has potential for widespread dissemination in school districts serving disadvantaged youth nationwide. The proposed randomized controlled trial will evaluate the effects of RAP Club, an evidence-based trauma-informed intervention, on eighth graders in an urban school district characterized by high rates of violence and trauma exposure. Schools serving youth in trauma-affected communities currently lack universal, trauma-informed approaches for promoting mental health and school success in upper middle school students prior to high school entry. RAP Club has potential to reduce risk for emotional, behavioral, and academic problems in our most vulnerable young people across the nation, with significant implications for reducing disparities in achievement and health.",A trauma informed intervention to improve mental health and school success for urban eighth graders,9928781,R01HD090022,"['Achievement ', ' Achievement Attainment ', ' Adolescence ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' assault ', ' Baltimore ', ' Behavior ', ' Biometry ', ' Biometrics ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' children ', "" childrens' "", ' youngster ', ' Cities ', ' Communities ', ' Control Groups ', ' Cost Analysis ', ' Cost Analyses ', ' assess cost ', ' cost assessment ', ' Professional counselor ', ' Counselor ', ' Crime ', ' Data Reporting ', ' data representation ', ' Decision Making ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Family ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health education ', ' Health Instruction ', ' Health Tutoring ', ' Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Economical Income ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Methods ', ' Mission ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' NIMH ', ' Occupations ', ' Jobs ', ' Professional Positions ', ' Perception ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Poverty ', ' Psychologist ', ' Psychotherapy ', ' Public Health ', ' Records ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Schools ', ' Informal Social Control ', ' Self Regulation ', ' Social Workers ', ' medical specialties ', ' Specialty ', ' Standardization ', ' Stress ', ' Students ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Testing ', ' Unemployment ', ' jobless ', ' joblessness ', ' out of work ', ' unemployed ', ' Violence ', ' violent ', ' violent behavior ', ' Work ', ' Afro American ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Black Populations ', ' black American ', ' African American ', ' Competence ', ' Emotional Depression ', ' depression symptom ', ' depressive ', ' depressive symptoms ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Youth ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' juvenile ', ' juvenile human ', ' Adolescent ', ' Link ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' teacher ', ' Failure ', ' Distress ', ' Trust ', ' adult youth ', ' young adulthood ', ' young adult ', ' Funding ', ' behavioral problem ', ' Problem behavior ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' Shapes ', ' Nature ', ' programs ', ' Event ', ' Techniques ', ' inner city ', ' Services ', ' mental health personnel ', ' Performance ', ' success ', ' high school ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Prevention program ', ' member ', ' 7th grade ', ' seventh grade ', ' 8th grade ', ' eighth grade ', ' 9th grade ', ' high school freshman ', ' ninth grade ', ' Manpower ', ' personnel ', ' Human Resources ', ' Academic achievement ', ' physical attack ', ' physical assault ', ' positive youth development ', ' Emotional ', ' Modeling ', ' Adolescent Development ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Low income ', ' Mediator ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Address ', ' Child Mental Health ', ' Symptoms ', ' Chronic stress ', ' Data ', ' NICHD ', "" National Institute of Children's Health and Human Development "", ' National Institute of Child Health and Human Development ', ' randomisation ', ' randomization ', ' randomly assigned ', ' Randomized ', ' Cognitive ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' follow-up ', ' Behavioral ', ' active control ', ' post intervention ', ' cost ', ' Social Functioning ', ' Outcome ', ' scale up ', ' childhood traumatic stress ', ' Child Traumatic Stress ', ' aged ', ' Trauma ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' 17 years of age ', ' age 17 years ', ' seventeen year old ', ' seventeen years of age ', ' 17 year old ', ' implementation science ', ' emotional regulation ', ' emotion regulation ', ' high risk ', ' evidence base ', ' group intervention ', ' mindfulness ', ' screening ', ' Junior High School Student ', ' Junior High Student ', ' Middle School Student ', ' Prevention trial ', ' anxious symptom ', ' anxiety symptoms ', ' behavior outcome ', ' behavioral outcome ', ' student engagement ', ' student motivation ', ' student participation ', ' school district ', ' treatment group ', ' improved outcome ', ' neighborhood disadvantage ', ' reduce disparity ', ' disparity reduction ', ' trauma symptom ', ' urban school ', ' urban underserved ', ' recruit ', ' exposure to trauma ', ' trauma exposure ', ' exposure to violence ', ' violence exposure ', ' emotional functioning ', ' ']",NICHD,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,516829,0.022334204304437208
"Building Community Capacity for Disability Prevention for Minority Elders PROJECT SUMMARY Although minority elders represent the fastest growing segment of an aging US population, they have less access to mental health care and prevention of disability, lagging well behind non-Latino whites, and suffering significant disparities. Research suggests that a contributing factor may be an insufficient supply of professional providers and the inability of evidence based treatments to reach and be acceptable to minority elders. We have obtained promising results from a novel model of disability prevention, the Positive Minds Strong Bodies (E-PMSB) intervention, embedded in the client’s neighborhood and culture to improve access, quality of mental health outcomes and reduce disability. The proposed renewal tests whether an enhanced PMSB intervention is acceptable in community-based organizations and community clinics, and allows effectiveness to be strengthened through added maintenance components. We identified areas to strengthen the intervention, to facilitate easier adoption at the organizational level, to increase mental health symptom reduction beyond 6 months, and augment dosage of the exercise component. In Aim 2 we will assess implementation readiness of the E-PMSB, to ensure that its package of interventions is feasible and can be easily adopted, with reduced barriers to its sustainability. Informed by the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR), we will assess facilitators and barriers to implementation. A learning community consisting of community-based organizations (CBOs), clinical sites and academic partners will share elements that have contributed to initial success and can strengthen the collaboration. For Aim 3, we will create and evaluate a toolkit to disseminate the program, with a focus on developing cultural and age appropriate evidence-based messaging, packaging, and an overview of the implementation process and financing. This dynamic toolkit will be designed for use by community organizations, community health workers (CHWs), exercise trainers, and program participants, targeting strategies for capacity building as well as implementation. Drawing on the feedback from participating sites, we envision refining materials in the last 6 months of the project to have a lasting product that can be disseminated, and that not only facilitates positive intervention outcomes but additionally support organizations to optimize implementation success, fidelity, and sustainability. PROJECT NARRATIVE The rapid expansion of the aging ethnic/racial and linguistic minority population is outstripping the capacity to offer disability prevention services necessary to respond to their needs. The proposed renewal project aims to test the effectiveness and implementation readiness of an enhanced mental health and physical disability prevention intervention, delivered by community- based staff in four languages.

"CBTpro: Scaling up CBT for psychosis using simulated patients and spoken language technologies Psychosis resulting from schizophrenia spectrum disorders and major mood disorders is one of the most disabling health concerns worldwide. Evidence-based psychotherapeutic interventions are recommended as standard of care by national psychosis treatment guidelines but are rarely accessible. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for psychosis (CBTp) is the most well-researched psychotherapy for psychotic disorders, yet fewer than 1% of American mental health providers are trained in this intervention. To date, there has been no scalable way to offer high-quality and sustainable CBTp training to mental health providers. The primary objective of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) proposal is to develop and evaluate a spoken language technology tool – CBTpro -- to support high-quality skills training in CBTp. CBTpro will provide a rapid means of scaling and sustaining CBTp in routine care settings across the US, resulting in more clinicians across the country providing higher quality CBTp to individuals with psychosis. This fast-track STTR proposal has two phases. The objective of Phase I is to develop a CBTpro prototype, which requires three core activities: Aim 1: understand community stakeholder needs to inform software design and functionality; Aim 2: develop CBTpro digital content; and Aim 3: train and validate machine learning algorithms to automatically score CBTp fidelity. The objective of Phase II is to optimize and test the CBTpro tool in real world practice settings. Accordingly, in Phase II, we will Aim 1: conduct a lab usability study (Aim 1a) followed by field testing of the CBTpro prototype (Aim 1b) with 20 trainees; Aim 2: conduct a randomized controlled trial of CBTpro training vs. training as usual (N= 100 providers / N=300 clients), using a nested mixed model analysis to determine the effect of CBTpro on client symptoms, functioning, and recovery; and Aim 3: adopting an NIMH experimental therapeutics approach, assess the hypothesized mechanism by which CBTpro affects clinical outcomes through increased provider fidelity to CBTp (mediation), and test whether the strength of the relationship between these variables is affected by client skill acquisition (moderation). This proposal directly addresses the National Institute of Mental Health’s strategic objectives to improve dissemination, implementation, and continuous improvement of evidence-based mental health services (Objective 4.2) and develop innovative models to dramatically improve the outcomes of mental health services received (Objective 4.3), particularly through the use of novel technology. CBTpro has the potential to reduce the high personal and societal costs associated with serious mental illness, redress the challenges of training amidst high rates of mental health system turnover, support supervisors in quality assurance and improvement efforts, and reduce health disparities associated with mental health workforce shortage areas. Evidence based psychotherapeutic interventions are recommended by national psychosis treatment guidelines, but are inaccessible in routine practice. The objective of this proposal is to systematically develop, pilot, and rigorously test CBTpro, a novel clinician support tool designed to train community mental health workers to provide cognitive behavioral therapy for psychosis skills to their clients. CBTpro merges cutting- edge technology with best psychotherapeutic practices for serious mental illness to enable a rapid research, development, and testing pipeline.",CBTpro: Scaling up CBT for psychosis using simulated patients and spoken language technologies,10004543,R42MH123215,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Affect ', ' Client ', ' Cognitive Therapy ', ' Cognition Therapy ', ' Cognitive Psychotherapy ', ' cognitive behavior intervention ', ' cognitive behavior modification ', ' cognitive behavior therapy ', ' cognitive behavioral intervention ', ' cognitive behavioral modification ', ' cognitive behavioral therapy ', ' cognitive behavioral treatment ', ' Communities ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Elements ', ' Feedback ', ' Future ', ' Health ', ' Health Personnel ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' health care worker ', ' health provider ', ' health workforce ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' medical personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Language ', ' Learning ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Health Services ', ' Mental Hygiene Services ', ' Persons ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' NIMH ', ' Patient Education ', ' Patient Instruction ', ' Patient Training ', ' Patients ', ' Psychotherapy ', ' Psychotic Disorders ', ' Psychoses ', ' psychotic illness ', ' Records ', ' Research ', ' research and development ', ' Development and Research ', ' R & D ', ' R&D ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Schizophrenia ', ' Schizophrenic Disorders ', ' dementia praecox ', ' schizophrenic ', ' Software Design ', ' Designing computer software ', ' Speech ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Training Programs ', ' Universities ', ' Businesses ', ' Caring ', ' Comprehension ', ' Practice Guidelines ', ' base ', ' quality assurance ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Medical ', ' Training ', ' disability ', ' Individual ', ' Recovery ', ' Interdisciplinary Research ', ' Multidisciplinary Collaboration ', ' Multidisciplinary Research ', ' Interdisciplinary Study ', ' Technology Transfer ', ' Collaborations ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Adopted ', ' Clinic ', ' System ', ' Country ', ' Affective Disorders ', ' Mood Disorders ', ' psychosocial ', ' Needs Assessment ', ' skills training ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' field based data ', ' field learning ', ' field test ', ' field study ', ' Performance ', ' rehearsal ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' member ', ' Negotiating ', ' Negotiation ', ' Mediation ', ' novel technologies ', ' new technology ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' depository ', ' repository ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Experimental Therapies ', ' Investigational Treatments ', ' experimental therapeutic agents ', ' experimental therapeutics ', ' Investigational Therapies ', ' Provider ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Address ', ' Health system ', ' Symptoms ', ' Economic Burden ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' Evidence based treatment ', ' website ', ' web site ', ' Instruction ', ' cost ', ' virtual ', ' digital ', ' computerized ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' chronic mental illness ', ' persistent mental illness ', ' serious mental disorder ', ' serious mental illness ', ' severe mental disorder ', ' severe mental illness ', ' Outcome ', ' scale up ', ' cost effective ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' skill development ', ' skill acquisition ', ' usability ', ' prototype ', ' multi-modality ', ' multimodality ', ' effective intervention ', ' evidence base ', ' standard of care ', ' routine care ', ' routine practice ', ' arm ', ' m-Health ', ' mobile health ', ' mHealth ', ' support tools ', ' Workforce Development ', ' improved outcome ', ' health care outcomes ', ' healthcare outcomes ', ' care outcomes ', ' practice setting ', ' societal costs ', ' cognitive benefits ', ' treatment guidelines ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' evaluate effectiveness ', ' effectiveness evaluation ', ' ']",NIMH,"LYSSN.IO, INC.",R42,2020,465946,0.11358471364475087
"Penn mental health AIDS research center Overview Abstract/Summary The overarching theme of the Penn Mental Health AIDS Research Center (PMHARC) at the University of Pennsylvania (Penn) and Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) is to transform how individuals with comorbid mental illness/AIDS are treated and managed by developing innovative, interdisciplinary, and integrative approaches to optimize psychiatric, behavioral, and medical outcomes and achieving a better understanding of the biological, psychological, and behavioral mechanisms underlying these combined illnesses and treatments. No other center in the U.S. is currently pursuing this explicit focus, making PMHARC unique in the NIMH ARC portfolio. A substantial body of work links psychiatric disorders to acquisition of HIV infection, accelerated immune dysfunction, poor access to HIV care, and poor adherence to antiretroviral treatment once in care. Yet, there is a relative paucity of evidence-based interventions focused on the combined treatment of mental illness/AIDS and related medical co-morbidities, and relatively little work in determining the relationships between mental health treatment and HIV/AIDS disease and understanding the underlying biology. PMHARC will stimulate novel approaches and strategies to address these problems by providing mentoring and resource support for both new and established investigators choosing to study comorbid mental illness/AIDS, in part through innovative pilot studies. PMHARC's leadership has extensive expertise in contemporary pharmacotherapy of mental illness and AIDS, cognitive behavioral treatments, and theory-based behavioral interventions. PMHARC will extend well-established collaborations at Penn and CHOP, including those in the Department of Psychiatry and the CFAR, as well as with the CTSA/CTRC, the Delaney Collaboratory, and community partners in Philadelphia. A unique feature of PMHARC is the collaboration of well- established mental health AIDS researchers, well-established mental health researchers who have not previously studied AIDS, well-established substance abuse AIDS researchers who have not previously studied mental health, and AIDS researchers not previously focused on mental health. PMHARC has an Administrative and Developmental Core, and four Shared Resource Cores. Overview Relevance: A growing body of research documents that persons with mental illness are at increased risk for contracting and transmitting HIV, and there are few evidence-based practices supporting treatment of persons with mental illnesses who are also HIV seropositive. Poor treatment outcomes and non-adherence pose a major public health threat due to poor individual outcomes and increased transmissibility and secondary infections. Thus, improving treatments for persons with these comorbid conditions has major public health significance.",Penn mental health AIDS research center,10220362,P30MH097488,"['Acquired Immunodeficiency

"Building Community Capacity for Disability Prevention for Minority Elders COVID-19 supplement PROJECT SUMMARY Previous studies have shown that major health crises and economic shocks can have negative impacts on mental health, which are worsened when physical quarantine is required. A particularly vulnerable population are those that have physical and emotional problems and are ethnic/racial and linguistic minority elders, many of whom live in areas with high infection rates and lack of appropriate health resources. The ongoing impact of the crisis on minority elders, who may take longer to recover and require longer periods of quarantine, is essential to understand and address. Our proposed supplement extends from the Positive Minds Strong Bodies clinical trial, that showed positive outcomes for this combined mental health and physical disability management and prevention intervention. We seek to assess the long-term effect of this program in reducing elders’ mortality (Aim 1) and maintaining mental health (Aim 2), as participants have been exposed to COVID- 19 or its social effects. We hypothesize that elders who received the intervention approximately 3 years ago pre-COVID will have a lower trend for mortality than those in the control condition, after adjusting for age, gender, and comorbidities at baseline. Our study is a unique opportunity to address disparities in a multiethnic, multilingual sample, including Latino, Asian and Black participants in 4 languages, Spanish, Mandarin, Cantonese and English. We propose to test whether the Positive Minds Strong Bodies intervention buffers mental health and disability impacts, through recontact of elders who participated in the 2015-2019 trial, along with those that will be newly enrolled in our new implementation study. In the third aim of the supplement, we will explore the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on daily stressors for ethnic/racial minority elders, as well as their responses to public health interventions such as home confinement, social distancing and isolation, mass risk communications, disease testing, intention to vaccinate and contact tracing. The proposed supplement will test the potential for this combined intervention to contribute to ongoing preparedness during the COVID-19 pandemic while also providing an evidence-based program that could support a diverse population in the face of future health crises. PROJECT NARRATIVE The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated health disparities and positioned them center stage. Our proposed supplement would examine the impact of our disability prevention intervention, Positive Minds Strong Bodies, in reducing mortality and mental health symptomatology for racial/ethnic and linguistic minority elders. We will assess the feasibility, adoption, and impact of public health interventions used to manage and prevent exposure to COVID-19 in this population, that could impact future health crises.",Building Community Capacity for Disability Prevention for Minority Elders COVID-19 supplement,10170914,R01AG046149,"['Adoption ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', ' Buffers ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Communication ', ' Community Health Aides ', ' community health worker ', ' comorbidity ', ' co-morbid ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Confidence Intervals ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Economics ', ' Exercise ', ' Florida ', ' Future ', ' Geographic Locations ', ' Geographic Area ', ' Geographic Region ', ' Geographical Location ', ' geographic site ', ' Health ', ' Health Resources ', ' Language ', ' Linguistics ', ' Linguistic ', ' Long-Term Effects ', ' Longterm Effects ', ' Massachusetts ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' mortality ', ' New York ', ' Parents ', ' Puerto Rico ', ' Quarantine ', ' isolation/quarantine ', ' Risk ', ' Shock ', ' Circulatory Collapse ', ' circulatory shock ', ' Social Distance ', ' Social isolation ', ' Testing ', ' Asians ', ' oriental ', ' Contact Tracing ', ' Communicable Disease Contact Tracing ', ' Infectious Disease Contact Tracing ', ' Gender ', ' Latino ', ' physical disability ', ' physically disabled ', ' physically handicapped ', ' diverse populations ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' population diversity ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' Intention ', ' dosage ', ' Area ', ' disability ', ' Multilingualism ', ' Exposure to ', ' instrument ', ' programs ', ' Home ', ' Home environment ', ' stressor ', ' Participant ', ' Prevention ', ' social ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Interventional trial ', ' Intervention Trial ', ' Emotional ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' Recontacts ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Preparedness ', ' Readiness ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Administrative Supplement ', ' Effectiveness of Interventions ', ' Preventative intervention ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Vaccinated ', ' trend ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' follow-up ', ' post intervention ', ' implementation trial ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Mind ', ' Evidence based program ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' function improvement ', ' functional improvement ', ' arm ', ' public health intervention ', ' disability impact ', ' community building ', ' Physical Performance ', ' racial minority ', ' symptomatology ', ' mood symptom ', ' intervention participants ', ' COVID19 ', ' corona virus disease 2019 ', ' coronavirus disease 2019 ', ' COVID-19 ', ' COVID-19 epidemic ', ' COVID19 epidemic ', ' COVID19 pandemic ', ' corona virus disease 2019 epidemic ', ' corona virus disease 2019 pandemic ', ' coronavirus disease 2019 epidemic ', ' coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic ', ' COVID-19 pandemic ', ' COVID ', ' CoV disease ', ' corona virus disease ', ' coronavirus disease ', ' rate of infection ', ' infection rate ', ' ']",NIA,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R01,2020,209766,0.055749018326590176
"University of Miami Developmental HIV/AIDS Mental Health Research Center (D-ARC) Project Summary (Overall)  This application from the University of Miami (UM) for a Developmental AIDS Research Center (UM D- ARC) proposes to establish a behavioral science hub advancing mental health (MH) HIV research in a US region hardest hit by HIV/AIDS. The over-arching Center theme, “Reducing the Impact of Mental Health and Minority Health Disparities across the HIV Prevention and Care Continua,” is directly relevant to the uncontrolled HIV/AIDS epidemic in the Greater Miami area, and this developmental funding will provide a pathway for dynamic growth to a subsequent full ARC application. Over the initial funding period, we will consolidate, coordinate, and augment institutional resources as well as develop and expand regional and national collaborations. Miami has the highest HIV incidence and prevalence of any US city and fares worst, geographically, on every CDC indicator of HIV impact. Developing a D-ARC focused on MH at UM is also of high public health significance, as Miami’s diverse populations face significant MH disparities, making the area an ideal setting for MH research across diverse populations disproportionately affected by the epidemic.  The organization of the UM D-ARC Cores represents a logical and innovative approach to establishing a D-ARC in an institution that has a growing cadre of behavioral scientists and a strategic goal of increasing HIV research. We propose the required Administrative (Admin) Core and Developmental (Dev) Core and two (rather than the required one) complementary Research Cores: a Methods Core and a Mental Health Disparities (MHD) Core. The Admin Core will embody Center leadership, governance, and strategic planning and coordinate the bi-directional community engagement activities that are key to the work of all Cores. The Dev Core will focus on awarding pilot studies and mentoring early stage investigators. The Methods Core will provide innovative research design, biostatistical, and data management expertise and collaborate with the MHD Core to construct, expand, and maintain Center Common Data Elements (CDE), consent-to-contact databases, and a REDCap measures library to maximize resource sharing. The MHD Core will provide expertise and resources to promote culturally competent, theory-driven approaches, tools, and interventions in ethical, multi-level, community-engaged research addressing MH and minority health disparities in HIV.  The developmental activities proposed for the new UM D-ARC have the overarching goal of increasing local MH HIV/AIDS research consistent with the center theme and UM strategic goals regarding HIV/AIDS and will leverage strong institutional support. This structure allows for attainment of our Overall Aims, which are to establish the Developmental Center, and to grow by promoting research that mitigates the impact of MH and minority health disparities across the HIV prevention and treatment continuum. The UM D-ARC has the unique potential for high-impact research addressing HIV among hardest-hit populations in greatest need and at greatest risk for falling off of the HIV prevention and treatment continua. PROJECT NARRITIVE  This proposal for what would be the first NIMH Developmental Mental Health HIV/AIDS Center (D- ARC) from the University Of Miami (UM) has exceptionally high public health significance; the D-ARC would be situated in one of the hardest hit geographic areas affected by the epidemic, at an institution with a strong and growing faculty of mental health HIV/AIDS researchers with ties to the local health departments, and to the local community. The proposed D-ARC will catalyze high-impact research efforts addressing mental health disparities, answering key questions related to HIV prevention and care starting in a domestic epicenter, with implications that can be applied broadly, and stimulate growth to a full-fledged MH-ARC. The focus of expertise and center activities on those most at risk for not achieving U.S. and U.N. end-the-epidemic goals is an excellent match for the geographic area facing health and mental health disparities driving the HIV epidemic.",University of Miami Developmental HIV/AIDS Mental Health Research Center (D-ARC),9899305,P30MH116867,"['Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome ', ' AIDS ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immuno-Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immunologic Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Affect ', ' Automobile Driving ', ' driving ', ' Award ', ' Ursidae Family ', ' Bears ', ' Ursidae ', ' bear ', ' Behavioral Research ', ' Behavioral Sciences ', ' Biometry ', ' Biometrics ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' CDC ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' Cities ', ' Communities ', ' comorbidity ', ' co-morbid ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Epidemic ', ' Ethics ', ' ethical ', ' Face ', ' faces ', ' facial ', ' Faculty ', ' Florida ', ' Future ', ' Geographic Locations ', ' Geographic Area ', ' Geographic Region ', ' Geographical Location ', ' geographic site ', ' Geography ', ' Goals ', ' Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Health ', ' HIV ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Hospitals ', ' Incidence ', ' Leadership ', ' Libraries ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' NIMH ', ' Patients ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Research Design ', ' Study Type ', ' study design ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Research Support ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Science ', ' United Nations ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Latino Population ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' hispanic community ', ' Hispanics ', ' Latino ', ' diverse populations ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' population diversity ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' Research Methods ', ' Research Methodology ', ' HIV Prevention ', ' HIV/AIDS prevention ', ' AIDS prevention ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' Area ', ' Failure ', ' Individual ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Databases ', ' Funding ', ' uptake ', ' Collaborations ', ' tool ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' Clinic ', ' Viral ', ' meetings ', ' data management ', ' Structure ', ' Prevention Research ', ' Categories ', ' Prevention ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' AIDS/HIV ', ' HIV/AIDS ', ' HIV/AIDS problem ', ' AIDS/HIV problem ', ' theories ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' fall risk ', ' Institution ', ' Address ', ' Consent ', ' Data ', ' Resource Sharing ', ' Strategic Planning ', ' Common Data Element ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' minority health ', ' biobehavioral ', ' biobehavior ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' high risk ', ' community partnership ', ' PrEP ', ' pre-exposure prophylaxis ', ' recruit ', ' barrier to health care ', ' barrier to healthcare ', ' barrier to treatment ', ' obstacle to care ', ' obstacle to healthcare ', ' barrier to care ', ' social structural ', ' socio-structural ', ' sociostructural ', ' social structure ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF MIAMI CORAL GABLES,P30,2020,1364620,0.08198353810672049
"A Structural Approach to Understanding and Addressing Suicidality among Transgender and Gender Nonconforming College Students PROJECT SUMMARY Dr. Lipson's career objective is to become a leading mental health disparities researcher, contributing novel evidence about structural determinants of disparities in adolescent and young adult populations, specifically for transgender and gender nonconforming (TGNC) individuals (those who have a gender identity that differs from assigned sex at birth or does not fit the male-female binary). Dr. Lipson is particularly interested in mental health disparities among college students, which include ~70% of adolescents and young adults nationwide. Though TGNC students represent just 3-4% of all undergraduates, they account for ~15% of reported suicide attempts. The proposed K01 focuses on how exposure to structural stigma, in the form of 6 campus policies, is associated with suicidality and mental health service utilization among TGNC college students. This K01 includes 3 specific aims, each requiring further training and expert mentorship: Aims 1 and 2 leverage the natural experiment in which students have low/no exposure to campus policies in the pre-period (before arriving in fall of the 1st undergraduate year). In Aim 1, Dr. Lipson will apply her K01 training in causal inference to compare changes suicidal ideation and attempts between TGNC and cisgender students on campuses with and without structural stigma. In Aim 2, Dr. Lipson will analyze a national database of counseling center records to assess how structural stigma is associated with treatment dropout by TGNC and cisgender students. Supported by her K01 training in qualitative research, in Aim 3, Dr. Lipson will conduct interviews with TGNC students and counseling center directors. This formative research will be in accordance with the preparation phase of the Multiphase Optimization Strategy (MOST), a principled framework for optimizing/evaluating interventions. The preparation phase will inform development and evaluation of future interventions to address structural stigma and its underlying mechanisms. With her K01 research and training, Dr. Lipson will have the skills, knowledge, and evidence to lead intervention evaluation and effectively collaborate on intervention teams. At the end of the K01, she will be prepared to proceed with subsequent phases of MOST, for which she will seek R01 funding. As an assistant professor at the Boston University School of Public Health (BUSPH), Dr. Lipson is opportunely positioned to accomplish the proposed research and achieve her overall career objectives. Her mentors from BUSPH, Boston Children's Hospital/Harvard, and Rutgers University bring interdisciplinary expertise in: TGNC health disparities (Dr. Austin), causal inference (Dr. Lin), qualitative research (Dr. Jernigan), intervention development and evaluation (Dr. Stein), and suicide epidemiology (Dr. Gradus). NIH has designated TGNC as a disparity population, yet there remain large gaps in knowledge that undermine development of public health interventions, including evidence to support implementation of protective policies. With regard to TGNC suicidality, NIMH has specifically highlighted a need to consider transition periods that may heighten risk. Beginning college (the focus of Aims 1 and 2) is a significant life transition that coincides with age of onset for many lifetime mental disorders. The proposed research will strengthen the public health impact of NIMH-supported research (Strategic Objective 4) and address a critical barrier by advancing knowledge of how campus structural stigma is associated with TGNC suicidality. This evidence can be used to inform policy change and create more inclusive services to meet the needs of a growing population of TGNC students nationwide. PROJECT NARRATIVE Transgender and gender nonconforming (TGNC) college students represent 3-4% of all students but account for ~15% of students reporting suicide attempts. In this K01, Dr. Lipson will address a critical barrier to knowledge by examining how TGNC student suicidality and mental health service utilization are associated with exposure to structural stigma in the form of six specific campus policies, such as whether students are allowed to change their preferred name in campus records or access gender-neutral bathrooms. Supported by expert mentorship and training in methods of causal inference for policy analysis, qualitative research, intervention development and evaluation, and TGNC mental health, the proposed research will contribute novel, policy-relevant knowledge of how structural stigma perpetuates TGNC mental health disparities during the epidemiologically-vulnerable and psychosocially-significant college years.",A Structural Approach to Understanding and Addressing Suicidality among Transgender and Gender Nonconforming College Students,10055300,K01MH121515,"['Accounting ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' psychological disorder ', ' Birth ', ' Parturition ', ' Boston ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Client ', ' Counseling ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Dropout ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiologic ', ' epidemiological ', ' Evaluation Research ', ' Feedback ', ' Female ', ' Future ', ' Gender Identity ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Pediatric Hospitals ', "" Children's Hospital "", ' Housing ', ' Health Insurance ', ' health insurance plan ', ' Interview ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' male ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Health Services ', ' Mental Hygiene Services ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methods ', ' Names ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' NIMH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' well-being ', ' wellbeing ', ' Public Health ', ' Recommendation ', ' Records ', ' Research ', ' Research Design ', ' Study Type ', ' study design ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Research Support ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Schools ', ' Public Health Schools ', ' Stigmatization ', ' Students ', ' Suicide ', ' fatal attempt ', ' fatal suicide ', ' intent to die ', ' suicidality ', ' Suicide attempt ', ' non fatal attempt ', ' nonfatal attempt ', ' suicidal attempt ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Time ', ' Universities ', ' Gender ', ' Institutional Policy ', ' Measures ', ' falls ', ' Policy Analyses ', ' Policy Analysis ', ' Longitudinal Surveys ', ' Mediating ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' career ', ' Phase ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Age of Onset ', ' Link ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Databases ', ' Policies ', ' Funding ', ' Hormone Replacement Rx ', ' Hormone replacement therapy ', ' Exposure to ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Insurance Status ', ' Insurance Coverage ', ' Suicidal thoughts ', ' suicidal ideation ', ' suicidal thinking ', ' suicide ideation ', ' thoughts about suicide ', ' Feeling suicidal ', ' Investigation ', ' suicidal ', ' psychosocial ', ' interest ', ' collegiate ', ' college ', ' Services ', ' trans* ', ' transgender ', ' suicide risk ', ' suicidal risk ', ' experience ', ' college student ', ' university student ', ' professor ', ' austin ', ' Structure ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' Negotiating ', ' Negotiation ', ' Mediation ', ' Reporting ', ' sensitivity training ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' stigma ', ' social stigma ', ' theories ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Qualitative Research ', ' Provider ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Institution ', ' Mediator ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Intake ', ' Research Training ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Preparation ', ' sex ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' treatment center ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' prospective ', ' Natural experiment ', ' develop therapy ', ' intervention development ', ' treatment development ', ' therapy development ', ' multi-faceted intervention ', ' multi-modal intervention ', ' multicomponent intervention ', ' multifaceted intervention ', ' multimodal intervention ', ' multi-component intervention ', ' undergraduate ', ' undergraduate student ', ' Adolescent and Young Adult ', ' public health intervention ', ' gender non-conforming ', ' non-gender conforming ', ' gender nonconforming ', ' higher education ', ' cis-gender ', ' cisgender ', ' health service utilization ', ' health service use ', ' healthcare settings ', ' health care settings ', ' multiphase optimization strategy ', ' ']",NIMH,BOSTON UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CAMPUS,K01,2020,162506,0.05190403778299845
"Sociocultural Influences on Mental Health Service Utilization for Young Black Gay, Bisexual and other Men who have Sex with Men PROJECT SUMMARY Young Black gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with men (YB-GBMSM) experience high HIV prevalence and incidence, but suboptimal rates of engagement across the HIV Continuum of Care (HIV-CoC). Treatable mental health (MH) conditions such as depressive disorders, anxiety disorders, trauma- and stressor-related disorders, and substance use are major determinants of HIV-CoC outcomes; however, MH services utilization rates are low in this population. There is a need for culturally -tailored interventions to improve MH service utilization among YB-GBMSM, in order to improve both HIV-CoC and MH outcomes. Our long-term goal is to identify novel approaches to promoting and delivering MH services for YB-GBMSM living with HIV. The objective of this R21 application is to develop an understanding of influences on MH service utilization among YB-GBMSM living with HIV. The rationale for the project is that the influences on HIV and MH care are often overlapping and/or synergistic, and that cultural considerations are critically important to understanding these factors. Our study will be based in Atlanta, Georgia – an HIV epicenter. The theoretical foundation for the study is a preliminary conceptual model based on Andersen’s Behavioral Model of Health Service Use, which we have culturally adapted using theories and frameworks with particular relevance for YB- GBMSM (minority stress, intersectionality, and resilience). This study will pursue three specific aims: (1) to qualitatively explore conceptualizations of MH service utilization among YB-GBMSM living with HIV, including investigation of associated sociocultural, demographic and clinical influences; (2) to quantitatively examine relationships between constructs in our conceptual model, MH service utilization, and HIV-CoC outcomes; and (3) To develop program objectives and methods for a culturally-tailored intervention designed to enhance acceptability and uptake of MH services, and improve HIV-CoC outcomes, among YB-GBMSM living with HIV. For the first aim, we will conduct N=40 qualitative interviews to understand conceptualizations of MH and MH services, and to refine a conceptual model based on Andersen’s Behavioral Model. For the second aim, we will test the relationships in our model using quantitative data from N=200 cross-sectional surveys that we will conduct with YB-GBMSM living with HIV. For the third aim, we will synthesize the findings from Aims 1 and 2 to begin development of an intervention to enhance MH service utilization among YB-GBMSM living with HIV, using the Intervention Mapping approach. The proposed research is highly significant because of its potential to inform effective strategies for improving HIV-CoC outcomes among YB-GBMSM, with important implications for both individual and public health outcomes. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed project seeks to understand influences on the use of mental health services by young Black gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with men (YB-GBMSM) who are living with HIV. This project is relevant to public health because YB-GBMSM are disproportionately impacted by HIV and mental health conditions, but often do not seek mental health care. Our proposal is responsive to the NIH Office of AIDS Research mandate to conduct research to reduce disparities in health outcomes for people living with HIV.","Sociocultural Influences on Mental Health Service Utilization for Young Black Gay, Bisexual and other Men who have Sex with Men",10013550,R21MH121164,"['Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Anxiety Disorders ', ' Communities ', ' Continuity of Patient Care ', ' Continuity of Care ', ' Continuum of Care ', ' Cross-Sectional Studies ', ' Cross Sectional Analysis ', ' Cross-Sectional Analyses ', ' Cross-Sectional Survey ', ' Disease Frequency Surveys ', ' Demographic Factors ', ' Depressive disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Enabling Factors ', ' Epidemic ', ' Face ', ' faces ', ' facial ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Geography ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health Services ', ' Heart ', ' HIV ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Incidence ', ' Interview ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Medical Records ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Health Services ', ' Mental Hygiene Services ', ' Methods ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' well-being ', ' wellbeing ', ' Predisposing Factor ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Stress ', ' Testing ', ' Work ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Youth ', ' HIV Prevention ', ' HIV/AIDS prevention ', ' AIDS prevention ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' Bi-sexual ', ' Bisexual ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Substance-Related Disorders ', ' AOD use ', ' substance use ', ' substance using ', ' using substances ', ' Alcohol or Other Drugs use ', ' Individual ', ' Gays ', ' uptake ', ' programs ', ' Investigation ', ' Viral ', ' experience ', ' stressor ', ' Participant ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' health-related belief ', ' health belief ', ' Modeling ', ' theories ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' AIDS test ', ' AIDS/HIV test ', ' HIV test ', ' HIV-1 test ', ' HIV-2 test ', ' Human immunodeficiency virus test ', ' Address ', ' social capital ', ' Adherence ', ' Data ', ' NIH Office of AIDS Research ', ' Transmission ', ' transmission process ', ' Behavioral Model ', ' MSM ', ' men who have sex with other men ', ' men who have sex with men ', ' Minority ', ' new approaches ', ' novel approaches ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel strategies ', ' resilience ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' Trauma ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' intervention design ', ' treatment design ', ' therapy design ', ' develop therapy ', ' intervention development ', ' treatment development ', ' therapy development ', ' sexual minority ', ' minority investigator ', ' racial minority ', ' reduce disparity ', ' disparity reduction ', ' health service utilization ', ' health service use ', ' psychiatric symptom ', ' intersectionalities ', ' intersectionality ', ' Long-term cohort ', ' Longterm cohort ', ' Longitudinal cohort ', ' barrier to health care ', ' barrier to healthcare ', ' barrier to treatment ', ' obstacle to care ', ' obstacle to healthcare ', ' barrier to care ', ' socio-cultural ', ' sociocultural ', ' social culture ', ' ']",NIMH,EMORY UNIVERSITY,R21,2020,262487,0.025123126995822215
"Engaging Pacific Islanders in Mental Health Treatment Services Abstract Pacific Islanders are a vulnerable racial population that is greatly affected by physical health disparities such as cancer, obesity, diabetes, and heart disease. In addition to these physical health disparities, evidence from our NIMH R21 research reveals Pacific Islanders experience sizable mental health disparities including high levels of untreated mental illness that we suspect may contribute to Pacific Islanders’ poor health and elevated risk of chronic disease (e.g., cancer, obesity). Unfortunately, although many Pacific Islanders experience high levels of mental health need, very few present for treatment. This appears to be due to the following major treatment barriers identified in our R21: low mental health literacy, high mental health stigma, and poor knowledge of treatment leading to misperceptions of treatment and subsequent resistance. The proposed R34 pilot study will address this problem by creating and pilot testing Talking Story: a novel intervention designed to promote Pacific Islander treatment seeking by using culturally grounded strategies to overcome their major treatment barriers. Building on our R21 conceptual model of Pacific Islander-preferred intervention strategies, Talking Story will combine lecture-based content from current mental health evidence-based practices with innovative health communication films (called narratives) that depict fictional stories of Pacific Islanders in treatment-related scenarios. To build Talking Story, we will design the initial versions of the lecture content and narrative films with an advisory council of Pacific Islander experts and a professional filmmaker. We will then conduct 2 citizens’ panels to bring together 24 Samoan adults, 24 Tongan adults, and 12 treatment providers in Los Angeles County to discuss and shape our content and films for cultural fit and impact. Using the data from these panels, our content will be finalized and combined into an intervention manual that will be pilot tested in a randomized wait-list controlled trial with 24 Samoans and 24 Tongans with mental illness to gain information about the intervention’s feasibility, acceptability, and utility; leading to full-scale randomized controlled testing in a follow- up R01 study. Study findings will be disseminated to the Pacific Islander community via brochures and public forums, and to the scientific community via presentations and peer-reviewed manuscripts.  Narrative Pacific Islanders bear high risk for mental health and substance use disorders but rarely present for treatment due to three powerful barriers: low mental health literacy, high mental health stigma, and poor knowledge of mental health treatment. Building on a conceptual model of evidence-based strategies shaped by Pacific Islanders in an earlier NIMH R21, this R34 study will design and pilot test Talking Story: the first culturally grounded intervention to promote treatment seeking among Pacific Islanders. By combining state-of-the-art narrative films designed to increase Pacific Islanders’ mental health knowledge with culturally adapted mental health literacy and anti-stigma practices, Talking Story will be tested for feasibility and measurement in preparation for full-scale randomized controlled testing in a future NIMH R01.",Engaging Pacific Islanders in Mental Health Treatment Services,9957603,R34MH122641,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Affect ', ' alcohol use disorder ', ' ethanol use disorder ', ' American Indians ', ' American Indian ', ' Arkansas ', ' Ursidae Family ', ' Bears ', ' Ursidae ', ' bear ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' psychological disorder ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Client ', ' Communities ', ' Community Health Aides ', ' community health worker ', ' Decision Making ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Health ', ' Health Personnel ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' health care worker ', ' health provider ', ' health workforce ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' medical personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' Heart Diseases ', ' Cardiac Diseases ', ' Cardiac Disorders ', ' heart disorder ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Literature ', ' Los Angeles ', ' Manuals ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' mortality ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' NIMH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Obesity ', ' adiposity ', ' corpulence ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulentia ', ' obese ', ' obese people ', ' obese person ', ' obese population ', ' Pamphlets ', ' Booklets ', ' Brochures ', ' Peer Review ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' medical specialties ', ' Specialty ', ' Stigmatization ', ' Substance Use Disorder ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Violence ', ' violent ', ' violent behavior ', ' Waiting Lists ', ' waitlist ', ' Work ', ' County ', ' Film ', ' Health Benefit ', ' Latino ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' Clinical ', ' Series ', ' Ensure ', ' AOD use ', ' substance use ', ' substance using ', ' using substances ', ' Alcohol or Other Drugs use ', ' Rural ', ' Pacific Islander ', ' Pacific Islander American ', ' Pacific Island Americans ', ' Measurement ', ' Funding ', ' Generalized Anxiety Disorder ', ' Immigrant ', ' Shapes ', ' Samoan ', ' Consensus ', ' Knowledge ', ' lectures ', ' physical health ', ' physical conditioning ', ' health knowledge ', ' Services ', ' preference ', ' suicide risk ', ' suicidal risk ', ' experience ', ' Manuscripts ', ' novel ', ' treatment program ', ' Reporting ', ' health-related belief ', ' health belief ', ' Modeling ', ' stigma ', ' social stigma ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Provider ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' clinical depression ', ' major depression ', ' major depression disorder ', ' Major Depressive Disorder ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Legal ', ' Address ', ' Evidence based practice ', ' Data ', ' Health Communication ', ' Indigenous ', ' randomisation ', ' randomization ', ' randomly assigned ', ' Randomized ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Preparation ', ' Process ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' follow-up ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' minority health ', ' health literacy ', ' cost ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' new approaches ', ' novel approaches ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel strategies ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' resistant ', ' Resistance ', ' intervention design ', ' treatment design ', ' therapy design ', ' develop therapy ', ' intervention development ', ' treatment development ', ' therapy development ', ' high risk ', ' evidence base ', ' efficacy testing ', ' sexual minority ', ' public health intervention ', ' Personalized medical approach ', ' individualized approach ', ' precision approach ', ' tailored approach ', ' personalized approach ', ' Native Hawaiian ', ' treatment services ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA RIVERSIDE,R34,2020,283162,0.06557878647887642
"Video-visit behavior therapy for anxiety and depression in youth: A randomized effectiveness-implementation study in low-resource primary care settings. The proposed mixed-methods study will (a) test the effectiveness of brief behavioral therapy (STEP-UP) for youths with anxiety and/or depression recruited from primary care community health centers (CHCs), (b) evaluate a population-based method of implementation of STEP-UP, and (c) explore patient, provider, and clinic reactions to identify target mechanisms for successful and sustainable implementation. Anxiety and mood disorders in youth are prevalent and impairing, with a high current and lifetime comorbidity in part due to shared etiologic factors. Untreated, these disorders lead to sustained functional impairment and convey increased risk for recurrent disorder and suicidal behavior. Only 1 in 5 anxious and 2 in 5 depressed youth report any lifetime mental health use, the lowest treatment rates for any youth mental health condition. Further, there are notable disparities in care, with minority youths significantly less likely to receive services than non- Hispanic white (NHW) youths, despite experiencing similar or higher rates of disorder. Therefore, effective treatment of anxiety and depression is a critical public health priority, especially for traditionally underserved minority youths. STEP-UP is a streamlined behavioral intervention developed to efficiently treat anxiety and depression as a unified problem area by targeting avoidance behavior common to both disorders. The proposed study builds on a multi-site randomized trial demonstrating the effectiveness of STEP-UP, with especially strong effects for Hispanic youths. This application responds to RFA-MH-20-400 and focuses on implementing and testing this promising evidence-based practice in the OCHIN network of CHCs and federally qualified health centers which serves a diverse population of vulnerable families. STEP-UP has been adapted to a digital health framework with video visits to increase dissemination potential, scalability, and cost-effectiveness. We propose to conduct an innovative hybrid effectiveness-implementation study (type 1) testing digitally delivered STEP-UP compared to facilitated referral to traditional outpatient mental health services (treatment-as-usual, TAU). Youths (age 8-17, N = 250) will be identified and recruited at the population level through electronic health records (EHR) and direct clinician referral of new cases. Eligible youths will be randomized to (a) STEP-UP or (b) facilitated referral to TAU. Clinical outcomes will be assessed at Weeks 16 and 32 and process measures collected over the course of care. Qualitative interviews will occur with 20 youth-parent dyads, 35 CHC providers and staff, and 20 administrators sampled from enrolled clinics. Aims include testing the clinical effectiveness of STEP-UP and engagement of the intervention mechanism in the vulnerable CHC population of families (Aim 1), evaluating the impact of STEP-UP on equity in mental health outcomes for minority youths (Aim 2), estimating the implementation cost and incremental cost effectiveness of STEP-UP (Aim 3), and identifying target mechanisms for sustainable implementation of STEP- UP in CHCs using the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (Aim 4). Project narrative: This study will test whether a brief, behavioral treatment program can help vulnerable youths struggling with depression and anxiety. A previous face-to-face version of this program was effective, and this study will test to see if the program works well when delivered in a video-visit format to families who are traditionally underserved by mental health.

"Mental health of at-risk women: the role of structural vulnerabilities and resilience Project Summary Female sex workers (FSW) bear a disproportionate burden of depression and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) compared to the general female population. There is some evidence of the role of structural vulnerabilities (i.e. homelessness, stigma, poverty) in poor mental health in the general population however there has been little research on the nature of this relationship FSW, a population that is characterized by a diverse array of structural vulnerabilities. Resilience has played a promising role in improving mental health in prior research yet it is unclear the role it may play for FSW. The proposed mentored research will examine patterns of structural vulnerabilities among a sample of FSW in Baltimore, Maryland collected at baseline (n=350) and how resilience moderates the relationship between these patterns and mental health at 12-month follow-up. Semi-structured in-depth interviews with free listing will be used to qualitatively examine how women (n=20-25) describe dimensions and experiences of resilience in their lives and how they acquire resources to strengthen resilience, including social support. (Aim 1). Using baseline survey data, latent class analysis (LCA) will be performed to determine patterns of structural vulnerabilities (Aim 2). Then, LCA with distal outcomes will be used to predict mental health (depression, PTSD, and co-occurring PTSD and depression) at 12-month follow-up based on structural vulnerability class (Aim 3). Finally, LCA models with distal outcomes will be used to explore the moderating role of resilience in the relationship between structural vulnerability class and mental health (Sub-aim 3a). This study uses a novel mixed methods approach to explore moderating factors that influence mental health among a population that experiences high rates of mental illness and structural vulnerabilities. Findings can elucidate the drivers of the mental health disparity between FSW and the general population. Results can also inform clinical and research interventions for addressing social and structural-level risks and protective factors among a vulnerable population. This project will prepare the applicant to become a leading independent researcher in the fields of mental health among vulnerable populations. The culminating results from this project can help NIMH meet Strategic Objectives 2, 3, and 4 by using advanced LCA methods to predict classes of risk factors for PTSD and depression in a sample of women who experience significant mental health disparities; these risk factor classes can better inform mental health prevention and clinical care. Project Narrative Female sex workers (FSW) experience a wide array of structural vulnerabilities and a disproportionate burden of mental illness yet little is known about modifiable factors that can improve mental health outcomes in this population. The proposed mentored research will examine patterns of structural vulnerabilities among a sample of FSW and how resilience moderates the relationship between structural vulnerability classes and mental health (i.e. depression, PTSD, and co-occurring depression and PTSD). Findings can inform future research and clinical and outreach efforts to improve mental health disparities in FSW and other vulnerable women populations.",Mental health of at-risk women: the role of structural vulnerabilities and resilience,9975000,F31MH118817,"['Achievement ', ' Achievement Attainment ', ' Baltimore ', ' Ursidae Family ', ' Bears ', ' Ursidae ', ' bear ', ' Behavior ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' psychological disorder ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Conflict (Psychology) ', ' Conflict ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Economics ', ' Exhibits ', ' Female ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health Resources ', ' Interview ', ' Maryland ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' NIMH ', ' Play ', ' Poverty ', ' Public Health ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Research ', ' Research Design ', ' Study Type ', ' study design ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Social support ', ' social support network ', ' Societies ', ' Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders ', ' PTSD ', ' Post-Traumatic Neuroses ', ' Posttraumatic Neuroses ', ' Posttraumatic Stress Disorders ', ' post-trauma stress disorder ', ' posttrauma stress disorder ', ' traumatic neurosis ', ' Time ', ' Violence ', ' violent ', ' violent behavior ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', "" Women's Role "", ' Female Roles ', ' base ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Distal ', ' Clinical ', ' homeless ', ' unhoused ', ' Homelessness ', ' Individual ', ' Baseline Surveys ', ' Nature ', ' Dimensions ', ' Frequencies ', ' Severities ', ' Complex ', ' Pattern ', ' experience ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' outreach ', ' General Public ', ' General Population ', ' Prevention ', ' social ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' stigma ', ' social stigma ', ' theories ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Meta-Analysis ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' low SES ', ' low socio-economic position ', ' low socio-economic status ', ' low socioeconomic position ', ' low socioeconomic status ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Update ', ' Process ', ' sex ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' follow-up ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio-economically ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomics ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' resilience ', ' Outcome ', ' coping ', ' Population ', ' sexual trauma ', ' person centered ', ' clinical care ', ' post-trauma stress ', ' posttrauma stress ', ' posttraumatic stress ', ' post-traumatic stress ', ' female sex worker ', ' protective factors ', ' social structural ', ' socio-structural ', ' sociostructural ', ' social structure ', ' ']",NIMH,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,F31,2020,45520,0.04848179259320198
"Medicare Policy Effects on Mental Health Care Disparities This project will assess the impact of recent Medicare policy changes on racial/ethnic disparities in mental health (MH) care. Medicare is the most common source of coverage for elderly and non-elderly disabled Americans with mental illness. Two recent policy changes have the potential to reduce wide disparities in access to mental health care, including care provided by primary care providers (PCPs) and specialty mental health providers (MHPs). Specifically, the Affordable Care Act (ACA) temporarily increased payments in 2013- 2014 by up to 25 percent for PCPs caring for Full Subsidy dual-eligible beneficiaries. Separately, the Medicare Improvements for Patients and Providers Act (MIPPA) gradually increased MHP payments (2009-2014) by up to 37 percent for Full Subsidy beneficiaries, and reduced beneficiary coinsurance for MHP visits from 50% to 20% for other beneficiaries (i.e., Partial Subsidy beneficiaries with incomes just above eligibility for Full Subsidies). In other settings, changes in provider payments and cost-sharing have been effective policy levers in modifying care utilization and access. In Medicare, these policies could reduce disparities by improving access to care for low-income income and Full Subsidy dual-eligibles, who are disproportionately racial/ethnic minorities; but there is little data on their effects. Despite the limited evidence, 34 states dropped PCP payment rates in 2015 (back to pre-2013 levels), while 16 states have continued the payment increase. We will use the natural experiments created by the ACA and MIPPA to assess the effects of these policy changes on racial/ethnic disparities in MH care within three sets of outcomes: Aim 1) medical care and quality process measures (e.g., outpatient visits to PCPs and MHPs for mental health diagnoses, antidepressant use in major depression); Aim 2) clinical events (e.g., emergency department visits and hospitalizations); and Aim 3) total and component medical spending. We will use comprehensive Medicare claims data (2006-2018) to compare longitudinal changes for Black, Hispanic, Asian, Native American and White beneficiaries affected vs. unaffected by the policies using a difference-in-difference approach with fixed effects (within-person) estimation. To estimate the effects of each policy, our identification strategy exploits the staggered implementation of each policy, differences across states in the magnitude of the payment changes based on baseline payment rates, and variations in exposure associated with eligibility for Full vs. Partial low-income subsidies. We will compare four resulting policy exposure groups: 1) beneficiaries affected by the PCP (2013- 2014) and MHP payment increases; 2) beneficiaries affected by the extended PCP (2013-2018) and MHP payment increases; 3) beneficiaries affected only by the MHP cost-sharing decrease; and 4) beneficiaries unaffected by either policy (concurrent controls). The findings from this study have the potential to inform decision-makers seeking to reduce the substantial disparities in MH care with actionable findings, especially as the federal government and states make ongoing decisions about payment policy and benefit design. Project Narrative The Federal Collaborative for Health Disparities Research has identified racial and ethnic disparities in mental health care access and treatment as a top area needing immediate national attention. Recently, the Medicare program implemented two policies that increased physician payments for care provided to the poorest beneficiaries and reduced beneficiary out-of-pocket costs for specialty mental health care. These policies could increase access to primary and mental health care for racial and ethnic minorities with mental illness and reduce existing disparities. This project will assess the impact of these major policy changes on disparities in access, treatment, patient outcomes, and medical spending.",Medicare Policy Effects on Mental Health Care Disparities,9850875,R01MD010456,"['Affect ', ' Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', ' Antidepressive Agents ', ' Antidepressant Agent ', ' Antidepressant Drugs ', ' Antidepressants ', ' anti-depressant agent ', ' anti-depressant drugs ', ' anti-depressants ', ' anti-depressive agents ', ' Asian Americans ', ' Attention ', ' Back ', ' Dorsum ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' psychological disorder ', ' Coinsurance ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Eligibility Determination ', ' Eligibility ', ' Protocol Screening ', ' Face ', ' faces ', ' facial ', ' Federal Government ', ' National Government ', ' Disabled Persons ', ' Disabled Population ', ' Handicapped ', ' People with Disabilities ', ' Persons with Disabilities ', ' disabled ', ' disabled individual ', ' disabled people ', ' individuals with disabilities ', ' Health ', ' Medicare ', ' Health Insurance for Aged and Disabled, Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Disabled Title 18 ', ' Title 18 ', ' health insurance for disabled ', ' Health Personnel ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' health care worker ', ' health provider ', ' health workforce ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' medical personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' Access to Care ', ' access to health services ', ' access to services ', ' access to treatment ', ' accessibility to health services ', ' availability of services ', ' care access ', ' health service access ', ' health services availability ', ' service availability ', ' treatment access ', ' Hispanic Americans ', ' Spanish Americans ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Hospital Admission ', ' Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Economical Income ', ' Medicaid ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' mortality ', ' Persons ', ' Outpatients ', ' Out-patients ', ' parity ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Race ', ' Racial Group ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Research ', ' medical specialties ', ' Specialty ', ' Asians ', ' oriental ', ' Measures ', ' Cost Sharing ', ' Afro American ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Black Populations ', ' black American ', ' African American ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Latino Population ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' hispanic community ', ' Hispanics ', ' Outcome Measure ', ' Process Measure ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Medical ', ' Policies ', ' Funding ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Native Americans ', ' programs ', ' Event ', ' Side ', ' Source ', ' Visit ', ' American ', ' Medicare/Medicaid ', ' payment ', ' Sentinel ', ' Drops ', ' Provider ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' clinical depression ', ' major depression ', ' major depression disorder ', ' Major Depressive Disorder ', ' Low income ', ' Data ', ' Improve Access ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Patterns of Care ', ' beneficiary ', ' cost ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' Natural experiment ', ' dual eligible ', ' federal poverty level ', ' ethnic minority ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' Medicare claim ', ' ED visit ', ' ER visit ', ' Emergency care visit ', ' Emergency hospital visit ', ' Emergency room visit ', ' Emergency department visit ', ' racial minority ', ' reduce disparity ', ' disparity reduction ', ' disparity in care ', ' disparity in healthcare ', ' healthcare disparity ', ' health care disparity ', ' Obamacare ', ' Affordable Care Act ', ' access to health care ', ' access to healthcare ', ' accessibility of health care ', ' accessibility to health care ', ' accessibility to healthcare ', ' health care access ', ' health care service access ', ' health care service availability ', ' healthcare access ', ' healthcare accessibility ', ' healthcare availability ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare service availability ', ' health care availability ', ' primary care provider ', ' care providers ', ' ']",NIMHD,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R01,2020,623185,0.06058846409091111
"Impact of Telemedicine on Medicare Beneficiaries with Mental Illness PROJECT SUMMARY Access to mental health specialists is difficult for many patients in the U.S., particularly for the poor and those who live in rural communities. Telemental health is one potential solution for this access problem, and there has been rapid growth in the number of live video-based telemental health visits in the U.S. While there are numerous rigorous randomized-control trials comparing telemental health visits to in-person mental health specialist care, there have been little research on how telemental health is being used in real-world settings. The uptake of telemental health has been very uneven geographically, and what explains this variation is also largely unknown. Our mixed-methods proposal centers on filling these gaps in knowledge. Under the first aim, we will conduct a series of descriptive analyses of data on 75 million adults with Medicare or commercial insurance to understand how telemental health is being used in conjunction with in-person care and whether the growth of telemental health has decreased disparities in the use of mental health specialists among disadvantaged populations. Under the second aim, we seek to explain why there is geographic variation in uptake using robust statistical machine learning. Under the third aim, we exploit the variation in uptake to assess whether communities with greater telemental health penetration have experienced improvements in care for patients with mental illness. In the fourth aim we will conduct qualitative interviews with providers to complement the empirical analyses and understand the key contextual factors underlying our findings. Understanding how telemental health is being used, why there is variation in use of telemental health, and whether telemental health use is associated with higher quality care could help drive future telemental health interventions and influence the ongoing policy debate on telemedicine regulations and reimbursement. Together the results of these aims are consistent with the NIMH's expressed interest in innovative delivery models that can improve care for underserved communities. It is difficult for many patients with mental illness to access care from a mental health specialist. Telemental health is one way to potentially help these patients receive care and the number of such visits for mental illness has increased rapidly. In this project, we will study how telemental health is being used to care for patients with mental illness, what drives variation in use, and whether telemedicine is associated with receipt of higher quality care.",Impact of Telemedicine on Medicare Beneficiaries with Mental Illness,9821740,R01MH112829,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Affect ', ' Automobile Driving ', ' driving ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' psychological disorder ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Communities ', ' Complement ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Congresses ', ' meeting reports ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Diffusion ', ' Future ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Geography ', ' Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Disabled Persons ', ' Disabled Population ', ' Handicapped ', ' People with Disabilities ', ' Persons with Disabilities ', ' disabled ', ' disabled individual ', ' disabled people ', ' individuals with disabilities ', ' Health ', ' Medicare ', ' Health Insurance for Aged and Disabled, Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Disabled Title 18 ', ' Title 18 ', ' health insurance for disabled ', ' Health Personnel ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' health care worker ', ' health provider ', ' health workforce ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' medical personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' Access to Care ', ' access to health services ', ' access to services ', ' access to treatment ', ' accessibility to health services ', ' availability of services ', ' care access ', ' health service access ', ' health services availability ', ' service availability ', ' treatment access ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Hospital Admission ', ' Insurance ', ' Interview ', ' Laws ', ' Literature ', ' Medicaid ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Methods ', ' Persons ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' NIMH ', ' Patients ', ' Psychotic Disorders ', ' Psychoses ', ' psychotic illness ', ' Research ', ' Schizophrenia ', ' Schizophrenic Disorders ', ' dementia praecox ', ' schizophrenic ', ' medical specialties ', ' Specialty ', ' Testing ', ' Work ', ' conference ', ' convention ', ' summit ', ' symposia ', ' symposium ', ' Rural Community ', ' Specialist ', ' Caring ', ' Telemedicine ', ' base ', ' rural region ', ' rural area ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Penetration ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Series ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' mental ', ' Psyche structure ', ' Rural ', ' Policies ', ' uptake ', ' WWW ', ' web ', ' world wide web ', ' Internet ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Pattern ', ' Application Context ', ' contextual factors ', ' interest ', ' Visit ', ' experience ', ' Speed ', ' Structure ', ' Regulation ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' QOC ', ' Quality of Care ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Provider ', ' geographic variation ', ' geographic difference ', ' Low income ', ' Address ', ' Health system ', ' Data ', ' Improve Access ', ' randomisation ', ' randomization ', ' randomly assigned ', ' Randomized ', ' trend ', ' beneficiary ', ' drug adherence ', ' drug compliance ', ' medication adherence ', ' medication compliance ', ' rapid growth ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' chronic mental illness ', ' persistent mental illness ', ' serious mental disorder ', ' serious mental illness ', ' severe mental disorder ', ' severe mental illness ', ' elderly patient ', ' older patient ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' trial comparing ', ' demographics ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' control trial ', ' population health ', ' ED visit ', ' ER visit ', ' Emergency care visit ', ' Emergency hospital visit ', ' Emergency room visit ', ' Emergency department visit ', ' improved outcome ', ' disadvantaged population ', ' Telemental ', ' care costs ', ' statistical and machine learning ', ' machine learning method ', ' ']",NIMH,HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL,R01,2020,709065,0.05345028552520458
"Measuring Medical Care Experiences and Traumatic Stress in Differences of Sex Development PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Differences of sex development (DSD) are heterogeneous conditions that involve discordance between genetic, gonadal, or phenotypic sex evident at birth or through atypical development during puberty. DSD pose unique clinical management and psychosocial challenges, including impairments to fertility, sexual and urological function, atypical genitalia, increased incidence of gender identity incongruent with gender of rearing, and at times, controversies about gonadectomy and/or genital surgery, which are often performed in infancy before individuals with DSD can participate in decision-making or provide consent. Individuals with DSD are at risk for mental health problems, including traumatic stress symptoms, anxiety, depression, and suicidality, but little is known about relationships between medical care experiences and mental health. Although interdisciplinary care is currently recommended for DSD, medical care remains variable and controversial, with a paucity of data to guide empirically supported medical and psychosocial care practices. Some individuals with DSD report devastating experiences related to their medical care including distress over a lack of autonomy to make critical decisions about medical interventions performed for primarily psychosocial and non- medical purposes (e.g., genital/gender-typifying surgeries performed in infancy) and frequent genital medical exams and photography, often performed without clearly communicated rationales. A significant barrier to understanding medical care practices, experiences, impacts, and patient needs is the lack of any patient- centered, validated instruments specific to the DSD population to assess these issues and their relationships with mental health, including traumatic stress symptoms. Using a community-based participatory research approach and building on the foundation of our prior DSD research, we will develop, pilot, and establish initial psychometrics for a novel youth self-report instrument which will assess DSD care-related preferences, needs, experiences, and impacts on mental health among youth with DSD (ages 11-18 years). Specific aims include: 1) Convening a diverse Stakeholder Advisory Board consisting of youth with DSD, caregivers of youth with DSD, adults with DSD, and DSD clinicians representing a range of specialties to identify key domains of experiences and needs and item content identification to evaluate medical care experiences and their impacts on well-being; 2) Refining items for comprehensibility, content validity, acceptability/cultural competence, and coverage of key experiences through iterative cognitive interviewing; and 3) Evaluating initial psychometric properties of the developed instrument, including test-retest reliability and convergent and criterion validity. Our overarching objective is to expand access to personalized care in an underserved, vulnerable pediatric population, youth with DSD, by identifying medical care practices associated with positive and poor adjustment and informing tailored interventions to promote well-being. PROJECT NARRATIVE Youth with differences/disorders of sex development (DSD) often experience stressful medical care experiences linked to mental health risks, including traumatic stress, anxiety, depression, and suicidality, although little is known about how diverse medical care experiences differentially impact mental health and well-being.

"Impact of peer Support on Health Services and Social Disparities Among Minority Youth with SMI Project Summary/Abstract This mixed methods study aims to assess whether peer-support reduces disparities in mental health service utilization and social outcomes among transitional age youth (TAY) age 16-24 with severe mental illness (SMI). TAY with SMI face extraordinary challenges in their transition to adulthood and exhibit lower levels of educational attainment, and higher rates of unemployment, poverty, unplanned pregnancy, substance use, homelessness, and justice system involvement than TAY without SMI. These disparities are exacerbated among minority TAY. Therefore, there is a great need for evidence-based, culturally tailored interventions that effectively link TAY to resources that can improve their mental health and social outcomes. The 2004 California Mental Health Services Act funded hundreds of new TAY-specific programs; while TAY peer support services are now pervasive in mental health programs, evidence regarding their effectiveness for TAY with SMI is largely lacking. Therefore, this study aims to (1) Estimate quantitatively whether the use of peer support reduces racial / ethnic disparities in mental health services and social outcomes among TAY living with SMI; (2) Identify quantitatively which types or combinations of peer supports are most effective at improving mental health services and social outcomes and reducing racial / ethnic disparities among TAY; (3) Estimate the additional mental health service costs or cost savings associated with providing peer support services to TAY; (4) Qualitatively elucidate TAY clients’ and peer providers’ perceptions of how TAY peer support relates to mental health services and social outcomes disparities; and (5) Qualitatively characterize barriers and facilitators to the use of TAY peer support by TAY program managers and county administrators. To meet these aims, we will survey TAY programs (N=140), analyze five years of administrative data to assess costs or cost-savings associated with using peer support services (N=8,800, Aims 1-3) and conduct small group interviews with TAY peer providers (n=30-40), focus groups with TAY clients (n=60-80), and individual interviews with as TAY program managers (n=20) and county administrators (n=6-10) (Aims 4 and 5). This study leverages a major system redesign in California’s mental health system and aims to rigorously study a large-scale implementation of TAY peer support services. Findings will help providers and policy-makers make informed decisions about the effectiveness of peer support in reducing disparities among minority TAY living with SMI and enable us to make recommendations on potential best-practices in the use of TAY peer supports. Project Narrative This mixed methods study aims to test the effectiveness of peer-support in reducing disparities in mental health services and social outcomes among minority transitional age youth (TAY) ages 16-24 with severe mental illness (SMI).

"Treatment Development of Yoga for Anger Management in Incarcerated Adults In the criminal justice (CJ) system in the US, there are high rates of mental health and substance use disorders. Although prisons must provide treatment, the CJ system is resource-poor and the presenting problems of prisoners are diverse. To maximize efficiency in the CJ context, recent efforts focus adjunctive interventions on symptoms that are most detrimental to prisoners, and that are shared across diverse conditions. Of particular interest has been anger dysregulation, as this is prevalent in CJ-involved populations, contributing not only to distress and exacerbation of other mental health problems, but also to risk of aggression. Overt aggression further increases risk for prison behavioral infractions or placement in restraints or seclusion, and may delay parole or release decisions. There are many limitations to existing approaches to anger management in prison. We propose that hatha yoga could serve as a useful adjunctive treatment for anger within prisons. In addition to preliminary research showing that yoga programs may improve anger regulation, research has also demonstrated benefits of yoga for related symptoms of depression, anxiety, and trauma-related emotion reactivity and arousal. Yoga may be delivered in a relatively low-cost fashion. Finally, prisoners may view yoga as less stigmatizing than more traditional anger management interventions, particularly given its focus on physical body awareness/movement and on overall wellness. Despite a recent proliferation of yoga programs for various problems in prisons, empirical research on this topic is minimal, with a small number of studies limited by significant methodological concerns. We propose to conduct systematic treatment development research that would prepare us to study whether yoga (vs. a health education control group) is an effective adjunctive treatment for prisoners with anger dysregulation. In Phase 1 (Treatment Development Stage 1A) of the proposed project, we will refine our current manualized Hatha yoga intervention and health education intervention for specific use with prisoners with high levels of anger dysregulation. We will conduct focus groups with prisoners and prison administrators, and solicit feedback from relevant experts, in order to make modifications to our yoga and health education treatment manuals. In Phase 2 (Treatment Development Stage 1B), we will conduct a pilot randomized clinical trial (n = 40) of Hatha yoga vs. a health education group (attention control) for prisoners high in self-reported anger dysregulation. Participants will be enrolled in the active intervention for 10 weeks, and then followed for 8 weeks. We will assess feasibility and acceptability of the yoga program, the health education control group, and research procedures. To assess safety, we will track all adverse events in a structured fashion. We do not expect to see any serious adverse events definitely or probably related to study participation. We will iteratively revise manuals and materials, making final revisions at the end of the pilot RCT. If successful, this project will provide us with materials, experience, and pilot data needed for the next stage of this line of research, namely, a fully powered RCT. Project Narrative Anger dysregulation is prevalent in prison populations, contributes to distress and exacerbation of mental health problems, increases risk of aggression within prison, and may precipitate future criminal offending after release. A hatha yoga program may effectively target anger dysregulation within the prison setting. The purpose of this project is to develop and pilot-test such a program, in preparation for a larger scale study, so that we may effectively help people in prison manage anger, improve their overall mental health, and decrease the risk of physical aggression in and out of prison.",Treatment Development of Yoga for Anger Management in Incarcerated Adults,9848511,R34AT010172,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Aggressive behavior ', ' Aggression ', ' Anger ', ' angers ', ' angry ', ' Anxiety ', ' Anxiety Disorders ', ' Arousal ', ' Awareness ', ' Control Groups ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Emotions ', ' Feedback ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Future ', ' Health education ', ' Health Instruction ', ' Health Tutoring ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Impulse Control Disorders ', ' Interview ', ' Manuals ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Methodology ', ' mortality ', ' Movement ', ' body movement ', ' Prisoner ', ' Prison Inmates ', ' correctional institution resident ', ' jail inmate ', ' Prisons ', ' Psychotherapy ', ' Research ', ' research and development ', ' Development and Research ', ' R & D ', ' R&D ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Safety ', ' Social support ', ' social support network ', ' Stigmatization ', ' Substance Use Disorder ', ' Taxes ', ' Testing ', ' Thinking ', ' thoughts ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Yoga ', ' Measures ', ' Administrator ', ' Criminal Justice ', ' Emotional Depression ', ' depression symptom ', ' depressive ', ' depressive symptoms ', ' injuries ', ' Injury ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Clinical ', ' prematurity ', ' premature ', ' incarcerated ', ' incarceration ', ' Imprisonment ', ' Phase ', ' Randomized Clinical Trials ', ' Distress ', ' AOD use ', ' substance use ', ' substance using ', ' using substances ', ' Alcohol or Other Drugs use ', ' satisfaction ', ' Education for Intervention ', ' Instruction Intervention ', ' Training Intervention ', ' instructional intervention ', ' Educational Intervention ', ' restraint ', ' Psychiatric Diagnosis ', ' Empirical Research ', ' programs ', ' Physical aggression ', ' fighting ', ' System ', ' Best Practice Analysis ', ' Benchmarking ', ' interest ', ' instructor ', ' anger management ', ' suicide risk ', ' suicidal risk ', ' experience ', ' Structure ', ' Participant ', ' recidivism ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Reporting ', ' parole ', ' Impulsivity ', ' Emotional ', ' Regulation ', ' Deterioration ', ' stigma ', ' social stigma ', ' Adverse Experience ', ' Adverse event ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Symptoms ', ' Adherence ', ' Data ', ' Cognitive ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Severe Adverse Event ', ' serious adverse experience ', ' serious adverse reaction ', ' Serious Adverse Event ', ' Preparation ', ' Modification ', ' Behavioral ', ' cost ', ' Outcome ', ' Expectancy ', ' criminal offending ', ' Population ', ' Trauma ', ' addictive disorder ', ' addiction ', ' develop therapy ', ' intervention development ', ' treatment development ', ' therapy development ', ' primary outcome ', ' arm ', ' disparities in race ', ' race disparity ', ' racial disparity ', ' socioeconomic disparity ', ' attentional control ', ' ethnicity disparity ', ' ethnic disparity ', ' substance misuse ', ' recruit ', ' ']",NCCIH,BROWN UNIVERSITY,R34,2020,246478,0.03410163014679546
"Penn mental health AIDS research center Overview Abstract/Summary The overarching theme of the Penn Mental Health AIDS Research Center (PMHARC) at the University of Pennsylvania (Penn) and Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) is to transform how individuals with comorbid mental illness/AIDS are treated and managed by developing innovative, interdisciplinary, and integrative approaches to optimize psychiatric, behavioral, and medical outcomes and achieving a better understanding of the biological, psychological, and behavioral mechanisms underlying these combined illnesses and treatments. No other center in the U.S. is currently pursuing this explicit focus, making PMHARC unique in the NIMH ARC portfolio. A substantial body of work links psychiatric disorders to acquisition of HIV infection, accelerated immune dysfunction, poor access to HIV care, and poor adherence to antiretroviral treatment once in care. Yet, there is a relative paucity of evidence-based interventions focused on the combined treatment of mental illness/AIDS and related medical co-morbidities, and relatively little work in determining the relationships between mental health treatment and HIV/AIDS disease and understanding the underlying biology. PMHARC will stimulate novel approaches and strategies to address these problems by providing mentoring and resource support for both new and established investigators choosing to study comorbid mental illness/AIDS, in part through innovative pilot studies. PMHARC's leadership has extensive expertise in contemporary pharmacotherapy of mental illness and AIDS, cognitive behavioral treatments, and theory-based behavioral interventions. PMHARC will extend well-established collaborations at Penn and CHOP, including those in the Department of Psychiatry and the CFAR, as well as with the CTSA/CTRC, the Delaney Collaboratory, and community partners in Philadelphia. A unique feature of PMHARC is the collaboration of well- established mental health AIDS researchers, well-established mental health researchers who have not previously studied AIDS, well-established substance abuse AIDS researchers who have not previously studied mental health, and AIDS researchers not previously focused on mental health. PMHARC has an Administrative and Developmental Core, and four Shared Resource Cores. Overview Relevance: A growing body of research documents that persons with mental illness are at increased risk for contracting and transmitting HIV, and there are few evidence-based practices supporting treatment of persons with mental illnesses who are also HIV seropositive. Poor treatment outcomes and non-adherence pose a major public health threat due to poor individual outcomes and increased transmissibility and secondary infections. Thus, improving treatments for persons with these comorbid conditions has major public health significance.",Penn mental health AIDS research center,9864089,P30MH097488,"['Acquired Immunodeficiency

"Navigating Resource-Constrained Systems and Communities to Promote the Behavioral Health of Black Youth PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Black youth living in poverty-impacted communities are disproportionately burdened by behavioral health challenges, notably serious disruptive behavioral difficulties (DBDs). Without access to care, children with DBDs frequently suffer serious impairment. This study is based on the premise that if care navigation models are going to succeed in eliminating racial disparities in child mental health care, then the preparation and support for child behavioral health navigators (cbhNs) needs to include: 1) training to deliver evidence-based family engagement, psychoeducation and support interventions; 2) ongoing coaching and supervision focused on building collaborative relationships between families and provider partners and; 3) skills to enhance community/system buy-in, as well as to analyze and interrupt multi-level structural influences on disparities and system gaps. involves individuals STL. integrates education, The proposed study (in response to PAR 18-428) will be conducted in 2 phases. Phase 1 the r ecruitment and training of a new cohort of cbhNs (n=15), intentionally involving committed of color from an existing community-based network of outh service system partners, HomeGrown CbhNs will be prepared to collaborate with youth/families via an interactive training protocol which existing vidence-based approaches, including engagement interventions 19 , family support and adapted care navigation models and empirically supported implementation strategies to address y e barriers. Phase 2 is a mixed methods, hybrid effectiveness implementation experimental study, enrolling 390 early adolescent youth (10 to 14 years) of African descent and their families living in geographically defined St. Louis north city and county neighborhoods (racially segregated areas with high poverty concentration). The study aims to simultaneously examine multi-level factors that enhance or impede cbhN interaction and youth/family outcomes. In stakeholders, addition, the study explores the response to cbhNs by key network and system as well as of the cbhNs.This study is being conducted by a transdisciplinary network of scientists at Washington University in St. Louis and New York University in collaboration with St. Louis service organizations, policy officials and the HomeGrown STL Advisory Board. This application aligns with NIH's priorities to address underlying health disparities, as well as to enhance public health impact of mental health focused research studies. NARRATIVE Black youth living in poverty-impacted communities are disproportionately burdened by behavioral health challenges, notably serious disruptive behavioral difficulties (DBDs). If care navigation models are going to succeed where previous efforts have failed in eliminating racial disparities in child mental health care, then child behavioral health navigator (cbhN) training needs to include: 1) preparation to deliver evidence-based family engagement, psychoeducation and support interventions; 2) ongoing coaching and supervision focused on building collaborative family/provider relationships; 3) skills and community/system buy-in to analyze and interrupt multi-level structural influences on disparities and system gaps.

"University of Miami Developmental HIV/AIDS Mental Health Research Center (D-ARC) Project Summary (Overall)  This application from the University of Miami (UM) for a Developmental AIDS Research Center (UM D- ARC) proposes to establish a behavioral science hub advancing mental health (MH) HIV research in a US region hardest hit by HIV/AIDS. The over-arching Center theme, “Reducing the Impact of Mental Health and Minority Health Disparities across the HIV Prevention and Care Continua,” is directly relevant to the uncontrolled HIV/AIDS epidemic in the Greater Miami area, and this developmental funding will provide a pathway for dynamic growth to a subsequent full ARC application. Over the initial funding period, we will consolidate, coordinate, and augment institutional resources as well as develop and expand regional and national collaborations. Miami has the highest HIV incidence and prevalence of any US city and fares worst, geographically, on every CDC indicator of HIV impact. Developing a D-ARC focused on MH at UM is also of high public health significance, as Miami’s diverse populations face significant MH disparities, making the area an ideal setting for MH research across diverse populations disproportionately affected by the epidemic.  The organization of the UM D-ARC Cores represents a logical and innovative approach to establishing a D-ARC in an institution that has a growing cadre of behavioral scientists and a strategic goal of increasing HIV research. We propose the required Administrative (Admin) Core and Developmental (Dev) Core and two (rather than the required one) complementary Research Cores: a Methods Core and a Mental Health Disparities (MHD) Core. The Admin Core will embody Center leadership, governance, and strategic planning and coordinate the bi-directional community engagement activities that are key to the work of all Cores. The Dev Core will focus on awarding pilot studies and mentoring early stage investigators. The Methods Core will provide innovative research design, biostatistical, and data management expertise and collaborate with the MHD Core to construct, expand, and maintain Center Common Data Elements (CDE), consent-to-contact databases, and a REDCap measures library to maximize resource sharing. The MHD Core will provide expertise and resources to promote culturally competent, theory-driven approaches, tools, and interventions in ethical, multi-level, community-engaged research addressing MH and minority health disparities in HIV.  The developmental activities proposed for the new UM D-ARC have the overarching goal of increasing local MH HIV/AIDS research consistent with the center theme and UM strategic goals regarding HIV/AIDS and will leverage strong institutional support. This structure allows for attainment of our Overall Aims, which are to establish the Developmental Center, and to grow by promoting research that mitigates the impact of MH and minority health disparities across the HIV prevention and treatment continuum. The UM D-ARC has the unique potential for high-impact research addressing HIV among hardest-hit populations in greatest need and at greatest risk for falling off of the HIV prevention and treatment continua. PROJECT NARRITIVE  This proposal for what would be the first NIMH Developmental Mental Health HIV/AIDS Center (D- ARC) from the University Of Miami (UM) has exceptionally high public health significance; the D-ARC would be situated in one of the hardest hit geographic areas affected by the epidemic, at an institution with a strong and growing faculty of mental health HIV/AIDS researchers with ties to the local health departments, and to the local community. The proposed D-ARC will catalyze high-impact research efforts addressing mental health disparities, answering key questions related to HIV prevention and care starting in a domestic epicenter, with implications that can be applied broadly, and stimulate growth to a full-fledged MH-ARC. The focus of expertise and center activities on those most at risk for not achieving U.S. and U.N. end-the-epidemic goals is an excellent match for the geographic area facing health and mental health disparities driving the HIV epidemic.",University of Miami Developmental HIV/AIDS Mental Health Research Center (D-ARC),10220206,P30MH116867,"['Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome ', ' AIDS ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immuno-Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immunologic Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Affect ', ' Automobile Driving ', ' driving ', ' Award ', ' Ursidae Family ', ' Bears ', ' Ursidae ', ' bear ', ' Behavioral Research ', ' Behavioral Sciences ', ' Biometry ', ' Biometrics ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' CDC ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' Cities ', ' Communities ', ' comorbidity ', ' co-morbid ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Epidemic ', ' Ethics ', ' ethical ', ' Face ', ' faces ', ' facial ', ' Faculty ', ' Florida ', ' Future ', ' Geographic Locations ', ' Geographic Area ', ' Geographic Region ', ' Geographical Location ', ' geographic site ', ' Geography ', ' Goals ', ' Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Health ', ' HIV ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Hospitals ', ' Incidence ', ' Leadership ', ' Libraries ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' NIMH ', ' Patients ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Research Design ', ' Study Type ', ' study design ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Research Support ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Science ', ' United Nations ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Latino Population ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' hispanic community ', ' Hispanics ', ' Latino ', ' diverse populations ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' population diversity ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' Research Methods ', ' Research Methodology ', ' HIV Prevention ', ' HIV/AIDS prevention ', ' AIDS prevention ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' Area ', ' Failure ', ' Individual ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Databases ', ' Funding ', ' uptake ', ' Collaborations ', ' tool ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' Clinic ', ' Viral ', ' meetings ', ' data management ', ' Structure ', ' Prevention Research ', ' Categories ', ' Prevention ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' AIDS/HIV ', ' HIV/AIDS ', ' HIV/AIDS problem ', ' AIDS/HIV problem ', ' theories ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' fall risk ', ' Institution ', ' Address ', ' Consent ', ' Data ', ' Resource Sharing ', ' Strategic Planning ', ' Common Data Element ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' minority health ', ' biobehavioral ', ' biobehavior ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' high risk ', ' community partnership ', ' PrEP ', ' pre-exposure prophylaxis ', ' recruit ', ' barrier to health care ', ' barrier to healthcare ', ' barrier to treatment ', ' obstacle to care ', ' obstacle to healthcare ', ' barrier to care ', ' social structural ', ' socio-structural ', ' sociostructural ', ' social structure ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF MIAMI CORAL GABLES,P30,2020,301000,0.08198353810672049
"Mental Health Research Network III Practice-based research has the potential to dramatically improve the speed, efficiency, relevance, and impact of mental health clinical and services research. Realizing those gains will require a practice-based research network capable of anticipating and adapting to changes in mental health care delivery, including: • Research fully embedded in real-world practice • Alignment of research goals with priorities of patient and health system stakeholders • Large-scale data infrastructure available for rapid analysis • A culture of trust and transparency to facilitate collaborative learning and improvement We propose to expand the existing Mental Health Research Network (MHRN) to include 14 research centers embedded in health systems serving a combined population of over 25 million patients in 16 states. MHRN infrastructure will be enhanced to support a next-generation practice-based network, including: • Increased engagement of patients, health system leaders, and other stakeholders in network governance • An expanded public, open-source library of software tools and other technical resources • More formal processes for conducting feasibility pilot projects and rapid response to stakeholder queries • Expanded outreach to external stakeholders and research partners This Overall application requests support for an Administrative Core, a Methods core, and four research projects. The Administrative Core will support all network activities, including ongoing affiliated research projects, new research projects proposed in this application, and new projects developed during the coming funding cycle. An Organizational Unit will include executive leadership, governance, strategic planning, and responsibility for financial management and regulatory compliance. An Outreach and External Collaboration Unit will be responsible for stakeholder engagement and developing collaborations with new research partners. An Emerging Issues Unit will support timely responses to emerging scientific and public health questions. The Methods Core will support optimal use of existing methods across all network research and develop new methods to address high-priority public health questions. An Informatics Unit will maintain and improve network data infrastructure and disseminate network-developed informatics resources. A Scientific Analysis Unit will focus on improving the methodologic rigor of network projects and development of innovative analytic methods driven by stakeholder needs. These infrastructure resources will support two Signature research projects (a pragmatic trial of eHealth interventions for perinatal depression and a real-time evaluation of new medications to address suicide risk) and two Pilot research projects (an investigation of stakeholder perspectives on implementation of suicide risk prediction models and a pilot trial of outreach to reduce disparities in depression treatment initiation). The Mental Health Research Network will conduct practice-based mental health research in large healthcare systems serving over 25 million patients in 16 states. Infrastructure will include an Administrative Core responsible for governance, communications, and fostering research collaborations as well as a Methods Core responsible for advancing methods in mental health informatics and analytic methods.
