"WOMEN'S SOCIOECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AND HEALTH Throughout the developing world, there is evidence of declining rates of mortality and fertility, yet no clear understanding of the factors driving this change, nor the extent to which these health improvements are being experienced equitably by sub-sections of the population.  This study uses data from Matlab, Bangladesh to explore the role of women's socioeconomic development in hastening health improvement and lessening health disparity.  Its specific aims are to: 1) Consider the various determinants of health change and in particular, the relative importance of women's socioeconomic development versus health-specific interventions in explaining this change; 2) Evaluate socioeconomic and gender disparities in a variety of health outcomes and assess whether these inequities have been increasing or decreasing over the course of the decade; and 3) Specify the mechanisms through which women's socioeconomic development influences health behaviors and outcomes.  The study benefits from access to one of the most established and accurate sources of demographic data in the developing world.  Established in 1966, the Demographic Surveillance System (DSS) in Matlab monitors vital events on a population of over 200,000 by means of bimonthly household visits.  Linked to the DSS registration system, the study employs a four-cell research design.  The four cells are comprised of a sample of communities located in areas in which a women-focused NGO development program is operating; a sample population that is receiving intensive health outreach activities; a cell consisting of communities in which both women's socioeconomic development and health outreach activities are conducted; and a ""comparison cell"" where only government services are being provided.  In 1992, baseline data were collected prior to the initiation of women's socioeconomic development activities on a random sample of 11,343 households. This survey was repeated in August 1998 to enable the assessment of the rate and magnitude of health change between and within the four cell design.  A factorial design is employed to analyze these differences over time.  In addition to the quantitative survey, the study will analyze qualitative data that monitor the experience of a sub-sample of women involved in socioeconomic development activities to shed further light on the mechanisms underlying health change.

"GENDER DIFFERENCES IN CELLULAR RESPONSE TO CHALLENGES Autoimmune and other diseases frequently manifest a sexual disparity that is often attributed to hormonal differences.  This explanation does not account for the difference in frequency rather than severity between the sexes; nor does it explain the frequent failure of hormonal countervention to alleviate a problem.  We propose that inherent biological differences between otherwise identical male and female cells can be a source of the disparity.  Such a possibility has been studied only minimally. We have found in initial studies, which are consistent with the few publications available, that there is a marked difference between male and female cells in their responses to cell death inducing stimuli.  We will analyze this possibility by collecting cells from several tissues (liver, brain, thymus, heart) of embryonic mice, sexing the embryos and noting both their position in the uterus and the sex of their neighbors.  We will culture these cells in primary culture and challenge them with a range of cell death inducing stimuli, including commonly used laboratory challenges such as H2O2 and ethanol, physiological challenges such as TNF-alpha, Fas and Fas ligand, and glucocorticoids, and medically relevant chemotherapeutic agents.  We will assess the dose- and time-dependent sensitivity of the male and female cells to these several challenges.  This assessment will include direct observation of the viability of the cells as well as analysis of which aspects of cell death respond differentially: activation of ceramide 2nd messenger signaling, caspase and lysosome activity, and degradation of chromatin and DNA.  Starting with the eatliest embroyos that we can sex, we will extend the studies to include later embryos, newborns, juveniles, and pubertal animals, to determine whether the in vivo differences can be accounted for by initial genetic differences or whether they arise only after exposure to sex hormones.  In these experiments we will also be able to determine the extent to which hormone-derived differences persist in the absence of hormones.  These experiments represent both a direct inquiry into the mechanism of gender related difference in disease and an entry point for this investigator to the field of gender differences in autoimmune disease.

"Trichomonas vaginalis Genetic Analysis of Cell Adherence DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Trichomonas vaginalis is responsible for serious health consequences for women. Significantly, the infection by this parasite is a co-factor in amplifying the transmission of HIV among African American and Hispanic women contributing to poor minority health and health disparities in our nation. Fundamental aspects of Trichomonas cell and molecular biology remain unknown, despite the impact to public health. Our long-term goal is to understand the molecular basis of pathogenesis. Adherence of trichomonads to vaginal epithelial cells is important for infection, and, therefore, the objective of this proposal is to study the structure, function and regulation of T. vaginalis AP65 adhesin compartmentalization. The rationale for undertaking these studies is that more effective means of control of infectious diseases requires enhanced knowledge of the fundamental biological processes that govern virulence. The AP65 adhesin has sequence identity to malic enzyme (decarboxylating), an enzyme of organelles called hydrogenosomes. Thus, AP65 belongs to the category of surface-associated microbial enzymes with functional diversity. The hypotheses being tested are that i) iron regulates gene expression, compartmentalization and surface placement of all members of the ap65 gene family, ii) there is cross signaling by phosphorylation of trichomonads and AP65 following adherence, and iii) there is a quantitative relationship between host epithelial cell receptors for AP65 and levels of cytoadherence. Four aims are proposed. Aim 1 will show compartmentalization outside hydrogenosomes by expressing tagged-AP65 fusion in wild type and MR100 (AP65-negative) mutants. Aim 2 will determine the mechanism of ompartmentalization of AP65. Aim 3 will examine the differential binding of trichomonads to host epithelial cells mediated through AP65 and cell receptor. Finally, Aim 4 will silence expression of the ap65 genes. In addition to the biological merit, innovative aspects of our proposal are our use of antisense transfection to silence expression of ap65, and the use of drug resistant MR100 lacking hydrogenosome proteins (AP65-negative) to study adherence.

"Trichomonas vaginalis: Molecular Analysis of Adherence DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Trichomonas vaginalis is a sexually transmitted protist causing serious health consequences for women. Trichomonosis is a co-factor in HIV transmission and contributes to preterm labor, cervical cancer and atypical pelvic inflammatory disease. Incidence and prevalence rates of this disease are especially high among minorities, contributing to health disparities. Despite this public health impact, fundamental aspects of trichomonad cell and molecular biology are unknown. Our long-term goal is to understand the molecular basis of adherence of trichomonads to vaginal epithelial cells. The rationale is that molecular dissection of this fundamental process of virulence will provide for effective means of control of this infectious disease. The objective of this work is to perform genetic analysis of T. vaginalis adherence mediated by the surface protein AP65, a protein with sequence identity to decarboxylating malic enzyme of the metabolic hydrogenosome organelle. The functional diversity and differential compartmentalization of a metabolic enzyme to mediate adherence is a unique adaptation by this parasite to colonizing the urogenital tract. The hypothesis is that contact with host cells and iron initiate a signal transduction cascade leading to phosphorylation and subsequent mobilization and surface placement of AP65, which allows for interaction of AP65 with a specific protein receptor on the host cell. Further, there is a quantitative relationship between the amount of AP65 on the parasite and the amount of available receptors on host cells that determines the level of adherence. To test the hypothesis, three specific aims are proposed: Aim 1 will silence and modulate expression of the AP65 adhesin through antisense RNA to provide genetic evidence for a role of AP65 in adherence. Aim 2 will express an epitope-tagged AP65 to study compartmentalization and surface targeting in response to iron levels. Aim 3 will characterize the role of phosphorylation of AP65 as a signal for surface placement. The aims will utilize episomally-expressed constructs of mutated phosphorylation sites and/or constructs with mutated regions within AP65 essential for surface targeting. The use of antisense RNA inhibition, the demonstration of signaling from host to parasite for protein surface targeting, and establishment of a stable transfection system for heterologous expression in trichomonads represent innovative aspects of research for studying the biology of Trichomonas organisms.

"Sickle Cell Disease Research Center (SCDRC) Summer Institute/Mentoring Program    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The mission of the Sickle Cell Disease Research Center (SCDRC) is to ""actively and aggressively participate in the substantive development of basic research and training efforts to improve treatment options or cure sickle cell disease"". The SIPID funding initiative is relevant to the mission of the SCDRC project because it will utilize a multidisciplinary approach to increase underrepresented minorities in Biomedical Research related to heart, lung, and blood disease. The program will fund summer institutes to enable 10-12 participants from underrepresented racial and ethnic groups to further develop their research skills and knowledge, thereby enhancing their career development as faculty members or scientists. The summer institute will focus on genomic-based biomedical research related to sickle cell disease (SCD): to introduce multidisciplinary approaches to genomic research and establish a broad base working knowledge of current technological advances and identify potential areas of future research projects involving modern DMA and protein analytical tools. This will be accomplished through classroom didactic lectures and hands-on bench training in laboratory settings. Our goals will include: increasing the number of racial and ethical underserved individuals who enter research careers by establishing a structured mentored training program and long-term research collaborations between mentors and mentees; increasing grantsmanship skills of participants; and identifying extramural research funding opportunities. Diversity of scientific and scholarly activity will be valuable in improving the public health of patients and subjects from diverse backgrounds. Studies have suggested that a racially concordant scientific staff is more successful in recruiting individuals from minority groups into clinical studies. Racially similar physician-patient dyads have been shown to be related to greater patient satisfaction in ways that may also enhance communication and participation in a clinical research setting. The need for a diverse workforce permeates all aspects of the nation's public health-related research efforts.

To test the hypothesis, three specific aims are proposed: Aim 1 will silence and modulate expression of the AP65 adhesin through antisense RNA to provide genetic evidence for a role of AP65 in adherence. Aim 2 will express an epitope-tagged AP65 to study compartmentalization and surface targeting in response to iron levels. Aim 3 will characterize the role of phosphorylation of AP65 as a signal for surface placement. The aims will utilize episomally-expressed constructs of mutated phosphorylation sites and/or constructs with mutated regions within AP65 essential for surface targeting. The use of antisense RNA inhibition, the demonstration of signaling from host to parasite for protein surface targeting, and establishment of a stable transfection system for heterologous expression in trichomonads represent innovative aspects of research for studying the biology of Trichomonas organisms.

"Hematopoietic Stem Cell Donor Enrollment and Retention in Korean Americans    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) transplantation is a potentially curative therapeutic option increasingly used for a variety of hematologic malignancies and disorders. HSC transplant into a recipient patient first requires the identification of a suitable human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-matched donor, and harvest of bone marrow or peripheral stem cells once a donor is identified. In the United States, the National Marrow Donor Program (NMDP) maintains a registry of potential volunteer donors who have undergone preliminary HLA-typing. Compared to Whites, Asian/Pacific Islander American (API) patients who search the NMDP registry have a lower likelihood of successfully receiving an unrelated, HLA-matched hematopoietic stem cell transplant. This disparity is attributable to at least two issues. First, there are fewer potentially matched donors available to API patients, possibly because of high HLA polymorphism within API populations. While 87% of White patients searching the NMDP registry found at least one potential matching donor, only 75% of API patients were able to find a potential match.6 Second, volunteer donors among API groups have a high rate of attrition from the registry. More than half (56%) of API potential donors preliminarily matched to patients did not complete the full medical and laboratory testing needed to complete HSC harvest and donation.6 We propose to obtain qualitative data from one API community (Korean Americans) regarding participation in the NMDP registry. We intend to identify factors that influence both the initial decision to enroll in the donor registry, as well as the continued participation in the registry over time. To address these two topics, we will conduct 40 baseline in-depth, semi-structured qualitative interviews among Korean adults 18-60 years of age following community NMDP registry enrollment drives; half of these interviews will be conducted among participants who choose to enroll in the registry, while the other half will be conducted among participants who decline to enroll. Follow-up qualitative interviews will be conducted one year after baseline interviews among the half of the participants that enroll in the NMDP registry. Interview topics will include discussion about cultural beliefs, knowledge, and attitudes that may influence participation in the NMDP registry. We believe this R03 Small Grant proposal offers the opportunity to identify and explore the factors associated with enrollment and retention of potential API hematopoietic stem cell donors in a national registry program. These qualitative data will be used to identify targets for an educational program to address the specific concerns in Asian/Pacific Islander communities regarding hematopoietic stem cell donation, and to increase retention among potential donors. Ultimately, we hope to increase the likelihood of identifying HLA-matched donors and successfully completing hematopoietic stem cell transplant among Asian/Pacific Islander patients. to Public Health: We believe this small grant proposal offers the opportunity to inductively identify and explore the factors associated with enrollment and retention of potential Asian/Pacific Islander hematopoietic stem cell donors in a national registry program. We hope to use these qualitative data to identify targets for an educational program to address the specific concerns in Asian/Pacific Islander communities regarding stem cell donation, and to increase retention among potential donors.

"Gender Differences in Experimental Aortic Aneurysms    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) comprise the 10th leading cause of death in Caucasian males 65-74 years of age and accounted for nearly 16,000 deaths overall in the year 2000. Understanding the pathophysiology of AAAs is an important undertaking. Clinically, multiple risk factors are associated with the development of AAAs, including increasing age, positive smoking history, and hypertension. Male gender is also a well-established risk factor for the development of an AAA with a 4:1 male to female ratio. The reason for this gender disparity is unknown. The pathogenesis of AAAs formation is complex and multifactorial. Histologically, AAAs are characterized by early chemokine driven leukocyte infiltration into the aortic wall with subsequent destruction of elastin and collagen in the media and adventitia by excessive local production of matrix degrading enzymes, and smooth muscle cell loss with thinning of the aortic wall. At present, there are no medical therapies available to treat patients with aortic aneurysms, using only the crude measurement of aortic diameter as a threshold for which patients must undergo life-threatening and costly surgery, either open or endovascularly. Therefore, defining the early mechanisms underlying gender-related differences in AAA formation are critical and will be the focus of the present investigation. Understanding differences in disease patterns based on gender may allow us to develop new translational approaches to the prevention and treatment of patients with aortic aneurysms. Overall hypothesis: Gender- related differences in aortic aneurysm formation are mediated by the hormonal (androgen: estrogen ratio) regulation of leukocyte trafficking into the aortic wall. Specific Aim 1. To define the mechanism by which early inflammatory cell recruitment is accelerated in males during AAA formation. Studies will test the hypothesis that increased incidence of AAAs in males is secondary to increased recruitment of leukocytes into the aortic wall driven by an excess of androgens relative to estrogens. Specific Aim 2. To demonstrate that gonadal hormones can be used to modulate the inflammatory response accompanying AAA formation. Studies will test the hypothesis that altering the androgen: estrogen environment can dictate the prevalence of aneurysm formation by altering the aforementioned specific soluble mediator dependent leukocyte trafficking, ultimately driving the balance of matrix degradation and repair toward aneurysm formation.           ",Gender Differences in Experimental Aortic

"Trichomonas vaginalis: Molecular Analysis of Adherence DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Trichomonas vaginalis is a sexually transmitted protist causing serious health consequences for women. Trichomonosis is a co-factor in HIV transmission and contributes to preterm labor, cervical cancer and atypical pelvic inflammatory disease. Incidence and prevalence rates of this disease are especially high among minorities, contributing to health disparities. Despite this public health impact, fundamental aspects of trichomonad cell and molecular biology are unknown. Our long-term goal is to understand the molecular basis of adherence of trichomonads to vaginal epithelial cells. The rationale is that molecular dissection of this fundamental process of virulence will provide for effective means of control of this infectious disease. The objective of this work is to perform genetic analysis of T. vaginalis adherence mediated by the surface protein AP65, a protein with sequence identity to decarboxylating malic enzyme of the metabolic hydrogenosome organelle. The functional diversity and differential compartmentalization of a metabolic enzyme to mediate adherence is a unique adaptation by this parasite to colonizing the urogenital tract. The hypothesis is that contact with host cells and iron initiate a signal transduction cascade leading to phosphorylation and subsequent mobilization and surface placement of AP65, which allows for interaction of AP65 with a specific protein receptor on the host cell. Further, there is a quantitative relationship between the amount of AP65 on the parasite and the amount of available receptors on host cells that determines the level of adherence.

"Sickle Cell Disease Research Center (SCDRC) Summer Institute/Mentoring Program    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):      The mission of the Sickle Cell Disease Research Center (SCDRC) is to ""actively and aggressively participate in the substantive development of basic research and training efforts to improve treatment options or cure sickle cell disease"". The SIPID funding initiative is relevant to the mission of the SCDRC project because it will utilize a multidisciplinary approach to increase underrepresented minorities in Biomedical Research related to heart, lung, and blood disease. The program will fund summer institutes to enable 10-12 participants from underrepresented racial and ethnic groups to further develop their research skills and knowledge, thereby enhancing their career development as faculty members or scientists. The summer institute will focus on genomic-based biomedical research related to sickle cell disease (SCD): to introduce multidisciplinary approaches to genomic research and establish a broad base working knowledge of current technological advances and identify potential areas of future research projects involving modern DMA and protein analytical tools. This will be accomplished through classroom didactic lectures and hands-on bench training in laboratory settings. Our goals will include: increasing the number of racial and ethical underserved individuals who enter research careers by establishing a structured mentored training program and long-term research collaborations between mentors and mentees; increasing grantsmanship skills of participants; and identifying extramural research funding opportunities. Diversity of scientific and scholarly activity will be valuable in improving the public health of patients and subjects from diverse backgrounds. Studies have suggested that a racially concordant scientific staff is more successful in recruiting individuals from minority groups into clinical studies. Racially similar physician-patient dyads have been shown to be related to greater patient satisfaction in ways that may also enhance communication and participation in a clinical research setting. The need for a diverse workforce permeates all aspects of the nation's public health-related research efforts.

Recent studies indicate innate cellular restriction factors are key to limiting such infections, and that lentiviral adaptation to a new host requires alterations in accessory gene structure, i.e., viral infectivity factor (Vif). To study this issue, we developed a feline model of cross-species lentiviral transmission that results in productive, yet regressive, avirulent infection, and have determined that such infection attenuates subsequent virulent feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) challenge. Data published during the initial grant cycle demonstrate that innate cellular responses, namely cytokine expression profiles and cytidine deaminase-like (CD) activity resulting in high viral error burden, are more significant for host viral control than adaptive immune responses-which follow rather than precede viral down regulation. Moreover, virulent FIV-C-PG disease attenuation (i.e. protection from CD4+ T cell depletion and modulation of viral set point) in cats infected with avirulent puma lentivirus (PLV-1695), is associated with unique FIV molecular evolution, and maintenance of a proinflammatory cytokine profile vs. cats infected with virulent FIV-C-PG alone-and disease modulation occurs despite disparities in receptor use and target cell distribution between FIV and PLV. Here we propose to advance this unique feline model to address important questions in lentivirus biology: (a) How does host innate activity (defined by CD-like hypermutation and cytokine cell-signaling) relate to attenuation of disease? and (b) What role does Vif play in modulating virulent lentiviral challenge? To answer these questions, we propose: (1) To determine whether previous PLV-1695 infection enhances hypermutation, error burden, and tissue-specific cytidine deaminase activity/cytokine expression after FIV-C-PG challenge; and, (2) To determine whether Vif modulates CD activity and cytokine activation as a mechanism of attenuation. These experiments pose a new paradigm for assessment of protective immunity against HIV/AIDS-namely, that enhancement of early innate immune parameters by exposure to an avirulent, non-adapted lentivirus can provide cross-protective activity against a virulent, host-adapted lentivirus, and as such, these studies are of great public health significance.           ",Mechanisms of Feline Lentivirus Control and Interference,7230844,R01HL092791,"['base ', ' Grant ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Man (Taxonomy) ', ' Site ', ' Subfamily lentivirinae ', ' Virus-Lenti ', ' Lentivirus ', ' Lentivirinae ', ' Feline Lentiviruses ', ' Immune system ', ' allergic/immunologic organ system ', ' allergic/immunologic body system ', ' Immunity ', ' Natural Immunity ', ' Non-Specific Immunity ', ' Native Immunity ', ' Innate Immunity ', ' Immunologic Deficiency Syndromes ', ' immunodeficiency ', ' immune deficiency disorder ', ' hypoimmunity ', ' Immunological Deficiency Syndromes ', ' Immunodeficiency Syndrome ', ' Immunodeficiency Disorder ', ' In Vitro ', ' Infection ', ' African ', ' Macaca ', ' Macaque ', ' Maintenance ', ' Monkeys ', ' Published Comment ', ' Viewpoint ', ' Editorial Comment ', ' Commentary ', ' Comment ', ' Molecular Evolution ', ' progesterone 11-hemisuccinate-(2-iodohistamine) ', ' his-PG ', ' therapeutic vaccine ', ' Immune response ', ' immunoresponse ', ' host response ', ' Genetic ', ' Play ', ' Family Felidae ', ' feline ', ' Felids ', ' Felidae ', ' Exposure to ', ' Attenuated ', ' Inflammatory ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' Publishing ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Role playing therapy ', ' role playing (psychodrama) ', ' Role Playing ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' programs ', ' Viral Load result ', ' Viral Load ', ' Viral Burden ', ' CD4 Positive T Lymphocytes ', ' helper T cell ', ' T4 Lymphocytes ', ' T4 Cells ', ' CD4-Positive Lymphocytes ', ' CD4+ T-Lymphocyte ', ' CD4+ T cell ', ' CD4 lymphocyte ', ' CD4 T cells ', ' CD4 Cells ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Virulence ', ' Virus Diseases ', ' virus-induced disease ', ' virus infection ', ' viral infection ', ' Viral Diseases ', ' Virus Replication ', ' virus multiplication ', ' Virus ', ' General Viruses ', ' Immune ', ' System ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' Viral ', ' Biology ', ' receptor ', ' Receptor Protein ', ' Animal Model ', ' model organism ', ' Animal Models and Related Studies ', ' attenuation ', ' virus host interaction ', ' T-Cell Depletion ', ' research study ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' AIDS/HIV problem ', ' HIV/AIDS problem ', ' HIV/AIDS ', ' AIDS/HIV ', ' Felis catus ', ' Felis sylvestris catus ', ' Felis domesticus ', ' Felis domestica ', ' Feline Species ', ' Domestic Cats ', ' Cats Mammals ', ' Cats ', ' Cells ', ' Asians ', ' oriental ', ' cytokine ', ' Feline Immunodeficiency Virus ', ' Feline T-Lymphotropic Virus ', ' Feline T-Lymphotropic Lentivirus ', ' FTLV ', ' FIV ', ' Lentivirus Infections ', ' Lentivirus disease ', ' Relative (related person) ', ' Relative ', ' Infection Control ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Puma Lentivirus ', ' novel therapeutics ', ' next generation therapeutics ', ' new therapeutics ', ' Cytidine Deaminase ', ' Cytidine Aminohydrolase ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Down-Regulation ', ' Downregulation ', ' Down-Regulation (Physiology) ', ' Elements ', ' Address ', ' Cytokine Activation ', ' Data ', ' Indigenous ', ' Molecular Profiling ', ' molecular signature ', ' molecuar profile ', ' Molecular Fingerprinting ', ' Expression Signature ', ' Expression Profiling ', ' in vivo ', ' Gene Structure ', ' Gene Structure/Organization ', ' Gene Organization ', ' Virulent ', ' transmission process ', ' Transmission ', ' trend ', ' Family ', ' Genome ', ' Age ', ' ']",NHLBI,COLORADO STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2007,373750,0.0714572180334774
"Pancreatic endocrine development and regeneration    DESCRIPTION, OVERALL (provided by applicant):   Islet cell transplantation represents a logical approach to a curative treatment for type 1 diabetes mellitus. However, even if the obstacles associated with transplantation, such as immunosuppression, are overcome in the future, the supply of islets remains a major problem. Clearly, novel strategies are critically needed to provide sufficient islet material for all potential patients. Embryonic stem cells (ES) offer a promising source for in vitro generation of beta cells, but before this will become reality, several challenges should be surmounted. One major issue is the limited knowledge of the developmental processes that govern patterning, growth, and differentiation in the developing embryo. The central theme of this Program is to investigate the biology of pancreatic progenitor cells. We will generate novel mouse strains and use these to investigate how pancreatic progenitor cells (PPC) are specified and how the formation of endocrine progenitor cells (EPC) is regulated? Additionally, we will investigate the mesenchymal signals that control the proliferation and endocrine lineage commitment of the PPC as well as the signals that direct the proliferation and differentiation of the EPC. We will investigate the mechanisms by which Ngn3 induce generic endocrine- and endocrine subtype-specific differentiation events as well as the mechanisms by which genes such as Nkx6.1, Arx, and Pax4 regulate endocrine subtype specification. Lastly, we will test whether the mechanisms used in the embryo for regulation of endocrine development are also utilized for beta cell formation in adults after partial pancreatic duct ligation, or whether beta cells under these circumstances are formed purely by replication of pre-existing beta cells. To accomplish our objectives we are building on previously established collaborations between the different investigators and we are expanding these to include the generation of novel tools that will be shared across project boundaries, with other BCBC investigators, and with the community at large. In particular, in this proposal we will generate several novel mouse lines and use these to investigate the cellular and molecular mechanisms that regulate beta cell development.

"Trichomonas vaginalis: Molecular Analysis of Adherence DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Trichomonas vaginalis is a sexually transmitted protist causing serious health consequences for women. Trichomonosis is a co-factor in HIV transmission and contributes to preterm labor, cervical cancer and atypical pelvic inflammatory disease. Incidence and prevalence rates of this disease are especially high among minorities, contributing to health disparities. Despite this public health impact, fundamental aspects of trichomonad cell and molecular biology are unknown. Our long-term goal is to understand the molecular basis of adherence of trichomonads to vaginal epithelial cells. The rationale is that molecular dissection of this fundamental process of virulence will provide for effective means of control of this infectious disease. The objective of this work is to perform genetic analysis of T. vaginalis adherence mediated by the surface protein AP65, a protein with sequence identity to decarboxylating malic enzyme of the metabolic hydrogenosome organelle. The functional diversity and differential compartmentalization of a metabolic enzyme to mediate adherence is a unique adaptation by this parasite to colonizing the urogenital tract. The hypothesis is that contact with host cells and iron initiate a signal transduction cascade leading to phosphorylation and subsequent mobilization and surface placement of AP65, which allows for interaction of AP65 with a specific protein receptor on the host cell. Further, there is a quantitative relationship between the amount of AP65 on the parasite and the amount of available receptors on host cells that determines the level of adherence. To test the hypothesis, three specific aims are proposed: Aim 1 will silence and modulate expression of the AP65 adhesin through antisense RNA to provide genetic evidence for a role of AP65 in adherence. Aim 2 will express an epitope-tagged AP65 to study compartmentalization and surface targeting in response to iron levels. Aim 3 will characterize the role of phosphorylation of AP65 as a signal for surface placement. The aims will utilize episomally-expressed constructs of mutated phosphorylation sites and/or constructs with mutated regions within AP65 essential for surface targeting. The use of antisense RNA inhibition, the demonstration of signaling from host to parasite for protein surface targeting, and establishment of a stable transfection system for heterologous expression in trichomonads represent innovative aspects of research for studying the biology of Trichomonas organisms.

"Transgenerational Microchimerism in Pregnancy Loss    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Microchimerism (Mc) refers to harboring a small number of cells or DNA from a genetically distinct individual. During pregnancy Mc is naturally acquired in the exchange of cells between a mother and conceptus. In prior studies we found that a mother's cells persist in her progeny into adult life. During pregnancy a woman who is already host to Mc from her mother acquires an additional source of Mc as cells and cell-free DNA from the conceptus enter her circulation. These observations raise the question of whether HLA-relationships across generations influence the outcome of pregnancy in women and, as genetic diversity is generally thought to be good, whether excessive HLA-sharing across generations contributes to recurrent idiopathic pregnancy loss (RPL). HLA molecules are central to immune responses, to distinguishing self from ""other"" and extensive polymorphism is the hallmark feature of HLA genes. Due to the polymorphism in HLA genes most of the time there are numerous differences in HLA alleles among family members. However, occasionally an increase of HLA-sharing is observed in families, either due to HLA-homozygosity or heterozygous HLA-identity. Previous studies have suggested that excessive HLA-sharing of a woman and her partner is associated with idiopathic RPL, although studies have been conflicting. The first Specific Aim of this R21 proposal will test the hypothesis that HLA-relationships over three generations have less HLA-disparity (increased sharing) when women probands have primary idiopathic RPL compared to probands with a live birth and no history of miscarriage. HLA-genotyping will be conducted for DRB1, DRB3, DRB4, DRB5, DQA1, DQB1, A, B and C for women with primary idiopathic RPL, their mothers, conceptus, and partners. Specific Aim 2 will identify and quantify Mc from the proband's mother (MP-Mc) in consecutive blood samples from before, during and after pregnancy for probands with primary idiopathic RPL with a subsequent miscarriage or with a live birth and healthy women with no history of miscarriage. For this purpose a panel of HLA-specific and other genetic polymorphism specific quantitative PCR assays has been developed and will be employed to tested peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Specific Aim 3 will quantify Mc from the conceptus of the proband (CP-Mc) in the same peripheral blood samples using the same methods as in Aim 2 to test peripheral blood mononuclear cells as well as serum. In addition to the hypothesis of Aim 1, a second hypothesis will be tested in Aims 2 and 3, that dynamic changes in Mc, either MP-Mc or CP-Mc or both, is associated with idiopathic RPL. The consequences and long-term effects of harboring Mc from multiple sources are largely unknown as naturally acquired Mc from pregnancy has only recently been recognized. To our knowledge there are no prior studies investigating HLA-sharing or Mc across generations in idiopathic RPL. Harboring a small number of cells (or DNA) that originated from a genetically distinct individual is referred to as microchimerism (Mc). The finding that women harbor Mc from their own mothers and later acquire Mc from their own pregnancy(ies) raises questions about whether interactions between cell populations across generations sometimes influences pregnancy success. Because they help distinguish one cell from another particular genes, called HLA genes, are of special interest to investigate.          ",Transgenerational Microchimerism in Pregnancy Loss,7306029,R21AI072547,"['HLA-DRB1 ', ' HLA-DRB1 antigen ', ' DNA ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' Purpose ', ' Microchimerism ', ' Conceptus ', ' Other Genetics ', ' Family ', ' Fetus ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Future ', ' Genes ', ' Genotype ', ' Blood specimen ', ' Blood Sample ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' HLA Antigens ', ' Leukocyte Antigens ', ' Human Leukocyte Antigens ', ' HL-A Antigens ', ' Family Study ', ' Alleles ', ' Allelomorphs ', ' peripheral blood ', ' Serum ', ' Blood Serum ', ' Individual ', ' Long-Term Effects ', ' Longterm Effects ', ' Methods ', ' Mothers ', ' Terminology ', ' Immune response ', ' immunoresponse ', ' host response ', ' Polymerase Chain Reaction ', ' Genetic Polymorphism ', ' polymorphism ', ' Polymorphism (Genetics) ', ' Pregnancy ', ' Gestation ', ' Pregnancy Outcome ', ' Recurrence ', ' Recurrent ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Testing ', ' Thinking, function ', ' thoughts ', ' Thinking ', ' Time ', ' Variation (Genetics) ', ' allelic variant ', ' Genetic Variation ', ' Genetic Diversity ', ' Gene variant ', ' Woman ', ' Immune ', ' Source ', ' Live Birth ', ' interest ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Blood Circulation ', ' Circulation ', ' Bloodstream ', ' success ', ' human leukocyte antigen gene ', ' HLA gene ', ' Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell ', ' PBMC ', ' trafficking ', ' Pregnancy loss ', ' proband ', ' Abbreviations ', ' Cell Count ', ' Cell Number ', ' Cells ', ' Spontaneous abortion ', ' Miscarriage ', ' Generations ', ' Family member ', ' Population ', ' Conflict (Psychology) ', ' Conflict ', ' ']",NIAID,FRED HUTCHINSON CANCER RESEARCH CENTER,R21,2007,231695,0.06535460218618551
"Hematopoietic Stem Cell Donor Enrollment and Retention in Korean Americans    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) transplantation is a potentially curative therapeutic option increasingly used for a variety of hematologic malignancies and disorders. HSC transplant into a recipient patient first requires the identification of a suitable human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-matched donor, and harvest of bone marrow or peripheral stem cells once a donor is identified. In the United States, the National Marrow Donor Program (NMDP) maintains a registry of potential volunteer donors who have undergone preliminary HLA-typing. Compared to Whites, Asian/Pacific Islander American (API) patients who search the NMDP registry have a lower likelihood of successfully receiving an unrelated, HLA-matched hematopoietic stem cell transplant. This disparity is attributable to at least two issues. First, there are fewer potentially matched donors available to API patients, possibly because of high HLA polymorphism within API populations. While 87% of White patients searching the NMDP registry found at least one potential matching donor, only 75% of API patients were able to find a potential match.6 Second, volunteer donors among API groups have a high rate of attrition from the registry. More than half (56%) of API potential donors preliminarily matched to patients did not complete the full medical and laboratory testing needed to complete HSC harvest and donation.6 We propose to obtain qualitative data from one API community (Korean Americans) regarding participation in the NMDP registry. We intend to identify factors that influence both the initial decision to enroll in the donor registry, as well as the continued participation in the registry over time. To address these two topics, we will conduct 40 baseline in-depth, semi-structured qualitative interviews among Korean adults 18-60 years of age following community NMDP registry enrollment drives; half of these interviews will be conducted among participants who choose to enroll in the registry, while the other half will be conducted among participants who decline to enroll. Follow-up qualitative interviews will be conducted one year after baseline interviews among the half of the participants that enroll in the NMDP registry. Interview topics will include discussion about cultural beliefs, knowledge, and attitudes that may influence participation in the NMDP registry. We believe this R03 Small Grant proposal offers the opportunity to identify and explore the factors associated with enrollment and retention of potential API hematopoietic stem cell donors in a national registry program. These qualitative data will be used to identify targets for an educational program to address the specific concerns in Asian/Pacific Islander communities regarding hematopoietic stem cell donation, and to increase retention among potential donors. Ultimately, we hope to increase the likelihood of identifying HLA-matched donors and successfully completing hematopoietic stem cell transplant among Asian/Pacific Islander patients. to Public Health: We believe this small grant proposal offers the opportunity to inductively identify and explore the factors associated with enrollment and retention of potential Asian/Pacific Islander hematopoietic stem cell donors in a national registry program.

"Sickle Cell Disease Research Center (SCDRC) Summer Institute/Mentoring Program    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):      The mission of the Sickle Cell Disease Research Center (SCDRC) is to ""actively and aggressively participate in the substantive development of basic research and training efforts to improve treatment options or cure sickle cell disease"". The SIPID funding initiative is relevant to the mission of the SCDRC project because it will utilize a multidisciplinary approach to increase underrepresented minorities in Biomedical Research related to heart, lung, and blood disease. The program will fund summer institutes to enable 10-12 participants from underrepresented racial and ethnic groups to further develop their research skills and knowledge, thereby enhancing their career development as faculty members or scientists. The summer institute will focus on genomic-based biomedical research related to sickle cell disease (SCD): to introduce multidisciplinary approaches to genomic research and establish a broad base working knowledge of current technological advances and identify potential areas of future research projects involving modern DMA and protein analytical tools. This will be accomplished through classroom didactic lectures and hands-on bench training in laboratory settings. Our goals will include: increasing the number of racial and ethical underserved individuals who enter research careers by establishing a structured mentored training program and long-term research collaborations between mentors and mentees; increasing grantsmanship skills of participants; and identifying extramural research funding opportunities. Diversity of scientific and scholarly activity will be valuable in improving the public health of patients and subjects from diverse backgrounds. Studies have suggested that a racially concordant scientific staff is more successful in recruiting individuals from minority groups into clinical studies. Racially similar physician-patient dyads have been shown to be related to greater patient satisfaction in ways that may also enhance communication and participation in a clinical research setting. The need for a diverse workforce permeates all aspects of the nation's public health-related research efforts. Because minorities suffer a disproportionate burden of morbidity and mortality associated with HLBS disorders, there is a critical need to increase the number of investigators conducting research on health disparities in HLBS disorders, such as sickle cell disease.      (End of Abstract)           ",Sickle Cell Disease Research Center (SCDRC) Summer Institute/Mentoring Program,7467987,R25HL085070,"['Individual ', ' Numbers ', ' Lung ', ' pulmonary ', ' Lung Respiratory System ', ' Fostering ', ' Funding ', ' Americas ', ' American Indians ', ' American Indian ', ' Mentors ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' Mission ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Mortality ', ' Collaborations ', ' Sickle Cell Anemia ', ' sicklemia ', ' sickle disease ', ' sickle cell disease ', ' Hemoglobin sickle cell disorder ', ' Hemoglobin sickle cell disease ', ' Hemoglobin S Disease ', ' HbSS disease ', ' Hb SS disease ', ' Client satisfaction ', ' Patient Satisfaction ', ' Patients ', ' physical science ', ' Physicians ', ' Proteins ', ' gene product ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' Public Sector ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' recruit ', ' Research ', ' Research Institute ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Schools ', ' Science ', ' Scientific Societies ', ' Research Priority ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' lectures ', ' programs ', ' Stress ', ' Students ', ' Texas ', ' Scientist ', ' Training Programs ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Writing ', ' Award ', ' Behavioral Sciences ', ' Severity of illness ', ' disease severity ', ' interest ', ' Visit ', ' Biology ', ' Biomedical Research ', ' Gray unit of radiation dose ', ' Gray ', ' college ', ' collegiate ', ' Black race ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' success ', ' Structure ', ' skills ', ' Participant ', ' member ', ' Basic Science ', ' Basic Research ', ' Reporting ', ' Cell membrane ', ' plasmalemma ', ' Plasma Membrane ', ' Cytoplasmic Membrane ', ' Chemistry ', ' Sleep Disorders ', ' sleep problem ', ' abstracting ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Hispanics ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Proteomics ', ' Genomics ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Communication ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' analytical tool ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' racial/ethnic ', ' interdisciplinary approach ', ' multidisciplinary approach ', ' Educational Curriculum ', ' Curriculum ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Continuing Education ', ' Continuance of education ', ' Environment ', ' Address ', ' Equilibrium ', ' balance function ', ' balance ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Doctor of Philosophy ', ' PhD ', ' Ph.D. ', ' Research Training ', ' Extramural Activities ', ' Extramural ', ' EXTMR ', ' Funding Opportunities ', ' Underrepresented Minority ', ' underserved minority ', ' under-represented minority ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Faculty ', ' Fellowship ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Gene Expression Regulation ', ' Gene Regulation Process ', ' Gene Regulation ', ' Gene Action Regulation ', ' Genome ', ' Human Genome ', ' human whole genome ', ' Globin ', ' p-Globin ', ' base ', ' career ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' improved ', ' Hand ', ' Heart ', ' Hematological Disease ', ' blood disorder ', ' Hematological Disorder ', ' Hematologic Diseases ', ' Blood Diseases ', ' Area ', ' Surface ', ' Institutes ', ' Ensure ', ' Training ', ' Sickle Cell ', ' sickle red blood cell ', ' sickle erythrocyte ', ' sickle RBC ', ' drepanocyte ', ' teacher ', ' Joints ', ' Articulation ', ' Laboratories ', ' ']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS DALLAS,R25,2008,280800,0.05533122027248915
"Arts, Research, T-cells & Socio-demographics (ARTS) in the Niagara Region    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The disproportionately lower number of minority and low income individuals participating in clinical and prevention research has a significant impact on the representativeness of scientific outcomes and result in social and clinical injustices. Roswell Park Cancer Institute (RPCI) and Niagara Falls community members are creating power-neutral collaborations to meet the needs of vulnerable communities in order to reduce cancer disparities and improve cancer research. The proposed ""ARTS"" (Arts, Research, T-cells & Sociodemographics) study creates a collaborative opportunity linking a diverse, relatively low income population with an NCI Comprehensive Cancer Center to test the feasibility of studying the relationship among various contributing factors (e.g., socio-demographics, including poverty and race/ethnicity) to health disparities (e.g., immune function, risks for cancer). The goal of this study is to investigate strategies to engage residents in the Niagara Falls region with scientists at RPCI to increase mutual understanding of each other and participation in cancer prevention research, and to obtain pilot data on variations in Treg cell levels. The following Specific Aims are proposed to achieve this goal: Aim 1. Investigate the feasibility of educating and recruiting Niagara Falls residents to cancer prevention studies through creative community-based methods and interventions within the Niagara Arts & Cultural Center (NACC) as measured through attendance, surveys and study participation. Aim 2. Investigate the technical feasibility of epidemiological survey collection, biological specimen collection, and performing regulatory T Cell assays through community-based interventional methods. Aim 3. Develop a meaningful and appropriate framework and best methods for sharing findings from social and biological data among all academic and community partners and participants. Through educational recruitment programs based at the NACC, demographics, affective measures (e.g., the feeling people associate with the idea of research), and intent to participate, will be collected using a community-friendly audience response system (ARS). Individuals may choose to participate at various levels, and those selecting to donate blood will allow us to obtain pilot data about how certain lifestyle (e.g., smoking, exercise, diet) and demographic factors (e.g., income, neighborhood, race/ethnicity) are related to important aspects of the immune system in healthy residents as measured by Treg cells (cells that can prevent the immune system from protecting the body). It is expected that process and outcome results from this feasibility study will provide pilot data for research questions related to: 1) the role of affectively-based decision making factors on research participation; 2) heterogeneity of immunological indicators in relationship to socio-demographic, environmental, and behavioral variables; 3) the effectiveness of linking medical research education and recruitment with a community group focused on the arts; and 4) the technical accommodations necessary for a research institution and community partners to recruit, accrue, and analyze measures related to cancer research.          ","Arts, Research, T-cells & Socio-demographics (ARTS) in the Niagara Region",7555888,R03CA139946,"['Clinical ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Biological ', ' Link ', ' Immune system ', ' allergic/immunologic organ system ', ' allergic/immunologic body system ', ' Income ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Life Style ', ' Lifestyle ', ' Individual ', ' Numbers ', ' Low Income Population ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Methods ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Mission ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Educational Intervention ', ' instructional intervention ', ' Training Intervention ', ' Instruction Intervention ', ' Education for Intervention ', ' cancer prevention ', ' Collaborations ', ' Play ', ' Poverty ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' recruit ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Science ', ' Smoking ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Arts ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' T-Lymphocyte ', ' thymus derived lymphocyte ', ' Thymus-Dependent Lymphocytes ', ' T-Cells ', ' Testing ', ' Scientist ', ' Universities ', ' Attitude ', ' Work ', ' Awareness ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' Behavior ', ' Belief ', ' Benchmarking ', ' Best Practice Analysis ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' cancer risk ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Prevention Research ', ' Prevention strategy ', ' Preventive strategy ', ' member ', ' research study ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' Basic Science ', ' Basic Research ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' Cells ', ' Measures ', ' Medical Research ', ' falls ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' diverse populations ', ' Research Methodology ', ' Research Methods ', ' response ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Communities ', ' forging ', ' anticancer research ', ' cancer research ', ' Minority ', ' diet and exercise ', ' Outcome ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' cancer disparity ', ' Affective ', ' demographics ', ' community based participatory research ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Address ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Data ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Cancer Center ', ' Collection ', ' Comprehensive Cancer Center ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Roswell Park Cancer Institute ', ' Translational Research ', ' translation research enterprise ', ' translation research ', ' Translational Science ', ' Translational Research Enterprise ', ' Process ', ' Feeling ', ' feelings ', ' Behavioral ', ' Feasibility Studies ', ' Focus Groups ', ' base ', ' Goals ', ' improved ', ' Health ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' sample collection ', ' specimen collection ', ' Decision Making ', ' Demographic Factors ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Commit ', ' immune function ', ' Cellular Immune Function ', ' Institution ', ' Action Research ', ' Effectiveness ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Low income ', ' ']",NCI,ROSWELL PARK CANCER INSTITUTE CORP,R03,2008,75156,0.027492286018370733
"Mechanisms of Feline Lentivirus Control and Interference    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Though transmission of indigenous African monkey lentiviruses to humans or to Asian macaques has resulted pathogenic consequences for the new host, it is becoming increasingly clear that pathogenic cross- species lentiviral infection is an exceptional occurrence. Recent studies indicate innate cellular restriction factors are key to limiting such infections, and that lentiviral adaptation to a new host requires alterations in accessory gene structure, i.e., viral infectivity factor (Vif). To study this issue, we developed a feline model of cross-species lentiviral transmission that results in productive, yet regressive, avirulent infection, and have determined that such infection attenuates subsequent virulent feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) challenge. Data published during the initial grant cycle demonstrate that innate cellular responses, namely cytokine expression profiles and cytidine deaminase-like (CD) activity resulting in high viral error burden, are more significant for host viral control than adaptive immune responses-which follow rather than precede viral down regulation. Moreover, virulent FIV-C-PG disease attenuation (i.e. protection from CD4+ T cell depletion and modulation of viral set point) in cats infected with avirulent puma lentivirus (PLV-1695), is associated with unique FIV molecular evolution, and maintenance of a proinflammatory cytokine profile vs. cats infected with virulent FIV-C-PG alone-and disease modulation occurs despite disparities in receptor use and target cell distribution between FIV and PLV. Here we propose to advance this unique feline model to address important questions in lentivirus biology: (a) How does host innate activity (defined by CD-like hypermutation and cytokine cell-signaling) relate to attenuation of disease? and (b) What role does Vif play in modulating virulent lentiviral challenge? To answer these questions, we propose: (1) To determine whether previous PLV-1695 infection enhances hypermutation, error burden, and tissue-specific cytidine deaminase activity/cytokine expression after FIV-C-PG challenge; and, (2) To determine whether Vif modulates CD activity and cytokine activation as a mechanism of attenuation. These experiments pose a new paradigm for assessment of protective immunity against HIV/AIDS-namely, that enhancement of early innate immune parameters by exposure to an avirulent, non-adapted lentivirus can provide cross-protective activity against a virulent, host-adapted lentivirus, and as such, these studies are of great public health significance.           ",Mechanisms of Feline Lentivirus Control and Interference,7503962,R01HL092791,"['Cytidine Deaminase ', ' Cytidine Aminohydrolase ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Down-Regulation ', ' Downregulation ', ' Down-Regulation (Physiology) ', ' Elements ', ' Address ', ' Cytokine Activation ', ' Data ', ' Indigenous ', ' Molecular Profiling ', ' molecular signature ', ' molecuar profile ', ' Molecular Fingerprinting ', ' Expression Signature ', ' Expression Profiling ', ' in vivo ', ' Gene Structure ', ' Gene Structure/Organization ', ' Gene Organization ', ' Virulent ', ' transmission process ', ' Transmission ', ' trend ', ' Family ', ' Genome ', ' Age ', ' base ', ' Grant ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Man (Taxonomy) ', ' Site ', ' Subfamily lentivirinae ', ' Virus-Lenti ', ' Lentivirus ', ' Lentivirinae ', ' Feline Lentiviruses ', ' Immune system ', ' allergic/immunologic organ system ', ' allergic/immunologic body system ', ' Immunity ', ' Natural Immunity ', ' Non-Specific Immunity ', ' Native Immunity ', ' Innate Immunity ', ' Immunologic Deficiency Syndromes ', ' immunodeficiency ', ' immune deficiency disorder ', ' hypoimmunity ', ' Immunological Deficiency Syndromes ', ' Immunodeficiency Syndrome ', ' Immunodeficiency Disorder ', ' In Vitro ', ' Infection ', ' African ', ' Macaca ', ' Macaque ', ' Maintenance ', ' Monkeys ', ' Published Comment ', ' Viewpoint ', ' Editorial Comment ', ' Commentary ', ' Comment ', ' Molecular Evolution ', ' progesterone 11-hemisuccinate-(2-iodohistamine) ', ' his-PG ', ' therapeutic vaccine ', ' Immune response ', ' immunoresponse ', ' host response ', ' Genetic ', ' Play ', ' Family Felidae ', ' feline ', ' Felids ', ' Felidae ', ' Exposure to ', ' Attenuated ', ' Inflammatory ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' Publishing ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Role playing therapy ', ' role playing (psychodrama) ', ' Role Playing ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' programs ', ' Viral Load result ', ' Viral Load ', ' Viral Burden ', ' CD4 Positive T Lymphocytes ', ' helper T cell ', ' T4 Lymphocytes ', ' T4 Cells ', ' CD4-Positive Lymphocytes ', ' CD4+ T-Lymphocyte ', ' CD4+ T cell ', ' CD4 lymphocyte ', ' CD4 T cells ', ' CD4 Cells ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Virulence ', ' Virus Diseases ', ' virus-induced disease ', ' virus infection ', ' viral infection ', ' Viral Diseases ', ' Virus Replication ', ' virus multiplication ', ' Virus ', ' General Viruses ', ' Immune ', ' System ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' Viral ', ' Biology ', ' receptor ', ' Receptor Protein ', ' Animal Model ', ' model organism ', ' Animal Models and Related Studies ', ' attenuation ', ' virus host interaction ', ' T-Cell Depletion ', ' research study ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' AIDS/HIV problem ', ' HIV/AIDS problem ', ' HIV/AIDS ', ' AIDS/HIV ', ' Felis catus ', ' Felis sylvestris catus ', ' Felis domesticus ', ' Felis domestica ', ' Feline Species ', ' Domestic Cats ', ' Cats Mammals ', ' Cats ', ' Cells ', ' Asians ', ' oriental ', ' cytokine ', ' Feline Immunodeficiency Virus ', ' Feline T-Lymphotropic Virus ', ' Feline T-Lymphotropic Lentivirus ', ' FTLV ', ' FIV ', ' Lentivirus Infections ', ' Lentivirus disease ', ' Relative (related person) ', ' Relative ', ' Infection Control ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Puma Lentivirus ', ' novel therapeutics ', ' next generation therapeutics ', ' new therapeutics ', ' ']",NHLBI,COLORADO STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2008,367500,0.0714572180334774
"Microbicide properties of RT inhibitor combinations    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Topical microbicides are an important strategy to minimize heterosexual transmission of HIV. Several single agent microbicides are in clinical trials, including one based on the nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) UC781 that we discovered as a potential microbicidal agent. However, combination microbicides may be preferable, yet only a single combination microbicide is currently under evaluation. There is also an urgent need to identify new pipeline microbicidal agents. We have found that the nucleoside RT inhibitor (NRTI) 4'-ethynyl-2-fluoro-deoxyadenosine (4'E-2FdA) provides a potent and prolonged barrier to HIV- 1 infection of cells in the subsequent absence of exogenous drug, a property previously only noted for NNRTI such as UC781. The ""memory effect"" barrier is imparted by 4'E-2FdA at drug levels orders of magnitude less than those needed for protection by the nucleotide tenofovir, currently in clinical assessment for microbicide use. We hypothesize that microbicides comprising combinations of different classes of highly potent RT inhibitors, namely the NNRTI UC781 and an NRTI such as 4'E-2FdA, will provide an optimal barrier to HIV-1 transmission. We therefore propose these Specific Aims for this R21/R33 phased innovation application: R21 Aim 1. To evaluate the in vitro (cell-based) microbicidal properties of NRTI and UC781 alone and in combination. These studies include assessment of antiviral activity and ""memory effect"" protection imparted by NRTIs and UC781 alone and in combination using primary cells (PBMCs, CD4+ T-cells, macrophages) and different HIV drug-sensitive and drug-resistant strains, isolates and clades. R21 Aim 2. To elucidate the mechanism of 4'E-2FdA (and analogs) induced protective barrier or ""memory effect"" in HIV susceptible cells. These studies include characterization of uptake, conversion to triphosphate and intracellular stability of the NRTI-TPs, as well as detailed kinetic evaluations of the NRTI substrate activity with enzymes involved in metabolism of the NRTIs. R21 Deliverables: Identification of a lead NRTI and two back-ups for use with UC781 for development as a combination microbicide. R33 Aim 1. To formulate the NRTI/NNRTI combinations selected in the R21 phase into an appropriate delivery system for vaginal topical use. NRTIs and NNRTIs have different chemical properties, thus appropriate delivery systems must be identified to enable incorporation and release of the active agents. We will prepare and evaluate both gel and rapidly dissolving film formulations for the combination microbicide. R33 Aim 2. To evaluate the anti-HIV microbicidal activity of formulated NRTI/NNRTI combinations in an ex vivo cervical explant tissue model. These studies will use a newly developed physiologically relevant polarized cervical tissue model to assess the impact of formulated microbicides alone and in combination on HIV transmission and infectivity. R33 Deliverables: Identification of an appropriate delivery formulation for the selected NRTI/NNRTI combination for entry into subsequent preclinical safety and efficacy studies. This project seeks to develop anti-HIV microbicides based on the non-nucleoside RT inhibitor UC781 in combination with novel 4'-substituted nucleosides, a combination found to provide profound and protracted protection of susceptible cells against HIV infection in vitro. Our studies will provide potent new formulations to the microbicide development pipeline for entry into clinical evaluation.          ",Microbicide properties of RT inhibitor combinations,7533792,R21AI079801,"['Inequality ', ' analog ', ' uptake ', ' chemical property ', ' macrophage ', ' Memory ', ' Metabolism ', ' Metabolic Processes ', ' Intermediary Metabolism ', ' Nucleosides ', ' Nucleotides ', ' inhibitor/antagonist ', ' inhibitor ', ' Poliomyelitis ', ' Polio ', ' Epidemic Acute Poliomyelitis ', ' Acute Poliomyelitis ', ' Antiviral Agents ', ' Antivirals ', ' Antiviral Drugs ', ' Risk ', ' Safety ', ' Smallpox ', ' variola major ', ' small pox ', ' Variola ', ' Tenofovir ', ' 9-PMPA ', ' 9-(2-phosphonylmethoxypropyl)adenine ', ' 9-(2-phosphonomethoxypropyl)adenine ', ' UC 781 ', ' UC781 ', ' CD4 Positive T Lymphocytes ', ' helper T cell ', ' T4 Lymphocytes ', ' T4 Cells ', ' CD4-Positive Lymphocytes ', ' CD4+ T-Lymphocyte ', ' CD4+ T cell ', ' CD4 lymphocyte ', ' CD4 T cells ', ' CD4 Cells ', ' Educational process of instructing ', ' Teaching ', ' Vaccines ', ' Vagina ', ' Vaginal ', ' Virion ', ' Virus Particle ', ' Virus ', ' General Viruses ', ' Woman ', ' System ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' Class ', ' Back ', ' Dorsum ', ' Drug Formulations ', ' Formulation ', ' success ', ' novel ', ' Today ', ' Cells ', ' Gender ', ' Generations ', ' Film ', ' HIV vaccine ', ' human immunodeficiency virus vaccine ', ' HIV/AIDS Vaccines ', ' Mediating ', ' Property ', ' LOINC Axis 2 Property ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' clinical investigation ', ' cost ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' HIV drug resistance ', ' resistant to HIV drug ', ' resistance to antiHIV ', ' resistance to anti-HIV ', ' resistance to HIV drug ', ' HIV drug resistant ', ' AntiHIV resistant ', ' AntiHIV resistance ', ' Anti-HIV resistant ', ' Anti-HIV resistance ', ' Clinical assessments ', ' Drug-sensitive ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' microbicide ', ' microbicidal ', ' Local Microbicides ', ' topical microbicide ', ' Deoxyadenosines ', ' Adenylyldeoxyribonucleosides ', ' Adenine Deoxyribonucleosides ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Drug resistance ', ' resistant to Drug ', ' resistance to Drug ', ' drug resistant ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Economics ', ' non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors ', ' nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors ', ' non-nucleoside RT inhibitors ', ' NNRTI ', ' Enzymes ', ' Equilibrium ', ' balance function ', ' balance ', ' tripolyphosphate ', ' triphosphate ', ' Systemic Therapy ', ' SYS-TX ', ' research clinical testing ', ' clinical test ', ' Clinical Testing ', ' Clinical Evaluation ', ' Sexual Transmission ', ' Tissue Model ', ' transmission process ', ' Transmission ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Heterosexuals ', ' pre-clinical ', ' preclinical ', ' Gel ', ' base ', ' Half-Life ', ' HIV ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV Infections ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' HIV-1 ', ' human T lymphotropic virus III ', ' human T cell leukemia virus III ', ' Human immunodeficiency virus 1 ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Virus Type 1 ', ' HIV1 ', ' HIV-I ', ' Cervical ', ' Phase ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' In Vitro ', ' Infection ', ' Evaluation ', ' Kinetics ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' deoxyadenosine ', ' ']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R21,2008,197946,0.043815408840907046
"Antigen Specific T Cell tolerance by Anti CD3 Antibodies    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Transplantation of hematopoietic stem cells from an allogeneic donor can be followed by serious graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) despite the best available regimen for immune suppression. Experimental animal data and results of clinical trials have demonstrated that T cells play a central role in GVHD. Recent advances in understanding the mechanisms of peripheral T cell tolerance have made it feasible to test the hypothesis that GVHD can be prevented in man by T cell receptor (TCR) partial agonist ligands through the selective depletion of alloreactive T cells. Transplantation tolerance is facilitated by activation-induced cell death (AICD) of peripheral T cells triggered by the specific alloantigens, and TCR signals are indispensable for induction of antigen-specific tolerance. TCR engagement can induce either T cell proliferation and differentiation or AICD. Monoclonal antibodies (mAb) to CD3, a monomorphic chain associated to the TCR complex, mimic antigen and induce TCR signaling and T cell activation. Fc receptor (FcR)-binding anti-CD3 mAbs recruit antigen-presenting cells (APC) and deliver full agonist signals that promote T cell proliferation and effector functions, independent of antigen. In contrast, non-FcR-binding anti-CD3 mAbs induce a partial agonist TCR signaling pattern causing anergy in naive T cells and AICD in antigen-activated, cycling T cells. In mice, we found that non-FcR-binding anti-CD3 mAbs induce selective depletion of donor T cells that recognize recipient alloantigens thereby preventing GVHD across MHC disparities, and spare T cell specific to third party antigens. In collaboration with J. Tso, we designed a `humanized' non-FcR-binding anti-CD3 mAb, visilizumab, which delivers a partial agonist signal to the TCR. Visilizumab is more effective than other anti-CD3 mAbs in inducing AICD of activated, cycling human T cells. Our preliminary results in human trials show that visilizumab can induce complete clinical responses in some patients with severe acute GVHD, refractory to conventional immune suppressive agents. We propose here to study efficacy of visilizumab in the prevention of GVHD after hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) from HLA incompatible donors, and assess whether its immune suppressive effects are selective for alloantigens. We will pursue the following specific aims: Aim 1: Determine the safety and efficacy of humanized non-FcR-binding anti-CD3 mAb visilizumab in preventing severe GVHD after transplantation of T-replete hematopoietic cell grafts from HLA-incompatible donors. Aim 2: Investigate whether visilizumab therapy depletes the alloreactive T cell pool, while sparing immunity to third party alloantigens, cytomegalovirus (CMV) and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), and tumor- associated antigen WT1. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The development of effective regimens for the prevention of GVHD will improve patient safety and survival after transplantation, and extend the use of this procedure to a larger number of patients. Progress in the prevention of GVHD has the potential for advancing the fields of organ transplantation and therapy for autoimmune disorders. Anti-CD3 mAbs represent the prototype of a new class of therapeutic agents that suppress the immune system by inducing an abortive activation and T cell death. What makes anti-CD3 mAbs unique and more attractive than other agents is the potential for achieving immunological tolerance rapidly and irreversibly. Showing that non-FcR-binding anti-CD3 mAbs spare T cells specific for viral and tumor-associated antigens is key to predict patient safety.          ",Antigen Specific T Cell tolerance by Anti CD3 Antibodies,7528907,R01CA132197,"['Cytomegalovirus ', ' human cytomegalovirus ', ' cytomegalovirus group ', ' Salivary Gland Viruses ', ' HCMV ', ' CMV ', ' CD3 Antigens ', ' T3 molecule ', ' T3 Complex ', ' T3 Antigens ', ' OKT3 antigen ', ' CD3 molecule ', ' CD3 Complex ', ' CD3 ', ' patient safety ', ' Visilizumab ', ' Nuvion ', ' T-Cell Proliferation ', ' T-Cell Activation ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Human Herpesvirus 4 ', ' human herpesvirus 4 group ', ' Infectious Mononucleosis Virus ', ' Herpesvirus 4 (gamma), Human ', ' HHV-4 ', ' Epstein-Barr Virus ', ' Epstein Barr Virus ', ' EB virus ', ' E-B Virus ', ' Burkitt Lymphoma Virus ', ' Burkitt Herpesvirus ', ' Doctor of Medicine ', ' M.D. ', ' Receptor Signaling ', ' Allogenic ', ' Principal Investigator ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Graft-vs-Host Disease ', ' Runt Disease ', ' Homologous Wasting Disease ', ' Graft-Versus-Host Disease ', ' GVHD ', ' Grant ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Man (Taxonomy) ', ' Peripheral ', ' Clinical ', ' Refractory ', ' Cell Transplantation ', ' Immune system ', ' allergic/immunologic organ system ', ' allergic/immunologic body system ', ' Immunity ', ' Alloantigen ', ' anergy ', ' Hematopoietic ', ' Ligands ', ' Numbers ', ' Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation ', ' HSC transplantation ', ' Agonist ', ' Mus ', ' Murine ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Mice ', ' Collaborations ', ' Organ Transplantation ', ' organ xenograft ', ' organ graft ', ' organ allograft ', ' Transplantation Surgery ', ' Organ Transplants, Including Bone Marrow for DCT ', ' Organ Transplants ', ' Grafting Procedure ', ' Clinical, Transplantation, Organ ', ' Therapeutic Agents ', ' Patients ', ' Infectious Agent ', ' infectious organism ', ' Play ', ' Monoclonal Antibodies ', ' Clinical Treatment Moab ', ' Antigen-Presenting Cells ', ' accessory cell ', ' Monocytes / Macrophages / APC ', ' Immunologic Accessory Cells ', ' Antigens ', ' immunogen ', ' ATGN ', ' Proteins ', ' gene product ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' T-Cell Receptor ', ' Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell ', ' Major Histocompatibility Complex Receptor ', ' MHC Receptor ', ' Fc Receptor ', ' antibody receptor ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' recruit ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Safety ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' programs ', ' T-Lymphocyte ', ' thymus derived lymphocyte ', ' Thymus-Dependent Lymphocytes ', ' T-Cells ', ' Testing ', ' Transplantation ', ' transplant ', ' Treatment Protocols ', ' Treatment Schedule ', ' Treatment Regimen ', ' Tumor Antigens ', ' tumor-specific antigen ', ' Tumor-Associated Antigen ', ' Autoimmune Diseases ', ' autoimmune disorder ', ' Immune ', ' Complex ', ' Pattern ', ' Class ', ' Viral ', ' receptor binding ', ' animal data ', ' disorder prevention ', ' disease prevention ', ' Prevention ', ' WT1 gene ', ' Wilms tumor suppressor WT1 ', ' Wilms Tumor 1 ', ' WT33 ', ' WT1 ', ' WAGR ', ' Cell Death ', ' necrocytosis ', ' Cells ', ' Muromonab-CD3 ', ' OKT3 ', ' Muromonab-CD3 Monoclonal Antibody ', ' Monoclonal Antibody OKT3 ', ' MoAb OKT3 ', ' Anti-CD3 Monoclonal Antibody OKT3 ', ' Mediating ', ' Acute Graft Versus Host Disease ', ' Acute GVHD ', ' response ', ' Monoclonal Antibody HuM291 ', ' MoAb HuM291 ', ' HuM291 ', ' HUM291 [Anti-CD3 Antibody] ', ' Anti-CD3 Antibody ', ' Transplantation Tolerance ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' clinical investigation ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' man ', "" man's "", ' prototype ', ' ']",NCI,H.

"North Carolina A&T University-Wake Forest Cancer Center partnership (1of 2)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application requests support to evaluate the ability of benzylidenes and their boronic acid derivatives to prevent the incidence of prostate cancer via induction of phase II enzymes. Prostate cancer is the most frequently diagnosed cancer and is a leading cause of death in men in the United States. It is also the single most diagnosed non-skin cancer among African Americans. Our long term goal is to understand the detailed structure-activity relationships for cancer chemopreventive agents in the prostate and on that basis to produce nontoxic, prostate specific cancer chemopreventive agents. In this project we expect to (1) use Benzylidenes and their boronic acid derivatives to determine the structural features necessary to trigger the production of a potent amount of phase II enzymes in prostate cancer cells and (2) define the mode of action by which these Benzylidenes and their derivatives exert their chemopreventive effects using in vitro and in vivo models. Specifically, we propose to: (1) Prepare and characterize benzylidenes and their boronic acid derivatives; (2) Evaluate benzylidenes' ability to induce the phase 2 enzymes in DU145, LNCaP, and PC-3 prostate carcinoma cells and measure the cytotoxicity of these compounds in these cell lines; (3) Assess benzylidenes' ability to induce phase 2 enzymes and prevent prostate cancer in PTEN deleted mouse model. The preparation and characterization of the benzylidenes and their boronic acid derivatives will be completed at North Carolina A & T State University (NCAT) in the department of chemistry while the evaluation of those compounds in vitro and in vivo will be completed at Wake Forest University School of Medicine (WFUBMC). The co-Principal investigator and two (2) graduate students will benefit from training received at WFUBMC. At the end of the grant period, the co-Pi will use the training and information gathered from this project to complete and R01 grant application to further progress toward the pursuit of the completion of the long term objectives.       Summary: This project will evaluate the ability of benzylidenes and their boronic acid derivatives to prevent the incidence of prostate cancer via induction of phase II enzymes. The applicant has proposed to complete this project by completing  the following tasks: (1) by synthesizing benzylidenes and their boronic acid derivatives; (2) by evaluating the compounds' abilities to induce the phase 2 enzymes in DU145, LNCaP, and PC-3 prostate carcinoma cells; and, (3) by assessing the compounds' abilities to induce phase 2 enzymes and prevent prostate cancer in PTEN deleted mouse model.       The preparation and characterization of the benzylidenes and their boronic acid derivatives will be completed at NC A&T, while the evaluation of those compounds in vitro and in vivo will be completed at WFUBMC. The detoxification of compounds in the body is generally considered a three step process, phase I metabolism includes oxidation, reduction, hydration, hydrolysis, generally increasing the chemical reactivity, followed by detoxification during phase II metabolism, which increases water solubility, and promotes excretion in phase III metabolism.       There is considerable research evidence which notes that exposure of animal cells to low levels of electrophilic compounds (such as benzylidenes) results in the elevation and induction of phase 2 enzymes. Independently, other studies have indicated that boron, and boric acid have chemopreventive properties.  The phase II enzymes to be tested include NAD (P) H quinone oxidoreductase (NQO1), GST (total), GST-mu, and GSTP1. Inducers of the phase 2 enzymes all belong to at least nine structurally diverse classes, but they all possess the ability to react with sulfhydryl groups, where reactivity correlates with potency. Other studies have shown that Benzylidenes and flavanoids are potent inducers of the NQO1 enzyme. Information regarding variation in the underlying mechanisms would have strengthened this section of the application.      A series of 4 benzylidene compounds, and their boronic acid derivatives, will be synthesized and tested on cell lines (both androgen-dependent and androgen-independent). Phase II enzymes will be measured using western blot. Similar measurements will be made in prostate-cancer prone mice, when the tumors become palpable. For chemoprevention efficacy, one wonders if waiting until tumors are palpable is the most relevant time point. The integration of the two groups is another strongpoint, with monthly meetings of PIs and NC A&T students attending weekly lab meetings at WFUCCC.      Information on the other boronic acid-benzylidene compounds which have also been shown to have anticancer effects was not adequately addressed in this application. These include the boronic acid-benzylidene compounds highlighted in reviews such as: Achanta G, Modzelewska A, Feng L, Khan SR, Huang P. Mol Pharmacol. 2006 Jul;70(1):426-33. A boronic-chalcone derivative exhibits potent anticancer activity through inhibition of the proteasome. The applicant mentioned that these would be the first. So the proposed innovation might be diminished somewhat, if these prior compounds are actually relevant.      Innovation: The innovation relies primarily on the  testing of relatively novel compounds in an excellent mouse model.       Investigators: Drs. Franks, Torti and Chen are well suited to carry out this investigation, and their roles are clearly defined, and their strengths are complementary. Dr. Franks is a young investigator who performed his postdoctoral work with Dr. Torti. Dr. Chen has directly relevant experience working with the prostate cancer prone mouse model. Drs. Torti and Chen both have significant independent funding.       Environment: The environment is excellent.      PILOT PROJECT 2: Fra-1 expression regulates CD44 and C-MET expression in Glioblastoma Cells.   (PI: Dr. Patrick Martin, NC A&T; Co-PI: Dr. Waldermar Debinski, WFUCCC).      DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most lethal and malignant form of glioma known. Astroglial tumors are classified into four grades by the World Health Organization (WHO): a. pilocytic astrocytomas (Grade I, WHO classification); b. anaplastic astrocytomas (Grade ll-lll); c. glioblastoma (Grade IV). Glioblastomas differ from lower grades of astrocytic neoplasms; by being extremely aggressive, highly neovascularized and proliferative, as well as migratory/infiltrative. To compound the poor prognosis of patients with glioblastoma further, glioblastomas are typically insensitive to radiation therapy and chemotherapy. Although many different therapeutic approaches have been utilized, the overall median survival rate has not increased in the last twenty years. A better understanding of the molecular mechanisms that give rise to the invasive nature of malignant brain tumors is necessary in order to design more effective therapeutic regimens. The transcription factor, fosrelated antigen (Fra-1); glycoprotein CD44 and receptor tyrosine kinase c-Met are over-expressed in well characterized human GBM cell lines and human brain tumor specimens. Expression of Fra-1, CD44 and c-Met have been associated with increased glioblastoma migration. C-Met activation has also been associated with promoting inhibition to apoptosis.       Summary: This application is focused on understanding the regulation of CD44 and c-Met expression by Fra-1 in high grade astrocytoma, especially glioblastomas. The proposed studies will also determine whether Fra-1 regulates invasive cell migration and also resistance to apoptosis induced by radiation via CD44 and c-Met respectively.      Significance: Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most lethal and malignant form of glioma known.  The long-term goals of these studies are to better understand the transcriptional regulation of glioblastoma cell migration as well as define biomarkers for malignant brain tumors. These experiments will answer important questions about glioblastoma biology,  and will with high probability lead to publishable results, and have a similar high probability of serving as the foundation for applications by Dr. Martin for external funding.       Approach: The proposed work will determine whether alterations in Fra- 1 expression: (1) regulates CD44 and c-Met expression; (2) regulates cell migration (via CD44 and c-Met); and, (3) regulates glioblastoma resistance to apoptosis. Lastly, the modulation by AKT of Fra-1 activity in glioblastoma cell lines will be explored. Additional studies will test whether Fra-1 expression regulates glioblastoma cell resistance to apoptosis. Fra- 1's ability to regulate CD44 and c-Met expression related cell activities will be by silencing targeted proteins with siRNA. The proposed studies will determine whether Fra-1 regulates invasive cell migration and also resistance to apoptosis induced by radiation via CD44 and c-Met respectively.      Innovation: The innovation is primarily in the novelty of the anticipated results. Standard methodology is employed.      Investigators: The combination of interests and backgrounds of both the mentor (Dr. Waldermar Debinski) and mentee (Dr. Martin) make this an excellent partnership.      Environment: The environment is excellent.      PILOT PROGRAMS: Training and Educational      The current NC A&T science curriculum is not strong in cancer biology.  With the support of the P20 WFUCCC faculty  with work with NC A& T faculty to increase awareness of cancer research.

Summer support for these students will be provided by existing NC A&T programs.        Graduate student training in cancer research:   Drs. Martin and Franks will recruit at least one NC A&T Master's student each into the collaborative pilot projects conducted jointly with WFUCCC faculty for the graduate student training in cancer research.       Genomics Education and Internships:    Jianfeng Xu, M.D., Dr.PH, Professor of Public Health and Professor of Cancer Biology and Director of Center for Cancer Genomics at Wake Forest University School of Medicine will provide an opportunity for NC A&T students to learn how genomics and proteomics tools are applied in cancer research. The Center utilizes state-of-the-art high-throughput molecular technologies and bioinformatics tools to evaluate millions of germline sequence variants in the genome among a large number of cancer patients and normal controls. They also integrate germline changes with somatic DNA changes and epigenetic changes in tumors to comprehensively interrogate genome for cancer related genes.       Guest Lectures:    Researchers from the WFUCCC Genomics Center will also guest lecture in the BIOL 640 Introduction to Bioinformatics and Genomics course at NC A&T for upper level undergraduate and graduate students.       Computational Biology Training:    Dr. Gregory Coins, Director of the BLEND program at NC A&T, will hold an awareness seminar for the BLEND undergraduate students to inform them regarding the opportunity of participating in computational cancer biology research projects ongoing at WFU under the mentorship of Dr. Jacquelyn Fetrow.       Health Disparities Internships and Education:   The Maya Angelou Research Center on Minority Health (MARCMH) at the Wake Forest University School of Medicine (WFUSM) will take a lead role   in the development of research training and community outreach experiences for NC A&T students.  Dr. Ronny Bell, Professor of Epidemiology and Prevention and MARCMH Director, and Dr. Melicia Whitt-Glover, Director of the MARCMH Community Outreach program, will work with Dr. Smith and other NC A&T colleagues in formulating the structure for the experience.       Opportunities for research training will include internships and individual mentoring with MARCMH faculty affiliates, participation in MARCMH and other WFUSM seminars and conferences pertaining to health disparities and auditing courses in the WFUSM Master's of Sciences in Clinical and Population Translational Sciences Graduate Program.      Additional Opportunities: Additional opportunities for community outreach will include participating in community initiated health-focused activities (health fairs, screenings, conferences, etc.) in the Triad area (Greensboro, Winston-Salem, High Point), particularly those targeting minority and low-income segments of these cities.       Another opportunity is the course, titled, The introduction to the Use of Animal Models in Cancer Research. Dr. Tim Kute, Professor of Cancer Biology at WFU, will collaborate with Dr. Vinaya Kelkar at NC A&T to develop a teaching module on animal models of cancer to be integrated into the current experimental biology course (BIOL 703 Experimental Methods in Biology) that will be taught at NC A&T.      Investigator/Personnel: Dr. Steve Akman, WFU Principal Investigator, is Professor of Internal Medicine and Cancer Biology at Wake Forest University. His research interests focus on DNA damage and mutagenesis, and non-canonical DNA structures. As a practicing medical oncologist, Dr. Akman has both a clinical and a research interest in breast cancer, a disease in which there is a clear disparity in outcome between African-Americans and other ethnic groups.

"Asymmetric CD8+ T Cell Division in the Initiation of Immunity    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): CD8+ T cells play a critical role in host defense against microbes pertinent to biodefense. A hallmark of adaptive immunity against agents such as Listeria monocytogenes, LCMV virus, and Toxoplasma gondii is heterogeneity of cell fate among antigen-experienced CD8+ T cells. Substantial preliminary evidence outlined in this proposal indicates that the first division of a CD8+ T cell responding to a pathogen, in vivo, is characterized by unequal partitioning of proteins with established roles in signaling, cell fate specification, and asymmetric cell division. In addition, the first daughter T cells of the immune response appear to be differentially fated as precursors of the effector and memory lineages. This project will test whether asymmetric cell division is a general feature of the CD8+ T cell response against pathogens, whether ancestral regulators of cell polarity are responsible for establishing cytoskeletal features necessary for asymmetric division, and how asymmetrically inherited signaling proteins could mediate fate disparity in daughter T cells.

"Transgenerational Microchimerism in Pregnancy Loss    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Microchimerism (Mc) refers to harboring a small number of cells or DNA from a genetically distinct individual. During pregnancy Mc is naturally acquired in the exchange of cells between a mother and conceptus. In prior studies we found that a mother's cells persist in her progeny into adult life. During pregnancy a woman who is already host to Mc from her mother acquires an additional source of Mc as cells and cell-free DNA from the conceptus enter her circulation. These observations raise the question of whether HLA-relationships across generations influence the outcome of pregnancy in women and, as genetic diversity is generally thought to be good, whether excessive HLA-sharing across generations contributes to recurrent idiopathic pregnancy loss (RPL). HLA molecules are central to immune responses, to distinguishing self from ""other"" and extensive polymorphism is the hallmark feature of HLA genes. Due to the polymorphism in HLA genes most of the time there are numerous differences in HLA alleles among family members. However, occasionally an increase of HLA-sharing is observed in families, either due to HLA-homozygosity or heterozygous HLA-identity. Previous studies have suggested that excessive HLA-sharing of a woman and her partner is associated with idiopathic RPL, although studies have been conflicting. The first Specific Aim of this R21 proposal will test the hypothesis that HLA-relationships over three generations have less HLA-disparity (increased sharing) when women probands have primary idiopathic RPL compared to probands with a live birth and no history of miscarriage. HLA-genotyping will be conducted for DRB1, DRB3, DRB4, DRB5, DQA1, DQB1, A, B and C for women with primary idiopathic RPL, their mothers, conceptus, and partners. Specific Aim 2 will identify and quantify Mc from the proband's mother (MP-Mc) in consecutive blood samples from before, during and after pregnancy for probands with primary idiopathic RPL with a subsequent miscarriage or with a live birth and healthy women with no history of miscarriage. For this purpose a panel of HLA-specific and other genetic polymorphism specific quantitative PCR assays has been developed and will be employed to tested peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Specific Aim 3 will quantify Mc from the conceptus of the proband (CP-Mc) in the same peripheral blood samples using the same methods as in Aim 2 to test peripheral blood mononuclear cells as well as serum. In addition to the hypothesis of Aim 1, a second hypothesis will be tested in Aims 2 and 3, that dynamic changes in Mc, either MP-Mc or CP-Mc or both, is associated with idiopathic RPL. The consequences and long-term effects of harboring Mc from multiple sources are largely unknown as naturally acquired Mc from pregnancy has only recently been recognized. To our knowledge there are no prior studies investigating HLA-sharing or Mc across generations in idiopathic RPL. Harboring a small number of cells (or DNA) that originated from a genetically distinct individual is referred to as microchimerism (Mc). The finding that women harbor Mc from their own mothers and later acquire Mc from their own pregnancy(ies) raises questions about whether interactions between cell populations across generations sometimes influences pregnancy success. Because they help distinguish one cell from another particular genes, called HLA genes, are of special interest to investigate.          ",Transgenerational Microchimerism in Pregnancy Loss,7484075,R21AI072547,"['Thinking, function ', ' thoughts ', ' Thinking ', ' Time ', ' Variation (Genetics) ', ' allelic variant ', ' Genetic Variation ', ' Genetic Diversity ', ' Gene variant ', ' Woman ', ' Immune ', ' Source ', ' Live Birth ', ' interest ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Blood Circulation ', ' Circulation ', ' Bloodstream ', ' success ', ' human leukocyte antigen gene ', ' HLA gene ', ' Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell ', ' PBMC ', ' trafficking ', ' Pregnancy loss ', ' proband ', ' Abbreviations ', ' Cell Count ', ' Cell Number ', ' Cells ', ' Spontaneous abortion ', ' Miscarriage ', ' Generations ', ' Family member ', ' Population ', ' Conflict (Psychology) ', ' Conflict ', ' HLA-DRB1 ', ' HLA-DRB1 antigen ', ' DNA ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' Purpose ', ' Microchimerism ', ' Conceptus ', ' Other Genetics ', ' Family ', ' Fetus ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Future ', ' Genes ', ' Genotype ', ' Blood specimen ', ' Blood Sample ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' HLA Antigens ', ' Leukocyte Antigens ', ' Human Leukocyte Antigens ', ' HL-A Antigens ', ' Family Study ', ' Alleles ', ' Allelomorphs ', ' peripheral blood ', ' Serum ', ' Blood Serum ', ' Individual ', ' Long-Term Effects ', ' Longterm Effects ', ' Methods ', ' Mothers ', ' Terminology ', ' Immune response ', ' immunoresponse ', ' host response ', ' Polymerase Chain Reaction ', ' Genetic Polymorphism ', ' polymorphism ', ' Polymorphism (Genetics) ', ' Pregnancy ', ' Gestation ', ' Pregnancy Outcome ', ' Recurrence ', ' Recurrent ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Testing ', ' ']",NIAID,FRED HUTCHINSON CANCER RESEARCH CENTER,R21,2008,251601,0.06535460218618551
"Gender Differences in Experimental Aortic Aneurysms    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) comprise the 10th leading cause of death in Caucasian males 65-74 years of age and accounted for nearly 16,000 deaths overall in the year 2000. Understanding the pathophysiology of AAAs is an important undertaking. Clinically, multiple risk factors are associated with the development of AAAs, including increasing age, positive smoking history, and hypertension. Male gender is also a well-established risk factor for the development of an AAA with a 4:1 male to female ratio. The reason for this gender disparity is unknown. The pathogenesis of AAAs formation is complex and multifactorial. Histologically, AAAs are characterized by early chemokine driven leukocyte infiltration into the aortic wall with subsequent destruction of elastin and collagen in the media and adventitia by excessive local production of matrix degrading enzymes, and smooth muscle cell loss with thinning of the aortic wall. At present, there are no medical therapies available to treat patients with aortic aneurysms, using only the crude measurement of aortic diameter as a threshold for which patients must undergo life-threatening and costly surgery, either open or endovascularly. Therefore, defining the early mechanisms underlying gender-related differences in AAA formation are critical and will be the focus of the present investigation. Understanding differences in disease patterns based on gender may allow us to develop new translational approaches to the prevention and treatment of patients with aortic aneurysms. Overall hypothesis: Gender- related differences in aortic aneurysm formation are mediated by the hormonal (androgen: estrogen ratio) regulation of leukocyte trafficking into the aortic wall. Specific Aim 1. To define the mechanism by which early inflammatory cell recruitment is accelerated in males during AAA formation. Studies will test the hypothesis that increased incidence of AAAs in males is secondary to increased recruitment of leukocytes into the aortic wall driven by an excess of androgens relative to estrogens. Specific Aim 2. To demonstrate that gonadal hormones can be used to modulate the inflammatory response accompanying AAA formation. Studies will test the hypothesis that altering the androgen: estrogen environment can dictate the prevalence of aneurysm formation by altering the aforementioned specific soluble mediator dependent leukocyte trafficking, ultimately driving the balance of matrix degradation and repair toward aneurysm formation.           ",Gender Differences in Experimental Aortic

"Helper T Cell Regulation In Murine Leishmaniasis    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The clonal selection theory of adaptive immunity suggests that proliferation of a single lymphocyte should provide sufficient function for acute defense (effector cells), yet the regenerative capacity to maintain the selected lineage (memory cells). The progeny of a CD4+ helper T cell selected for an immune response against parasitic pathogens must also have the plasticity to choose among several effector lineages (Th1, Th2, Th17) in order to mobilize the most appropriate defense mechanisms for elimination of a single-celled intracellular protozoan or a multi-celled extracellular helminth. This proposal tests the hypothesis that signals directing the activation of a CD4+ helper T cell during the immune response against the parasite Leishmania major may trigger a program of cell fate diversity among the initial daughter cells of the selected microbe-specific T cell. Preliminary evidence suggests such diversification may be accomplished using an evolutionarily conserved mechanism, called asymmetric cell division, wherein critical cell fate determinants are inherited unequally by two daughter cells. This competing continuation proposal seeks to determine the extent of disparity in the inheritance of signaling molecules and fate regulators in the initial cellular progeny of a CD4+ helper T cell responding to L. major, to evaluate the fate of the initial daughter and grand-daughter CD4+ T cells, and to assess genetically whether critical daughter cell fates depend on regulators of asymmetric cell division. These studies should provide novel insight into some of the most important remaining questions regarding the programming of CD4+ helper T cell function and the immunological control of parasitic infections that are relevant to humankind.Public Health Relevance Statement       Helper T lymphocytes are specialized white blood cells that orchestrate the actions of our immune system to protect us against infections.

"Systemic Innate Immune Responses in Secondary Syphilis    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Venereal syphilis is a sexually transmitted disease caused by the spirochetal pathogen, Treponema pallidum. The disease remains uncontrolled, particularly in resource-scarce regions where testing, treatment and proper follow-up are not always accessible. Syphilis is characterized by the appearance of a local ulcer at the site of initial infection to an array of chronic systemic inflammatory manifestations that when left untreated, can cause severe complications and even death. The inability to culture the bacterium has hampered efforts to fully understand its pathogenesis, particularly why the spirochete is able to evade the immune system. The research proposed here is thus designed to better characterize the nature this immune response as it occurs in human syphilis. The systemic cellular innate immune response in secondary syphilis patients will be the focus of the current proposal. We hypothesize that in secondary syphilis, the presence of T. pallidum in the blood directly activates circulating monocytes and dendritic cells. To do so, in Specific Aim 1 we will first confirm that spirochetal DNA is present in blood from secondary syphilis patients using a novel Real Time Quantitative PCR method and in Specific Aim 2 we will characterize T. pallidum driven immune responses in circulating monocytes and dendritic cells by using multiparameter four color flow cytometry and `real time' PCR (RT-PCR) to quantify their pro- inflammatory cytokine gene expression signals. Complementary ex vivo studies, are structured to identify the effect of the bacterium on specific components of innate and adaptive immune cells. From these two parallel lines of research, we will obtain a more mechanistic understanding of the pathogenesis of syphilis, which can be further developed along cellular and molecular lines and ultimately facilitate development of a vaccine. In concert with the Fogarty International Center's mission to reduce health disparities amongst nations, the planned activities will also: (1) support collaborative syphilis immunobiology research between the USPI and the FC in Cali, Colombia; (2) strengthen the foreign institute's (CIDEIM), research capabilities and technical base; (3) foster sustained and productive research between two US based institutions (UCHC and CCMC) and CIDEIM; and (4) provide needed epidemiological data about venereal syphilis for that region of Colombia.           ",Systemic Innate Immune Responses in Secondary Syphilis,7342736,R03TW008023,"['Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Skin ', ' Dendritic Cells ', ' Veiled Cells ', ' Inflammatory Response ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Institution ', ' DNA ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' Cytokine Gene ', ' Elements ', ' Data ', ' Immunobiology ', ' Immunophysiology ', ' in vivo Model ', ' Immunologics ', ' Immunochemical Immunologic ', ' transmission process ', ' Transmission ', ' Molecular ', ' follow-up ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' Flow Cytometry ', ' flow cytophotometry ', ' Flow Microfluorometry ', ' Flow Microfluorimetry ', ' Flow Cytofluorometry ', ' Flow Cytofluorometries ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Globus Pallidus ', ' pallidum ', ' base ', ' Organ ', ' HIV ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Man (Taxonomy) ', ' Left ', ' Site ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Immune system ', ' allergic/immunologic organ system ', ' allergic/immunologic body system ', ' Natural Immunity ', ' Non-Specific Immunity ', ' Native Immunity ', ' Innate Immunity ', ' Immunologic Memory ', ' secondary immune response ', ' anamnestic reaction ', ' Immunological Memory ', ' In Vitro ', ' Infection ', ' Institutes ', ' Lesion ', ' peripheral blood ', ' insight ', ' Numbers ', ' Lipoproteins ', ' lymph nodes ', ' lymph gland ', ' Lymph node proper ', ' Lymph Node Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Fostering ', ' Methods ', ' Mission ', ' Biological Models ', ' Model System ', ' Biologic Models ', ' monocyte ', ' Marrow monocyte ', ' Blood monocyte ', ' Immune response ', ' immunoresponse ', ' host response ', ' Patients ', ' Antibodies ', ' Polymerase Chain Reaction ', ' Antigenic Specificity ', ' Antigens ', ' immunogen ', ' ATGN ', ' Contracts ', ' Contracting Opportunities ', ' Inflammatory ', ' Nature ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Sexually Transmitted Diseases ', ' Venereal Infections ', ' Venereal Disorders ', ' Venereal Diseases ', ' Sexually Transmitted Infection ', ' Sexually Transmitted Disorder ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Order Spirochaetales ', ' Spirochetes ', ' Spirochaetales ', ' Syphilis ', ' great pox ', ' T-Lymphocyte ', ' thymus derived lymphocyte ', ' Thymus-Dependent Lymphocytes ', ' T-Cells ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Time Study ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Treponema pallidum ', ' T.pallidum ', ' T. pallidum ', ' Ulcer ', ' Ulceration ', ' Investigation ', ' World Health Organization ', ' Immune ', ' Bacteria ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' vaccine development ', ' development of a vaccine ', ' develop a vaccine ', ' international center ', ' Animal Model ', ' model organism ', ' Animal Models and Related Studies ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Pathogenesis ', ' Appearance ', ' Cells ', ' Mediating ', ' Property ', ' LOINC Axis 2 Property ', ' response ', ' Colombia ', ' Color ', ' Communicable Diseases ', ' Infectious Disorder ', ' Infectious Diseases and Manifestations ', ' Infectious Diseases ', ' Infectious Disease Pathway ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' pathogen ', ' Homing ', ' parent grant ', ' ']",FIC,CONNECTICUT CHILDREN'S MEDICAL CENTER,R03,2008,39380,0.0904501249783663

"Role of Mitochondrial Genomic Alterations in Epithelial Ovarian Tumors    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Epithelial ovarian cancer is the major cause of gynecologic cancer mortality in women in the United States. At the molecular level, both sporadic and hereditary ovarian cancer requires the accumulation of genetic changes, and these changes are characterized by a high degree of genetic alterations. Ovarian carcinoma is histopathologically classify on morphological criteria, which is the different types of epithelia in the female reproductive system, including serous, mucinous, endometrioid, clear cell, and Brenner. Epithelial ovarian tumor subtype has been further subclassified into benign, borderline and malignant to reflect their histopathology. Mitochondria are 99% inherited from the mother through the egg (oocyte) and involved in essential cellular pathways, some of which have been associated with tumorigenesis. In preliminary work, we have identified several differential mitochondrial DNA germline mutations/polymorphisms in cytoadenomas, borderline and stages (1-IV) within each of the epithelial ovarian tumor subtype and ethnic difference (Aikhionbare et al., Journal of Carcinogenesis 2007 and Diagnostic Pathology 2008). The proposed study would employ various molecular techniques, including: Random Amplified Polymorphic DNA-PCR (RAPD-PCR), High-Resolution Restriction analysis, Allelic-Specific Polymerase Chain Reaction, then followed by PCR-based DNA Sequencing and real-time RT-PCR. These techniques would be used to: 1) Identify and determine the distributions and frequencies of mitochondrial DNA mutation(s)/polymorphism(s) in three epithelial ovarian tumor subtypes (n= 300 tissue samples; serous=100, mucinous=100, endometrioid=100). 2) Determine the role of mitochondrial DNA polymorphisms/mutations among African-American and Caucasian women susceptibility to invasive epithelial ovarian tumor. This project will provide insight and more preliminary data for further study of a novel downstream target gene of mitochondria, which may ultimately facilitate the diagnosis and prognosis of the epithelial ovarian tumor subtypes and stages.   PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Mitochondria plays a role in the initiation of cells death and cancer cells growth. This project will identify and determine scientifically whether altered mitochondria gene could be associated with the different subtypes and early stages of the ovarian tumors progression, which may be involved in racial difference. Results from this aim may have significant clinical implications in the development of novel diagnostic approaches for biologically aggressive ovarian cancer from diverse racial origin.           Mitochondria plays a role in the initiation of cells death and cancer cells growth.

"Gender Differences in Experimental Aortic Aneurysms    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) comprise the 10th leading cause of death in Caucasian males 65-74 years of age and accounted for nearly 16,000 deaths overall in the year 2000. Understanding the pathophysiology of AAAs is an important undertaking. Clinically, multiple risk factors are associated with the development of AAAs, including increasing age, positive smoking history, and hypertension. Male gender is also a well-established risk factor for the development of an AAA with a 4:1 male to female ratio. The reason for this gender disparity is unknown. The pathogenesis of AAAs formation is complex and multifactorial. Histologically, AAAs are characterized by early chemokine driven leukocyte infiltration into the aortic wall with subsequent destruction of elastin and collagen in the media and adventitia by excessive local production of matrix degrading enzymes, and smooth muscle cell loss with thinning of the aortic wall. At present, there are no medical therapies available to treat patients with aortic aneurysms, using only the crude measurement of aortic diameter as a threshold for which patients must undergo life-threatening and costly surgery, either open or endovascularly. Therefore, defining the early mechanisms underlying gender-related differences in AAA formation are critical and will be the focus of the present investigation. Understanding differences in disease patterns based on gender may allow us to develop new translational approaches to the prevention and treatment of patients with aortic aneurysms. Overall hypothesis: Gender- related differences in aortic aneurysm formation are mediated by the hormonal (androgen: estrogen ratio) regulation of leukocyte trafficking into the aortic wall. Specific Aim 1. To define the mechanism by which early inflammatory cell recruitment is accelerated in males during AAA formation. Studies will test the hypothesis that increased incidence of AAAs in males is secondary to increased recruitment of leukocytes into the aortic wall driven by an excess of androgens relative to estrogens. Specific Aim 2. To demonstrate that gonadal hormones can be used to modulate the inflammatory response accompanying AAA formation. Studies will test the hypothesis that altering the androgen: estrogen environment can dictate the prevalence of aneurysm formation by altering the aforementioned specific soluble mediator dependent leukocyte trafficking, ultimately driving the balance of matrix degradation and repair toward aneurysm formation.           ",Gender Differences in Experimental Aortic

"NCMHD Southeastern Exploratory Sickle Cell Center of Excellence    DESCRIPTION: Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a genetic disorder of hemoglobin and afflicts ~110,000 African-Americans in the US. Because of its complex pathophysiology through chronic hemolytic anemia, microvascularocclusion, and a chronic inflammatory state, it affects multiple organ systems and leads to significant morbidity and organ damage as well as leads to frequent hospitalizations and health care encounters. During the past 35 years, primarily through research and patient care conducted by the NIH funded Comprehensive Sickle Cell Centers and some pivotal clinical trials, the life expectancy of patients with SCD has increased from the teens to mid- to late forties. This is still considerably shorter than that of African-Americans who do not have sickle cell disease and can be viewed as a major disparity even in this underserved minority population. While significant advances have been made in the understanding of the disease pathophysiology and in novel therapies through basic and translational research, these advances have been slow to be taken to clinical practice. The Southeastern Exploratory Sickle Cell Center of Excellence seeks to improve the care and quality of life of the SCD patient population by i) investigating the basic mechanism of action of a highly successful and effective hemoglobin F inducing drug, hydroxyurea, ii) identifying genetic variations underlying the frequency of pain, response to narcotics, and thus addressing the important issue of biologic/genetic bases of pain and its under treatment leading to the stigmatization of many SCD patients and its resulting disparity, iii) investigating the medical, social, and economic reasons for underutilization of hydroxyurea in SCD, iv) training primary care physicians with evidence based medicine in the care of patients with SCD, given the sobering reality that there will not be enough specialists in non-malignant hematology to meet the needs of the growing adult SCD population, and v) implementing innovative methods and concepts for the care of SCD patients in the ED and for transitioning from pediatric to adult care. Relieving the health disparity of SCD patients is the primary goal of this application. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Sickle cell disease in the United States primarily affects African-Americans and is considered an orphan disease. Because of the lack of knowledge of health care providers in the management and treatment of painful episodes and other complications of this disease, patients are most often undertreated or not treated at all, which has created an enormous health disparity for these patients.             Sickle cell disease in the United States primarily affects African-Americans and is considered an orphan disease.

"Microbicide properties of RT inhibitor combinations    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Topical microbicides are an important strategy to minimize heterosexual transmission of HIV. Several single agent microbicides are in clinical trials, including one based on the nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) UC781 that we discovered as a potential microbicidal agent. However, combination microbicides may be preferable, yet only a single combination microbicide is currently under evaluation. There is also an urgent need to identify new pipeline microbicidal agents. We have found that the nucleoside RT inhibitor (NRTI) 4'-ethynyl-2-fluoro-deoxyadenosine (4'E-2FdA) provides a potent and prolonged barrier to HIV- 1 infection of cells in the subsequent absence of exogenous drug, a property previously only noted for NNRTI such as UC781. The ""memory effect"" barrier is imparted by 4'E-2FdA at drug levels orders of magnitude less than those needed for protection by the nucleotide tenofovir, currently in clinical assessment for microbicide use. We hypothesize that microbicides comprising combinations of different classes of highly potent RT inhibitors, namely the NNRTI UC781 and an NRTI such as 4'E-2FdA, will provide an optimal barrier to HIV-1 transmission. We therefore propose these Specific Aims for this R21/R33 phased innovation application: R21 Aim 1. To evaluate the in vitro (cell-based) microbicidal properties of NRTI and UC781 alone and in combination. These studies include assessment of antiviral activity and ""memory effect"" protection imparted by NRTIs and UC781 alone and in combination using primary cells (PBMCs, CD4+ T-cells, macrophages) and different HIV drug-sensitive and drug-resistant strains, isolates and clades. R21 Aim 2. To elucidate the mechanism of 4'E-2FdA (and analogs) induced protective barrier or ""memory effect"" in HIV susceptible cells. These studies include characterization of uptake, conversion to triphosphate and intracellular stability of the NRTI-TPs, as well as detailed kinetic evaluations of the NRTI substrate activity with enzymes involved in metabolism of the NRTIs. R21 Deliverables: Identification of a lead NRTI and two back-ups for use with UC781 for development as a combination microbicide. R33 Aim 1. To formulate the NRTI/NNRTI combinations selected in the R21 phase into an appropriate delivery system for vaginal topical use. NRTIs and NNRTIs have different chemical properties, thus appropriate delivery systems must be identified to enable incorporation and release of the active agents. We will prepare and evaluate both gel and rapidly dissolving film formulations for the combination microbicide. R33 Aim 2. To evaluate the anti-HIV microbicidal activity of formulated NRTI/NNRTI combinations in an ex vivo cervical explant tissue model. These studies will use a newly developed physiologically relevant polarized cervical tissue model to assess the impact of formulated microbicides alone and in combination on HIV transmission and infectivity. R33 Deliverables: Identification of an appropriate delivery formulation for the selected NRTI/NNRTI combination for entry into subsequent preclinical safety and efficacy studies. This project seeks to develop anti-HIV microbicides based on the non-nucleoside RT inhibitor UC781 in combination with novel 4'-substituted nucleosides, a combination found to provide profound and protracted protection of susceptible cells against HIV infection in vitro. Our studies will provide potent new formulations to the microbicide development pipeline for entry into clinical evaluation.          ",Microbicide properties of RT inhibitor combinations,7682246,R21AI079801,"['Memory ', ' Metabolism ', ' Metabolic Processes ', ' Intermediary Metabolism ', ' Nucleosides ', ' Nucleotides ', ' inhibitor/antagonist ', ' inhibitor ', ' Poliomyelitis ', ' Polio ', ' Epidemic Acute Poliomyelitis ', ' Acute Poliomyelitis ', ' Antiviral Agents ', ' Antivirals ', ' Antiviral Drugs ', ' Risk ', ' Smallpox ', ' variola major ', ' small pox ', ' Variola ', ' Tenofovir ', ' 9-PMPA ', ' 9-(2-phosphonylmethoxypropyl)adenine ', ' 9-(2-phosphonomethoxypropyl)adenine ', ' microbicide ', ' microbicidal ', ' Local Microbicides ', ' topical microbicide ', ' Deoxyadenosines ', ' Adenylyldeoxyribonucleosides ', ' Adenine Deoxyribonucleosides ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Drug resistance ', ' resistant to Drug ', ' resistance to Drug ', ' drug resistant ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Economics ', ' non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors ', ' nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors ', ' non-nucleoside RT inhibitors ', ' NNRTI ', ' Enzymes ', ' Equilibrium ', ' balance function ', ' balance ', ' tripolyphosphate ', ' triphosphate ', ' Systemic Therapy ', ' SYS-TX ', ' research clinical testing ', ' clinical test ', ' Clinical Testing ', ' Clinical Evaluation ', ' Sexual Transmission ', ' Tissue Model ', ' transmission process ', ' Transmission ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Heterosexuals ', ' Gel ', ' base ', ' Half-Life ', ' topical antiviral ', ' topical anti-viral ', ' HIV ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV Infections ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' HIV-1 ', ' human T lymphotropic virus III ', ' human T cell leukemia virus III ', ' Human immunodeficiency virus 1 ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Virus Type 1 ', ' HIV1 ', ' HIV-I ', ' Cervical ', ' Phase ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' In Vitro ', ' Infection ', ' Evaluation ', ' Kinetics ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Inequality ', ' analog ', ' uptake ', ' chemical property ', ' macrophage ', ' UC 781 ', ' UC781 ', ' CD4 Positive T Lymphocytes ', ' helper T cell ', ' T4 Lymphocytes ', ' T4 Cells ', ' CD4-Positive Lymphocytes ', ' CD4+ T-Lymphocyte ', ' CD4+ T cell ', ' CD4 lymphocyte ', ' CD4 T cells ', ' CD4 Cells ', ' Educational process of instructing ', ' Teaching ', ' Vaccines ', ' Vagina ', ' Vaginal ', ' Virion ', ' Virus Particle ', ' Virus ', ' General Viruses ', ' Woman ', ' System ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' Back ', ' Dorsum ', ' Drug Formulations ', ' Formulation ', ' success ', ' novel ', ' Cells ', ' Gender ', ' Generations ', ' Film ', ' HIV vaccine ', ' human immunodeficiency virus vaccine ', ' HIV/AIDS Vaccines ', ' Mediating ', ' Property ', ' LOINC Axis 2 Property ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' clinical investigation ', ' cost ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' HIV drug resistance ', ' resistant to HIV drug ', ' resistance to antiHIV ', ' resistance to anti-HIV ', ' resistance to HIV drug ', ' HIV drug resistant ', ' AntiHIV resistant ', ' AntiHIV resistance ', ' Anti-HIV resistant ', ' Anti-HIV resistance ', ' Clinical assessments ', ' Drug-sensitive ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' resistant strain ', ' resistance strain ', ' preclinical safety ', ' anti-HIV microbicide ', ' anti-HIV microbicidal ', ' ']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R21,2009,222852,0.043815408840907046
"Antigen Specific T Cell tolerance by Anti CD3 Antibodies    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Transplantation of hematopoietic stem cells from an allogeneic donor can be followed by serious graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) despite the best available regimen for immune suppression. Experimental animal data and results of clinical trials have demonstrated that T cells play a central role in GVHD. Recent advances in understanding the mechanisms of peripheral T cell tolerance have made it feasible to test the hypothesis that GVHD can be prevented in man by T cell receptor (TCR) partial agonist ligands through the selective depletion of alloreactive T cells. Transplantation tolerance is facilitated by activation-induced cell death (AICD) of peripheral T cells triggered by the specific alloantigens, and TCR signals are indispensable for induction of antigen-specific tolerance. TCR engagement can induce either T cell proliferation and differentiation or AICD. Monoclonal antibodies (mAb) to CD3, a monomorphic chain associated to the TCR complex, mimic antigen and induce TCR signaling and T cell activation. Fc receptor (FcR)-binding anti-CD3 mAbs recruit antigen-presenting cells (APC) and deliver full agonist signals that promote T cell proliferation and effector functions, independent of antigen. In contrast, non-FcR-binding anti-CD3 mAbs induce a partial agonist TCR signaling pattern causing anergy in naive T cells and AICD in antigen-activated, cycling T cells. In mice, we found that non-FcR-binding anti-CD3 mAbs induce selective depletion of donor T cells that recognize recipient alloantigens thereby preventing GVHD across MHC disparities, and spare T cell specific to third party antigens. In collaboration with J. Tso, we designed a `humanized' non-FcR-binding anti-CD3 mAb, visilizumab, which delivers a partial agonist signal to the TCR. Visilizumab is more effective than other anti-CD3 mAbs in inducing AICD of activated, cycling human T cells. Our preliminary results in human trials show that visilizumab can induce complete clinical responses in some patients with severe acute GVHD, refractory to conventional immune suppressive agents. We propose here to study efficacy of visilizumab in the prevention of GVHD after hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) from HLA incompatible donors, and assess whether its immune suppressive effects are selective for alloantigens. We will pursue the following specific aims: Aim 1: Determine the safety and efficacy of humanized non-FcR-binding anti-CD3 mAb visilizumab in preventing severe GVHD after transplantation of T-replete hematopoietic cell grafts from HLA-incompatible donors. Aim 2: Investigate whether visilizumab therapy depletes the alloreactive T cell pool, while sparing immunity to third party alloantigens, cytomegalovirus (CMV) and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), and tumor- associated antigen WT1. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The development of effective regimens for the prevention of GVHD will improve patient safety and survival after transplantation, and extend the use of this procedure to a larger number of patients. Progress in the prevention of GVHD has the potential for advancing the fields of organ transplantation and therapy for autoimmune disorders. Anti-CD3 mAbs represent the prototype of a new class of therapeutic agents that suppress the immune system by inducing an abortive activation and T cell death. What makes anti-CD3 mAbs unique and more attractive than other agents is the potential for achieving immunological tolerance rapidly and irreversibly. Showing that non-FcR-binding anti-CD3 mAbs spare T cells specific for viral and tumor-associated antigens is key to predict patient safety.          ",Antigen Specific T Cell tolerance by Anti CD3 Antibodies,7679536,R01CA132197,"['Cytomegalovirus ', ' human cytomegalovirus ', ' cytomegalovirus group ', ' Salivary Gland Viruses ', ' HCMV ', ' CMV ', ' CD3 Antigens ', ' T3 molecule ', ' T3 Complex ', ' T3 Antigens ', ' OKT3 antigen ', ' CD3 molecule ', ' CD3 Complex ', ' CD3 ', ' patient safety ', ' Visilizumab ', ' Nuvion ', ' T-Cell Proliferation ', ' T-Cell Activation ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Human Herpesvirus 4 ', ' human herpesvirus 4 group ', ' Infectious Mononucleosis Virus ', ' Herpesvirus 4 (gamma), Human ', ' HHV-4 ', ' Epstein-Barr Virus ', ' Epstein Barr Virus ', ' EB virus ', ' E-B Virus ', ' Burkitt Lymphoma Virus ', ' Burkitt Herpesvirus ', ' Doctor of Medicine ', ' M.D. ', ' Receptor Signaling ', ' Allogenic ', ' Principal Investigator ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Graft-vs-Host Disease ', ' Runt Disease ', ' Homologous Wasting Disease ', ' Graft-Versus-Host Disease ', ' GVHD ', ' Grant ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Man (Taxonomy) ', ' Peripheral ', ' Clinical ', ' Refractory ', ' Cell Transplantation ', ' Immune system ', ' allergic/immunologic organ system ', ' allergic/immunologic body system ', ' Immunity ', ' Alloantigen ', ' anergy ', ' Hematopoietic ', ' Ligands ', ' Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation ', ' HSC transplantation ', ' Agonist ', ' Mus ', ' Murine ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Mice ', ' Collaborations ', ' Organ Transplantation ', ' organ xenograft ', ' organ graft ', ' organ allograft ', ' Transplantation Surgery ', ' Organ Transplants, Including Bone Marrow for DCT ', ' Organ Transplants ', ' Grafting Procedure ', ' Clinical, Transplantation, Organ ', ' Therapeutic Agents ', ' Patients ', ' Infectious Agent ', ' infectious organism ', ' Play ', ' Monoclonal Antibodies ', ' Clinical Treatment Moab ', ' Antigen-Presenting Cells ', ' accessory cell ', ' Monocytes / Macrophages / APC ', ' Immunologic Accessory Cells ', ' Antigens ', ' immunogen ', ' ATGN ', ' Proteins ', ' gene product ', ' T-Cell Receptor ', ' Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell ', ' Major Histocompatibility Complex Receptor ', ' MHC Receptor ', ' Fc Receptor ', ' antibody receptor ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' recruit ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Safety ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' programs ', ' T-Lymphocyte ', ' thymus derived lymphocyte ', ' Thymus-Dependent Lymphocytes ', ' T-Cells ', ' Testing ', ' Transplantation ', ' transplant ', ' Treatment Protocols ', ' Treatment Schedule ', ' Treatment Regimen ', ' Tumor Antigens ', ' tumor-specific antigen ', ' Tumor-Associated Antigen ', ' Autoimmune Diseases ', ' autoimmune disorder ', ' Immune ', ' Complex ', ' Pattern ', ' Viral ', ' receptor binding ', ' animal data ', ' disorder prevention ', ' disease prevention ', ' Prevention ', ' WT1 gene ', ' Wilms tumor suppressor WT1 ', ' Wilms Tumor 1 ', ' WT33 ', ' WT1 ', ' WAGR ', ' Cell Death ', ' necrocytosis ', ' Cells ', ' Mediating ', ' Acute Graft Versus Host Disease ', ' Acute GVHD ', ' response ', ' Monoclonal Antibody HuM291 ', ' MoAb HuM291 ', ' HuM291 ', ' HUM291 [Anti-CD3 Antibody] ', ' Anti-CD3 Antibody ', ' Transplantation Tolerance ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' clinical investigation ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' man ', "" man's "", ' prototype ', ' public health relevance ', ' ']",NCI,H.

"Reducing Urban Women's HIV Risk: Soap Opera Videos on Video Capable Cell Phones    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Reducing Urban Women's HIV Risk: Soap Opera Videos on Video-Capable Cell Phones According to the CDC, the majority (80%) of women with HIV became infected by unprotected sex with an infected male partner. Black and Latina women accounted for 82% of AIDS diagnoses in women in 2005. The purpose of this proposal is to evaluate whether a series of 12-weekly data and theory-based urban soap operas will promote a reduction in HIV sex risk behavior in young urban African American and Latina women. Toni's Story is based on content analysis of focus group discussions with the target population. By grounding stories in urban women's own experiences, via a popular medium of the soap opera, women can identify with the heroines' emotionally charged process of change, transforming their behavior through a new awareness of their value as women, of their choices, and their potential. Messages about reducing HIV sexual risk are designed to fulfill familiar relationship needs. Because trust, sexual pressure and power form the nexus of sex scripts associated with HIV sexual risk, these themes are examined through the pursuits of the various characters as sub-plots. A randomized controlled trial (RCT) with 250 high-risk women aged 18 to 29, recruited in neighborhood settings in Newark and Jersey City, will be conducted to test the effect of the video-based intervention on HIV sexual risk behavior. A control group will receive text messages with audio that stress HIV health promotion messages. The series of 12 20-minute videos to the video intervention group (n=125) and 12- weekly HIV-risk reduction text/ audio messages to the control group (n=125) will be viewed over video-capable cell phones so that women may view the videos and text messages repeatedly and in privacy. It is expected that as a result of watching the video series, the video intervention group will demonstrate greater reductions in unprotected sex from baseline to 3 and 6 months than will the control group. Further, it is expected that they will demonstrate lower sexual pressure, indicating lower stereotypical expectations to engage in unprotected sex. Secondary analyses will determine whether there are differences in these results by partner type, whether there is a reduction in the number of high risk sex partners, and whether choosing to watch the videos more frequently will relate to further reduction in risk behavior. Interviews will be conducted by audio computer assisted self-interview (ACASI). The program will track when, how often, and for how long the videos are viewed. If the aims of this proposal are achieved, the use of the cell phone to view videos could change the paradigm of how health promotion is amplified between clinic sessions. Potentially hard to reach young urban women who may be at risk for HIV, will be able to access video-based interventions on their own cell phones. The popularity of the cell phone and use of the Internet for multimedia offer a new communication channel to address health disparities in young urban women.

"Mechanisms of Feline Lentivirus Control and Interference    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Though transmission of indigenous African monkey lentiviruses to humans or to Asian macaques has resulted pathogenic consequences for the new host, it is becoming increasingly clear that pathogenic cross- species lentiviral infection is an exceptional occurrence. Recent studies indicate innate cellular restriction factors are key to limiting such infections, and that lentiviral adaptation to a new host requires alterations in accessory gene structure, i.e., viral infectivity factor (Vif). To study this issue, we developed a feline model of cross-species lentiviral transmission that results in productive, yet regressive, avirulent infection, and have determined that such infection attenuates subsequent virulent feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) challenge. Data published during the initial grant cycle demonstrate that innate cellular responses, namely cytokine expression profiles and cytidine deaminase-like (CD) activity resulting in high viral error burden, are more significant for host viral control than adaptive immune responses-which follow rather than precede viral down regulation. Moreover, virulent FIV-C-PG disease attenuation (i.e. protection from CD4+ T cell depletion and modulation of viral set point) in cats infected with avirulent puma lentivirus (PLV-1695), is associated with unique FIV molecular evolution, and maintenance of a proinflammatory cytokine profile vs. cats infected with virulent FIV-C-PG alone-and disease modulation occurs despite disparities in receptor use and target cell distribution between FIV and PLV. Here we propose to advance this unique feline model to address important questions in lentivirus biology: (a) How does host innate activity (defined by CD-like hypermutation and cytokine cell-signaling) relate to attenuation of disease? and (b) What role does Vif play in modulating virulent lentiviral challenge? To answer these questions, we propose: (1) To determine whether previous PLV-1695 infection enhances hypermutation, error burden, and tissue-specific cytidine deaminase activity/cytokine expression after FIV-C-PG challenge; and, (2) To determine whether Vif modulates CD activity and cytokine activation as a mechanism of attenuation. These experiments pose a new paradigm for assessment of protective immunity against HIV/AIDS-namely, that enhancement of early innate immune parameters by exposure to an avirulent, non-adapted lentivirus can provide cross-protective activity against a virulent, host-adapted lentivirus, and as such, these studies are of great public health significance.

"Gender Differences in Experimental Aortic Aneurysms Abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) comprise the 10th leading cause of death in Caucasian males 65-74 years of age and accounted for nearly 16,000 deaths overall in the year 2000. Understanding the pathophysiology of AAAs is an important undertaking. Clinically, multiple risk factors are associated with the development of AAAs, including increasing age, positive smoking history, and hypertension. Male gender is also a well-established risk factor for the development of an AAA with a 4:1 male to female ratio. The reason for this gender disparity is unknown. The pathogenesis of AAAs formation is complex and multifactorial. Histologically, AAAs are characterized by early chemokine driven leukocyte infiltration into the aortic wall with subsequent destruction of elastin and collagen in the media and adventitia by excessive local production of matrix degrading enzymes, and smooth muscle cell loss with thinning of the aortic wall. At present, there are no medical therapies available to treat patients with aortic aneurysms, using only the crude measurement of aortic diameter as a threshold for which patients must undergo life-threatening and costly surgery, either open or endovascularly. Therefore, defining the early mechanisms underlying gender-related differences in AAA formation are critical and will be the focus of the present investigation. Understanding differences in disease patterns based on gender may allow us to develop new translational approaches to the prevention and treatment of patients with aortic aneurysms. Overall hypothesis: Gender- related differences in aortic aneurysm formation are mediated by the hormonal (androgen: estrogen ratio) regulation of leukocyte trafficking into the aortic wall. Specific Aim 1. To define the mechanism by which early inflammatory cell recruitment is accelerated in males during AAA formation. Studies will test the hypothesis that increased incidence of AAAs in males is secondary to increased recruitment of leukocytes into the aortic wall driven by an excess of androgens relative to estrogens. Specific Aim 2. To demonstrate that gonadal hormones can be used to modulate the inflammatory response accompanying AAA formation. Studies will test the hypothesis that altering the androgen: estrogen environment can dictate the prevalence of aneurysm formation by altering the forementioned specific soluble mediator dependent leukocyte trafficking, ultimately driving the balance of matrix degradation and repair toward aneurysm formation.

"The Role of Protease-Activated Receptors in the Regulation of eNOS    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The objective of this study is to explore the signal transduction mechanism by which protease-activated receptors (PARs) regulate endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) phoshorylation and activation in endothelial cells. Proteases play very important roles in endothelial physiology and pathophysiology through activation of PARs. Their functions include regulations of endothelium-dependent contraction/relaxation, endothelial permeability/barrier function, leukocyte adhesion, angiogenesis, endothelial cell migration and proliferation. Thus, PARs are very likely to be involved in the development of cardiovascular diseases. However, the detailed molecular mechanisms by which PARs regulate these functions remain largely unclear. PAR1 and PAR2 are believed to play major roles in endothelial cell function. Recent studies revealed multiple heterotrimeric G protein-coupling (Gq, Gi, G12/13) and several downstream signaling cascades of PAR1 in endothelial cells and other cells. By contrast, much less is known regarding PAR2 signal transduction in endothelial cells, which mainly couples to Gq. Our goal is to study the specific signal transduction pathways utilized by PARs including heterotrimeric G protein- coupling together with the structure-activity relationship of PARs during coupling and their roles in mediating downstream signals that regulate eNOS. We hypothesize that PAR1 and PAR2 reciprocally regulate eNOS through distinct signaling pathways and have proposed the following specific aims to address this hypothesis. We plan: 1. To demonstrate that a distinct receptor C-tail structure associated with distinct G protein-coupling is required for reciprocal eNOS phosphorylation by PARs. 2. To identify eNOS kinases that reciprocally regulate eNOS activity in response to distinct PARs. 3. To identify the distinct PAR C-tail associated proteins that are responsible for reciprocal eNOS regulation. Cultured endothelial cells will be used to detect phosphorylation of eNOS. Kinase assays, site mutations, and novel proteomic approaches will be used to identify other proteins involved in the reciprocal phosphorylation of eNOS. The results of this study will be valuable in developing specific-acting therapeutic drugs that can be used to treat endothelial dysfunctions that lead to cardiovascular diseases. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project is relevant to public health because of its importance in understanding some of the possible causes of cardiovascular disease, the number one killer in America, especially among the African American community. It will provide information regarding the role of protease-activated receptors in the regulation of the endothelium, which plays an important role in vascular tone. Endothelial dysfunction is a major cause of hypertension, and these studies will contribute to the development of treatment strategies to alleviate or prevent cardiovascular disease.             ",The Role of Protease-Activated Receptors in the Regulation of eNOS,7560994,SC3GM086336,"['Couples ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Proteinase-Activated Receptors ', ' Protease-Activated Receptors ', ' Endopeptidase-Activated Receptors ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Etiology ', ' disease causation ', ' causation ', ' Causality ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' F2R gene ', ' PAR1 ', ' F2R ', ' CF2R ', ' ADRBK1 gene ', ' GRK2 ', ' Beta-ARK-1 ', ' BARK1 ', ' ADRBK1 ', ' protein kinase inhibitor ', ' Endothelium ', ' Address ', ' Enzymes ', ' Protein Kinase Inhibitors ', ' Adhesions ', ' Doctor of Philosophy ', ' PhD ', ' Ph.D. ', ' Dominant-Negative Mutation ', ' Dominant-Negative Mutant ', ' Dominant Negative ', ' Antimorphic mutation ', ' RGS Domain ', ' Regulators of G Protein Signaling Domain ', ' RGS-Signaling Domain ', ' Receptor Activation ', ' Receptor Signaling ', ' Phage Display ', ' Molecular ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Family ', ' Chimeric Proteins ', ' Fusion Protein ', ' Chimera Protein ', ' career ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Hypertension ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' high blood pressure ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' In Vitro ', ' protein kinase C-delta ', ' Training ', ' Endothelial Cells ', ' Laboratories ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Leukocytes ', ' white blood corpuscle ', ' white blood cell ', ' White Cell ', ' White Blood Cells ', ' Marrow leukocyte ', ' Leukocytes Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Blood leukocyte ', ' Funding ', ' Agonist ', ' Americas ', ' PAR-2 Receptor ', ' Trypsin Receptor ', ' Proteinase Activated Receptor 2 ', ' Protease-Activated Receptor 2 ', ' PAR2 Receptor ', ' Mutation ', ' genome mutation ', ' Genetic defect ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Functional disorder ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Physiopathology ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Nitric Oxide ', ' endothelial cell derived relaxing factor ', ' Nitrogen Protoxide ', ' Nitrogen Monoxide ', ' Mononitrogen Monoxide ', ' Endothelium-Derived Nitric Oxide ', ' Endogenous Nitrate Vasodilator ', ' Therapeutic ', ' angiogenesis ', ' Paper ', ' Peptide Hydrolases ', ' Proteolytic Enzymes ', ' Proteinases ', ' Proteases ', ' Peptidases ', ' Esteroproteases ', ' Permeability ', ' inhibitor/antagonist ', ' inhibitor ', ' Phosphorylation ', ' Protein Phosphorylation ', ' Phosphotransferases ', ' Transphosphorylases ', ' Kinases ', ' EC 2.7 ', ' Physiology ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Play ', ' Production ', ' tool ', ' Proteins ', ' gene product ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' Publications ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Publishing ', ' Figs -

"Mechanisms of Feline Lentivirus Control and Interference    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Though transmission of indigenous African monkey lentiviruses to humans or to Asian macaques has resulted pathogenic consequences for the new host, it is becoming increasingly clear that pathogenic cross- species lentiviral infection is an exceptional occurrence. Recent studies indicate innate cellular restriction factors are key to limiting such infections, and that lentiviral adaptation to a new host requires alterations in accessory gene structure, i.e., viral infectivity factor (Vif). To study this issue, we developed a feline model of cross-species lentiviral transmission that results in productive, yet regressive, avirulent infection, and have determined that such infection attenuates subsequent virulent feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) challenge. Data published during the initial grant cycle demonstrate that innate cellular responses, namely cytokine expression profiles and cytidine deaminase-like (CD) activity resulting in high viral error burden, are more significant for host viral control than adaptive immune responses-which follow rather than precede viral down regulation. Moreover, virulent FIV-C-PG disease attenuation (i.e. protection from CD4+ T cell depletion and modulation of viral set point) in cats infected with avirulent puma lentivirus (PLV-1695), is associated with unique FIV molecular evolution, and maintenance of a proinflammatory cytokine profile vs. cats infected with virulent FIV-C-PG alone-and disease modulation occurs despite disparities in receptor use and target cell distribution between FIV and PLV. Here we propose to advance this unique feline model to address important questions in lentivirus biology: (a) How does host innate activity (defined by CD-like hypermutation and cytokine cell-signaling) relate to attenuation of disease? and (b) What role does Vif play in modulating virulent lentiviral challenge? To answer these questions, we propose: (1) To determine whether previous PLV-1695 infection enhances hypermutation, error burden, and tissue-specific cytidine deaminase activity/cytokine expression after FIV-C-PG challenge; and, (2) To determine whether Vif modulates CD activity and cytokine activation as a mechanism of attenuation. These experiments pose a new paradigm for assessment of protective immunity against HIV/AIDS-namely, that enhancement of early innate immune parameters by exposure to an avirulent, non-adapted lentivirus can provide cross-protective activity against a virulent, host-adapted lentivirus, and as such, these studies are of great public health significance.           ",Mechanisms of Feline Lentivirus Control and Interference,7590398,R01HL092791,"['Cytidine Deaminase ', ' Cytidine Aminohydrolase ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Down-Regulation ', ' Downregulation ', ' Down-Regulation (Physiology) ', ' Elements ', ' Address ', ' Cytokine Activation ', ' Data ', ' Indigenous ', ' Molecular Profiling ', ' molecular signature ', ' molecuar profile ', ' Molecular Fingerprinting ', ' Expression Signature ', ' Expression Profiling ', ' in vivo ', ' Gene Structure ', ' Gene Structure/Organization ', ' Gene Organization ', ' Virulent ', ' transmission process ', ' Transmission ', ' trend ', ' Family ', ' Genome ', ' Age ', ' base ', ' Grant ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Man (Taxonomy) ', ' Site ', ' Subfamily lentivirinae ', ' Virus-Lenti ', ' Lentivirus ', ' Lentivirinae ', ' Feline Lentiviruses ', ' Immune system ', ' allergic/immunologic organ system ', ' allergic/immunologic body system ', ' Immunity ', ' Natural Immunity ', ' Non-Specific Immunity ', ' Native Immunity ', ' Innate Immunity ', ' In Vitro ', ' Infection ', ' African ', ' Macaca ', ' Macaque ', ' Maintenance ', ' Monkeys ', ' Published Comment ', ' Viewpoint ', ' Editorial Comment ', ' Commentary ', ' Comment ', ' Molecular Evolution ', ' progesterone 11-hemisuccinate-(2-iodohistamine) ', ' his-PG ', ' therapeutic vaccine ', ' Immune response ', ' immunoresponse ', ' host response ', ' Genetic ', ' Play ', ' Family Felidae ', ' feline ', ' Felids ', ' Felidae ', ' Exposure to ', ' Attenuated ', ' Inflammatory ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' Publishing ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' programs ', ' Viral Load result ', ' Viral Load ', ' Viral Burden ', ' CD4 Positive T Lymphocytes ', ' helper T cell ', ' T4 Lymphocytes ', ' T4 Cells ', ' CD4-Positive Lymphocytes ', ' CD4+ T-Lymphocyte ', ' CD4+ T cell ', ' CD4 lymphocyte ', ' CD4 T cells ', ' CD4 Cells ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Virulence ', ' Virus Diseases ', ' virus-induced disease ', ' virus infection ', ' viral infection ', ' Viral Diseases ', ' Virus Replication ', ' virus multiplication ', ' Virus ', ' General Viruses ', ' Immune ', ' System ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' Viral ', ' Biology ', ' receptor ', ' Receptor Protein ', ' Animal Model ', ' model organism ', ' Animal Models and Related Studies ', ' attenuation ', ' virus host interaction ', ' T-Cell Depletion ', ' research study ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' AIDS/HIV problem ', ' HIV/AIDS problem ', ' HIV/AIDS ', ' AIDS/HIV ', ' Felis catus ', ' Felis sylvestris catus ', ' Felis domesticus ', ' Felis domestica ', ' Feline Species ', ' Domestic Cats ', ' Cats Mammals ', ' Cats ', ' Cells ', ' Asians ', ' oriental ', ' cytokine ', ' Feline Immunodeficiency Virus ', ' Feline T-Lymphotropic Virus ', ' Feline T-Lymphotropic Lentivirus ', ' FTLV ', ' FIV ', ' Lentivirus Infections ', ' Lentivirus disease ', ' Relative (related person) ', ' Relative ', ' Infection Control ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Puma Lentivirus ', ' novel therapeutics ', ' next generation therapeutics ', ' new therapeutics ', ' ']",NHLBI,COLORADO STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2009,367500,0.0714572180334774
"Occult lymph node metastases and racial disparities in colon cancer outcomes    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application addresses Broad Challenge Area (09): Health Disparities and Prevention and Specific Challenge Topic, 09-CA-101: The Basis for Differences in Cancer Incidence. There is an established disparity in stage-specific outcomes in African Americans, compared to Caucasians, with colorectal cancer, the 3rd most common incident cancer and the 3rd leading cause of cancer death in the U.S. Indeed, African Americans who are free of metastases exhibit a 40% excess mortality attributable to race. Factors contributing to these racial disparities in outcomes, and methods that quantify excess risk, remain undefined. While the most important prognostic marker of survival and predictive marker of response to therapy in colorectal cancer are tumor cells in regional lymph nodes detected histologically, ~30% of patients with histology-negative nodes (stage I, II; pN0) die of recurrent disease, reflecting under-staging and occult nodal metastases that escape detection. Recently, GUCY2C, a protein whose expression is restricted to intestinal cells normally, but is universally expressed by colorectal cancer cells, was clinically validated for detection of prognostically important occult metastases, by quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR), in a prospective, multicenter, blinded clinical trial. Further, beyond the utility of occult metastases as a categorical variable (yes/no), occult tumor burden (how much) estimated by GUCY2C qRT-PCR stratified risk, identifying pN0 patients with near-zero risk, and those with >80% risk, of unfavorable outcomes. Importantly, subgroup analysis suggests that African Americans exhibit disproportionate occult tumor burden in lymph nodes associated with unfavorable clinical outcomes. The working hypothesis here suggests that racial disparities in stage-specific outcomes in pN0 colorectal cancer, in part, reflect disproportionate under-staging and occult metastases in lymph nodes which can be detected by GUCY2C qRT-PCR. Here, we propose a retrospective analysis of pN0 African American and Caucasian colon cancer patients >5 y beyond staging, with established clinical outcomes, to quantify the contribution of occult metastases to racial disparities in outcomes. This proposal will examine the utility of GUCY2C qRT-PCR as a categorical variable (yes/no) that identifies occult metastases in lymph nodes contributing to excess risk attributable to race in patients with pN0 colon cancer. Moreover, we will quantify the contribution of occult tumor burden (how much) to racial differences in outcomes in pN0 patients. At the conclusion, the contribution of occult metastatic tumor cells in lymph nodes to racial disparities in stage-specific outcomes in colon cancer will be defined, and a prognostic paradigm comprising GUCY2C qRT-PCR to quantify occult tumor burden and excess risk in African Americans will be clinically validated and positioned for translation. PROJECT NARRATIVE: African Americans with colon cancer exhibit increased mortality compared to Caucasians, although the reasons are unknown. In that context, recent work revealed the importance of occult metastases in lymph nodes that are undetected by routine techniques in defining the risk of disease recurrence in patients with colon cancer. The present studies examine the contribution of occult metastases, detected by new molecular techniques, to racial disparities in outcomes in African Americans and Caucasians with colon cancer.              PROJECT NARRATIVE: African Americans with colon cancer exhibit increased mortality compared to Caucasians, although the reasons are unknown.

"Arts, Research, T-cells & Socio-demographics (ARTS) in the Niagara Region    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The disproportionately lower number of minority and low income individuals participating in clinical and prevention research has a significant impact on the representativeness of scientific outcomes and result in social and clinical injustices. Roswell Park Cancer Institute (RPCI) and Niagara Falls community members are creating power-neutral collaborations to meet the needs of vulnerable communities in order to reduce cancer disparities and improve cancer research. The proposed ""ARTS"" (Arts, Research, T-cells & Sociodemographics) study creates a collaborative opportunity linking a diverse, relatively low income population with an NCI Comprehensive Cancer Center to test the feasibility of studying the relationship among various contributing factors (e.g., socio-demographics, including poverty and race/ethnicity) to health disparities (e.g., immune function, risks for cancer). The goal of this study is to investigate strategies to engage residents in the Niagara Falls region with scientists at RPCI to increase mutual understanding of each other and participation in cancer prevention research, and to obtain pilot data on variations in Treg cell levels. The following Specific Aims are proposed to achieve this goal: Aim 1. Investigate the feasibility of educating and recruiting Niagara Falls residents to cancer prevention studies through creative community-based methods and interventions within the Niagara Arts & Cultural Center (NACC) as measured through attendance, surveys and study participation. Aim 2. Investigate the technical feasibility of epidemiological survey collection, biological specimen collection, and performing regulatory T Cell assays through community-based interventional methods. Aim 3. Develop a meaningful and appropriate framework and best methods for sharing findings from social and biological data among all academic and community partners and participants. Through educational recruitment programs based at the NACC, demographics, affective measures (e.g., the feeling people associate with the idea of research), and intent to participate, will be collected using a community-friendly audience response system (ARS). Individuals may choose to participate at various levels, and those selecting to donate blood will allow us to obtain pilot data about how certain lifestyle (e.g., smoking, exercise, diet) and demographic factors (e.g., income, neighborhood, race/ethnicity) are related to important aspects of the immune system in healthy residents as measured by Treg cells (cells that can prevent the immune system from protecting the body). It is expected that process and outcome results from this feasibility study will provide pilot data for research questions related to: 1) the role of affectively-based decision making factors on research participation; 2) heterogeneity of immunological indicators in relationship to socio-demographic, environmental, and behavioral variables; 3) the effectiveness of linking medical research education and recruitment with a community group focused on the arts; and 4) the technical accommodations necessary for a research institution and community partners to recruit, accrue, and analyze measures related to cancer research.          ","Arts, Research, T-cells & Socio-demographics (ARTS) in the Niagara Region",7691807,R03CA139946,"['Arts ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' T-Lymphocyte ', ' thymus derived lymphocyte ', ' Thymus-Dependent Lymphocytes ', ' T-Cells ', ' Testing ', ' Scientist ', ' Universities ', ' Attitude ', ' Work ', ' Decision Making ', ' Demographic Factors ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Commit ', ' immune function ', ' Cellular Immune Function ', ' Institution ', ' Action Research ', ' Effectiveness ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Low income ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Address ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Data ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Cancer Center ', ' Collection ', ' Comprehensive Cancer Center ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Roswell Park Cancer Institute ', ' Translational Research ', ' translation research enterprise ', ' translation research ', ' Translational Science ', ' Translational Research Enterprise ', ' Process ', ' Feeling ', ' feelings ', ' Behavioral ', ' Feasibility Studies ', ' Focus Groups ', ' base ', ' Goals ', ' improved ', ' Health ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' sample collection ', ' specimen collection ', ' Clinical ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Biological ', ' Link ', ' Immune system ', ' allergic/immunologic organ system ', ' allergic/immunologic body system ', ' Income ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Life Style ', ' Lifestyle ', ' Individual ', ' Low Income Population ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Methods ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Mission ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Educational Intervention ', ' instructional intervention ', ' Training Intervention ', ' Instruction Intervention ', ' Education for Intervention ', ' cancer prevention ', ' Collaborations ', ' Play ', ' Poverty ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' recruit ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Science ', ' Smoking ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Awareness ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' Behavior ', ' Belief ', ' Benchmarking ', ' Best Practice Analysis ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' meetings ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' cancer risk ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Prevention Research ', ' Prevention strategy ', ' Preventive strategy ', ' member ', ' research study ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' Basic Science ', ' Basic Research ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' Cells ', ' Measures ', ' Medical Research ', ' falls ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' diverse populations ', ' Research Methodology ', ' Research Methods ', ' response ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Communities ', ' forging ', ' anticancer research ', ' cancer research ', ' Minority ', ' diet and exercise ', ' Outcome ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' cancer disparity ', ' Affective ', ' demographics ', ' community based participatory research ', ' ']",NCI,ROSWELL PARK CANCER INSTITUTE CORP,R03,2009,75156,0.027492286018370733
"Helper T Cell Regulation In Murine Leishmaniasis    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The clonal selection theory of adaptive immunity suggests that proliferation of a single lymphocyte should provide sufficient function for acute defense (effector cells), yet the regenerative capacity to maintain the selected lineage (memory cells). The progeny of a CD4+ helper T cell selected for an immune response against parasitic pathogens must also have the plasticity to choose among several effector lineages (Th1, Th2, Th17) in order to mobilize the most appropriate defense mechanisms for elimination of a single-celled intracellular protozoan or a multi-celled extracellular helminth. This proposal tests the hypothesis that signals directing the activation of a CD4+ helper T cell during the immune response against the parasite Leishmania major may trigger a program of cell fate diversity among the initial daughter cells of the selected microbe-specific T cell. Preliminary evidence suggests such diversification may be accomplished using an evolutionarily conserved mechanism, called asymmetric cell division, wherein critical cell fate determinants are inherited unequally by two daughter cells. This competing continuation proposal seeks to determine the extent of disparity in the inheritance of signaling molecules and fate regulators in the initial cellular progeny of a CD4+ helper T cell responding to L. major, to evaluate the fate of the initial daughter and grand-daughter CD4+ T cells, and to assess genetically whether critical daughter cell fates depend on regulators of asymmetric cell division. These studies should provide novel insight into some of the most important remaining questions regarding the programming of CD4+ helper T cell function and the immunological control of parasitic infections that are relevant to humankind.Public Health Relevance Statement       Helper T lymphocytes are specialized white blood cells that orchestrate the actions of our immune system to protect us against infections.

"Systemic Innate Immune Responses in Secondary Syphilis    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Venereal syphilis is a sexually transmitted disease caused by the spirochetal pathogen, Treponema pallidum. The disease remains uncontrolled, particularly in resource-scarce regions where testing, treatment and proper follow-up are not always accessible. Syphilis is characterized by the appearance of a local ulcer at the site of initial infection to an array of chronic systemic inflammatory manifestations that when left untreated, can cause severe complications and even death. The inability to culture the bacterium has hampered efforts to fully understand its pathogenesis, particularly why the spirochete is able to evade the immune system. The research proposed here is thus designed to better characterize the nature this immune response as it occurs in human syphilis. The systemic cellular innate immune response in secondary syphilis patients will be the focus of the current proposal. We hypothesize that in secondary syphilis, the presence of T. pallidum in the blood directly activates circulating monocytes and dendritic cells. To do so, in Specific Aim 1 we will first confirm that spirochetal DNA is present in blood from secondary syphilis patients using a novel Real Time Quantitative PCR method and in Specific Aim 2 we will characterize T. pallidum driven immune responses in circulating monocytes and dendritic cells by using multiparameter four color flow cytometry and `real time' PCR (RT-PCR) to quantify their pro- inflammatory cytokine gene expression signals. Complementary ex vivo studies, are structured to identify the effect of the bacterium on specific components of innate and adaptive immune cells. From these two parallel lines of research, we will obtain a more mechanistic understanding of the pathogenesis of syphilis, which can be further developed along cellular and molecular lines and ultimately facilitate development of a vaccine. In concert with the Fogarty International Center's mission to reduce health disparities amongst nations, the planned activities will also: (1) support collaborative syphilis immunobiology research between the USPI and the FC in Cali, Colombia; (2) strengthen the foreign institute's (CIDEIM), research capabilities and technical base; (3) foster sustained and productive research between two US based institutions (UCHC and CCMC) and CIDEIM; and (4) provide needed epidemiological data about venereal syphilis for that region of Colombia.           ",Systemic Innate Immune Responses in Secondary Syphilis,7547764,R03TW008023,"['Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Skin ', ' Veiled Cells ', ' Dendritic Cells ', ' Inflammatory Response ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Institution ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' DNA ', ' Cytokine Gene ', ' Elements ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' Data ', ' Immunophysiology ', ' Immunobiology ', ' in vivo Model ', ' Immunochemical Immunologic ', ' Immunologics ', ' Transmission ', ' transmission process ', ' Molecular ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' flow cytophotometry ', ' Flow Microfluorometry ', ' Flow Microfluorimetry ', ' Flow Cytofluorometry ', ' Flow Cytofluorometries ', ' Flow Cytometry ', ' Gene Expression ', ' pallidum ', ' Globus Pallidus ', ' base ', ' Organ ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' Modern Man ', ' Man (Taxonomy) ', ' Human ', ' Left ', ' Site ', ' Methods ', ' Mission ', ' Model System ', ' Biologic Models ', ' Biological Models ', ' Marrow monocyte ', ' Blood monocyte ', ' monocyte ', ' immunoresponse ', ' host response ', ' Immune response ', ' Patients ', ' Antibodies ', ' Antigenic Specificity ', ' immunogen ', ' ATGN ', ' Antigens ', ' Contracting Opportunities ', ' Contracts ', ' Inflammatory ', ' Nature ', ' Research ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Venereal Infections ', ' Venereal Disorders ', ' Venereal Diseases ', ' Sexually Transmitted Infection ', ' Sexually Transmitted Disorder ', ' Sexually Transmitted Diseases ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Spirochetes ', ' Spirochaetales ', ' Order Spirochaetales ', ' great pox ', ' Syphilis ', ' thymus derived lymphocyte ', ' Thymus-Dependent Lymphocytes ', ' T-Cells ', ' T-Lymphocyte ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Time Study ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Tissues ', ' T.pallidum ', ' T. pallidum ', ' Treponema pallidum ', ' Ulceration ', ' Ulcer ', ' Investigation ', ' World Health Organization ', ' Immune ', ' Bacteria ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Blood ', ' development of a vaccine ', ' develop a vaccine ', ' vaccine development ', ' international center ', ' model organism ', ' Animal Models and Related Studies ', ' Animal Model ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Pathogenesis ', ' Appearance ', ' Cells ', ' Mediating ', ' LOINC Axis 2 Property ', ' Property ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' allergic/immunologic organ system ', ' allergic/immunologic body system ', ' Immune system ', ' Non-Specific Immunity ', ' Native Immunity ', ' Innate Immunity ', ' Natural Immunity ', ' secondary immune response ', ' anamnestic reaction ', ' Immunological Memory ', ' Immunologic Memory ', ' In Vitro ', ' Infection ', ' Institutes ', ' Lesion ', ' peripheral blood ', ' insight ', ' Lipoproteins ', ' lymph gland ', ' Lymph node proper ', ' Lymph Node Reticuloendothelial System ', ' lymph nodes ', ' Fostering ', ' response ', ' Colombia ', ' Color ', ' Infectious Disorder ', ' Infectious Diseases and Manifestations ', ' Infectious Diseases ', ' Infectious Disease Pathway ', ' Communicable Diseases ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' pathogen ', ' Homing ', ' parent grant ', ' ']",FIC,CONNECTICUT CHILDREN'S MEDICAL CENTER,R03,2009,50760,0.0904501249783663
"Sickle Cell Disease Research Center (SCDRC) Summer Institute/Mentoring Program    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):      The mission of the Sickle Cell Disease Research Center (SCDRC) is to ""actively and aggressively participate in the substantive development of basic research and training efforts to improve treatment options or cure sickle cell disease"". The SIPID funding initiative is relevant to the mission of the SCDRC project because it will utilize a multidisciplinary approach to increase underrepresented minorities in Biomedical Research related to heart, lung, and blood disease. The program will fund summer institutes to enable 10-12 participants from underrepresented racial and ethnic groups to further develop their research skills and knowledge, thereby enhancing their career development as faculty members or scientists. The summer institute will focus on genomic-based biomedical research related to sickle cell disease (SCD): to introduce multidisciplinary approaches to genomic research and establish a broad base working knowledge of current technological advances and identify potential areas of future research projects involving modern DMA and protein analytical tools. This will be accomplished through classroom didactic lectures and hands-on bench training in laboratory settings. Our goals will include: increasing the number of racial and ethical underserved individuals who enter research careers by establishing a structured mentored training program and long-term research collaborations between mentors and mentees; increasing grantsmanship skills of participants; and identifying extramural research funding opportunities. Diversity of scientific and scholarly activity will be valuable in improving the public health of patients and subjects from diverse backgrounds. Studies have suggested that a racially concordant scientific staff is more successful in recruiting individuals from minority groups into clinical studies. Racially similar physician-patient dyads have been shown to be related to greater patient satisfaction in ways that may also enhance communication and participation in a clinical research setting. The need for a diverse workforce permeates all aspects of the nation's public health-related research efforts. Because minorities suffer a disproportionate burden of morbidity and mortality associated with HLBS disorders, there is a critical need to increase the number of investigators conducting research on health disparities in HLBS disorders, such as sickle cell disease.

"Determining the roles(s) of HIV-1 Nef in enhancement of virion infectivity    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): HIV-1 Nef has many functions that work to enhance the pathogenicity of HIV and SIV which are important for the progression to AIDS. One such function is the enhancement of infectivity of virions that contain the Nef gene. Various investigators have shown an array of effects on virion infectivity from changes in cholesterol content of virions (a producer cell effect) to proposed effects on the process of reverse transcription (a target cell effect). Unfortunately, many of these studies have been done using different viruses and different cell systems and the conclusions have not always been directly comparable. The goal of this project will be cells, virions, and target to investigate the potential effects of Nef on producer cells in the same project. We will take advantage of several unique approaches that have been developed in our lab to study the effects of Nef in three contexts: 1. Nef expressed in producer cells, but containing mutations that prevent incorporation into virions. 2. Nef directly delivered to virions by fusion of virions with secreted Nef vesicles. 3. Nef-GFP labeled virions to allow tracking of Nef after fusion and entry. Completion of these experiments will allow us to better understand at which stages of the viral life cycle Nef can exert an effect on infectivity. A better understanding of how Nef modulates virion infectivity would provide the basis for developing therapeutics based on this mechanism. In light of the difficulties in finding an effective vaccine, a better understanding of the basic functions of Nef and other viral proteins could provide an alternative to control viral infectivity. In the past decade the search for an HIV/AIDS vaccine has been more difficult than anyone would have anticipated. To date, the production of new antiviral drugs has provided the greatest success we have had in reducing deaths due to AIDS. Therefore, it is important to continue to study basic viral replication in the effort to find new antiviral strategies. The goal of this project is to advance our understanding of how the HIV virus controls its own infectivity. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: With support from the Kirschstein fellowship, I aim to prepare ultimately for a meaningful and prolific career in academia or being an adept researcher at the National Institutes of Health or Centers for Disease Control studying minority health disparities. The research training proposed in this application will greatly facilitate achievement of this long-term goal in a number of ways. First, it will facilitate acquisition of various technical skills (e.g. cloning, immuno-cytochemistry) which will certainly prove Instrumental in post-doctoral work. Secondly, and perhaps more importantly, accomplishment of this training will foster the development of the critical thinking skills required for independent research.

"Polymorphism and mutation spectrum in minorities with non-small cell lung cancer    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application addresses broad Challenge Area (09) Health Disparities and Specific Challenge Topic, 09-CA- 104: Basic cancer research in cancer health disparities. Title: Polymorphism and mutation spectrum in minorities with non-small cell lung cancer Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer related deaths in the United States. Despite similar risk factors, African-Americans have higher incidence and mortality rates from lung cancer than other populations. Numerous studies have recently demonstrated that both inherited and acquired genetic lesions have a significant impact on both the risk of developing lung cancer and the outcomes and efficacy of targeted therapies. For example, the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling pathway is important in the development, progression, and invasion of non-small cell lung cancer. Ethnic differences in polymorphisms and acquired mutations in the EGFR and its downstream targets have been definitively proven to exist. It is well established that mutations in the tyrosine kinase domain are more frequent in Asian populations as compared to Caucasian population residing in western countries. These mutations confer better overall prognosis and predict response to the tyrosine kinase inhibitors, erlotinib and gefitinib; however, very little data is available regarding the prevalence of these mutations in the dominant U.S. racial minorities. In another important pathway, KRAS, mutations are present in 20-30% of patients with non-small cell lung cancer. Mutated KRAS is associated with poor prognosis and resistance to the monoclonal EGFR antibody, cetuximab as well as the EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors erlotinib and gefitinib. Notably, the prevalence of KRAS and somatic EGFR mutations in African-Americans is unknown. Recently, genome wide association studies identified a single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) variation in the nicotinic receptor which correlated with an increase in genetic susceptibility to non small cell lung cancer. Increased frequency of SNP variability may be one factor that contributes to the increased incidence of non-small cell lung cancer in African-Americans, but the frequency of these in this population is undefined. Thus efforts to better understand the molecular basis for disease susceptibility, incidence, progression, prognosis, and response to biologic agents among the common U.S. racial and ethnic minorities are needed. The Comprehensive Meharry/Vanderbilt-Ingram Cancer Center Research Partnership conducts research to address the disproportional cancer incidence, morbidity, and mortality in under-represented minorities. A dual institution study to review documented cases of non-small cell lung cancers in African-Americans to determine the frequency of germ line polymorphisms, somatic EGFR mutations, and KRAS mutations is proposed. The clinical significance of a SNP in the nicotinic receptor in African-Americans will be determined by comparing known lung cancer patients with age matched controls identified through the Southern Community Cohort Study. Medical records of patients diagnosed with non-small cell lung cancer will be reviewed. Gene sequencing will identify the prevalence of EGFR mutations and KRAS mutations. The frequency of these mutations will be analyzed as independent variables to determine the clinical significance when compared to known risk factors such as smoking. The goal of this study is to determine the impact of perturbations in the EGFR pathway on genetic susceptibility, disease progression, and outcome in African-Americans with nonsmall cell lung cancer. A study of this nature has never been performed. The results should provide tremendous insight into the genomic factors which influence susceptibility, pathogenesis, drug sensitivity, and survival in African-Americans with non-small cell lung cancer.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer related deaths in the United States.

"The pigmentary system: securing a place in the sun    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The PanAmerican Society for Pigment Cell Research is preparing to hold its 15th Annual Meeting - ""The Pigmentary System: Securing a Place Under the Sun"" in Memphis, TN on September 4-7, 2009. At the last PASPCR 2007 annual meeting, we proposed to attract both basic scientists and clinicians interested in pigmentary disorders in order to concentrate efforts in applying the existing knowledge towards the treatment of underserved patient populations. Within the vast field of cutaneous biology, pigmentation is a growing area of research. The theme of this meeting therefore touches on unique facets and diverse topics of public health interest, ranging from developmental biology, biochemistry of pigmentation, melanosomes and immune recognition, stem cells and malignant transformation, to the environmental effects on pigmentation including the effect of solar radiation, health disparities and pigmentary disorders, inheritance of skin coloration and sociobiology. Among important topics discussed is the biohazard connected with the ultraviolet wavelengths of the solar radiation with resulting cutaneous carcinogenesis. In this context pigmentary system serves as well documented protector against solar radiation as well as an efficient system counteracting the action of reactive oxygem species. On the other hand ultraviolet radiation (UVB) is crucial for cutaneous production of vitamin D3, a major regulator of body calcium homeostasis and hormone with pleiotropic effects. There are also other systems attenuating oxidative stress such as melanoninergic system. Furthermore, pigmentary system is operating within the skin neuroendocrine system and interacts with the immune system. These research topics share areas of interest that allow basic researchers and clinicians with a primary or derivative interest in pigmentation to communicate novel and unpublished research data and treatment outcomes. The opportunity contributes to the emerging of novel ideas and fruitful collaborations. Our Memphis location for the '09 meeting will allow easy and relatively affordable access to the meeting for all US based researchers and clinicians. Methodist Healthcare designates this educational activity for a maximum of 26 AMA PRA Category 1 Credits. The objectives of the current application for funding of this meeting are to support keynote speakers and outstanding young investigators, to enhance the educational and scientific aspect of the meeting by publishing and distributing the final program and abstracts among the participants, to educate the general public with an open access website with educational material, publication of proceeding in the PASPCR Newsletter and publication of the abstracts and programs in the Journal Pigment Cell and Melanoma Research, and to facilitate and strengthen more collaboration between pigment interest groups and other research groups that can broaden and further integrate the basic and clinical research.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: NARRATIVE The 2009 meeting of the PanAmerican Society for Pigment Cell Research and suggestively entitled ""The Pigmentary System: Securing a Place Under the Sun"" will be held in Memphis, TN to update investigators on the most novel basic and clinical findings in the pigmentary system. It will provide a forum for basic researchers and clinicians to meet and share data on the complex field of skin and eye pigmentation with its wider implications in human health, environmental effects of solar radiation and racial diversity. We expect to achieve a better understanding of the process at molecular, cellular and entire organism levels that might lead to more effective treatments for pigmentary disorders ranging from rare genetic abnormalities to autoimmune disorders and skin malignancies. Recent advances in pigment cell biology interfacing with other areas such as dermatology, basic biology, neurobiology, endocrinology, immunology, photobiology, ophthalmology, pathology, biochemistry, chemistry, physics and cancer research will be presented. Importantly, realizing that pigmentation is also the basis for racial discrimination with an impact for the individual well being and for the society as a whole, the PASPCR opens the necessary space for discussion on health and social issues. It is expected that new avenues in pigment cells research will be discussed and future directions proposed to place this field on the forefront of basic and life sciences.

"Sickle Cell Disease Research Center (SCDRC) Summer Institute/Mentoring Program    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):      The mission of the Sickle Cell Disease Research Center (SCDRC) is to ""actively and aggressively participate in the substantive development of basic research and training efforts to improve treatment options or cure sickle cell disease"". The SIPID funding initiative is relevant to the mission of the SCDRC project because it will utilize a multidisciplinary approach to increase underrepresented minorities in Biomedical Research related to heart, lung, and blood disease. The program will fund summer institutes to enable 10-12 participants from underrepresented racial and ethnic groups to further develop their research skills and knowledge, thereby enhancing their career development as faculty members or scientists. The summer institute will focus on genomic-based biomedical research related to sickle cell disease (SCD): to introduce multidisciplinary approaches to genomic research and establish a broad base working knowledge of current technological advances and identify potential areas of future research projects involving modern DMA and protein analytical tools. This will be accomplished through classroom didactic lectures and hands-on bench training in laboratory settings. Our goals will include: increasing the number of racial and ethical underserved individuals who enter research careers by establishing a structured mentored training program and long-term research collaborations between mentors and mentees; increasing grantsmanship skills of participants; and identifying extramural research funding opportunities. Diversity of scientific and scholarly activity will be valuable in improving the public health of patients and subjects from diverse backgrounds. Studies have suggested that a racially concordant scientific staff is more successful in recruiting individuals from minority groups into clinical studies. Racially similar physician-patient dyads have been shown to be related to greater patient satisfaction in ways that may also enhance communication and participation in a clinical research setting. The need for a diverse workforce permeates all aspects of the nation's public health-related research efforts. Because minorities suffer a disproportionate burden of morbidity and mortality associated with HLBS disorders, there is a critical need to increase the number of investigators conducting research on health disparities in HLBS disorders, such as sickle cell disease.      (End of Abstract)           ",Sickle Cell Disease Research Center (SCDRC) Summer Institute/Mentoring Program,7642330,R25HL085070,"['Educational Curriculum ', ' Curriculum ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Continuing Education ', ' Continuance of education ', ' Environment ', ' Address ', ' Equilibrium ', ' balance function ', ' balance ', ' Ethics ', ' ethical ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Doctor of Philosophy ', ' PhD ', ' Ph.D. ', ' Research Training ', ' Extramural Activities ', ' Extramural ', ' EXTMR ', ' Funding Opportunities ', ' Underrepresented Minority ', ' underserved minority ', ' under-represented minority ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Faculty ', ' Fellowship ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Gene Expression Regulation ', ' Gene Regulation Process ', ' Gene Regulation ', ' Gene Action Regulation ', ' Globin ', ' p-Globin ', ' base ', ' career ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' improved ', ' Hand ', ' Heart ', ' Hematological Disease ', ' blood disorder ', ' Hematological Disorder ', ' Hematologic Diseases ', ' Blood Diseases ', ' National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute ', ' NHLBI ', ' National Human Genome Research Institute ', ' National Center for Human Genome Research ', ' NHGRI ', ' Area ', ' Surface ', ' Institutes ', ' Ensure ', ' Training ', ' Sickle Cell ', ' sickle red blood cell ', ' sickle erythrocyte ', ' sickle RBC ', ' drepanocyte ', ' teacher ', ' Joints ', ' Articulation ', ' Laboratories ', ' Individual ', ' Lung ', ' pulmonary ', ' Lung Respiratory System ', ' Fostering ', ' Funding ', ' Americas ', ' American Indians ', ' American Indian ', ' Mentors ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' Mission ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Mortality ', ' Collaborations ', ' Sickle Cell Anemia ', ' sicklemia ', ' sickle disease ', ' sickle cell disease ', ' Hemoglobin sickle cell disorder ', ' Hemoglobin sickle cell disease ', ' Hemoglobin S Disease ', ' HbSS disease ', ' Hb SS disease ', ' Client satisfaction ', ' Patient Satisfaction ', ' Patients ', ' physical science ', ' Physicians ', ' Proteins ', ' gene product ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' Public Sector ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' recruit ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Schools ', ' Science ', ' Scientific Societies ', ' Research Priority ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' lectures ', ' programs ', ' Stress ', ' Students ', ' Texas ', ' Scientist ', ' Training Programs ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Writing ', ' Award ', ' Behavioral Sciences ', ' Severity of illness ', ' disease severity ', ' interest ', ' Visit ', ' Biology ', ' Biomedical Research ', ' Gray unit of radiation dose ', ' Gray ', ' meetings ', ' college ', ' collegiate ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' success ', ' Structure ', ' skills ', ' Participant ', ' member ', ' Basic Science ', ' Basic Research ', ' Reporting ', ' Cell membrane ', ' plasmalemma ', ' Plasma Membrane ', ' Cytoplasmic Membrane ', ' Chemistry ', ' Sleep Disorders ', ' sleep problem ', ' abstracting ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Hispanics ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' career development ', ' Proteomics ', ' Genomics ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Communication ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' analytical tool ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' racial/ethnic ', ' interdisciplinary approach ', ' multidisciplinary approach ', ' genome-wide ', ' genomewide ', ' ']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS DALLAS,R25,2009,307556,0.05533122027248915
"Asymmetric CD8+ T Cell Division in the Initiation of Immunity    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): CD8+ T cells play a critical role in host defense against microbes pertinent to biodefense. A hallmark of adaptive immunity against agents such as Listeria monocytogenes, LCMV virus, and Toxoplasma gondii is heterogeneity of cell fate among antigen-experienced CD8+ T cells. Substantial preliminary evidence outlined in this proposal indicates that the first division of a CD8+ T cell responding to a pathogen, in vivo, is characterized by unequal partitioning of proteins with established roles in signaling, cell fate specification, and asymmetric cell division. In addition, the first daughter T cells of the immune response appear to be differentially fated as precursors of the effector and memory lineages. This project will test whether asymmetric cell division is a general feature of the CD8+ T cell response against pathogens, whether ancestral regulators of cell polarity are responsible for establishing cytoskeletal features necessary for asymmetric division, and how asymmetrically inherited signaling proteins could mediate fate disparity in daughter T cells. These studies should provide a framework for rational engineering of immune responses and vaccines against agents of biodefense, and address fundamental uncertainties regarding the principle of clonal selection of lymphocytes in response to infectious diseases.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Specialized white blood cells, called lymphocytes, increase in number to help protect us against infections. This project will provide fundamental insight into how immunity against re-infection is maintained for one's entire life.

"Arts, Research, T-cells & Socio-demographics (ARTS) in the Niagara Region DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The disproportionately lower number of minority and low income individuals participating in clinical and prevention research has a significant impact on the representativeness of scientific outcomes and result in social and clinical injustices. Roswell Park Cancer Institute (RPCI) and Niagara Falls community members are creating power-neutral collaborations to meet the needs of vulnerable communities in order to reduce cancer disparities and improve cancer research. The proposed ?ARTS? (Arts, Research, T-cells & Sociodemographics) study creates a collaborative opportunity linking a diverse, relatively low income population with an NCI Comprehensive Cancer Center to test the feasibility of studying the relationship among various contributing factors (e.g., socio-demographics, including poverty and race/ethnicity) to health disparities (e.g., immune function, risks for cancer). The goal of this study is to investigate strategies to engage residents in the Niagara Falls region with scientists at RPCI to increase mutual understanding of each other and participation in cancer prevention research, and to obtain pilot data on variations in Treg cell levels. The following Specific Aims are proposed to achieve this goal: Aim 1. Investigate the feasibility of educating and recruiting Niagara Falls residents to cancer prevention studies through creative community-based methods and interventions within the Niagara Arts & Cultural Center (NACC) as measured through attendance, surveys and study participation. Aim 2. Investigate the technical feasibility of epidemiological survey collection, biological specimen collection, and performing regulatory T Cell assays through community-based interventional methods. Aim 3. Develop a meaningful and appropriate framework and best methods for sharing findings from social and biological data among all academic and community partners and participants. Through educational recruitment programs based at the NACC, demographics, affective measures (e.g., the feeling people associate with the idea of research), and intent to participate, will be collected using a community-friendly audience response system (ARS). Individuals may choose to participate at various levels, and those selecting to donate blood will allow us to obtain pilot data about how certain lifestyle (e.g., smoking, exercise, diet) and demographic factors (e.g., income, neighborhood, race/ethnicity) are related to important aspects of the immune system in healthy residents as measured by Treg cells (cells that can prevent the immune system from protecting the body). It is expected that process and outcome results from this feasibility study will provide pilot data for research questions related to: 1) the role of affectively-based decision making factors on research participation; 2) heterogeneity of immunological indicators in relationship to socio-demographic, environmental, and behavioral variables; 3) the effectiveness of linking medical research education and recruitment with a community group focused on the arts; and 4) the technical accommodations necessary for a research institution and community partners to recruit, accrue, and analyze measures related to cancer research.

"Systemic Innate Immune Responses in Secondary Syphilis    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Venereal syphilis is a sexually transmitted disease caused by the spirochetal pathogen, Treponema pallidum. The disease remains uncontrolled, particularly in resource-scarce regions where testing, treatment and proper follow-up are not always accessible. Syphilis is characterized by the appearance of a local ulcer at the site of initial infection to an array of chronic systemic inflammatory manifestations that when left untreated, can cause severe complications and even death. The inability to culture the bacterium has hampered efforts to fully understand its pathogenesis, particularly why the spirochete is able to evade the immune system. The research proposed here is thus designed to better characterize the nature this immune response as it occurs in human syphilis. The systemic cellular innate immune response in secondary syphilis patients will be the focus of the current proposal. We hypothesize that in secondary syphilis, the presence of T. pallidum in the blood directly activates circulating monocytes and dendritic cells. To do so, in Specific Aim 1 we will first confirm that spirochetal DNA is present in blood from secondary syphilis patients using a novel Real Time Quantitative PCR method and in Specific Aim 2 we will characterize T. pallidum driven immune responses in circulating monocytes and dendritic cells by using multiparameter four color flow cytometry and `real time' PCR (RT-PCR) to quantify their pro- inflammatory cytokine gene expression signals. Complementary ex vivo studies, are structured to identify the effect of the bacterium on specific components of innate and adaptive immune cells. From these two parallel lines of research, we will obtain a more mechanistic understanding of the pathogenesis of syphilis, which can be further developed along cellular and molecular lines and ultimately facilitate development of a vaccine. In concert with the Fogarty International Center's mission to reduce health disparities amongst nations, the planned activities will also: (1) support collaborative syphilis immunobiology research between the USPI and the FC in Cali, Colombia; (2) strengthen the foreign institute's (CIDEIM), research capabilities and technical base; (3) foster sustained and productive research between two US based institutions (UCHC and CCMC) and CIDEIM; and (4) provide needed epidemiological data about venereal syphilis for that region of Colombia.           ",Systemic Innate Immune Responses in Secondary Syphilis,7753673,R03TW008023,"['Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Dendritic Cells ', ' Veiled Cells ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Institution ', ' DNA ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' Cytokine Gene ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Data ', ' Immunobiology ', ' Immunophysiology ', ' Principal Investigator ', ' Molecular ', ' follow-up ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' Flow Cytometry ', ' flow cytophotometry ', ' Flow Microfluorometry ', ' Flow Microfluorimetry ', ' Flow Cytofluorometry ', ' Flow Cytofluorometries ', ' Gene Expression ', ' base ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Man (Taxonomy) ', ' Left ', ' Site ', ' Chronic ', ' Immune system ', ' allergic/immunologic organ system ', ' allergic/immunologic body system ', ' Infection ', ' Institutes ', ' Fostering ', ' Methods ', ' Mission ', ' monocyte ', ' Marrow monocyte ', ' Blood monocyte ', ' Names ', ' Immune response ', ' immunoresponse ', ' host response ', ' Patients ', ' Inflammatory ', ' Nature ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Sexually Transmitted Diseases ', ' Venereal Infections ', ' Venereal Disorders ', ' Venereal Diseases ', ' Sexually Transmitted Infection ', ' Sexually Transmitted Disorder ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' programs ', ' Order Spirochaetales ', ' Spirochetes ', ' Spirochaetales ', ' Syphilis ', ' great pox ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Treponema pallidum ', ' T.pallidum ', ' T. pallidum ', ' Ulcer ', ' Ulceration ', ' Immune ', ' Bacteria ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' vaccine development ', ' development of a vaccine ', ' develop a vaccine ', ' international center ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Pathogenesis ', ' Appearance ', ' Cells ', ' Colombia ', ' Color ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' pathogen ', ' ']",FIC,CONNECTICUT CHILDREN'S MEDICAL CENTER,R03,2010,25380,0.0904501249783663
"Polymorphism and mutation spectrum in minorities with non-small cell lung cancer    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application addresses broad Challenge Area (09) Health Disparities and Specific Challenge Topic, 09-CA- 104: Basic cancer research in cancer health disparities. Title: Polymorphism and mutation spectrum in minorities with non-small cell lung cancer Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer related deaths in the United States. Despite similar risk factors, African-Americans have higher incidence and mortality rates from lung cancer than other populations. Numerous studies have recently demonstrated that both inherited and acquired genetic lesions have a significant impact on both the risk of developing lung cancer and the outcomes and efficacy of targeted therapies. For example, the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling pathway is important in the development, progression, and invasion of non-small cell lung cancer. Ethnic differences in polymorphisms and acquired mutations in the EGFR and its downstream targets have been definitively proven to exist. It is well established that mutations in the tyrosine kinase domain are more frequent in Asian populations as compared to Caucasian population residing in western countries. These mutations confer better overall prognosis and predict response to the tyrosine kinase inhibitors, erlotinib and gefitinib; however, very little data is available regarding the prevalence of these mutations in the dominant U.S. racial minorities. In another important pathway, KRAS, mutations are present in 20-30% of patients with non-small cell lung cancer. Mutated KRAS is associated with poor prognosis and resistance to the monoclonal EGFR antibody, cetuximab as well as the EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors erlotinib and gefitinib. Notably, the prevalence of KRAS and somatic EGFR mutations in African-Americans is unknown. Recently, genome wide association studies identified a single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) variation in the nicotinic receptor which correlated with an increase in genetic susceptibility to non small cell lung cancer. Increased frequency of SNP variability may be one factor that contributes to the increased incidence of non-small cell lung cancer in African-Americans, but the frequency of these in this population is undefined. Thus efforts to better understand the molecular basis for disease susceptibility, incidence, progression, prognosis, and response to biologic agents among the common U.S. racial and ethnic minorities are needed. The Comprehensive Meharry/Vanderbilt-Ingram Cancer Center Research Partnership conducts research to address the disproportional cancer incidence, morbidity, and mortality in under-represented minorities. A dual institution study to review documented cases of non-small cell lung cancers in African-Americans to determine the frequency of germ line polymorphisms, somatic EGFR mutations, and KRAS mutations is proposed. The clinical significance of a SNP in the nicotinic receptor in African-Americans will be determined by comparing known lung cancer patients with age matched controls identified through the Southern Community Cohort Study. Medical records of patients diagnosed with non-small cell lung cancer will be reviewed. Gene sequencing will identify the prevalence of EGFR mutations and KRAS mutations. The frequency of these mutations will be analyzed as independent variables to determine the clinical significance when compared to known risk factors such as smoking. The goal of this study is to determine the impact of perturbations in the EGFR pathway on genetic susceptibility, disease progression, and outcome in African-Americans with nonsmall cell lung cancer. A study of this nature has never been performed. The results should provide tremendous insight into the genomic factors which influence susceptibility, pathogenesis, drug sensitivity, and survival in African-Americans with non-small cell lung cancer.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer related deaths in the United States.

"Sex Chromosomes and Gender Disparity in HBV-Related Hepatocellular Carcinoma    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a significant and deadly cancer in the world. Chronic hepatitis virus infection is the most significant risk factor for HCC development, especially among populations in Asia, Africa and the Amazon Basin. Importantly, there is a significant sex disparity among the HCC patients infected with hepatitis B virus (HBV) with male to female ratio as high as 6:1, depending on geographical locations. Currently, the exact etiology of such male dominance in the disease is uncertain. Recent studies suggest that the expression of the viral oncogene, HBx, on HBV genome is regulated by androgen, the male hormone, and androgen receptor (AR). HBx, in term, can activate AR, thereby generating a positive feedback loop for its own expression and oncogenic functions. Studies of another oncogene on the Y chromosome, testis-specific protein Y encoded (TSPY), suggest that TSPY serves as a co-activator for AR transactivation and stabilizer for HBx protein and could exert significant male dominant effects on HBx expression and oncogenesis. TSPY has specialized as a male germ cell factor involved in stem cell proliferation and meiotic division, but functions as an oncogene when ectopically expressed in incompatible somatic cells. Interesting, there is a X-homologue of TSPY, TSPX, which possesses contrasting properties and acts as a tumor suppressor. TSPX co-represses AR transactivation and binds but promotes HBx proteasomal degradation. After it diverged with TSPY, TSPX maintains the housekeeping functions in modulating proper cell cycle progression, promoting viral protein degradation and repressing viral gene expression. TSPY disrupts TSPX functions, and promotes viral oncogenesis in populations chronically infected with HBV. TSPY could exacerbate HBx oncogenic functions by exaggerating the AR transactivation of HBx gene and maintaining HBx protein stability. In this exploratory project, we plan to address the roles of TSPY and TSPX in HBx protein stability and modulation AR transactivation. First, we will elucidate the mechanisms involved in TSPX promotion of HBx degradation in the ubiquitin dependent and independent pathways. We will define the domains responsible for TSPY and TSPX interactions with and modulation of HBx proteasomal degradation. We will examine the postulation that the domains in TSPX, which are absent in TSPY, could serve tethering and enhancer functions between HBx and the proteasomal machinery. Second, we plan to evaluate three putative androgen response elements (AREs) at the distal Enhancer I position upstream of the HBx gene promoter in the AR transactivation by confirming TSPX and TSPY interactions with AR and delineating the critical domains important for TSPY and TSPX co- activation and co-repression respectively with AR on HBx transactivation. We will examine TSPY functions on HBx promoter activities. Understanding how TSPY disrupts TSPX functions and exacerbates HBx expression and protein stability will shed critical insights on the potential contributions of this pair of homologous oncogene and tumor suppressor gene in the pathogenesis of male dominance in HBV-related hepatocarcinogenesis.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Hepatocellular carcinoma is a prevalent and deadly liver cancer in the world, particularly among populations chronically infected with hepatitis viruses. Significantly, there is a critical gender disparity favoring men among hepatocellular carcinoma patients infected with hepatitis B virus. The reason for such male preference in the disease process is unknown. Recent studies have identified an oncogene (cancer gene), designated as TSPY on the human Y (male-only) chromosome that affects the expression and protein stability of the hepatitis B viral cancer gene, called HBx. Importantly, there is a homologue of TSPY, designated as TSPX, on the X chromosome, which possesses contrasting properties on HBx, and functions as a tumor suppressor.

"Mechanisms of Feline Lentivirus Control and Interference    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Though transmission of indigenous African monkey lentiviruses to humans or to Asian macaques has resulted pathogenic consequences for the new host, it is becoming increasingly clear that pathogenic cross- species lentiviral infection is an exceptional occurrence. Recent studies indicate innate cellular restriction factors are key to limiting such infections, and that lentiviral adaptation to a new host requires alterations in accessory gene structure, i.e., viral infectivity factor (Vif). To study this issue, we developed a feline model of cross-species lentiviral transmission that results in productive, yet regressive, avirulent infection, and have determined that such infection attenuates subsequent virulent feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) challenge. Data published during the initial grant cycle demonstrate that innate cellular responses, namely cytokine expression profiles and cytidine deaminase-like (CD) activity resulting in high viral error burden, are more significant for host viral control than adaptive immune responses-which follow rather than precede viral down regulation. Moreover, virulent FIV-C-PG disease attenuation (i.e. protection from CD4+ T cell depletion and modulation of viral set point) in cats infected with avirulent puma lentivirus (PLV-1695), is associated with unique FIV molecular evolution, and maintenance of a proinflammatory cytokine profile vs. cats infected with virulent FIV-C-PG alone-and disease modulation occurs despite disparities in receptor use and target cell distribution between FIV and PLV. Here we propose to advance this unique feline model to address important questions in lentivirus biology: (a) How does host innate activity (defined by CD-like hypermutation and cytokine cell-signaling) relate to attenuation of disease? and (b) What role does Vif play in modulating virulent lentiviral challenge? To answer these questions, we propose: (1) To determine whether previous PLV-1695 infection enhances hypermutation, error burden, and tissue-specific cytidine deaminase activity/cytokine expression after FIV-C-PG challenge; and, (2) To determine whether Vif modulates CD activity and cytokine activation as a mechanism of attenuation. These experiments pose a new paradigm for assessment of protective immunity against HIV/AIDS-namely, that enhancement of early innate immune parameters by exposure to an avirulent, non-adapted lentivirus can provide cross-protective activity against a virulent, host-adapted lentivirus, and as such, these studies are of great public health significance.           ",Mechanisms of Feline Lentivirus Control and Interference,7813920,R01HL092791,"['Maintenance ', ' Monkeys ', ' Published Comment ', ' Viewpoint ', ' Editorial Comment ', ' Commentary ', ' Comment ', ' Molecular Evolution ', ' progesterone 11-hemisuccinate-(2-iodohistamine) ', ' his-PG ', ' therapeutic vaccine ', ' Immune response ', ' immunoresponse ', ' host response ', ' Genetic ', ' Play ', ' Family Felidae ', ' feline ', ' Felids ', ' Felidae ', ' Exposure to ', ' Attenuated ', ' Inflammatory ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' Publishing ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' programs ', ' Viral Load result ', ' Viral Load ', ' Viral Burden ', ' CD4 Positive T Lymphocytes ', ' helper T cell ', ' T4 Lymphocytes ', ' T4 Cells ', ' CD4-Positive Lymphocytes ', ' CD4+ T-Lymphocyte ', ' CD4+ T cell ', ' CD4 lymphocyte ', ' CD4 T cells ', ' CD4 Cells ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Virulence ', ' Virus Diseases ', ' virus-induced disease ', ' virus infection ', ' viral infection ', ' Viral Diseases ', ' Virus Replication ', ' virus multiplication ', ' Virus ', ' General Viruses ', ' Immune ', ' System ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' Viral ', ' Biology ', ' receptor ', ' Receptor Protein ', ' Animal Model ', ' model organism ', ' Animal Models and Related Studies ', ' attenuation ', ' virus host interaction ', ' T-Cell Depletion ', ' research study ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' AIDS/HIV problem ', ' HIV/AIDS problem ', ' HIV/AIDS ', ' AIDS/HIV ', ' Felis catus ', ' Felis sylvestris catus ', ' Felis domesticus ', ' Felis domestica ', ' Feline Species ', ' Domestic Cats ', ' Cats Mammals ', ' Cats ', ' Cells ', ' Asians ', ' oriental ', ' cytokine ', ' Feline Immunodeficiency Virus ', ' Feline T-Lymphotropic Virus ', ' Feline T-Lymphotropic Lentivirus ', ' FTLV ', ' FIV ', ' Lentivirus Infections ', ' Lentivirus disease ', ' Relative (related person) ', ' Relative ', ' Infection Control ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Puma Lentivirus ', ' novel therapeutics ', ' next generation therapeutics ', ' new therapeutics ', ' Cytidine Deaminase ', ' Cytidine Aminohydrolase ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Down-Regulation ', ' Downregulation ', ' Down-Regulation (Physiology) ', ' Elements ', ' Address ', ' Cytokine Activation ', ' Data ', ' Indigenous ', ' Molecular Profiling ', ' molecular signature ', ' molecuar profile ', ' Molecular Fingerprinting ', ' Expression Signature ', ' Expression Profiling ', ' in vivo ', ' Gene Structure ', ' Gene Structure/Organization ', ' Gene Organization ', ' Virulent ', ' transmission process ', ' Transmission ', ' trend ', ' Family ', ' Genome ', ' Age ', ' base ', ' Grant ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Man (Taxonomy) ', ' Site ', ' Subfamily lentivirinae ', ' Virus-Lenti ', ' Lentivirus ', ' Lentivirinae ', ' Feline Lentiviruses ', ' Immune system ', ' allergic/immunologic organ system ', ' allergic/immunologic body system ', ' Immunity ', ' Natural Immunity ', ' Non-Specific Immunity ', ' Native Immunity ', ' Innate Immunity ', ' In Vitro ', ' Infection ', ' African ', ' Macaca ', ' Macaque ', ' ']",NHLBI,COLORADO STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2010,496484,0.0714572180334774
"The Role of Protease-Activated Receptors in the Regulation of eNOS    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The objective of this study is to explore the signal transduction mechanism by which protease-activated receptors (PARs) regulate endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) phoshorylation and activation in endothelial cells. Proteases play very important roles in endothelial physiology and pathophysiology through activation of PARs. Their functions include regulations of endothelium-dependent contraction/relaxation, endothelial permeability/barrier function, leukocyte adhesion, angiogenesis, endothelial cell migration and proliferation. Thus, PARs are very likely to be involved in the development of cardiovascular diseases. However, the detailed molecular mechanisms by which PARs regulate these functions remain largely unclear. PAR1 and PAR2 are believed to play major roles in endothelial cell function. Recent studies revealed multiple heterotrimeric G protein-coupling (Gq, Gi, G12/13) and several downstream signaling cascades of PAR1 in endothelial cells and other cells. By contrast, much less is known regarding PAR2 signal transduction in endothelial cells, which mainly couples to Gq. Our goal is to study the specific signal transduction pathways utilized by PARs including heterotrimeric G protein- coupling together with the structure-activity relationship of PARs during coupling and their roles in mediating downstream signals that regulate eNOS. We hypothesize that PAR1 and PAR2 reciprocally regulate eNOS through distinct signaling pathways and have proposed the following specific aims to address this hypothesis. We plan: 1. To demonstrate that a distinct receptor C-tail structure associated with distinct G protein-coupling is required for reciprocal eNOS phosphorylation by PARs. 2. To identify eNOS kinases that reciprocally regulate eNOS activity in response to distinct PARs. 3. To identify the distinct PAR C-tail associated proteins that are responsible for reciprocal eNOS regulation. Cultured endothelial cells will be used to detect phosphorylation of eNOS. Kinase assays, site mutations, and novel proteomic approaches will be used to identify other proteins involved in the reciprocal phosphorylation of eNOS. The results of this study will be valuable in developing specific-acting therapeutic drugs that can be used to treat endothelial dysfunctions that lead to cardiovascular diseases. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project is relevant to public health because of its importance in understanding some of the possible causes of cardiovascular disease, the number one killer in America, especially among the African American community. It will provide information regarding the role of protease-activated receptors in the regulation of the endothelium, which plays an important role in vascular tone. Endothelial dysfunction is a major cause of hypertension, and these studies will contribute to the development of treatment strategies to alleviate or prevent cardiovascular disease.

"Role of Mitochondrial Genomic Alterations in Epithelial Ovarian Tumors    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Epithelial ovarian cancer is the major cause of gynecologic cancer mortality in women in the United States. At the molecular level, both sporadic and hereditary ovarian cancer requires the accumulation of genetic changes, and these changes are characterized by a high degree of genetic alterations. Ovarian carcinoma is histopathologically classify on morphological criteria, which is the different types of epithelia in the female reproductive system, including serous, mucinous, endometrioid, clear cell, and Brenner. Epithelial ovarian tumor subtype has been further subclassified into benign, borderline and malignant to reflect their histopathology. Mitochondria are 99% inherited from the mother through the egg (oocyte) and involved in essential cellular pathways, some of which have been associated with tumorigenesis. In preliminary work, we have identified several differential mitochondrial DNA germline mutations/polymorphisms in cytoadenomas, borderline and stages (1-IV) within each of the epithelial ovarian tumor subtype and ethnic difference (Aikhionbare et al., Journal of Carcinogenesis 2007 and Diagnostic Pathology 2008). The proposed study would employ various molecular techniques, including: Random Amplified Polymorphic DNA-PCR (RAPD-PCR), High-Resolution Restriction analysis, Allelic-Specific Polymerase Chain Reaction, then followed by PCR-based DNA Sequencing and real-time RT-PCR. These techniques would be used to: 1) Identify and determine the distributions and frequencies of mitochondrial DNA mutation(s)/polymorphism(s) in three epithelial ovarian tumor subtypes (n= 300 tissue samples; serous=100, mucinous=100, endometrioid=100). 2) Determine the role of mitochondrial DNA polymorphisms/mutations among African-American and Caucasian women susceptibility to invasive epithelial ovarian tumor. This project will provide insight and more preliminary data for further study of a novel downstream target gene of mitochondria, which may ultimately facilitate the diagnosis and prognosis of the epithelial ovarian tumor subtypes and stages.   PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Mitochondria plays a role in the initiation of cells death and cancer cells growth. This project will identify and determine scientifically whether altered mitochondria gene could be associated with the different subtypes and early stages of the ovarian tumors progression, which may be involved in racial difference. Results from this aim may have significant clinical implications in the development of novel diagnostic approaches for biologically aggressive ovarian cancer from diverse racial origin.           Mitochondria plays a role in the initiation of cells death and cancer cells growth.

"Tumorigenic role of mitochondria in African-American women    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Mitochondria perform multiple cellular functions. These functions include ATP production via oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), control of cell growth, cell death, development and various metabolic pathways. OXPHOS is coupled through a series of oxido-reduction reactions catalyzed by five mitochondrial OXPHOS complexes (Complex I, II, III, IV and V). Of the 86 subunits that make up the mitochondrial OXPHOS system, mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) encodes 13 subunits. The rest are encoded by nuclear DNA (nDNA). Interestingly, studies in the past few years have described the risk of various cancers associated with polymorphism in mitochondrial OXPHOS genes. Studies show the 10398 G to A (G10398A) base substitution in the mtDNA-encoded ND3 gene (NADH dehydrogenase 3) subunit of complex I increases the risk of invasive breast cancer in African-American women (Canter et al 2005).The G to A substitution results in an amino acid change from alanine (encoded by the G allele) to threonine (encoded by the A allele). This G10398A substitution is found in 5% of the African-American population (Canter et al 2005). To understand the contribution of ND3 G10398A gene substitution associated with invasive breast cancer in African-American women, we generated a cell line completely devoid of mtDNA (mtDNA- knockout or rhoo or ?0). We used this rhoo cell line to develop a cybrid cell culture model for introducing the G10398A mtDNA variant into the isogenic nuclear background (trans-mitochondrial cybrid). We demonstrate that the G10398A variant confers increased complex I activity, resistance against cell death, and increased tumorigenicity. Based on these observations, we hypothesize that ND3 G10398A affects expression of nDNA encoded subunits of complex I, which contributes to increased complex I activity, resistance against cell death and tumorigenicity. To address the above hypothesis, we will: Aim 1: Determine G10398A-induced changes in subunit gene expression and composition of complex I. Mitochondrial complex I represents the largest and the least understood multimeric OXPHOS complex. It is composed of 45 subunits. Of these, 38 subunits are encoded by nDNA and 7 (including ND3) are encoded by mtDNA. To investigate whether increased complex I activity associated with G10398A (Kulawiec et al. 2009A) is due to increased expression of subunits, we will use a focused OXPHOS array developed in our laboratory to measure changes in the gene expression of all 45 subunits. To investigate whether alterations in complex I gene expression affect complex I composition, we will use blue native PAGE, which allows for measurement of the amounts of the respiratory complexes in their native state. Aim 2: Determine a role for NDUFA13/GRIM19 (an essential complex I regulatory subunit) in resistance to cell death and tumorigenesis. Of the 45 subunits that make up complex I, NDUFA13/GRIM19 (the gene associated with retinoid interferon induced mortality) acts as a death regulator protein (Zhang et al 2003, Lufei et al 2003) and is involved in tumorigenesis (Maximo et al 2008, Nallar et al 2008). NDUFA13/GRIM19 is also an essential component of complex I. It plays an indispensable role in the assembly and enzymatic activity of complex I (Huang et al 2004). Our study suggests that G10398A confers resistance against cell death and induces tumorigenesis (Kulawiec et al 2009). We will therefore determine whether the G10398A-associated resistance against cell death and tumorigenesis is due to changes in gene expression and/or posttranscriptional modification of GRIM19/NDUFA13. Our grant proposal addresses the two key objectives of the program announcement PAR-09-160 requesting exploratory/development grants program in basic cancer research in cancer health disparities (R21). These objectives include: 1) the development of ""new cell culture models/systems designed to investigate cancer disparities"" and 2) explores the susceptibility to breast cancer in African-American women due to ""genetic differences"" in mtDNA. The G10398A transmitochondrial cybrid system developed in our laboratory has the potential to enhance breast cancer research in the African-American population.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: In the last few years, several epidemiological studies have reported the increased risk of breast (and other) cancer associated with mtDNA polymorphisms in the African-American population. However, a mechanistic understanding of how certain mtDNA polymorphisms induce cancer is lacking. The proposed study will help determine the mechanism underlying G10398A induced tumorigenicity in African-American women. Innovative aspects of this project include the development of a G10398A transmitochondrial cybrid cell line. This cell line will serve as an important tool for the proposed studies. It will permit the mechanistic analysis of African-American polymorphic mtDNA in an isogenic nuclear background. The proposed cybrid model will pave the way to analyze the relevance of other mtDNA polymorphisms and epistatic interaction (i.e. synergy) between individual polymorphic loci within the mitochondrial genome in the African-American population. .           PROJECT NARRATIVE:  In the last few years, several epidemiological studies have reported the increased risk of breast (and other) cancer associated with mtDNA polymorphisms in the African-American population.

"Gender Differences in Experimental Aortic Aneurysms    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) comprise the 10th leading cause of death in Caucasian males 65-74 years of age and accounted for nearly 16,000 deaths overall in the year 2000. Understanding the pathophysiology of AAAs is an important undertaking. Clinically, multiple risk factors are associated with the development of AAAs, including increasing age, positive smoking history, and hypertension. Male gender is also a well-established risk factor for the development of an AAA with a 4:1 male to female ratio. The reason for this gender disparity is unknown. The pathogenesis of AAAs formation is complex and multifactorial. Histologically, AAAs are characterized by early chemokine driven leukocyte infiltration into the aortic wall with subsequent destruction of elastin and collagen in the media and adventitia by excessive local production of matrix degrading enzymes, and smooth muscle cell loss with thinning of the aortic wall. At present, there are no medical therapies available to treat patients with aortic aneurysms, using only the crude measurement of aortic diameter as a threshold for which patients must undergo life-threatening and costly surgery, either open or endovascularly. Therefore, defining the early mechanisms underlying gender-related differences in AAA formation are critical and will be the focus of the present investigation. Understanding differences in disease patterns based on gender may allow us to develop new translational approaches to the prevention and treatment of patients with aortic aneurysms. Overall hypothesis: Gender- related differences in aortic aneurysm formation are mediated by the hormonal (androgen: estrogen ratio) regulation of leukocyte trafficking into the aortic wall. Specific Aim 1. To define the mechanism by which early inflammatory cell recruitment is accelerated in males during AAA formation. Studies will test the hypothesis that increased incidence of AAAs in males is secondary to increased recruitment of leukocytes into the aortic wall driven by an excess of androgens relative to estrogens. Specific Aim 2. To demonstrate that gonadal hormones can be used to modulate the inflammatory response accompanying AAA formation. Studies will test the hypothesis that altering the androgen: estrogen environment can dictate the prevalence of aneurysm formation by altering the aforementioned specific soluble mediator dependent leukocyte trafficking, ultimately driving the balance of matrix degradation and repair toward aneurysm formation.           ",Gender Differences in Experimental Aortic

"Regulation of memory T cell responses during Ehrlichiosis    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Human monocytotropic ehrlichiosis (HME) is the most prevalent emerging tick-borne infectious disease caused by Ehrlichia chaffeensis, Gram negative obligate intracellular bacteria. The proposed studies will utilize two specific Ehrlichia strains; Ehrlichia muris, which causes persistent infection, and Ixodes ovatus Ehrlichia (IOE), which causes either lethal or sub-lethal infection, depending on the dose and route of inoculation. These models faithfully recapitulate mild and severe HME. Our studies have revealed that mice persistently infected with E. muris, but not mice that lack persistent infection or mice infected with the sub-lethal IOE infection that fails to establish persistent infection, are indeed protected against heterologous re-challenge with ordinarily lethal dose of IOE. Heterologous protection is mediated primarily by CD4+ type-1 memory responses and antigen specific IgG antibody response, while fatal primary and secondary ehrlichiosis is due to an extensive tissue injury mediated by Ehrlichia specific CD8+ T cells. Our preliminary data reveal that persistent E. muris infection is associated with substantial expansion of T regulatory cells, increased TGF-beta production in the spleens, and absence of immune mediated pathology following infection with IOE. These data indicate that we lack the fundamental understanding of the regulatory mechanisms that control the induction and maintenance of protective T cell memory and prevent the development of immunopathology upon secondary challenge, which is a prerequisite to developing an effective vaccine against HME. We will address this specific gap in our knowledge in the following two specific aims. In specific aim 1, we will determine the magnitude, phenotype, and function of memory T cells maintained in the presence or absence of persistent ehrlichial infection in C57BL/6 mice. Specific aim 2 will determine the role of T regulatory cells and TGF-beta in the persistence of ehrlichial infections, prevention of organ injury, and maintenance of protective memory T cell responses. The experiments utilize state-of-the art techniques such as multiparamter flow cytometry. Our study is significant as it address the strong need for balancing protective immunity and immunopathology in designing effective vaccination strategies. Knowledge generated therein will benefit vaccine development efforts not only against Ehrlichia but also, against other intracellular pathogens that are controlled by cell mediated immunity, which will significantly have major health impact.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Human monocytic ehrlichiosis is a major public health problem in many parts of the United States, due in part to the lack of a vaccine and inadequate therapy. The development of a vaccine for HME is lacking due to limited understanding of how to stimulate the memory T cells required for vaccine induced immunity. This proposal will determine how memory T cells are generated, maintained and regulated using a unique experimental animal model of the disease. The results from these experiments will provide a solid foundation of knowledge for the timely development of an effective and safe vaccine against ehrlichiosis.              Narrative: Human monocytic ehrlichiosis is a major public health problem in many parts of the United States, due in part to the lack of a vaccine and inadequate therapy.

"Asymmetric CD8+ T Cell Division in the Initiation of Immunity    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): CD8+ T cells play a critical role in host defense against microbes pertinent to biodefense. A hallmark of adaptive immunity against agents such as Listeria monocytogenes, LCMV virus, and Toxoplasma gondii is heterogeneity of cell fate among antigen-experienced CD8+ T cells. Substantial preliminary evidence outlined in this proposal indicates that the first division of a CD8+ T cell responding to a pathogen, in vivo, is characterized by unequal partitioning of proteins with established roles in signaling, cell fate specification, and asymmetric cell division. In addition, the first daughter T cells of the immune response appear to be differentially fated as precursors of the effector and memory lineages. This project will test whether asymmetric cell division is a general feature of the CD8+ T cell response against pathogens, whether ancestral regulators of cell polarity are responsible for establishing cytoskeletal features necessary for asymmetric division, and how asymmetrically inherited signaling proteins could mediate fate disparity in daughter T cells. These studies should provide a framework for rational engineering of immune responses and vaccines against agents of biodefense, and address fundamental uncertainties regarding the principle of clonal selection of lymphocytes in response to infectious diseases.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Specialized white blood cells, called lymphocytes, increase in number to help protect us against infections. This project will provide fundamental insight into how immunity against re-infection is maintained for one's entire life.

"NCMHD Southeastern Exploratory Sickle Cell Center of Excellence    DESCRIPTION: Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a genetic disorder of hemoglobin and afflicts ~110,000 African-Americans in the US. Because of its complex pathophysiology through chronic hemolytic anemia, microvascularocclusion, and a chronic inflammatory state, it affects multiple organ systems and leads to significant morbidity and organ damage as well as leads to frequent hospitalizations and health care encounters. During the past 35 years, primarily through research and patient care conducted by the NIH funded Comprehensive Sickle Cell Centers and some pivotal clinical trials, the life expectancy of patients with SCD has increased from the teens to mid- to late forties. This is still considerably shorter than that of African-Americans who do not have sickle cell disease and can be viewed as a major disparity even in this underserved minority population. While significant advances have been made in the understanding of the disease pathophysiology and in novel therapies through basic and translational research, these advances have been slow to be taken to clinical practice. The Southeastern Exploratory Sickle Cell Center of Excellence seeks to improve the care and quality of life of the SCD patient population by i) investigating the basic mechanism of action of a highly successful and effective hemoglobin F inducing drug, hydroxyurea, ii) identifying genetic variations underlying the frequency of pain, response to narcotics, and thus addressing the important issue of biologic/genetic bases of pain and its under treatment leading to the stigmatization of many SCD patients and its resulting disparity, iii) investigating the medical, social, and economic reasons for underutilization of hydroxyurea in SCD, iv) training primary care physicians with evidence based medicine in the care of patients with SCD, given the sobering reality that there will not be enough specialists in non-malignant hematology to meet the needs of the growing adult SCD population, and v) implementing innovative methods and concepts for the care of SCD patients in the ED and for transitioning from pediatric to adult care. Relieving the health disparity of SCD patients is the primary goal of this application.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Sickle cell disease in the United States primarily affects African-Americans and is considered an orphan disease. Because of the lack of knowledge of health care providers in the management and treatment of painful episodes and other complications of this disease, patients are most often undertreated or not treated at all, which has created an enormous health disparity for these patients.",NCMHD Southeastern Exploratory Sickle Cell Center of Excellence,7849069,P20MD003383,[''],NIMHD,AUGUSTA UNIVERSITY,P20,2010,2085530,0.04988924315436819
"Live Cell Imaging Confocal Microscope System    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Meharry Medical College investigators and their trainees have an immediate need for a confocal microscope capable of high speed as well as long-term imaging to capture dynamic processes occurring within living cells. These studies include examining interactions between fluorescently tagged individual molecules as well as examining native and regulated trafficking of one or several simultaneously labeled molecules from one intracellular compartment to another. The studies proposed use state of the art technologies introduced over the last several years (FRET, FLIP, FRAP, etc.) which are still evolving, as well as novel fluorescent probes that can be photoactivated or photoconverted in discrete regions within cells, and monitored over time. No equipment with the required features for addressing the hypotheses of our faculty members' peer-reviewed and funded studies exists on campus. To meet the needs of our investigators and their trainees, we are proposing purchase of the Nikon A1R confocal microscope for installation in our Morphology Core Facility, which is under the leadership of the PI, Dr. J. Shawn Goodwin, who is experienced in all of the proposed technologies and participates in their refinement nationally. Meharry's investigators focus on health disparities research in the areas of Women's Health (including cardiovascular diseases), HIV/AIDS, Cancer, and Brain and Behavior. Though our investigators can obtain pilot data on similar instrumentation at Vanderbilt University Medical Center, also in Nashville, Vanderbilt too lacks an instrument capable of both high resolution point scanning as well as high-speed, resonant scanning with an integrated perfect focus system. All of which are provided by the Nikon A1R confocal microscope. Furthermore, we have learned that routinely engaging in live cell imaging studies in an off campus setting is not conducive to the productivity of our faculty and their research programs, particularly in studies using freshly isolated or primary cultures derived from precious biological specimens under the purview of IACUC or IRB oversight. Equally importantly, the availability of this critical technology on campus is crucial for the mission of our institution to train the next generation of outstanding minority investigators in biomedical sciences. The long-range goal of the Morphology Core in which the Nikon A1R will be housed is to provide technical expertise and state-of-the-art instrumentation to enhance the productivity of Meharry's faculty investigators; in the pursuit of the mission of the Core and of the College, obtaining the Nikon A1R will benefit in a transformative fashion the peer-reviewed and funded research of the Major and Minor Users and the scientific development of their trainees.          ",Live Cell Imaging Confocal Microscope System,7795474,S10RR025497,"['IACUC ', ' Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Institution ', ' Address ', ' Equipment ', ' Core Facility ', ' Data ', ' Resolution ', ' Monitor ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' cellular imaging ', ' cell imaging ', ' Faculty ', ' Fluorescent Probes ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' Goals ', ' Label ', ' Microscope ', ' Housing ', ' Area ', ' Biological ', ' instrumentation ', ' Training ', ' Leadership ', ' Learning ', ' Individual ', ' Funding ', ' Minor ', ' Mission ', ' Peer Review ', ' Morphology ', ' Productivity ', ' instrument ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' medical schools ', ' school of medicine ', ' medical college ', ' Science ', ' Specimen ', ' Research Specimen ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Arts ', ' Technology ', ' Time ', ' Scanning ', ' System ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' meetings ', ' college ', ' collegiate ', ' experience ', ' Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer ', ' FRET ', ' trafficking ', ' Speed (motion) ', ' Speed ', ' novel ', ' member ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' AIDS/HIV problem ', ' HIV/AIDS problem ', ' HIV/AIDS ', ' AIDS/HIV ', ' Cells ', ' Technical Expertise ', "" Women's Health "", ' Female Health ', ' Research Ethics Committees ', ' Academic Medical Centers ', ' University Medical Centers ', ' next generation ', ' Minority ', ' brain behavior ', ' ']",NCRR,MEHARRY MEDICAL COLLEGE,S10,2010,418720,0.06401140626424877
"Determining the roles(s) of HIV-1 Nef in enhancement of virion infectivity    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): HIV-1 Nef has many functions that work to enhance the pathogenicity of HIV and SIV which are important for the progression to AIDS. One such function is the enhancement of infectivity of virions that contain the Nef gene. Various investigators have shown an array of effects on virion infectivity from changes in cholesterol content of virions (a producer cell effect) to proposed effects on the process of reverse transcription (a target cell effect). Unfortunately, many of these studies have been done using different viruses and different cell systems and the conclusions have not always been directly comparable. The goal of this project will be cells, virions, and target to investigate the potential effects of Nef on producer cells in the same project. We will take advantage of several unique approaches that have been developed in our lab to study the effects of Nef in three contexts: 1. Nef expressed in producer cells, but containing mutations that prevent incorporation into virions. 2. Nef directly delivered to virions by fusion of virions with secreted Nef vesicles. 3. Nef-GFP labeled virions to allow tracking of Nef after fusion and entry. Completion of these experiments will allow us to better understand at which stages of the viral life cycle Nef can exert an effect on infectivity. A better understanding of how Nef modulates virion infectivity would provide the basis for developing therapeutics based on this mechanism. In light of the difficulties in finding an effective vaccine, a better understanding of the basic functions of Nef and other viral proteins could provide an alternative to control viral infectivity. In the past decade the search for an HIV/AIDS vaccine has been more difficult than anyone would have anticipated. To date, the production of new antiviral drugs has provided the greatest success we have had in reducing deaths due to AIDS. Therefore, it is important to continue to study basic viral replication in the effort to find new antiviral strategies. The goal of this project is to advance our understanding of how the HIV virus controls its own infectivity. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: With support from the Kirschstein fellowship, I aim to prepare ultimately for a meaningful and prolific career in academia or being an adept researcher at the National Institutes of Health or Centers for Disease Control studying minority health disparities. The research training proposed in this application will greatly facilitate achievement of this long-term goal in a number of ways.

"Reducing Urban Women's HIV Risk: Soap Opera Videos on Video Capable Cell Phones    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Reducing Urban Women's HIV Risk: Soap Opera Videos on Video-Capable Cell Phones According to the CDC, the majority (80%) of women with HIV became infected by unprotected sex with an infected male partner. Black and Latina women accounted for 82% of AIDS diagnoses in women in 2005. The purpose of this proposal is to evaluate whether a series of 12-weekly data and theory-based urban soap operas will promote a reduction in HIV sex risk behavior in young urban African American and Latina women. Toni's Story is based on content analysis of focus group discussions with the target population. By grounding stories in urban women's own experiences, via a popular medium of the soap opera, women can identify with the heroines' emotionally charged process of change, transforming their behavior through a new awareness of their value as women, of their choices, and their potential. Messages about reducing HIV sexual risk are designed to fulfill familiar relationship needs. Because trust, sexual pressure and power form the nexus of sex scripts associated with HIV sexual risk, these themes are examined through the pursuits of the various characters as sub-plots. A randomized controlled trial (RCT) with 250 high-risk women aged 18 to 29, recruited in neighborhood settings in Newark and Jersey City, will be conducted to test the effect of the video-based intervention on HIV sexual risk behavior. A control group will receive text messages with audio that stress HIV health promotion messages. The series of 12 20-minute videos to the video intervention group (n=125) and 12- weekly HIV-risk reduction text/ audio messages to the control group (n=125) will be viewed over video-capable cell phones so that women may view the videos and text messages repeatedly and in privacy. It is expected that as a result of watching the video series, the video intervention group will demonstrate greater reductions in unprotected sex from baseline to 3 and 6 months than will the control group. Further, it is expected that they will demonstrate lower sexual pressure, indicating lower stereotypical expectations to engage in unprotected sex. Secondary analyses will determine whether there are differences in these results by partner type, whether there is a reduction in the number of high risk sex partners, and whether choosing to watch the videos more frequently will relate to further reduction in risk behavior. Interviews will be conducted by audio computer assisted self-interview (ACASI). The program will track when, how often, and for how long the videos are viewed. If the aims of this proposal are achieved, the use of the cell phone to view videos could change the paradigm of how health promotion is amplified between clinic sessions. Potentially hard to reach young urban women who may be at risk for HIV, will be able to access video-based interventions on their own cell phones. The popularity of the cell phone and use of the Internet for multimedia offer a new communication channel to address health disparities in young urban women.

"Microbicide properties of RT inhibitor combinations    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Topical microbicides are an important strategy to minimize heterosexual transmission of HIV. Several single agent microbicides are in clinical trials, including one based on the nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) UC781 that we discovered as a potential microbicidal agent. However, combination microbicides may be preferable, yet only a single combination microbicide is currently under evaluation. There is also an urgent need to identify new pipeline microbicidal agents. We have found that the nucleoside RT inhibitor (NRTI) 4'-ethynyl-2-fluoro-deoxyadenosine (4'E-2FdA) provides a potent and prolonged barrier to HIV- 1 infection of cells in the subsequent absence of exogenous drug, a property previously only noted for NNRTI such as UC781. The ""memory effect"" barrier is imparted by 4'E-2FdA at drug levels orders of magnitude less than those needed for protection by the nucleotide tenofovir, currently in clinical assessment for microbicide use. We hypothesize that microbicides comprising combinations of different classes of highly potent RT inhibitors, namely the NNRTI UC781 and an NRTI such as 4'E-2FdA, will provide an optimal barrier to HIV-1 transmission. We therefore propose these Specific Aims for this R21/R33 phased innovation application: R21 Aim 1. To evaluate the in vitro (cell-based) microbicidal properties of NRTI and UC781 alone and in combination. These studies include assessment of antiviral activity and ""memory effect"" protection imparted by NRTIs and UC781 alone and in combination using primary cells (PBMCs, CD4+ T-cells, macrophages) and different HIV drug-sensitive and drug-resistant strains, isolates and clades. R21 Aim 2. To elucidate the mechanism of 4'E-2FdA (and analogs) induced protective barrier or ""memory effect"" in HIV susceptible cells. These studies include characterization of uptake, conversion to triphosphate and intracellular stability of the NRTI-TPs, as well as detailed kinetic evaluations of the NRTI substrate activity with enzymes involved in metabolism of the NRTIs. R21 Deliverables: Identification of a lead NRTI and two back-ups for use with UC781 for development as a combination microbicide. R33 Aim 1. To formulate the NRTI/NNRTI combinations selected in the R21 phase into an appropriate delivery system for vaginal topical use. NRTIs and NNRTIs have different chemical properties, thus appropriate delivery systems must be identified to enable incorporation and release of the active agents. We will prepare and evaluate both gel and rapidly dissolving film formulations for the combination microbicide. R33 Aim 2. To evaluate the anti-HIV microbicidal activity of formulated NRTI/NNRTI combinations in an ex vivo cervical explant tissue model. These studies will use a newly developed physiologically relevant polarized cervical tissue model to assess the impact of formulated microbicides alone and in combination on HIV transmission and infectivity. R33 Deliverables: Identification of an appropriate delivery formulation for the selected NRTI/NNRTI combination for entry into subsequent preclinical safety and efficacy studies. This project seeks to develop anti-HIV microbicides based on the non-nucleoside RT inhibitor UC781 in combination with novel 4'-substituted nucleosides, a combination found to provide profound and protracted protection of susceptible cells against HIV infection in vitro.

"Antigen Specific T Cell tolerance by Anti CD3 Antibodies    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Transplantation of hematopoietic stem cells from an allogeneic donor can be followed by serious graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) despite the best available regimen for immune suppression. Experimental animal data and results of clinical trials have demonstrated that T cells play a central role in GVHD. Recent advances in understanding the mechanisms of peripheral T cell tolerance have made it feasible to test the hypothesis that GVHD can be prevented in man by T cell receptor (TCR) partial agonist ligands through the selective depletion of alloreactive T cells. Transplantation tolerance is facilitated by activation-induced cell death (AICD) of peripheral T cells triggered by the specific alloantigens, and TCR signals are indispensable for induction of antigen-specific tolerance. TCR engagement can induce either T cell proliferation and differentiation or AICD. Monoclonal antibodies (mAb) to CD3, a monomorphic chain associated to the TCR complex, mimic antigen and induce TCR signaling and T cell activation. Fc receptor (FcR)-binding anti-CD3 mAbs recruit antigen-presenting cells (APC) and deliver full agonist signals that promote T cell proliferation and effector functions, independent of antigen. In contrast, non-FcR-binding anti-CD3 mAbs induce a partial agonist TCR signaling pattern causing anergy in naive T cells and AICD in antigen-activated, cycling T cells. In mice, we found that non-FcR-binding anti-CD3 mAbs induce selective depletion of donor T cells that recognize recipient alloantigens thereby preventing GVHD across MHC disparities, and spare T cell specific to third party antigens. In collaboration with J. Tso, we designed a `humanized' non-FcR-binding anti-CD3 mAb, visilizumab, which delivers a partial agonist signal to the TCR. Visilizumab is more effective than other anti-CD3 mAbs in inducing AICD of activated, cycling human T cells. Our preliminary results in human trials show that visilizumab can induce complete clinical responses in some patients with severe acute GVHD, refractory to conventional immune suppressive agents. We propose here to study efficacy of visilizumab in the prevention of GVHD after hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) from HLA incompatible donors, and assess whether its immune suppressive effects are selective for alloantigens. We will pursue the following specific aims: Aim 1: Determine the safety and efficacy of humanized non-FcR-binding anti-CD3 mAb visilizumab in preventing severe GVHD after transplantation of T-replete hematopoietic cell grafts from HLA-incompatible donors. Aim 2: Investigate whether visilizumab therapy depletes the alloreactive T cell pool, while sparing immunity to third party alloantigens, cytomegalovirus (CMV) and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), and tumor- associated antigen WT1. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The development of effective regimens for the prevention of GVHD will improve patient safety and survival after transplantation, and extend the use of this procedure to a larger number of patients. Progress in the prevention of GVHD has the potential for advancing the fields of organ transplantation and therapy for autoimmune disorders. Anti-CD3 mAbs represent the prototype of a new class of therapeutic agents that suppress the immune system by inducing an abortive activation and T cell death. What makes anti-CD3 mAbs unique and more attractive than other agents is the potential for achieving immunological tolerance rapidly and irreversibly. Showing that non-FcR-binding anti-CD3 mAbs spare T cells specific for viral and tumor-associated antigens is key to predict patient safety.          ",Antigen Specific T Cell tolerance by Anti CD3 Antibodies,7902110,R01CA132197,"['Clinical Trials ', ' clinical investigation ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' man ', "" man's "", ' prototype ', ' public health relevance ', ' Regimen ', ' Cytomegalovirus ', ' human cytomegalovirus ', ' cytomegalovirus group ', ' Salivary Gland Viruses ', ' HCMV ', ' CMV ', ' CD3 Antigens ', ' T3 molecule ', ' T3 Complex ', ' T3 Antigens ', ' OKT3 antigen ', ' CD3 molecule ', ' CD3 Complex ', ' CD3 ', ' patient safety ', ' Visilizumab ', ' Nuvion ', ' T-Cell Proliferation ', ' T-Cell Activation ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Human Herpesvirus 4 ', ' human herpesvirus 4 group ', ' Infectious Mononucleosis Virus ', ' Herpesvirus 4 (gamma), Human ', ' HHV-4 ', ' Epstein-Barr Virus ', ' Epstein Barr Virus ', ' EB virus ', ' E-B Virus ', ' Burkitt Lymphoma Virus ', ' Burkitt Herpesvirus ', ' Doctor of Medicine ', ' M.D. ', ' Receptor Signaling ', ' Allogenic ', ' Principal Investigator ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Graft-vs-Host Disease ', ' Runt Disease ', ' Homologous Wasting Disease ', ' Graft-Versus-Host Disease ', ' GVHD ', ' Grant ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Man (Taxonomy) ', ' Peripheral ', ' Clinical ', ' Refractory ', ' Cell Transplantation ', ' Immune system ', ' allergic/immunologic organ system ', ' allergic/immunologic body system ', ' Immunity ', ' Natural immunosuppression ', ' immunosuppression ', ' immune suppression ', ' Immunosuppressive Effect ', ' Immunosuppressions (Physiology) ', ' Immunosuppression Effect ', ' Alloantigen ', ' anergy ', ' Hematopoietic ', ' Ligands ', ' Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation ', ' HSC transplantation ', ' Agonist ', ' Mus ', ' Murine ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Mice ', ' Collaborations ', ' Organ Transplantation ', ' organ xenograft ', ' organ graft ', ' organ allograft ', ' Transplantation Surgery ', ' Organ Transplants, Including Bone Marrow for DCT ', ' Organ Transplants ', ' Grafting Procedure ', ' Clinical, Transplantation, Organ ', ' Therapeutic Agents ', ' Patients ', ' Infectious Agent ', ' infectious organism ', ' Play ', ' Monoclonal Antibodies ', ' Clinical Treatment Moab ', ' Antigen-Presenting Cells ', ' accessory cell ', ' Monocytes / Macrophages / APC ', ' Immunologic Accessory Cells ', ' Antigens ', ' immunogen ', ' ATGN ', ' Proteins ', ' gene product ', ' T-Cell Receptor ', ' Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell ', ' Major Histocompatibility Complex Receptor ', ' MHC Receptor ', ' Fc Receptor ', ' antibody receptor ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' recruit ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Safety ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' programs ', ' T-Lymphocyte ', ' thymus derived lymphocyte ', ' Thymus-Dependent Lymphocytes ', ' T-Cells ', ' Regulatory T-Lymphocyte ', ' regulatory T-cells ', ' Treg ', ' Testing ', ' Transplantation ', ' transplant ', ' Tumor Antigens ', ' tumor-specific antigen ', ' Tumor-Associated Antigen ', ' Autoimmune Diseases ', ' autoimmune disorder ', ' Immune ', ' Complex ', ' Pattern ', ' Viral ', ' receptor binding ', ' animal data ', ' disorder prevention ', ' disease prevention ', ' Prevention ', ' WT1 gene ', ' Wilms tumor suppressor WT1 ', ' Wilms Tumor 1 ', ' WT33 ', ' WT1 ', ' WAGR ', ' Cell Death ', ' necrocytosis ', ' Cells ', ' Mediating ', ' Acute Graft Versus Host Disease ', ' Acute GVHD ', ' response ', ' Monoclonal Antibody HuM291 ', ' MoAb HuM291 ', ' HuM291 ', ' HUM291 [Anti-CD3 Antibody] ', ' Anti-CD3 Antibody ', ' Transplantation Tolerance ', ' ']",NCI,H.

"Helper T Cell Regulation In Murine Leishmaniasis    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The clonal selection theory of adaptive immunity suggests that proliferation of a single lymphocyte should provide sufficient function for acute defense (effector cells), yet the regenerative capacity to maintain the selected lineage (memory cells). The progeny of a CD4+ helper T cell selected for an immune response against parasitic pathogens must also have the plasticity to choose among several effector lineages (Th1, Th2, Th17) in order to mobilize the most appropriate defense mechanisms for elimination of a single-celled intracellular protozoan or a multi-celled extracellular helminth. This proposal tests the hypothesis that signals directing the activation of a CD4+ helper T cell during the immune response against the parasite Leishmania major may trigger a program of cell fate diversity among the initial daughter cells of the selected microbe-specific T cell. Preliminary evidence suggests such diversification may be accomplished using an evolutionarily conserved mechanism, called asymmetric cell division, wherein critical cell fate determinants are inherited unequally by two daughter cells. This competing continuation proposal seeks to determine the extent of disparity in the inheritance of signaling molecules and fate regulators in the initial cellular progeny of a CD4+ helper T cell responding to L. major, to evaluate the fate of the initial daughter and grand-daughter CD4+ T cells, and to assess genetically whether critical daughter cell fates depend on regulators of asymmetric cell division. These studies should provide novel insight into some of the most important remaining questions regarding the programming of CD4+ helper T cell function and the immunological control of parasitic infections that are relevant to humankind.Public Health Relevance Statement       Helper T lymphocytes are specialized white blood cells that orchestrate the actions of our immune system to protect us against infections.

For instance, the response to chemopreventive agents is different between these two populations. Since chemopreventive agents exert their effect through a molecular target, this disparity would suggest differences at the genetic level. Therefore, the generation and evaluation of chemopreventive agents that address the issue of chemo-resistance is essential. A promising colon cancer chemopreventive agent, phospho-sulindac (P-S), inhibits colon cancer cell growth more potently than sulindac by inhibiting cell proliferation and enhancing cell killing. However, very little is known about the molecular targets in the cancer cell that are responsible for this effect. Our hypothesis, based on preliminary results, is that miRNA expression/regulation differs between AA and Caucasians and this difference may account, at least in part, a) for the differential response to chemoprevention and b) for the differential incidence of colorectal cancer. To test these hypotheses, we propose the following three specific aims: 1) To study the effect of P-S on p53, NF-kB, 2-catenin, and cell kinetics in human colon cancer cell lines originating from Caucasians and AA; 2) To assess the effect of P- S on the miRNA profile in a p53 null murine model of colon cancer; and, 3) Determine the miRNA profile in human colon cancer samples from AA and Caucasian patients. The results from these findings will lead to the understanding of a worldwide issue and provide details for the development of chemopreventive agents that will span diverse populations.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We will define the mechanisms by which P-S exert its inhibitory effect on the growth of colon cancer cells and address racial disparities as a result of genetic mutations. We will evaluate in cell culture, using cell lines derived from Caucasians and AA colon cancer tissues, changes (by microarray analysis) in the expression of transcription factors and miRNAs. In addition, we will test whether our in vitro findings are relevant to a preclinical model of colon cancer. This study will evaluate directly in a p53 null and C57BL/6 (parent background) mice model the effect of P-S on the expressions of transcription factors and miRNAs. Thereby, we will test the key mechanistic findings from the in vitro study. Lastly, we will compare and contrast prospective and retrospective colon cancer tissue of Caucasians and AA at the protein, RNA, and DNA levels. Being able to demonstrate that P-S induces a potentially important molecular change in the malignant colonocytes that may be relevant to its pharmacological actions in cancer would indicate an important breakthrough in the prevention of colon cancer. Also, being able to attribute a genetic causative effect to resistance to chemotherapeutic agents will address the issue of racial disparity.           We will define the mechanisms by which P-S exert its inhibitory effect on the growth of colon cancer cells and address racial disparities as a result of genetic mutations.

"Natural killer cell genetics and cancer    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Natural killer (NK) cells, the third major population of lymphocytes, have the capacity to kill tumor and virus-infected cells and to produce immuno-modulatory cytokines without the need for prior immunization. Emerging evidence indicates that variation in genes encoding killer immunoglobulin-like receptor (KIR), expressed by natural killer (NK) cells, and HLA ligands can significantly influence disease susceptibility and progression. Recent genetic association studies have revealed that individuals with specific KIR and HLA genotypes are at greater risk of developing cancer. The fact that different ethnic populations display varying trends in their KIR-HLA genotypes offers a strong potential explanation for documented cancer health disparities. Although these epidemiological studies highlight the importance of the interplay between KIR and HLA in disease, the functional basis for this association has been poorly understood.  Recently, we have found an important novel role for these MHC recognizing receptors on NK cells, in both mice and humans. Our findings indicate that the interaction between these receptors and the MHC I ligand is required to confer functional competence in a process we have termed licensing. Licensing has provided a satisfactory explanation for how an NK cell acquires potency, yet achieves tolerance to self-tissues. The licensing impact has been fully analyzed in a murine NK cell system where we found that licensing has a positive effect on all aspects of NK cell responsiveness to various stimuli. This global influence, however, was not observed in human NK cells. Our previous studies have shown that licensing through KIR3DL1 impacted the responsiveness of NK cells to tumor cells, but it did not influence the responsiveness to stimulation through Fc-gamma receptor (CD16), which mediates lysis of antibody-coated target cells. However, studies by other groups, with a small number of samples, have reported that licensing through other KIR impacted the NK cell response both to tumor cells and to stimulation through CD16. Together, these studies formulate a hypothesis that different KIRs have distinct impacts on the responsiveness of NK cells via stimulation through CD16 and/or to other activation receptors.  In this proposal we will determine the impact of licensing through two different KIR, KIR3DL1 and 2DL3, on the responsiveness of NK cells to stimulation through CD16 and other activation receptors known to be involved in tumor recognition. Since licensing appears to be critical for the functional competence of NK cells, our study will generate critical data for furthering our understanding of the impact of licensing on the resolution of disease, especially in the context of health disparities among different ethnic populations, and provide the functional explanation for the results of the KIR-HLA disease association studies.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project is directed at understanding the population based differences in innate immunity that result in cancer health disparities.

"Occult lymph node metastases and racial disparities in colon cancer outcomes    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application addresses Broad Challenge Area (09): Health Disparities and Prevention and Specific Challenge Topic, 09-CA-101: The Basis for Differences in Cancer Incidence. There is an established disparity in stage-specific outcomes in African Americans, compared to Caucasians, with colorectal cancer, the 3rd most common incident cancer and the 3rd leading cause of cancer death in the U.S. Indeed, African Americans who are free of metastases exhibit a 40% excess mortality attributable to race. Factors contributing to these racial disparities in outcomes, and methods that quantify excess risk, remain undefined. While the most important prognostic marker of survival and predictive marker of response to therapy in colorectal cancer are tumor cells in regional lymph nodes detected histologically, ~30% of patients with histology-negative nodes (stage I, II; pN0) die of recurrent disease, reflecting under-staging and occult nodal metastases that escape detection. Recently, GUCY2C, a protein whose expression is restricted to intestinal cells normally, but is universally expressed by colorectal cancer cells, was clinically validated for detection of prognostically important occult metastases, by quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR), in a prospective, multicenter, blinded clinical trial. Further, beyond the utility of occult metastases as a categorical variable (yes/no), occult tumor burden (how much) estimated by GUCY2C qRT-PCR stratified risk, identifying pN0 patients with near-zero risk, and those with >80% risk, of unfavorable outcomes. Importantly, subgroup analysis suggests that African Americans exhibit disproportionate occult tumor burden in lymph nodes associated with unfavorable clinical outcomes. The working hypothesis here suggests that racial disparities in stage-specific outcomes in pN0 colorectal cancer, in part, reflect disproportionate under-staging and occult metastases in lymph nodes which can be detected by GUCY2C qRT-PCR. Here, we propose a retrospective analysis of pN0 African American and Caucasian colon cancer patients >5 y beyond staging, with established clinical outcomes, to quantify the contribution of occult metastases to racial disparities in outcomes. This proposal will examine the utility of GUCY2C qRT-PCR as a categorical variable (yes/no) that identifies occult metastases in lymph nodes contributing to excess risk attributable to race in patients with pN0 colon cancer. Moreover, we will quantify the contribution of occult tumor burden (how much) to racial differences in outcomes in pN0 patients. At the conclusion, the contribution of occult metastatic tumor cells in lymph nodes to racial disparities in stage-specific outcomes in colon cancer will be defined, and a prognostic paradigm comprising GUCY2C qRT-PCR to quantify occult tumor burden and excess risk in African Americans will be clinically validated and positioned for translation. PROJECT NARRATIVE: African Americans with colon cancer exhibit increased mortality compared to Caucasians, although the reasons are unknown. In that context, recent work revealed the importance of occult metastases in lymph nodes that are undetected by routine techniques in defining the risk of disease recurrence in patients with colon cancer.

"Hematopoietic Stem Cell and Cord Blood Transplantation    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Blood disorders including leukemia and lymphoma can be cured with unrelated donor (URD) hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) and cord blood transplantation (CBT). Post-transplant complications and mortality may be lowered through comprehensive HLA matching of the stem cell source. KIR-HLA interactions further define transplant outcome. The clinical practice of URD HCT and CBT today has several unmet needs. HLA identity of the URD does not guarantee that the patient will not develop life-threatening post-transplant complications, indicating the presence of undetected MHC region variation. For patients who lack matched URDs, the rules that govern permissible HLA mismatches are needed so as to broaden the availability of HCT to all patients in need. In CBT, the relevance of undetected disparity at HLA-A, B, C, DR, and DQ is unknown. Natural killer (NK)-mediated effects may further modulate transplant risks. Overall, clinical outcome is inferior for patients of non-Caucasian ethnicity. This project has two major goals. First, we will define the clinical importance of MHC residue variation after URD HCT and CBT by measuring the impact of HLA mismatching in non-Caucasian populations, identifying non-permissible HLA mismatches, and novel MHC resident genes. Second, we will define the clinical impact of KIR-HLA interactions, determine the molecular mechanisms underlying donor NK alloreactivity through a systematic evaluation of activating KIRs and haplotypes, and define mechanisms involved for the development of NK alloreactivity. These research questions will address the current roadblocks in URD HCT and CBT and provide novel laboratory-based information that can be translated to clinical practice for all patients of diverse racial background.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE (provided by applicant: Even though blood disorders such as leukemia and lymphoma can be cured through transplantation of stem cells from a healthy unrelated donor or cord blood stem cells, patients suffer from life-threatening complications. The risks of complications after transplantation are caused by variation in the genetic code between the patient and the stem cells. This project will find the genes that are causing the complications so that the information may be used to select unrelated donors and cord blood stem cells that lower risks.

"Polymorphism and mutation spectrum in minorities with non-small cell lung cancer    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application addresses broad Challenge Area (09) Health Disparities and Specific Challenge Topic, 09-CA- 104: Basic cancer research in cancer health disparities. Title: Polymorphism and mutation spectrum in minorities with non-small cell lung cancer Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer related deaths in the United States. Despite similar risk factors, African-Americans have higher incidence and mortality rates from lung cancer than other populations. Numerous studies have recently demonstrated that both inherited and acquired genetic lesions have a significant impact on both the risk of developing lung cancer and the outcomes and efficacy of targeted therapies. For example, the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling pathway is important in the development, progression, and invasion of non-small cell lung cancer. Ethnic differences in polymorphisms and acquired mutations in the EGFR and its downstream targets have been definitively proven to exist. It is well established that mutations in the tyrosine kinase domain are more frequent in Asian populations as compared to Caucasian population residing in western countries. These mutations confer better overall prognosis and predict response to the tyrosine kinase inhibitors, erlotinib and gefitinib; however, very little data is available regarding the prevalence of these mutations in the dominant U.S. racial minorities. In another important pathway, KRAS, mutations are present in 20-30% of patients with non-small cell lung cancer. Mutated KRAS is associated with poor prognosis and resistance to the monoclonal EGFR antibody, cetuximab as well as the EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors erlotinib and gefitinib. Notably, the prevalence of KRAS and somatic EGFR mutations in African-Americans is unknown. Recently, genome wide association studies identified a single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) variation in the nicotinic receptor which correlated with an increase in genetic susceptibility to non small cell lung cancer. Increased frequency of SNP variability may be one factor that contributes to the increased incidence of non-small cell lung cancer in African-Americans, but the frequency of these in this population is undefined. Thus efforts to better understand the molecular basis for disease susceptibility, incidence, progression, prognosis, and response to biologic agents among the common U.S. racial and ethnic minorities are needed. The Comprehensive Meharry/Vanderbilt-Ingram Cancer Center Research Partnership conducts research to address the disproportional cancer incidence, morbidity, and mortality in under-represented minorities. A dual institution study to review documented cases of non-small cell lung cancers in African-Americans to determine the frequency of germ line polymorphisms, somatic EGFR mutations, and KRAS mutations is proposed. The clinical significance of a SNP in the nicotinic receptor in African-Americans will be determined by comparing known lung cancer patients with age matched controls identified through the Southern Community Cohort Study. Medical records of patients diagnosed with non-small cell lung cancer will be reviewed. Gene sequencing will identify the prevalence of EGFR mutations and KRAS mutations. The frequency of these mutations will be analyzed as independent variables to determine the clinical significance when compared to known risk factors such as smoking. The goal of this study is to determine the impact of perturbations in the EGFR pathway on genetic susceptibility, disease progression, and outcome in African-Americans with nonsmall cell lung cancer. A study of this nature has never been performed. The results should provide tremendous insight into the genomic factors which influence susceptibility, pathogenesis, drug sensitivity, and survival in African-Americans with non-small cell lung cancer.

"Phosphosulindac, miRNAs and cancer racial disparity    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Epidemiological data has demonstrated that colon cancer is disproportional in incidence and mortality between Caucasians and African Americans (AA). Whereas socioeconomic and dietary differences contribute to this disparity other underlying factors must be involved. For instance, the response to chemopreventive agents is different between these two populations. Since chemopreventive agents exert their effect through a molecular target, this disparity would suggest differences at the genetic level. Therefore, the generation and evaluation of chemopreventive agents that address the issue of chemo-resistance is essential. A promising colon cancer chemopreventive agent, phospho-sulindac (P-S), inhibits colon cancer cell growth more potently than sulindac by inhibiting cell proliferation and enhancing cell killing. However, very little is known about the molecular targets in the cancer cell that are responsible for this effect. Our hypothesis, based on preliminary results, is that miRNA expression/regulation differs between AA and Caucasians and this difference may account, at least in part, a) for the differential response to chemoprevention and b) for the differential incidence of colorectal cancer. To test these hypotheses, we propose the following three specific aims: 1) To study the effect of P-S on p53, NF-kB, 2-catenin, and cell kinetics in human colon cancer cell lines originating from Caucasians and AA; 2) To assess the effect of P- S on the miRNA profile in a p53 null murine model of colon cancer; and, 3) Determine the miRNA profile in human colon cancer samples from AA and Caucasian patients. The results from these findings will lead to the understanding of a worldwide issue and provide details for the development of chemopreventive agents that will span diverse populations.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We will define the mechanisms by which P-S exert its inhibitory effect on the growth of colon cancer cells and address racial disparities as a result of genetic mutations. We will evaluate in cell culture, using cell lines derived from Caucasians and AA colon cancer tissues, changes (by microarray analysis) in the expression of transcription factors and miRNAs. In addition, we will test whether our in vitro findings are relevant to a preclinical model of colon cancer. This study will evaluate directly in a p53 null and C57BL/6 (parent background) mice model the effect of P-S on the expressions of transcription factors and miRNAs. Thereby, we will test the key mechanistic findings from the in vitro study. Lastly, we will compare and contrast prospective and retrospective colon cancer tissue of Caucasians and AA at the protein, RNA, and DNA levels. Being able to demonstrate that P-S induces a potentially important molecular change in the malignant colonocytes that may be relevant to its pharmacological actions in cancer would indicate an important breakthrough in the prevention of colon cancer. Also, being able to attribute a genetic causative effect to resistance to chemotherapeutic agents will address the issue of racial disparity.

Lastly, we will compare and contrast prospective and retrospective colon cancer tissue of Caucasians and AA at the protein, RNA, and DNA levels. Being able to demonstrate that P-S induces a potentially important molecular change in the malignant colonocytes that may be relevant to its pharmacological actions in cancer would indicate an important breakthrough in the prevention of colon cancer. Also, being able to attribute a genetic causative effect to resistance to chemotherapeutic agents will address the issue of racial disparity.","Phosphosulindac, miRNAs and cancer racial disparity",8322919,R01CA140487,"['colon carcinogenesis ', ' Western World ', ' Colon Carcinoma ', ' Colonic Carcinoma ', ' Colon Cancer ', ' chemotherapeutic agent ', ' Regulator Genes ', ' trans acting element ', ' regulatory gene ', ' Transcriptional Regulatory Elements ', ' Indium ', ' In element ', ' Anti-inflammatory ', ' Pre-Clinical Model ', ' Preclinical Models ', ' Cancer Cell Growth ', ' colon cancer cell line ', ' comparative efficacy ', ' compare efficacy ', ' Chromosomal Instability ', ' Chromosome Instability ', ' Chemopreventive Agent ', ' anticarcinogenic ', ' Chemopreventive ', ' advanced disease ', ' cell killing ', ' Sulindac ', ' cis-5-fluoro-2-methyl-1-[p-(methylsulfinyl)benzylidene]indene-3-acetic acid ', ' (Z)-5-fluoro-2-methyl-1-[[4-(methylsulfinyl)phenyl]methylene]-1H-indene-3-acetic acid ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' diverse populations ', ' Caucasians ', ' Caucasoid Race ', ' white race ', ' Occidental ', ' Caucasoid ', ' Caucasian Race ', ' Caucasian ', ' cancer chemoprevention ', ' Chemoprevention ', ' Colorectal Cancer ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' healthcare service availability ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare access availability ', ' health services availability ', ' health care service availability ', ' health care service access ', ' health care availability ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Availability of Health Services ', ' Accessibility of health care ', ' Access to Healthcare ', ' Access to Health Care ', ' Access to Care ', ' socioeconomics ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomic ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio economic ', ' DNA ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Cell Proliferation ', ' Cellular Proliferation ', ' Cell Multiplication ', ' Cell Growth in Number ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Resistance ', ' resistant ', ' Accounting ', ' Malignant -

"Microbicide properties of RT inhibitor combinations DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Topical microbicides are an important strategy to minimize heterosexual transmission of HIV. Several single agent microbicides are in clinical trials, including one based on the nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) UC781 that we discovered as a potential microbicidal agent. However, combination microbicides may be preferable, yet only a single combination microbicide is currently under evaluation. There is also an urgent need to identify new pipeline microbicidal agents. We have found that the nucleoside RT inhibitor (NRTI) 4'-ethynyl-2-fluoro-deoxyadenosine (4'E-2FdA) provides a potent and prolonged barrier to HIV- 1 infection of cells in the subsequent absence of exogenous drug, a property previously only noted for NNRTI such as UC781. The ""memory effect"" barrier is imparted by 4'E-2FdA at drug levels orders of magnitude less than those needed for protection by the nucleotide tenofovir, currently in clinical assessment for microbicide use. We hypothesize that microbicides comprising combinations of different classes of highly potent RT inhibitors, namely the NNRTI UC781 and an NRTI such as 4'E-2FdA, will provide an optimal barrier to HIV-1 transmission. We therefore propose these Specific Aims for this R21/R33 phased innovation application: R21 Aim 1. To evaluate the in vitro (cell-based) microbicidal properties of NRTI and UC781 alone and in combination. These studies include assessment of antiviral activity and ""memory effect"" protection imparted by NRTIs and UC781 alone and in combination using primary cells (PBMCs, CD4+ T-cells, macrophages) and different HIV drug-sensitive and drug-resistant strains, isolates and clades. R21 Aim 2. To elucidate the mechanism of 4'E-2FdA (and analogs) induced protective barrier or ""memory effect"" in HIV susceptible cells. These studies include characterization of uptake, conversion to triphosphate and intracellular stability of the NRTI-TPs, as well as detailed kinetic evaluations of the NRTI substrate activity with enzymes involved in metabolism of the NRTIs. R21 Deliverables: Identification of a lead NRTI and two back-ups for use with UC781 for development as a combination microbicide. R33 Aim 1. To formulate the NRTI/NNRTI combinations selected in the R21 phase into an appropriate delivery system for vaginal topical use. NRTIs and NNRTIs have different chemical properties, thus appropriate delivery systems must be identified to enable incorporation and release of the active agents. We will prepare and evaluate both gel and rapidly dissolving film formulations for the combination microbicide. R33 Aim 2. To evaluate the anti-HIV microbicidal activity of formulated NRTI/NNRTI combinations in an ex vivo cervical explant tissue model. These studies will use a newly developed physiologically relevant polarized cervical tissue model to assess the impact of formulated microbicides alone and in combination on HIV transmission and infectivity. R33 Deliverables: Identification of an appropriate delivery formulation for the selected NRTI/NNRTI combination for entry into subsequent preclinical safety and efficacy studies. This project seeks to develop anti-HIV microbicides based on the non-nucleoside RT inhibitor UC781 in combination with novel 4'-substituted nucleosides, a combination found to provide profound and protracted protection of susceptible cells against HIV infection in vitro.

"Sex Chromosomes and Gender Disparity in HBV-Related Hepatocellular Carcinoma    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a significant and deadly cancer in the world. Chronic hepatitis virus infection is the most significant risk factor for HCC development, especially among populations in Asia, Africa and the Amazon Basin. Importantly, there is a significant sex disparity among the HCC patients infected with hepatitis B virus (HBV) with male to female ratio as high as 6:1, depending on geographical locations. Currently, the exact etiology of such male dominance in the disease is uncertain. Recent studies suggest that the expression of the viral oncogene, HBx, on HBV genome is regulated by androgen, the male hormone, and androgen receptor (AR). HBx, in term, can activate AR, thereby generating a positive feedback loop for its own expression and oncogenic functions. Studies of another oncogene on the Y chromosome, testis-specific protein Y encoded (TSPY), suggest that TSPY serves as a co-activator for AR transactivation and stabilizer for HBx protein and could exert significant male dominant effects on HBx expression and oncogenesis. TSPY has specialized as a male germ cell factor involved in stem cell proliferation and meiotic division, but functions as an oncogene when ectopically expressed in incompatible somatic cells. Interesting, there is a X-homologue of TSPY, TSPX, which possesses contrasting properties and acts as a tumor suppressor. TSPX co-represses AR transactivation and binds but promotes HBx proteasomal degradation. After it diverged with TSPY, TSPX maintains the housekeeping functions in modulating proper cell cycle progression, promoting viral protein degradation and repressing viral gene expression. TSPY disrupts TSPX functions, and promotes viral oncogenesis in populations chronically infected with HBV. TSPY could exacerbate HBx oncogenic functions by exaggerating the AR transactivation of HBx gene and maintaining HBx protein stability. In this exploratory project, we plan to address the roles of TSPY and TSPX in HBx protein stability and modulation AR transactivation. First, we will elucidate the mechanisms involved in TSPX promotion of HBx degradation in the ubiquitin dependent and independent pathways. We will define the domains responsible for TSPY and TSPX interactions with and modulation of HBx proteasomal degradation. We will examine the postulation that the domains in TSPX, which are absent in TSPY, could serve tethering and enhancer functions between HBx and the proteasomal machinery. Second, we plan to evaluate three putative androgen response elements (AREs) at the distal Enhancer I position upstream of the HBx gene promoter in the AR transactivation by confirming TSPX and TSPY interactions with AR and delineating the critical domains important for TSPY and TSPX co- activation and co-repression respectively with AR on HBx transactivation. We will examine TSPY functions on HBx promoter activities. Understanding how TSPY disrupts TSPX functions and exacerbates HBx expression and protein stability will shed critical insights on the potential contributions of this pair of homologous oncogene and tumor suppressor gene in the pathogenesis of male dominance in HBV-related hepatocarcinogenesis.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Hepatocellular carcinoma is a prevalent and deadly liver cancer in the world, particularly among populations chronically infected with hepatitis viruses. Significantly, there is a critical gender disparity favoring men among hepatocellular carcinoma patients infected with hepatitis B virus. The reason for such male preference in the disease process is unknown. Recent studies have identified an oncogene (cancer gene), designated as TSPY on the human Y (male-only) chromosome that affects the expression and protein stability of the hepatitis B viral cancer gene, called HBx. Importantly, there is a homologue of TSPY, designated as TSPX, on the X chromosome, which possesses contrasting properties on HBx, and functions as a tumor suppressor. The proposed research is designed to elucidate the functions of this pair of homologous oncogene and tumor suppressor gene on HBx and male dominance in hepatocellular carcinoma development in hepatitis B virus infected populations.           Hepatocellular carcinoma is a prevalent and deadly liver cancer in the world, particularly among populations chronically infected with hepatitis viruses.

"Hematopoietic Stem Cell and Cord Blood Transplantation    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Blood disorders including leukemia and lymphoma can be cured with unrelated donor (URD) hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) and cord blood transplantation (CBT). Post-transplant complications and mortality may be lowered through comprehensive HLA matching of the stem cell source. KIR-HLA interactions further define transplant outcome. The clinical practice of URD HCT and CBT today has several unmet needs. HLA identity of the URD does not guarantee that the patient will not develop life-threatening post-transplant complications, indicating the presence of undetected MHC region variation. For patients who lack matched URDs, the rules that govern permissible HLA mismatches are needed so as to broaden the availability of HCT to all patients in need. In CBT, the relevance of undetected disparity at HLA-A, B, C, DR, and DQ is unknown. Natural killer (NK)-mediated effects may further modulate transplant risks. Overall, clinical outcome is inferior for patients of non-Caucasian ethnicity. This project has two major goals. First, we will define the clinical importance of MHC residue variation after URD HCT and CBT by measuring the impact of HLA mismatching in non-Caucasian populations, identifying non-permissible HLA mismatches, and novel MHC resident genes. Second, we will define the clinical impact of KIR-HLA interactions, determine the molecular mechanisms underlying donor NK alloreactivity through a systematic evaluation of activating KIRs and haplotypes, and define mechanisms involved for the development of NK alloreactivity. These research questions will address the current roadblocks in URD HCT and CBT and provide novel laboratory-based information that can be translated to clinical practice for all patients of diverse racial background.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE (provided by applicant: Even though blood disorders such as leukemia and lymphoma can be cured through transplantation of stem cells from a healthy unrelated donor or cord blood stem cells, patients suffer from life-threatening complications. The risks of complications after transplantation are caused by variation in the genetic code between the patient and the stem cells. This project will find the genes that are causing the complications so that the information may be used to select unrelated donors and cord blood stem cells that lower risks. In this way, patients can be cured of their cancer and live longer healthier lives.          ",Hematopoietic Stem Cell and Cord Blood Transplantation,8099785,U01AI069197,"['Inferior ', ' Umbilical Cord Blood Transplantation ', ' UCB transplantation ', ' Cord Blood Transplantation ', ' Hematopoietic stem cells ', ' Hematopoietic Progenitor Cells ', ' Blood Precursor Cell ', ' treatment strategy ', ' Haplotypes ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Translating ', ' Stem cell transplant ', ' Stem Cell Transplantation ', ' Progenitor Cell Transplantation ', ' leukemia/lymphoma ', ' lymphoma/leukemia ', ' Hematological Disease ', ' blood disorder ', ' Hematological Disorder ', ' Hematologic Diseases ', ' Blood Diseases ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Data ', ' Risk ', ' Source ', ' Maps ', ' Goals ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Principal Investigator ', ' clinical application ', ' clinical applicability ', ' Life ', ' Address ', ' Genes ', ' Hematopoietic ', ' novel ', ' Outcome ', ' Biological Models ', ' Model System ', ' Biologic Models ', ' Stem cells ', ' Progenitor Cells ', ' Transplantation ', ' transplant ', ' base ', ' Molecular ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' clinical practice ', ' clinically relevant ', ' clinical relevance ', ' Genetic ', ' Laboratories ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Evaluation ', ' Population ', ' Measures ', ' Clinical ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Mortality ', ' public health relevance ', ' Mediating ', ' Patients ', ' Research ', ' Phenotype ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Cell Transplantation ', ' HLA-A gene ', ' HLAA ', ' HLA-A ', ' Donor Selection ', ' Donor Screening ', ' Umbilical Cord Blood ', ' fetal cord blood ', ' Cord Blood ', ' Genetic Code ', ' gene interaction ', ' ']",NIAID,FRED HUTCHINSON CANCER RESEARCH CENTER,U01,2011,1130940,0.05168451359378197
"Reducing Urban Women's HIV Risk: Soap Opera Videos on Video Capable Cell Phones    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Reducing Urban Women's HIV Risk: Soap Opera Videos on Video-Capable Cell Phones According to the CDC, the majority (80%) of women with HIV became infected by unprotected sex with an infected male partner. Black and Latina women accounted for 82% of AIDS diagnoses in women in 2005. The purpose of this proposal is to evaluate whether a series of 12-weekly data and theory-based urban soap operas will promote a reduction in HIV sex risk behavior in young urban African American and Latina women. Toni's Story is based on content analysis of focus group discussions with the target population. By grounding stories in urban women's own experiences, via a popular medium of the soap opera, women can identify with the heroines' emotionally charged process of change, transforming their behavior through a new awareness of their value as women, of their choices, and their potential. Messages about reducing HIV sexual risk are designed to fulfill familiar relationship needs. Because trust, sexual pressure and power form the nexus of sex scripts associated with HIV sexual risk, these themes are examined through the pursuits of the various characters as sub-plots. A randomized controlled trial (RCT) with 250 high-risk women aged 18 to 29, recruited in neighborhood settings in Newark and Jersey City, will be conducted to test the effect of the video-based intervention on HIV sexual risk behavior. A control group will receive text messages with audio that stress HIV health promotion messages. The series of 12 20-minute videos to the video intervention group (n=125) and 12- weekly HIV-risk reduction text/ audio messages to the control group (n=125) will be viewed over video-capable cell phones so that women may view the videos and text messages repeatedly and in privacy. It is expected that as a result of watching the video series, the video intervention group will demonstrate greater reductions in unprotected sex from baseline to 3 and 6 months than will the control group. Further, it is expected that they will demonstrate lower sexual pressure, indicating lower stereotypical expectations to engage in unprotected sex. Secondary analyses will determine whether there are differences in these results by partner type, whether there is a reduction in the number of high risk sex partners, and whether choosing to watch the videos more frequently will relate to further reduction in risk behavior. Interviews will be conducted by audio computer assisted self-interview (ACASI). The program will track when, how often, and for how long the videos are viewed. If the aims of this proposal are achieved, the use of the cell phone to view videos could change the paradigm of how health promotion is amplified between clinic sessions. Potentially hard to reach young urban women who may be at risk for HIV, will be able to access video-based interventions on their own cell phones. The popularity of the cell phone and use of the Internet for multimedia offer a new communication channel to address health disparities in young urban women.

"Estrogen-ERbeta Axis In Disparity of Prostate Cancer    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  African Americans (AA) with prostate cancer (PC) have twice the incidence and mortality than European Americans (EA) and any other ethnic groups, however, the mechanism/s linked to this health disparity is not understood. The uncontrolled androgen receptor (AR) signaling in PC cells increases tumor development which is controlled by androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) in patients. However, ADT selects for androgen- independence and recurrence of aggressive tumors in AA-men. Notably, AA-men with PC have significantly higher circulating estrogens than EA-men. Since adipose tissue is the major source of estrogens in men and since PC risk increases with age and obesity, there appears to be a crucial link between adiposity and estrogenic signaling in PC progression. Indeed, estrogenic signaling via the estrogen receptor-beta (ERP) is implicated in aggressive tumor growth and metastasis. Our combined suppressive subtractive hybridization (SSH) analysis and race-based cDNA microarrays, showed a selective up-regulation of both the ERa co- repressor, SAFB2 and the ERf3 isoform, in freshly microdissected PC specimen. In the AA-derived PC cell line MDA-PCa-2b, activation of estrogen-ERP signaling axis conferred AR transactivation and proliferative responses in PC cells, even in the absence of androgen. Furthermore, adipose stem ceils (ADMSCs) from AA-men secreted estrogens in response to tumor-derived factors and increased PC cell growth both in vitro and in vivo. We therefore hypothesize that activation ofAR signaling by estrogen-ERP axis is pivotal to the progression of PC in AA-men despite androgen ablation therapy. Our hypothesis will be tested by the following specific aims: (1) to evaluate the clinical utility of SAFB2 and ERb expression levels as biomarkers and/or prognostic indicators of aggressive PC in African Americans. (2) To determine if the estrogen-ERp axis augments AR-mediated growth and metastasis in SAFB2-expressing PC cells in vitro. (3) To investigate in vitro whether local estrogen production by ADMSCs from AA-men contributes to ERp-dependent enhanced growth and metastasis of PC cells under ADC in vitro, and (4) To demonstrate that ERp activation by systemic and/or ADMSC-derived estrogens increases growth of PC tumors under ADC in vivo.  RELEVANCE (See Instructions): The discovery of alternate signaling pathways that may lead to androgen resistance and aggressive PC growth in AA-men, would be of crucial importance. A crucial role of estrogen-ERP signaling axis in PC progression and the contribution of adipose stem cell derived estrogens on growth and metastasis of PC cells, will provide new clues for understanding the disproportionate incidence and mortality due to PC in African American natients and will rifilineate novel theraneutic strategies that can be easily implemented..           ",Estrogen-ERbeta Axis In Disparity of Prostate Cancer,8195044,U01CA149204,"['Tumor-Derived ', ' Clonal Expansion ', ' Trans-Activation (Genetics) ', ' Transactivation ', ' expression vector ', ' Ectopic Expression ', ' PC3 cell line ', ' prostate cancer cell line ', ' Conditioned Culture Media ', ' Conditioned Medium ', ' Estrogen Receptor beta ', ' ERbeta ', ' Cancer Cell Growth ', ' scaffold ', ' scaffolding ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Mesenchymal Stem Cells ', ' Mesenchymal Progenitor Cell ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Protein Isoforms ', ' Isoforms ', ' stem ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Testosterone ', ' Trans-Testosterone ', ' Therapeutic Testosterone ', ' Malignant neoplasm of prostate ', ' Malignant prostatic tumor ', ' Prostatic Cancer ', ' Prostate Cancer ', ' Prostate CA ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Prostate ', ' European ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Injection of therapeutic agent ', ' Injections ', ' Preventive ', ' Cancer Patient ', ' prognostic indicator ', ' adverse outcome ', ' adverse consequence ', ' Adipose tissue ', ' yellow adipose tissue ', ' white adipose tissue ', ' adipose ', ' Fatty Tissue ', ' Tissue Microarray ', ' Tissue Chip ', ' Tissue Arrays ', ' Estrogens ', ' Therapeutic Estrogen ', ' Estrogenic Compounds ', ' Estrogenic Agents ', ' Androgen Receptor ', ' American ', ' Ablation ', ' Nude Mice ', ' Athymic Nude Mouse ', ' Athymic Mice ', ' small hairpin RNA ', ' short hairpin RNA ', ' shRNA ', ' Androgens ', ' Therapeutic Androgen ', ' Androgenic Compounds ', ' Androgenic Agents ', ' Prostatic Neoplasms ', ' Prostatic Neoplasia ', ' Prostate Tumor ', ' Prostate Neoplasms ', ' Receptor Signaling ', ' cancer risk ', ' Disease Progression ', ' Up-Regulation (Physiology) ', ' Upregulation ', ' Up-Regulation ', ' Recurrence ', ' Recurrent ', ' Incidence ', ' tumor progression ', ' neoplastic progression ', ' neoplasm progression ', ' cancer progression ', ' Testing ', ' base ', ' cohort ', ' Resistance ', ' resistant ', ' Outcome ', ' Enzymes ', ' tumor ', ' Stem cells ', ' Progenitor Cells ', ' Mediating ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Mortality ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Source ', ' Specimen ', ' Research Specimen ', ' in vivo ', ' deprivation ', ' Principal Investigator ', ' tumor growth ', ' cancer cell ', ' Malignant Cell ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' therapeutic target ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' neoplastic cell ', ' Tumor Cell ', ' Neoplasm Metastasis ', ' tumor cell metastasis ', ' cancer metastasis ', ' Tumor Cell Migration ', ' Secondary Tumor ', ' Secondary Neoplasm ', ' Metastatic Tumor ', ' Metastatic Neoplasm ', ' Metastasize ', ' Metastasis ', ' Clinical ', ' Cells ', ' response ', ' overexpression ', ' overexpress ', ' Production ', ' Link ', ' interest ', ' Play ', ' biomarker ', ' Patients ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' research study ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' Obesity ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Genes ', ' In Vitro ', ' Nature ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Age ', ' Signal Pathway ', ' Sampling ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' recruit ', ' novel ', ' Instruction ', ' Hormones ', ' Therapeutic Hormone ', ' Endocrine Gland Secretion ', ' Chemotherapy-Hormones/Steroids ', ' Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Small Interfering RNA ', ' siRNA ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' cDNA Arrays ', ' cDNA Microarray ', ' Gonadal structure ', ' Gonads ', ' Charcoal ', ' ']",NCI,TULANE UNIVERSITY OF LOUISIANA,U01,2011,309869,0.059508865363938804
"Mechanisms of Feline Lentivirus Control and Interference    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Though transmission of indigenous African monkey lentiviruses to humans or to Asian macaques has resulted pathogenic consequences for the new host, it is becoming increasingly clear that pathogenic cross- species lentiviral infection is an exceptional occurrence. Recent studies indicate innate cellular restriction factors are key to limiting such infections, and that lentiviral adaptation to a new host requires alterations in accessory gene structure, i.e., viral infectivity factor (Vif). To study this issue, we developed a feline model of cross-species lentiviral transmission that results in productive, yet regressive, avirulent infection, and have determined that such infection attenuates subsequent virulent feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) challenge. Data published during the initial grant cycle demonstrate that innate cellular responses, namely cytokine expression profiles and cytidine deaminase-like (CD) activity resulting in high viral error burden, are more significant for host viral control than adaptive immune responses-which follow rather than precede viral down regulation. Moreover, virulent FIV-C-PG disease attenuation (i.e. protection from CD4+ T cell depletion and modulation of viral set point) in cats infected with avirulent puma lentivirus (PLV-1695), is associated with unique FIV molecular evolution, and maintenance of a proinflammatory cytokine profile vs. cats infected with virulent FIV-C-PG alone-and disease modulation occurs despite disparities in receptor use and target cell distribution between FIV and PLV. Here we propose to advance this unique feline model to address important questions in lentivirus biology: (a) How does host innate activity (defined by CD-like hypermutation and cytokine cell-signaling) relate to attenuation of disease? and (b) What role does Vif play in modulating virulent lentiviral challenge? To answer these questions, we propose: (1) To determine whether previous PLV-1695 infection enhances hypermutation, error burden, and tissue-specific cytidine deaminase activity/cytokine expression after FIV-C-PG challenge; and, (2) To determine whether Vif modulates CD activity and cytokine activation as a mechanism of attenuation. These experiments pose a new paradigm for assessment of protective immunity against HIV/AIDS-namely, that enhancement of early innate immune parameters by exposure to an avirulent, non-adapted lentivirus can provide cross-protective activity against a virulent, host-adapted lentivirus, and as such, these studies are of great public health significance.           ",Mechanisms of Feline Lentivirus Control and Interference,8058699,R01HL092791,"['Immune system ', ' allergic/immunologic organ system ', ' allergic/immunologic body system ', ' Molecular Profiling ', ' molecular signature ', ' molecuar profile ', ' Molecular Fingerprinting ', ' Expression Signature ', ' Expression Profiling ', ' trend ', ' Natural Immunity ', ' Non-Specific Immunity ', ' Native Immunity ', ' Innate Immunity ', ' Immunity ', ' Viral Load result ', ' Viral Load ', ' Viral Burden ', ' Virus ', ' General Viruses ', ' Publishing ', ' Virus Diseases ', ' virus-induced disease ', ' virus infection ', ' viral infection ', ' Viral Diseases ', ' Virulence ', ' Immune ', ' Elements ', ' attenuation ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' cytokine ', ' Virus Replication ', ' virus multiplication ', ' Down-Regulation ', ' Downregulation ', ' Down-Regulation (Physiology) ', ' Viral ', ' novel therapeutics ', ' next generation therapeutics ', ' new therapeutics ', ' Genetic ', ' Maintenance ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' research study ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Genome ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' response ', ' Address ', ' Play ', ' Infection ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Attenuated ', ' Data ', ' Site ', ' base ', ' Family ', ' transmission process ', ' Transmission ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Man (Taxonomy) ', ' Cells ', ' Immune response ', ' immunoresponse ', ' host response ', ' Animal Model ', ' model organism ', ' Animal Models and Related Studies ', ' Relative (related person) ', ' Relative ', ' Modeling ', ' African ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Inflammatory ', ' Age ', ' In Vitro ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Exposure to ', ' in vivo ', ' Biology ', ' System ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' programs ', ' Time ', ' Grant ', ' receptor ', ' Receptor Protein ', ' Feline Lentiviruses ', ' novel vaccines ', ' next generation vaccines ', ' new vaccines ', ' Virulent ', ' T-Cell Depletion ', ' Puma Lentivirus ', ' Cytokine Activation ', ' Feline Immunodeficiency Virus ', ' Feline T-Lymphotropic Virus ', ' Feline T-Lymphotropic Lentivirus ', ' FTLV ', ' FIV ', ' Asians ', ' oriental ', ' Molecular Evolution ', ' Cytidine Deaminase ', ' Cytidine Aminohydrolase ', ' virus host interaction ', ' Gene Structure ', ' Gene Structure/Organization ', ' Gene Organization ', ' Family Felidae ', ' feline ', ' Felids ', ' Felidae ', ' Macaca ', ' Macaque ', ' Felis catus ', ' Felis sylvestris catus ', ' Felis domesticus ', ' Felis domestica ', ' Feline Species ', ' Domestic Cats ', ' Cats Mammals ', ' Cats ', ' Lentivirus Infections ', ' Lentivirus disease ', ' CD4 Positive T Lymphocytes ', ' helper T cell ', ' T4 Lymphocytes ', ' T4 Cells ', ' CD4-Positive Lymphocytes ', ' CD4+ T-Lymphocyte ', ' CD4+ T cell ', ' CD4 lymphocyte ', ' CD4 T cells ', ' CD4 Cells ', ' Indigenous ', ' Subfamily lentivirinae ', ' Virus-Lenti ', ' Lentivirus ', ' Lentivirinae ', ' Published Comment ', ' Viewpoint ', ' Editorial Comment ', ' Commentary ', ' Comment ', ' AIDS/HIV problem ', ' HIV/AIDS problem ', ' HIV/AIDS ', ' AIDS/HIV ', ' Infection Control ', ' Monkeys ', ' ']",NHLBI,COLORADO STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2011,484688,0.0714572180334774
"NcoA5, a unique nuclear receptor coactivator in hepatocarcinogenesis    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is two to four times higher in men than in women and the progression of chronic liver diseases to cirrhosis is much faster in men than in women. These suggest an important role of sex hormones in hepatocarcinogenesis. However, the molecular mechanism underlying the gender disparity in HCC still remains poorly understood. And there have been controversies on the use of hormonal therapies for patients with HCC. Hence, a better understanding of the genetic and epigenetic alterations that contribute to HCC development, especially to the gender disparity of HCC, may lead to a discovery of new etiologic, prognostic or therapeutic targets. The long- term goal is to understand how the genetic alterations in cells lead to hepatocarcinogenesis. The objective of this proposal is to determine the mechanism by which down regulation of nuclear receptor coactivator 5 (Ncoa5) contributes to the development of HCC. The central hypothesis is that Ncoa5 deficiency preferentially promotes hepatocarcinogenesis in males through inhibition of estrogen receptor 1 (ER?) activity and upregulation of androgen receptor (AR) expression in the liver. This hypothesis has been formulated on the basis of our recent preliminary data. The rationale for the proposed research is that understanding of the mechanism underlying Ncoa5-mediated suppression of HCC will reveal a novel regulatory pathway and new targets for developing innovative strategies to the prevention and treatment of HCC. This hypothesis will be tested by the following two specific aims: 1). Determine the effects of estrogen on Ncoa5 deficiency induced hepatocarcinogenesis using a novel genetically-engineered mouse model; and 2) Determine the molecular mechanism by which Ncoa5 exerts its effect on Kupffer cells and hepatocytes. The approach is innovative, because it utilizes a novel genetically-engineered mouse model of spontaneous HCC to prove a critical role of Ncoa5 in the suppression of HCC development. The proposed research is significant, because it is expected to demonstrate Ncoa5 as a novel mouse tumor suppressor with haploinsufficiency that links up ER? and AR mediated regulatory pathways to HCC. This will not only advance our understanding of the etiological mechanisms of HCC, but also provide the fields of basic and preclinical studies with a new mouse model that mimics the initiation and progression of human HCC.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The proposed research is relevant to public health because the development of an animal model of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and discovery of the mechanism underlying the gender disparity of HCC will not only contribute to a more comprehensive picture of the roles of sex hormone in Hepatocarcinogenesis, but also lead to the discovery of new etiologic, prognostic or therapeutic targets. Thus, the proposed research is relevant to the part of NIH's mission that pertains to developing the prevention and/or treatment of liver cancer.            The proposed research is relevant to public health because the development of an animal model of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and discovery of the mechanism underlying the gender disparity of HCC will not only contribute to a more comprehensive picture of the roles of sex hormone in Hepatocarcinogenesis, but also lead to the discovery of new etiologic, prognostic or therapeutic targets.

"Instant Pediatric POC Blood Analysis    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose to develop a Point-of-Care Blood Analyzer that will require ten times smaller blood volume or less and it will provide instant results to improve health of children in health disparity populations. The analyzer would be used for monitoring of anemia in children; neutropenia in children; evaluation for infections (total white count, increased white blood cells with neutrophil predominance, as an inflammatory marker); screening newborns for anemia, high WBC or neutropenia, with the use of very low blood volumes; clinical trial use in patients from diverse populations and ages.  Morbidity and mortality are disproportionally high in children under five years of age particularly in resource poor or disenfranchised populations including those in urban and rural areas in the United States. The major issues affecting infants and young children is infection followed by anemia and poor nutrition. A complete blood count is commonly used for diagnosis and the proposed analyzer will be the first to measure RBC, WBC, 3-part differential, hemoglobin, and platelets at the point-of-care.  The underlying technology of this transformative imaging platform was demonstrated by Prof. Ozcan's Group at UCLA [1 to 13]. It relies on innovative lensfree holographic imaging of cells, bacteria or other micro-scale particles on a low-cost cell phone camera chip at unprecedented throughputs. The holographic diffraction patterns of various blood cells are quite rich in information to enable characterization of cells based on shape and texture analysis through digital signal processing. This basic platform, termed Holographic LUCAS, will be developed in this SBIR Phase I project. Accuracy, precision, and linearity of the LUCAS platform will be compared with standard laboratory hematology analyzer using unidentified blood specimens.  Specific aims are to: (1) Develop an experimental platform consisting of a prototype Holographic CBC Analyzer and a lab cuvette design suitable for use as a sample holder in Phase I. (2) Research imaging of WBC 3-part differential (granulocytes, monocytes, and lymphocytes) with a holographic LUCAS imager and demonstrate accurate counting; (3) Develop a manual sample preparation process to be used with lab cuvettes for sample preparation in Phase I. The process is the first step in the development of an automated unidose cuvette in Phase II. (4) The final aim of this research will be to measure analyzer performance for RBC, WBC, 3-Part Differential, Hemoglobin, and Platelets. Preliminary tests will be done with purchased blood from the blood bank and final tests with unidentified specimens from UCI clinical laboratory. At least 100 samples will be measured to achieve desired statistical confidence. The results will be compared with the gold standard laboratory hematology analyzer (such as Beckman Coulter LH 750) and with manual microscopy.  After commercialization this analyzer will dramatically lower the cost and barriers to use as a point-of-care diagnostic instrument for health disparity populations and also for general use in the US, the developed world, and resource-limited countries. Future applications include CBC, Malaria, TB, HIV, and others.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  We propose a new technological platform that will enable CBC blood analysis for children in health disparity populations using a compact, light-weight and cost-effective unit that can be operated by minimally trained personnel right at the point of care or in resource poor settings such as rural areas.

"The Role of Protease-Activated Receptors in the Regulation of eNOS    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The objective of this study is to explore the signal transduction mechanism by which protease-activated receptors (PARs) regulate endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) phoshorylation and activation in endothelial cells. Proteases play very important roles in endothelial physiology and pathophysiology through activation of PARs. Their functions include regulations of endothelium-dependent contraction/relaxation, endothelial permeability/barrier function, leukocyte adhesion, angiogenesis, endothelial cell migration and proliferation. Thus, PARs are very likely to be involved in the development of cardiovascular diseases. However, the detailed molecular mechanisms by which PARs regulate these functions remain largely unclear. PAR1 and PAR2 are believed to play major roles in endothelial cell function. Recent studies revealed multiple heterotrimeric G protein-coupling (Gq, Gi, G12/13) and several downstream signaling cascades of PAR1 in endothelial cells and other cells. By contrast, much less is known regarding PAR2 signal transduction in endothelial cells, which mainly couples to Gq. Our goal is to study the specific signal transduction pathways utilized by PARs including heterotrimeric G protein- coupling together with the structure-activity relationship of PARs during coupling and their roles in mediating downstream signals that regulate eNOS. We hypothesize that PAR1 and PAR2 reciprocally regulate eNOS through distinct signaling pathways and have proposed the following specific aims to address this hypothesis. We plan: 1. To demonstrate that a distinct receptor C-tail structure associated with distinct G protein-coupling is required for reciprocal eNOS phosphorylation by PARs. 2. To identify eNOS kinases that reciprocally regulate eNOS activity in response to distinct PARs. 3. To identify the distinct PAR C-tail associated proteins that are responsible for reciprocal eNOS regulation. Cultured endothelial cells will be used to detect phosphorylation of eNOS. Kinase assays, site mutations, and novel proteomic approaches will be used to identify other proteins involved in the reciprocal phosphorylation of eNOS. The results of this study will be valuable in developing specific-acting therapeutic drugs that can be used to treat endothelial dysfunctions that lead to cardiovascular diseases.

"Helper T Cell Regulation In Murine Leishmaniasis    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The clonal selection theory of adaptive immunity suggests that proliferation of a single lymphocyte should provide sufficient function for acute defense (effector cells), yet the regenerative capacity to maintain the selected lineage (memory cells). The progeny of a CD4+ helper T cell selected for an immune response against parasitic pathogens must also have the plasticity to choose among several effector lineages (Th1, Th2, Th17) in order to mobilize the most appropriate defense mechanisms for elimination of a single-celled intracellular protozoan or a multi-celled extracellular helminth. This proposal tests the hypothesis that signals directing the activation of a CD4+ helper T cell during the immune response against the parasite Leishmania major may trigger a program of cell fate diversity among the initial daughter cells of the selected microbe-specific T cell. Preliminary evidence suggests such diversification may be accomplished using an evolutionarily conserved mechanism, called asymmetric cell division, wherein critical cell fate determinants are inherited unequally by two daughter cells. This competing continuation proposal seeks to determine the extent of disparity in the inheritance of signaling molecules and fate regulators in the initial cellular progeny of a CD4+ helper T cell responding to L. major, to evaluate the fate of the initial daughter and grand-daughter CD4+ T cells, and to assess genetically whether critical daughter cell fates depend on regulators of asymmetric cell division. These studies should provide novel insight into some of the most important remaining questions regarding the programming of CD4+ helper T cell function and the immunological control of parasitic infections that are relevant to humankind.Public Health Relevance Statement       Helper T lymphocytes are specialized white blood cells that orchestrate the actions of our immune system to protect us against infections. This project will reveal the inner workings of how helper T cells match their function appropriately to the type of infection we encounter, and how they prevent themselves from becoming depleted when the infection persists for our lifetime.          ",Helper T Cell Regulation In Murine Leishmaniasis,8019057,R01AI042370,"['CD4 Positive T Lymphocytes ', ' helper T cell ', ' T4 Lymphocytes ', ' T4 Cells ', ' CD4-Positive Lymphocytes ', ' CD4+ T-Lymphocyte ', ' CD4+ T cell ', ' CD4 lymphocyte ', ' CD4 T cells ', ' CD4 Cells ', ' Defense Mechanisms ', ' psychological defense mechanism ', ' T cell regulation ', ' Effector Cell ', ' Interleukin-4 ', ' T-Cell Growth Factor 2 ', ' Mast Cell Growth Factor-2 ', ' MCGF-2 ', ' Lymphocyte Stimulatory Factor 1 ', ' Interleukin-4 Precursor ', ' IL4 Protein ', ' IL-4 ', ' Binetrakin ', ' BSF1 (B cell stimulating factor 1) ', ' BSF1 ', ' BSF-1 ', ' BCSF 1 ', ' BCGF-1 ', ' BCGF ', ' BCDF-1 ', ' B-Cell Stimulatory Factor-1 ', ' B-Cell Stimulation Factor-1 ', ' B-Cell Stimulating Factor-1 ', ' B-Cell Stimulating Factor ', ' B-Cell Proliferating Factor ', ' B-Cell Growth Factor-I ', ' B-Cell Growth Factor-1 ', ' B-Cell Differentiation Factor-1 ', ' B cell growth factor ', ' Immunologic Memory ', ' secondary immune response ', ' anamnestic reaction ', ' Immunological Memory ', ' Dopamine D2 Receptor ', ' DRD2 Receptor ', ' D2 receptor ', ' Suggestion ', ' willingness ', ' Sorting - Cell Movement ', ' sorting ', ' Signaling Molecule ', ' ICAM1 gene ', ' ICAM1 ', ' ICAM-1 Gene ', ' CD54 ', ' BB2 ', ' Natural regeneration ', ' regenerate ', ' Regeneration ', ' Leishmaniasis ', ' CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes ', ' T8 Lymphocytes ', ' T8 Cells ', ' CD8-Positive Lymphocytes ', ' CD8+ T-Lymphocyte ', ' CD8 lymphocyte ', ' CD8 Cell ', ' Adopted ', ' Parasitic infection ', ' Leishmania major ', ' Leishmania tropica major ', ' Leishmania (Leishmania) major ', ' Leishmania (genus) ', ' Leishmania ', ' Daughter ', ' Regulatory Element ', ' Toxoplasmosis ', ' Toxoplasma gondii Infection ', ' T. gondii infection ', ' regenerative ', ' Lymphocyte ', ' lymph cell ', ' Lymphocytic ', ' Parasites ', ' Helminths ', ' Parasitic Worms ', ' T cell response ', ' Pattern ', ' Exhibits ', ' Reporting ', ' segregation ', ' Racial Segregation ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Inherited ', ' Hereditary ', ' Published Comment ', ' Viewpoint ', ' Editorial Comment ', ' Commentary ', ' Comment ', ' cytokine ', ' mutant ', ' Antibodies ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Immune response ', ' immunoresponse ', ' host response ', ' Cells ', ' Principal Investigator ', ' Communities ', ' T-Lymphocyte ', ' thymus derived lymphocyte ', ' Thymus-Dependent Lymphocytes ', ' T-Cells ', ' theories ', ' Nature ', ' Address ', ' Memory ', ' Specificity ', ' Data ', ' Organism ', ' living system ', ' Phase ', ' Proteins ', ' gene product ', ' receptor ', ' Receptor Protein ', ' Testing ', ' Transgenic Mice ', ' System ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' insight ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Intercellular adhesion molecule 1 ', ' ICAM-1 ', ' Glycoprotein ICAM 1 (human clone pHRVr1 deblocked protein moiety reduced) ', ' CD54 Antigens ', ' CD54 (ICAM 1) ', ' Kinetics ', ' Process ', ' pathogen ', ' Incidence ', ' daughter cell ', ' programs ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' base ', ' Infection ', ' Mus ', ' Murine ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Mice ', ' novel ', ' Production ', ' research study ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Proteomics ', ' Cell division ', ' Cell physiology ', ' Subcellular Process ', ' Cellular Process ', ' Cellular Physiology ', ' Cellular Function ', ' Cell Process ', ' Cell Function ', ' public health relevance ', ' Work ', ' Acute ', ' extracellular ', ' Leukocytes ', ' white blood corpuscle ', ' white blood cell ', ' White Cell ', ' White Blood Cells ', ' Marrow leukocyte ', ' Leukocytes Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Blood leukocyte ', ' Attention ', ' Biological ', ' Modeling ', ' polypeptide ', ' Immune system ', ' allergic/immunologic organ system ', ' allergic/immunologic body system ', ' Inbred BALB C Mice ', ' BALB/c ', ' BALB C Mouse ', ' Microbe ', ' Distal ', ' Helper-Inducer T-Lymphocyte ', ' Inducer T-Lymphocytes ', ' Inducer Cells ', ' Helper-Inducer T-Cells ', ' Helper T-Lymphocytes ', ' Helper T-Cells ', ' Helper Cells ', ' Qualifying ', ' adaptive immunity ', ' ']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2011,385914,0.2354590606504227
"Regulation of osteoclast biology by anion exchanger SLC4A2 in mouse and human sys    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Bone is a dynamic tissue that remodels to grow, adapt to stress and maintain integrity. Two cell types control this process, the osteoblast (OB) and the osteoclast (OC), which synthesize and degrade bone, respectively. Pathologic inequality in bone remodeling favoring resorption over formation leads to diseases such as osteoporosis, rheumatoid arthritis and metastatic bone cancer. Currently, over 30 million Americans have low bone mass and nearly 1% of our population suffers from rheumatoid arthritis. The yearly health care cost burden of these diseases is immense. Currently approved therapeutics targeting OCs are inadequate, necessitating the discovery of new targets. To resorb bone, osteoclasts secrete hydrochloric acid. To prevent a reciprocal build up of cytoplasmic base, electroneutral exchange of bicarbonate for chloride occurs through an anion exchanger. The identity of this exchanger eluded identification until our recent report showing Solute carrier family 4, anion exchanger, member 2 (Slc4a2, Ae2) is absolutely required for osteoclast activity during development. In its absence, mice develop profound osteopetrosis. A recent publication has identified a nearly identical phenotype in cattle that lack SLC4A2. To date, only a handful of mutations have been identified that so dramatically curtail the ability of osteoclasts to resorb calcified tissue. Our preliminary data suggest that SCL4A2 plays an unexpected complex role in OC physiology. We have found that SLC4A2 deficiency not only prevents OCs from properly secreting acid and performing anion exchange, but also profoundly affects the organization of their cytoskeleton. Many important questions remain regarding the biology of SLC4A2 in the OC. We do not know whether SLC4A2 is important in bone remodeling beyond the developmental period or in the pathogenesis of inflammatory skeletal disease. The relative contribution of the cytoplasmic and transmembrane domains of SLC4A2 to the regulation of osteoclast biology is unknown. Moreover, whether human osteoclasts utilize SLC4A2 is undefined. Four specific aims are proposed to answer these questions: 1) Establish the OC-intrinsic role of SLC4A2 and resolve the contribution of osteopetrosis to the lethal phenotype of Slc4a2-/- mice; 2) Establish the requirement of SLC4A2 in a mouse model of inflammatory arthritis; 3) Perform a structure-function analysis of SLC4A2 in OCs and 4) Confirm a role for SLC4A2 in human OCs. I will take advantage of the unique environment in Boston to facilitate these studies. Collaborations have been established with local experts in anion exchange physiology, OC cell biology, mouse models of RA and RNA interference. By analyzing the function of a gene that so profoundly affects OC biology, this grant will advance basic understanding of skeletal remodeling, make important contributions to general cell biology and signal transduction and, most importantly, define a new target to suppress pathologic bone loss.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Dynamic remodeling of bone allows our skeleton to grow and adapt to stress, but makes it susceptible to diseases such as osteoporosis and rheumatoid arthritis. The only cell capable of destroying bone is the osteoclast, a multinucleated giant cell that secretes hydrochloric acid and proteolytic enzymes. This grant aims to better understand how osteoclasts work by probing the function of an ion exchanger (SLC4A2) that osteoclasts require to perform this remarkable, but often pathologic, feat.              Dynamic remodeling of bone allows our skeleton to grow and adapt to stress, but makes it susceptible to diseases such as osteoporosis and rheumatoid arthritis.

"Bacterial neurotoxicity as an environmental model for Parkinson disease    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson disease (PD) comprise a major societal burden with increasing occurrence as our mean population ages. Recent studies have demonstrated that bacteria of distinct Streptomyces species have the capacity to produce a neurotoxic metabolite that causes dopaminergic degeneration in the nematode model organism C. elegans and in human SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells. These bacteria are commonly found in soil environments and exposure to their excretions may be a contributor to PD, which is more prevalent in individuals with a rural lifestyle. While exposures to pesticides may be a partially responsible, these alone cannot account for prevalence of PD, even in rural areas. This R15 proposal utilizes C. elegans as a primary assay system for scoring dopamine (DA) neuron degeneration to explore mechanisms involved in Streptomyces-induced neurodegeneration. While chronic exposures to the toxic metabolite cause DA neurodegeneration, experiments will be performed to determine if acute exposure paradigms also result in neurodegeneration (Aim I). Established mutant and transgenic worm strains will be utilized to investigate whether differential degeneration is observed in distinct genetic backgrounds related to PD (Aim II). Cellular pathways associated with neurodegeneration, such as apoptosis, DA metabolism and mitochondrial function will also be assessed following exposure to the metabolite (Aim III). Finally, studies in human neuronal cell cultures will be conducted, both to validate results gleaned from the invertebrate system and to expand upon data demonstrating that the neurotoxic activity of the Streptomyces metabolite extends to these cultures (Aim IV). Taken together, these studies represent an integrated strategy to rapidly discern the significance of this novel environmental factor and its influence on neurodegeneration as it pertains to PD. Included among the broader impacts of this proposal are an understanding of one possible cause of health disparities in rural populations, in addition to training and mentorship of graduate and undergraduate students.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Parkinson's Disease (PD) is the most common movement disorder affecting over 1 million Americans, yet underlying causes of this neurodegenerative disease have largely eluded medical science. This proposal is designed to address an unmet challenge of discerning environmental factors that contribute to PD by investigating the potential for exposures to a toxic compound produced by common soil bacteria to enhance susceptibility to neurodegeneration over the course of aging. Through an integrated training and experimental strategy involving student-centered research, mechanisms underlying neurotoxicity will be explored using a whole animal model system, as well as human cell culture experiments, whereby outcomes include potentially establishing a new paradigm for understanding neurodegeneration that may aid in the development of models to advance diagnostic and therapeutic strategies to combat PD.           Parkinson's Disease (PD) is the most common movement disorder affecting over 1 million Americans, yet underlying causes of this neurodegenerative disease have largely eluded medical science.

"Asymmetric CD8+ T Cell Division in the Initiation of Immunity    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): CD8+ T cells play a critical role in host defense against microbes pertinent to biodefense. A hallmark of adaptive immunity against agents such as Listeria monocytogenes, LCMV virus, and Toxoplasma gondii is heterogeneity of cell fate among antigen-experienced CD8+ T cells. Substantial preliminary evidence outlined in this proposal indicates that the first division of a CD8+ T cell responding to a pathogen, in vivo, is characterized by unequal partitioning of proteins with established roles in signaling, cell fate specification, and asymmetric cell division. In addition, the first daughter T cells of the immune response appear to be differentially fated as precursors of the effector and memory lineages. This project will test whether asymmetric cell division is a general feature of the CD8+ T cell response against pathogens, whether ancestral regulators of cell polarity are responsible for establishing cytoskeletal features necessary for asymmetric division, and how asymmetrically inherited signaling proteins could mediate fate disparity in daughter T cells.

"HORMONAL INFLUENCES ON AIRWAY DISEASE    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   Airway diseases are the most common of the lung disorders, however, treatment for these illnesses remains inadequate. Epidemiologic data indicates that a gender disparity exists in patients with airway diseases including bronchiectasis, asthma, and chronic obstructive lung disease, with women demonstrating worse severity and outcomes along with an increased prevalence in some circumstances. Few studies have addressed the biologic basis of this disparity, but sex hormones are a potentially important variable. A full understanding of the hormonal influences on the airways may lead to novel therapies to help treat these debilitating illnesses. In airway disease, the mucociliary apparatus, made up of cilia, mucous, and airway epithelial cell surface liquid, plays a critical role in protecting the lung from pathogens and is a target for hormone regulation. Indeed, our preliminary data indicates that female sex hormones alter mucociliary function. Accordingly, the goal of this proposal is to determine the impact of sex hormones, specifically progesterone, on mucociliary clearance, as a basis of explanation for the gender disparity in airways diseases. The central hypothesis is that women have more severe airway diseases than men due to progesterone-mediated alterations in airway epithelial mucociliary function. The long term goals of these studies are to understand the mechanisms leading to gender differences in airway diseases, improve current treatment, and develop novel therapies.  To address these long term goals, we will apply a bench-to-bedside approach to this proposal by pursuing three specific aims at the in vitro, in vivo, and clinical levels. In Aim 1, we will characterize progesterone receptor expression, cell specificity, and receptor trafficking in primary human airway cells and in human lung tissues. In Aim 2, we will determine the impact of progesterone on mucociliary clearance by comparing cilia beat frequency of primary human airway epithelial cells in hormone stimulated conditions and by measuring airway clearance in hormone manipulated mice. We will also evaluate progesterone-dependent pathways that influence airway epithelial cell function to understand the mechanisms involved in sex hormone influences on mucociliary clearance. In Aim 3, using Cystic Fibrosis (CF) bronchiectasis as a model airway disease, we will utilize the national CF Foundation registry to retrospectively compare lung function and pulmonary exacerbations in men and women pre- and post-puberty and recruit CF bronchiectasis women locally to prospectively assess lung health during hormonal phases of the ovulatory cycle. Further understanding of these findings could lead to new therapeutic approaches involving inhaled hormone manipulation in bronchiectasis and other airway diseases. This work, in combination with a program of mentored research and a targeted educational program, will serve as the foundation for the PI's physician-scientist career.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Airway diseases are the most common of the lung diseases, and currently have limited therapies. Multiple epidemiologic studies indicate that women with airway diseases have increased severity and worse outcomes than men. The objective of this proposal is to identify the influences of sex hormones on mucociliary clearance and the pathways involved. These findings could lead to novel therapeutic approaches involving inhaled hormone manipulation in patients with bronchiectasis and other airway diseases such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.            Airway diseases are the most common of the lung diseases, and currently have limited therapies.

"Phosphosulindac, miRNAs and cancer racial disparity    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Epidemiological data has demonstrated that colon cancer is disproportional in incidence and mortality between Caucasians and African Americans (AA). Whereas socioeconomic and dietary differences contribute to this disparity other underlying factors must be involved. For instance, the response to chemopreventive agents is different between these two populations. Since chemopreventive agents exert their effect through a molecular target, this disparity would suggest differences at the genetic level. Therefore, the generation and evaluation of chemopreventive agents that address the issue of chemo-resistance is essential. A promising colon cancer chemopreventive agent, phospho-sulindac (P-S), inhibits colon cancer cell growth more potently than sulindac by inhibiting cell proliferation and enhancing cell killing. However, very little is known about the molecular targets in the cancer cell that are responsible for this effect. Our hypothesis, based on preliminary results, is that miRNA expression/regulation differs between AA and Caucasians and this difference may account, at least in part, a) for the differential response to chemoprevention and b) for the differential incidence of colorectal cancer. To test these hypotheses, we propose the following three specific aims: 1) To study the effect of P-S on p53, NF-kB, 2-catenin, and cell kinetics in human colon cancer cell lines originating from Caucasians and AA; 2) To assess the effect of P- S on the miRNA profile in a p53 null murine model of colon cancer; and, 3) Determine the miRNA profile in human colon cancer samples from AA and Caucasian patients. The results from these findings will lead to the understanding of a worldwide issue and provide details for the development of chemopreventive agents that will span diverse populations.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We will define the mechanisms by which P-S exert its inhibitory effect on the growth of colon cancer cells and address racial disparities as a result of genetic mutations. We will evaluate in cell culture, using cell lines derived from Caucasians and AA colon cancer tissues, changes (by microarray analysis) in the expression of transcription factors and miRNAs. In addition, we will test whether our in vitro findings are relevant to a preclinical model of colon cancer. This study will evaluate directly in a p53 null and C57BL/6 (parent background) mice model the effect of P-S on the expressions of transcription factors and miRNAs. Thereby, we will test the key mechanistic findings from the in vitro study. Lastly, we will compare and contrast prospective and retrospective colon cancer tissue of Caucasians and AA at the protein, RNA, and DNA levels. Being able to demonstrate that P-S induces a potentially important molecular change in the malignant colonocytes that may be relevant to its pharmacological actions in cancer would indicate an important breakthrough in the prevention of colon cancer. Also, being able to attribute a genetic causative effect to resistance to chemotherapeutic agents will address the issue of racial disparity.

"NCMHD Southeastern Exploratory Sickle Cell Center of Excellence    DESCRIPTION: Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a genetic disorder of hemoglobin and afflicts ~110,000 African-Americans in the US. Because of its complex pathophysiology through chronic hemolytic anemia, microvascularocclusion, and a chronic inflammatory state, it affects multiple organ systems and leads to significant morbidity and organ damage as well as leads to frequent hospitalizations and health care encounters. During the past 35 years, primarily through research and patient care conducted by the NIH funded Comprehensive Sickle Cell Centers and some pivotal clinical trials, the life expectancy of patients with SCD has increased from the teens to mid- to late forties. This is still considerably shorter than that of African-Americans who do not have sickle cell disease and can be viewed as a major disparity even in this underserved minority population. While significant advances have been made in the understanding of the disease pathophysiology and in novel therapies through basic and translational research, these advances have been slow to be taken to clinical practice. The Southeastern Exploratory Sickle Cell Center of Excellence seeks to improve the care and quality of life of the SCD patient population by i) investigating the basic mechanism of action of a highly successful and effective hemoglobin F inducing drug, hydroxyurea, ii) identifying genetic variations underlying the frequency of pain, response to narcotics, and thus addressing the important issue of biologic/genetic bases of pain and its under treatment leading to the stigmatization of many SCD patients and its resulting disparity, iii) investigating the medical, social, and economic reasons for underutilization of hydroxyurea in SCD, iv) training primary care physicians with evidence based medicine in the care of patients with SCD, given the sobering reality that there will not be enough specialists in non-malignant hematology to meet the needs of the growing adult SCD population, and v) implementing innovative methods and concepts for the care of SCD patients in the ED and for transitioning from pediatric to adult care. Relieving the health disparity of SCD patients is the primary goal of this application.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Sickle cell disease in the United States primarily affects African-Americans and is considered an orphan disease. Because of the lack of knowledge of health care providers in the management and treatment of painful episodes and other complications of this disease, patients are most often undertreated or not treated at all, which has created an enormous health disparity for these patients.",NCMHD Southeastern Exploratory Sickle Cell Center of Excellence,8011095,P20MD003383,[''],NIMHD,AUGUSTA UNIVERSITY,P20,2011,2293394,0.04988924315436819
"Targeting pERK1/2 in Human Mammary Cancer Stem Cells    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Breast cancer is a complex disease associated with specific morphological and clinical features. Significant health disparity and high mortality rate is reported in African American (AA) patients, who suffer from unique and highly aggressive breast tumors. AA triple negative (TN) breast cancer patients suffer worse outcomes to chemotherapy compared with Caucasian women. Aggressive TN breast tumors contain poorly differentiated cells and express embryonic stem cell specific gene sets. These poorly differentiated mammary cancer stem cells (MCSCs) are the most tumorigenic cell types that drive initiation and progression of breast cancers. RAS/Raf/ERK1/2 signaling cascade has been found to promote every aspect of breast tumor progression including aggressive behavior like high angiogenesis and motility. We hypothesize that ""Mammary cancer stem cells drive aggressive TN breast tumors in AA women through sustained ERK1/2 signaling."" We will test this hypothesis with the following Specific Aims: 1) Establish whether mammary cancer stem cells from AA TN breast tumors form aggressive xenografts in nude mice. 2) Examine whether sustained ERK1/2 increases aggressive behavior of mammary cancer stem cells enriched mammospheres from AA TN breast tumors. 3) Examine whether inhibition of ERK1/2 signaling is effective in attenuating aggressive properties of mammary cancer stem cells from AA TN breast tumors. Fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) will be used to enrich MCSCs (Lin-/CD44+/CD24- /ALDH1+) from TN AA and Caucasian breast tumors, which will injected into the nude mice to form xenotransplants. These xenografts will be used to compare tumor volume, expression of angiogenesis stimulating factors (VEGF, CD31, MMP9), and motility of cells (Boyden Chamber Assay) between the two groups. MCSCs will also be enriched as mammospheres and pERK1/2-mediated effect on cell motility and expression of angiogenesis stimulating factors will be analyzed. ERK1/2 signaling will be attenuated in MCSCs by Nup153 shRNA and its effect on tumor promoting behavior will be analyzed both in vitro and in vivo. Increased understanding of the critical role of ERK1/2 signaling in MCSCs from AA patients and may provide novel targets for therapeutic drug design.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project will test the effectiveness of phospho-ERK1/2 targeting in human mammary cancer stem cells isolated from African American and Caucasian patients. Mammary cancer stem cells will be isolated from the discarded fresh tissue samples from patient and their ability to form tumors in Nude mice will be tested before and after inhibition of ERK1/2 signaling.

"Tumorigenic role of mitochondria in African-American women    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Mitochondria perform multiple cellular functions. These functions include ATP production via oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), control of cell growth, cell death, development and various metabolic pathways. OXPHOS is coupled through a series of oxido-reduction reactions catalyzed by five mitochondrial OXPHOS complexes (Complex I, II, III, IV and V). Of the 86 subunits that make up the mitochondrial OXPHOS system, mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) encodes 13 subunits. The rest are encoded by nuclear DNA (nDNA). Interestingly, studies in the past few years have described the risk of various cancers associated with polymorphism in mitochondrial OXPHOS genes. Studies show the 10398 G to A (G10398A) base substitution in the mtDNA-encoded ND3 gene (NADH dehydrogenase 3) subunit of complex I increases the risk of invasive breast cancer in African-American women (Canter et al 2005).The G to A substitution results in an amino acid change from alanine (encoded by the G allele) to threonine (encoded by the A allele). This G10398A substitution is found in 5% of the African-American population (Canter et al 2005). To understand the contribution of ND3 G10398A gene substitution associated with invasive breast cancer in African-American women, we generated a cell line completely devoid of mtDNA (mtDNA- knockout or rhoo or ?0). We used this rhoo cell line to develop a cybrid cell culture model for introducing the G10398A mtDNA variant into the isogenic nuclear background (trans-mitochondrial cybrid). We demonstrate that the G10398A variant confers increased complex I activity, resistance against cell death, and increased tumorigenicity. Based on these observations, we hypothesize that ND3 G10398A affects expression of nDNA encoded subunits of complex I, which contributes to increased complex I activity, resistance against cell death and tumorigenicity. To address the above hypothesis, we will: Aim 1: Determine G10398A-induced changes in subunit gene expression and composition of complex I. Mitochondrial complex I represents the largest and the least understood multimeric OXPHOS complex. It is composed of 45 subunits. Of these, 38 subunits are encoded by nDNA and 7 (including ND3) are encoded by mtDNA. To investigate whether increased complex I activity associated with G10398A (Kulawiec et al. 2009A) is due to increased expression of subunits, we will use a focused OXPHOS array developed in our laboratory to measure changes in the gene expression of all 45 subunits. To investigate whether alterations in complex I gene expression affect complex I composition, we will use blue native PAGE, which allows for measurement of the amounts of the respiratory complexes in their native state. Aim 2: Determine a role for NDUFA13/GRIM19 (an essential complex I regulatory subunit) in resistance to cell death and tumorigenesis. Of the 45 subunits that make up complex I, NDUFA13/GRIM19 (the gene associated with retinoid interferon induced mortality) acts as a death regulator protein (Zhang et al 2003, Lufei et al 2003) and is involved in tumorigenesis (Maximo et al 2008, Nallar et al 2008). NDUFA13/GRIM19 is also an essential component of complex I. It plays an indispensable role in the assembly and enzymatic activity of complex I (Huang et al 2004). Our study suggests that G10398A confers resistance against cell death and induces tumorigenesis (Kulawiec et al 2009). We will therefore determine whether the G10398A-associated resistance against cell death and tumorigenesis is due to changes in gene expression and/or posttranscriptional modification of GRIM19/NDUFA13. Our grant proposal addresses the two key objectives of the program announcement PAR-09-160 requesting exploratory/development grants program in basic cancer research in cancer health disparities (R21). These objectives include: 1) the development of ""new cell culture models/systems designed to investigate cancer disparities"" and 2) explores the susceptibility to breast cancer in African-American women due to ""genetic differences"" in mtDNA. The G10398A transmitochondrial cybrid system developed in our laboratory has the potential to enhance breast cancer research in the African-American population.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: In the last few years, several epidemiological studies have reported the increased risk of breast (and other) cancer associated with mtDNA polymorphisms in the African-American population. However, a mechanistic understanding of how certain mtDNA polymorphisms induce cancer is lacking. The proposed study will help determine the mechanism underlying G10398A induced tumorigenicity in African-American women. Innovative aspects of this project include the development of a G10398A transmitochondrial cybrid cell line. This cell line will serve as an important tool for the proposed studies. It will permit the mechanistic analysis of African-American polymorphic mtDNA in an isogenic nuclear background. The proposed cybrid model will pave the way to analyze the relevance of other mtDNA polymorphisms and epistatic interaction (i.e. synergy) between individual polymorphic loci within the mitochondrial genome in the African-American population. .          PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: In the last few years, several epidemiological studies have reported the increased risk of breast (and other) cancer associated with mtDNA polymorphisms in the African-American population.

"Sexual Dimorphism and Dysregulated Immune Responses in SLE: The Role of Leptin    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal aims to advance the current understanding of the cellular and molecular immune events that associate with the increased susceptibility to develop systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) in females. Gender disparities associate with several biological differences that most apparently involve an evident dissimilarity between sexes in the levels of sex hormones and their receptors. However, although very important, the differences in the expression and responsiveness to sex hormones may not be sufficient to fully explain the increased incidence of SLE in females. During the past decade, our group has been interested in investigating the effects of the hormone adipokine leptin on immune responses. We and others have shown that this sexually dimorphic hormone - found at concentrations 5-10 times higher in females than in males with similar body mass index - has proinflammatory activities that greatly favor the development and the progression of several autoimmune diseases including SLE. We have also shown that leptin constraints the ability of regulatory T cells to suppress autoreactive immune responses in vitro and in vivo, and together with others we have shown that regulatory T cells can modulate SLE disease activity. Here we propose to dissect the effects of leptin on regulatory T cells in SLE by testing the hypothesis that elevated levels of leptin in females can modulate key characteristics of the regulatory T cells in SLE. Three integrated aims will study the influence of leptin on the phenotype and function of regulatory T cells in SLE at the cellular, molecular and biochemical levels. By identifying specific events that can be modulated by leptin in SLE, we aim to ultimately identify surrogate markers of therapeutic intervention that could lead to a better management of the disease.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: In this application we will explore new mechanisms that may contribute to the increased susceptibility to develop systemic lupus erythematosus ( SLE) in females. We will investigate the role of a hormone that is expressed in much higher concentration in females as a possible major contributor to the pathogenesis of SLE. The role of this hormone, leptin, will be investigated in great detail for its capacity to inhibit the activity of cells that suppress autoimmunity in SLE, as preliminary work seems to suggest.           In this application we will explore new mechanisms that may contribute to the increased susceptibility to develop systemic lupus erythematosus ( SLE) in females.

"CD4+ T cells in Invasive Aspergillosis Dr. Amariliz Rivera is a newly appointed, tenure-track, assistant professor at the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey-New Jersey Medical School (UMDNJ-NJMS). Dr. Rivera is a woman of Puerto Rican descent who is committed to a career as a successful, independent scientist. Her scientific interest lies in performing research with the potential to better the therapeutic options of cancer patients afflicted with opportunistic fungal infections. Dr. Rivera's long-term career goals are: to become a recognized expert in fungal immunology, to establish a successful, well-funded research program and to be a tenured professor with the influence to contribute to diminishing the health disparities in our country. In the short term, she aspires to secure funding to support her new laboratory and its future members and to successfully complete the scientific aims proposed in this application. To attain these goals Dr. Rivera will participate in a variety of programs aimed at promoting her career development including workshops for: grant writing, presentation skills, lab management and leadership. Moreover, Drs. Gause and Salgame will be Amariliz's career development mentors. Both scientists have well-funded laboratories and are tenured-professors who have successfully trained other junior faculty. They will provide personalized advise on her career progression, will review her grants and papers and will guide her through the tenure process.   UMDNJ-NJMS is committed to Dr. Rivera's success as a scientist. She has been provided with a fully equipped laboratory and adjacent office as well as with ample space in the vivarium for her mouse strains. More importantly, she will be given protected time to focus on performing research and establishing her laboratory. Dr. Rivera will have access to a diversity of core facilities to aid in her studies and she will be surrounded by a community of fellow scientists with diverse expertise and willingness to help in her career progression. Dr. Rivera's career will also benefit from being a member of the Hispanic Center for Excellence (HCOE) where she will participate in activities specifically designed to enhance the academic performance of individuals from underserved backgrounds. Moreover, through HCOE Dr. Rivera will have the professional support of fellow scientists with common personal backgrounds.   The scientific goals of the studies proposed in this K22 application are centered in understanding and exploiting CD4 T lymphocytes in defense against fungal disease. Cancer patients that receive treatment for hematologic malignancies or bone marrow transplantation are at increased risk for developing invasive aspergillosis (IA). IA is a difficult to treat, opportunistic infection with reported mortality rates in excess of 50%. The most common causative agent of IA is Aspergillus fumigatus, a mold frequently present in the environment. Immune based therapies with the potential to benefit IA include vaccination and adoptive T cell transfers. The advancement of such immune-based therapies has been hampered by a lack of understanding of what constitutes protective A.fumigatus-specific, memory CD4 T cell responses and how are they elicited and regulated. In previous studies Dr. Rivera generated a T cell receptor transgenic mouse specific for A. fumigatus (Af3.16-TCR-tg) to track the in vivo activation, trafficking and differentiation of fungus-specific CD4 T cells. Her previous studies dissected the specific contributions of innate cells and innate receptors in shaping fungus-specific CD4 T cell differentiation in response to a primary, pulmonary infection with A.fumigatus spores. In the proposed studies she would further exploit Af3.16-TCR-tg mice to assess the formation of memory CD4 T cell responses to A.fumigatus. The specific aims of the proposed studies are: 1) Determine the impact of immune regulatory mechanisms in controlling fungus-specific CD4 T cell memory formation, 2) To examine the role of innate cell subsets and innate receptors in regulating the expansion and differentiation of fungus- specific CD4 T cell memory responses, 3) To establish optimal adoptive T cell therapies for diverse models of invasive fungal disease. Altogether, the proposed studies would significantly further our understanding of A.fumigatus-specific CD4 T cell memory formation, regulation and potential therapeutic benefit. Moreover, the successful completion of the proposed studies is likely to contribute to the development of novel therapeutic interventions to combat invasive fungal diseases. Invasive Aspergillosis (IA) is an opportunistic fungal infection that affects cancer patients with hematologic malignancies. The studies proposed in this application are aimed at identifying crucial immune cells, receptors and regulatory factors that control the formation of protective memory CD4 T cell responses against the causative agent of IA and to explore innovative adoptive T cell transfer strategies for the treatment of IA. Altogether, these studies will have important implications for the development of novel anti-fungal vaccines and immune based therapies against clinically important fungi.",CD4+ T cells in Invasive Aspergillosis,8164951,K22CA160874,"['defined contribution ', ' Hematologic Neoplasms ', ' Malignant Hematologic Neoplasm ', ' Hematopoietic Cancer ', ' Hematological Tumor ', ' Hematological Neoplasms ', ' Hematological Malignancies ', ' Hematologic Malignancies ', ' Hematologic Cancer ', ' vaccination strategy ', ' New Jersey ', ' Secure ', ' Adjuvant ', ' Mycoses ', ' fungus infection ', ' fungal infection ', ' Fungus Diseases ', ' Molds ', ' Filamentous Fungi ', ' Vaccination ', ' Interferons ', ' IFN ', ' fungus ', ' Antifungal Agents ', ' antifungals ', ' anti-fungal ', ' Therapeutic Fungicides ', ' Antifungal Drug ', ' Dentistry ', ' Receptor Cell ', ' Opportunistic Infections ', ' willingness ', ' Bone Marrow Transplantation ', ' Marrow Transplantation ', ' Bone Marrow Transplant ', ' Bone Marrow Grafting ', ' memory CD4 T lymphocyte ', ' memory CD4 T cell ', ' Core Facility ', ' T-Lymphocyte ', ' thymus derived lymphocyte ', ' Thymus-Dependent Lymphocytes ', ' T-Cells ', ' Commit ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' diverse populations ', ' T-Cell Activation ', ' Immunotherapy ', ' immune therapy ', ' Immunologically Directed Therapy ', ' career development ', ' chemotherapy ', ' Leadership ', ' T cell differentiation ', ' medical schools ', ' school of medicine ', ' medical college ', ' interest ', ' Paper ', ' T cell response ', ' Woman ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' Vaccines ', ' Cell Therapy ', ' cell-based therapy ', ' Faculty ', ' novel therapeutic intervention ', ' novel therapeutic approach ', ' new therapeutic intervention ', ' new therapeutic approach ', ' skills ', ' monocyte ', ' Marrow monocyte ', ' Blood monocyte ', ' trafficking ', ' Country ', ' Lung ', ' pulmonary ', ' Lung Respiratory System ', ' Mouse Strains ', ' CD4 Positive T Lymphocytes ', ' helper T cell ', ' T4 Lymphocytes ', ' T4 Cells ', ' CD4-Positive Lymphocytes ', ' CD4+ T-Lymphocyte ', ' CD4+ T cell ', ' CD4 lymphocyte ', ' CD4 T cells ', ' CD4 Cells ', ' Immune ', ' Immune system ', ' allergic/immunologic organ system ', ' allergic/immunologic body system ', ' Performance ', ' success ', ' treatment strategy ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Immune response ', ' immunoresponse ', ' host response ', ' combat ', ' Communities ', ' Transgenic Mice ', ' IL2RA gene ', ' TCGFR ', ' IL2RA ', ' IL2R ', ' CD25 ', ' Medicine ', ' receptor ', ' Receptor Protein ', ' Prevention ', ' pathogen ', ' novel vaccines ', ' next generation vaccines ', ' new vaccines ', ' professor ', ' Immunology ', ' Educational workshop ', ' Workshop ', ' Writing ', ' member ', ' Regulatory T-Lymphocyte ', ' regulatory T-cells ', ' Treg ', ' Infection ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Mus ', ' Murine ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Mice ', ' Regulation ', ' Scientist ', ' T-Cell Receptor ', ' Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell ', ' Major Histocompatibility Complex Receptor ', ' MHC Receptor ', ' Research ', ' Grant ', ' Shapes ', ' Dendritic Cells ', ' Veiled Cells ', ' Future ', ' Reporting ', ' Universities ', ' novel ', ' Patients ', ' Goals ', ' programs ', ' Address ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' in vivo ', ' Process ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Affect ', ' Training ', ' Funding ', ' Predisposition ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' base ', ' career ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' response ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Man (Taxonomy) ', ' Environment ', ' Population ', ' Production ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Mortality ', ' cytokine ', ' Cancer Patient ', ' Laboratories ', ' Cells ', ' Modeling ', ' Risk ', ' Play ', ' Time ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Inflammation ', ' Individual ', ' Mentors ', ' Hispanics ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' dectin 1 ', ' Fungal Vaccines ', ' Grant Review ', ' Aspergillus fumigatus ', ' Th1 Cells ', ' Type 1 Helper Cell ', ' Th-1 Cell ', ' Puerto Rican ', ' Reproduction spores ', ' Spores ', ' Aspergillosis ', ' ']",NCI,UNIV OF MED/DENT OF NJ-NJ MEDICAL SCHOOL,K22,2011,186192,0.19647506939563383
"Regulation of memory T cell responses during Ehrlichiosis    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Human monocytotropic ehrlichiosis (HME) is the most prevalent emerging tick-borne infectious disease caused by Ehrlichia chaffeensis, Gram negative obligate intracellular bacteria. The proposed studies will utilize two specific Ehrlichia strains; Ehrlichia muris, which causes persistent infection, and Ixodes ovatus Ehrlichia (IOE), which causes either lethal or sub-lethal infection, depending on the dose and route of inoculation. These models faithfully recapitulate mild and severe HME. Our studies have revealed that mice persistently infected with E. muris, but not mice that lack persistent infection or mice infected with the sub-lethal IOE infection that fails to establish persistent infection, are indeed protected against heterologous re-challenge with ordinarily lethal dose of IOE. Heterologous protection is mediated primarily by CD4+ type-1 memory responses and antigen specific IgG antibody response, while fatal primary and secondary ehrlichiosis is due to an extensive tissue injury mediated by Ehrlichia specific CD8+ T cells. Our preliminary data reveal that persistent E. muris infection is associated with substantial expansion of T regulatory cells, increased TGF-beta production in the spleens, and absence of immune mediated pathology following infection with IOE. These data indicate that we lack the fundamental understanding of the regulatory mechanisms that control the induction and maintenance of protective T cell memory and prevent the development of immunopathology upon secondary challenge, which is a prerequisite to developing an effective vaccine against HME. We will address this specific gap in our knowledge in the following two specific aims. In specific aim 1, we will determine the magnitude, phenotype, and function of memory T cells maintained in the presence or absence of persistent ehrlichial infection in C57BL/6 mice. Specific aim 2 will determine the role of T regulatory cells and TGF-beta in the persistence of ehrlichial infections, prevention of organ injury, and maintenance of protective memory T cell responses. The experiments utilize state-of-the art techniques such as multiparamter flow cytometry. Our study is significant as it address the strong need for balancing protective immunity and immunopathology in designing effective vaccination strategies. Knowledge generated therein will benefit vaccine development efforts not only against Ehrlichia but also, against other intracellular pathogens that are controlled by cell mediated immunity, which will significantly have major health impact.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Human monocytic ehrlichiosis is a major public health problem in many parts of the United States, due in part to the lack of a vaccine and inadequate therapy. The development of a vaccine for HME is lacking due to limited understanding of how to stimulate the memory T cells required for vaccine induced immunity. This proposal will determine how memory T cells are generated, maintained and regulated using a unique experimental animal model of the disease. The results from these experiments will provide a solid foundation of knowledge for the timely development of an effective and safe vaccine against ehrlichiosis.              Narrative: Human monocytic ehrlichiosis is a major public health problem in many parts of the United States, due in part to the lack of a vaccine and inadequate therapy.

"Determining the roles(s) of HIV-1 Nef in enhancement of virion infectivity    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): HIV-1 Nef has many functions that work to enhance the pathogenicity of HIV and SIV which are important for the progression to AIDS. One such function is the enhancement of infectivity of virions that contain the Nef gene. Various investigators have shown an array of effects on virion infectivity from changes in cholesterol content of virions (a producer cell effect) to proposed effects on the process of reverse transcription (a target cell effect). Unfortunately, many of these studies have been done using different viruses and different cell systems and the conclusions have not always been directly comparable. The goal of this project will be cells, virions, and target to investigate the potential effects of Nef on producer cells in the same project. We will take advantage of several unique approaches that have been developed in our lab to study the effects of Nef in three contexts: 1. Nef expressed in producer cells, but containing mutations that prevent incorporation into virions. 2. Nef directly delivered to virions by fusion of virions with secreted Nef vesicles. 3. Nef-GFP labeled virions to allow tracking of Nef after fusion and entry. Completion of these experiments will allow us to better understand at which stages of the viral life cycle Nef can exert an effect on infectivity. A better understanding of how Nef modulates virion infectivity would provide the basis for developing therapeutics based on this mechanism. In light of the difficulties in finding an effective vaccine, a better understanding of the basic functions of Nef and other viral proteins could provide an alternative to control viral infectivity. In the past decade the search for an HIV/AIDS vaccine has been more difficult than anyone would have anticipated. To date, the production of new antiviral drugs has provided the greatest success we have had in reducing deaths due to AIDS. Therefore, it is important to continue to study basic viral replication in the effort to find new antiviral strategies. The goal of this project is to advance our understanding of how the HIV virus controls its own infectivity. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: With support from the Kirschstein fellowship, I aim to prepare ultimately for a meaningful and prolific career in academia or being an adept researcher at the National Institutes of Health or Centers for Disease Control studying minority health disparities. The research training proposed in this application will greatly facilitate achievement of this long-term goal in a number of ways. First, it will facilitate acquisition of various technical skills (e.g. cloning, immuno-cytochemistry) which will certainly prove Instrumental in post-doctoral work. Secondly, and perhaps more importantly, accomplishment of this training will foster the development of the critical thinking skills required for independent research. Moreover, support from this fellowship and training program will allow me to attend conferences and present my work, thus promoting effective communication skills.           ",Determining the roles(s) of HIV-1 Nef in enhancement of virion infectivity,8132805,F31AI083167,"['myristoylation ', ' Methionine ', ' L-Methionine ', ' L-Isomer Methionine ', ' Controlled Study ', ' Leucine ', ' L-Leucine ', ' L-Isomer Leucine ', ' Pathogenicity ', ' Academia ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Thinking, function ', ' thoughts ', ' Thinking ', ' in vitro Assay ', ' success ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' HIV ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' research study ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' Training ', ' Viral ', ' Antiviral Agents ', ' Antivirals ', ' Antiviral Drugs ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immunologic Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immuno-Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency ', ' AIDS ', ' Communication ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' base ', ' Health ', ' Procedures ', ' inhibitor/antagonist ', ' inhibitor ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Process ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Research ', ' Virus ', ' General Viruses ', ' Production ', ' Research Training ', ' mutant ', ' Training Programs ', ' Fellowship ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' CDC ', ' Fostering ', ' career ', ' Play ', ' System ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' Staging ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Mutation ', ' genome mutation ', ' Genetic defect ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' symposium ', ' conference ', ' Testing ', ' Label ', ' Cholesterol ', ' Cholest-5-en-3-ol (3beta)- ', ' Vesicle ', ' Data ', ' insight ', ' skills ', ' Cells ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Proteins ', ' gene product ', ' Goals ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' Work ', ' Complex ', ' Infection ', ' Beryllium ', ' Be element ', ' Capsid ', ' coat (nonenveloped virus) ', ' SIV ', ' Simian Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' Image Analysis ', ' image evaluation ', ' Image Analyses ', ' Viral Proteins ', ' virus protein ', ' Viral Gene Proteins ', ' Viral Gene Products ', ' Magnetism ', ' magnetic ', ' Confocal Microscopy ', ' Cloning ', ' Cytoskeleton ', ' intracellular skeleton ', ' Cytoskeletal System ', ' Cellular Matrix ', ' Virion ', ' Virus Particle ', ' AIDS/HIV problem ', ' HIV/AIDS problem ', ' HIV/AIDS ', ' AIDS/HIV ', ' crosslink ', ' cross-link ', ' HIV-1 ', ' human T lymphotropic virus III ', ' human T cell leukemia virus III ', ' Human immunodeficiency virus 1 ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Virus Type 1 ', ' HIV1 ', ' HIV-I ', ' Achievement ', ' Achievement Attainment ', ' Life Cycle Stages ', ' life course ', ' Life Cycle ', ' Human Resources ', ' personnel ', ' Manpower ', ' Photons ', ' Vaccines ', ' Actins ', ' Postdoctoral Fellow ', ' post-doctoral ', ' post-doc ', ' Research Associate ', ' Postdoc ', ' N-terminal ', ' NH2-terminal ', ' nef Genes ', "" HIV-3'-orf Genes "", ' cytochemistry ', ' Cytochemistry Histology ', ' Fellowship Program ', ' UV induced ', ' ultraviolet induced ', ' nef Protein ', ' PTPRC gene ', ' T200 ', ' PTPRC ', ' LY5 ', ' GP180 ', ' CD45 ', ' B220 ', ' Nucleosome Core Particle ', ' Nucleosome Core ', ' Core Particle ', ' genetic element ', ' Reverse Transcription ', ' minority health ', ' ']",NIAID,MOREHOUSE SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,F31,2011,38728,0.14560782434675798
"Antigen Specific T Cell tolerance by Anti CD3 Antibodies    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Transplantation of hematopoietic stem cells from an allogeneic donor can be followed by serious graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) despite the best available regimen for immune suppression. Experimental animal data and results of clinical trials have demonstrated that T cells play a central role in GVHD. Recent advances in understanding the mechanisms of peripheral T cell tolerance have made it feasible to test the hypothesis that GVHD can be prevented in man by T cell receptor (TCR) partial agonist ligands through the selective depletion of alloreactive T cells. Transplantation tolerance is facilitated by activation-induced cell death (AICD) of peripheral T cells triggered by the specific alloantigens, and TCR signals are indispensable for induction of antigen-specific tolerance. TCR engagement can induce either T cell proliferation and differentiation or AICD. Monoclonal antibodies (mAb) to CD3, a monomorphic chain associated to the TCR complex, mimic antigen and induce TCR signaling and T cell activation. Fc receptor (FcR)-binding anti-CD3 mAbs recruit antigen-presenting cells (APC) and deliver full agonist signals that promote T cell proliferation and effector functions, independent of antigen. In contrast, non-FcR-binding anti-CD3 mAbs induce a partial agonist TCR signaling pattern causing anergy in naive T cells and AICD in antigen-activated, cycling T cells. In mice, we found that non-FcR-binding anti-CD3 mAbs induce selective depletion of donor T cells that recognize recipient alloantigens thereby preventing GVHD across MHC disparities, and spare T cell specific to third party antigens. In collaboration with J. Tso, we designed a `humanized' non-FcR-binding anti-CD3 mAb, visilizumab, which delivers a partial agonist signal to the TCR. Visilizumab is more effective than other anti-CD3 mAbs in inducing AICD of activated, cycling human T cells. Our preliminary results in human trials show that visilizumab can induce complete clinical responses in some patients with severe acute GVHD, refractory to conventional immune suppressive agents. We propose here to study efficacy of visilizumab in the prevention of GVHD after hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) from HLA incompatible donors, and assess whether its immune suppressive effects are selective for alloantigens. We will pursue the following specific aims: Aim 1: Determine the safety and efficacy of humanized non-FcR-binding anti-CD3 mAb visilizumab in preventing severe GVHD after transplantation of T-replete hematopoietic cell grafts from HLA-incompatible donors. Aim 2: Investigate whether visilizumab therapy depletes the alloreactive T cell pool, while sparing immunity to third party alloantigens, cytomegalovirus (CMV) and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), and tumor- associated antigen WT1. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The development of effective regimens for the prevention of GVHD will improve patient safety and survival after transplantation, and extend the use of this procedure to a larger number of patients. Progress in the prevention of GVHD has the potential for advancing the fields of organ transplantation and therapy for autoimmune disorders. Anti-CD3 mAbs represent the prototype of a new class of therapeutic agents that suppress the immune system by inducing an abortive activation and T cell death. What makes anti-CD3 mAbs unique and more attractive than other agents is the potential for achieving immunological tolerance rapidly and irreversibly. Showing that non-FcR-binding anti-CD3 mAbs spare T cells specific for viral and tumor-associated antigens is key to predict patient safety.          ",Antigen Specific T Cell tolerance by Anti CD3 Antibodies,8120238,R01CA132197,"['animal data ', ' Allogenic ', ' Acute Graft Versus Host Disease ', ' Acute GVHD ', ' Antigen-Presenting Cells ', ' accessory cell ', ' Monocytes / Macrophages / APC ', ' Immunologic Accessory Cells ', ' man ', "" man's "", ' Doctor of Medicine ', ' M.D. ', ' Cytomegalovirus ', ' human cytomegalovirus ', ' cytomegalovirus group ', ' Salivary Gland Viruses ', ' HCMV ', ' CMV ', ' Graft-vs-Host Disease ', ' Runt Disease ', ' Homologous Wasting Disease ', ' Graft-Versus-Host Disease ', ' GVHD ', ' patient safety ', ' Visilizumab ', ' Nuvion ', ' T-Cell Receptor ', ' Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell ', ' Major Histocompatibility Complex Receptor ', ' MHC Receptor ', ' receptor binding ', ' Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation ', ' HSC transplantation ', ' Infectious Agent ', ' infectious organism ', ' Immunity ', ' Monoclonal Antibodies ', ' Clinical Treatment Moab ', ' Regimen ', ' Viral ', ' T-Lymphocyte ', ' thymus derived lymphocyte ', ' Thymus-Dependent Lymphocytes ', ' T-Cells ', ' Tumor Antigens ', ' tumor-specific antigen ', ' Tumor-Associated Antigen ', ' Autoimmune Diseases ', ' autoimmune disorder ', ' Organ Transplantation ', ' organ xenograft ', ' organ graft ', ' organ allograft ', ' Transplantation Surgery ', ' Organ Transplants, Including Bone Marrow for DCT ', ' Organ Transplants ', ' Grafting Procedure ', ' Clinical, Transplantation, Organ ', ' T-Cell Proliferation ', ' Cell Transplantation ', ' Immune system ', ' allergic/immunologic organ system ', ' allergic/immunologic body system ', ' Safety ', ' Grant ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' prototype ', ' disorder prevention ', ' disease prevention ', ' Clinical ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' clinical investigation ', ' Pattern ', ' T-Cell Activation ', ' Play ', ' Cell Differentiation process ', ' Cell Differentiation ', ' Antigens ', ' immunogen ', ' ATGN ', ' response ', ' improved ', ' Transplantation ', ' transplant ', ' Procedures ', ' Agonist ', ' Health ', ' Therapeutic Agents ', ' Principal Investigator ', ' Complex ', ' Refractory ', ' Collaborations ', ' Peripheral ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Man (Taxonomy) ', ' programs ', ' Immune ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' recruit ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Cells ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Patients ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Hematopoietic ', ' Proteins ', ' gene product ', ' Mus ', ' Murine ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Mice ', ' Ligands ', ' Prevention ', ' Testing ', ' Natural immunosuppression ', ' immunosuppression ', ' immune suppression ', ' Immunosuppressive Effect ', ' Immunosuppressions (Physiology) ', ' Immunosuppression Effect ', ' Cell Death ', ' necrocytosis ', ' Receptor Signaling ', ' Regulatory T-Lymphocyte ', ' regulatory T-cells ', ' Treg ', ' Mediating ', ' CD3 Antigens ', ' T3 molecule ', ' T3 Complex ', ' T3 Antigens ', ' OKT3 antigen ', ' CD3 molecule ', ' CD3 Complex ', ' CD3 ', ' Human Herpesvirus 4 ', ' human herpesvirus 4 group ', ' Infectious Mononucleosis Virus ', ' Herpesvirus 4 (gamma), Human ', ' HHV-4 ', ' Epstein-Barr Virus ', ' Epstein Barr Virus ', ' EB virus ', ' E-B Virus ', ' Burkitt Lymphoma Virus ', ' Burkitt Herpesvirus ', ' Alloantigen ', ' Transplantation Tolerance ', ' Fc Receptor ', ' antibody receptor ', ' Monoclonal Antibody HuM291 ', ' MoAb HuM291 ', ' HuM291 ', ' HUM291 [Anti-CD3 Antibody] ', ' Anti-CD3 Antibody ', ' WT1 gene ', ' Wilms tumor suppressor WT1 ', ' Wilms Tumor 1 ', ' WT33 ', ' WT1 ', ' WAGR ', ' anergy ', ' ']",NCI,H.

"Natural killer cell genetics and cancer    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Natural killer (NK) cells, the third major population of lymphocytes, have the capacity to kill tumor and virus-infected cells and to produce immuno-modulatory cytokines without the need for prior immunization. Emerging evidence indicates that variation in genes encoding killer immunoglobulin-like receptor (KIR), expressed by natural killer (NK) cells, and HLA ligands can significantly influence disease susceptibility and progression. Recent genetic association studies have revealed that individuals with specific KIR and HLA genotypes are at greater risk of developing cancer. The fact that different ethnic populations display varying trends in their KIR-HLA genotypes offers a strong potential explanation for documented cancer health disparities. Although these epidemiological studies highlight the importance of the interplay between KIR and HLA in disease, the functional basis for this association has been poorly understood.  Recently, we have found an important novel role for these MHC recognizing receptors on NK cells, in both mice and humans. Our findings indicate that the interaction between these receptors and the MHC I ligand is required to confer functional competence in a process we have termed licensing. Licensing has provided a satisfactory explanation for how an NK cell acquires potency, yet achieves tolerance to self-tissues. The licensing impact has been fully analyzed in a murine NK cell system where we found that licensing has a positive effect on all aspects of NK cell responsiveness to various stimuli. This global influence, however, was not observed in human NK cells. Our previous studies have shown that licensing through KIR3DL1 impacted the responsiveness of NK cells to tumor cells, but it did not influence the responsiveness to stimulation through Fc-gamma receptor (CD16), which mediates lysis of antibody-coated target cells. However, studies by other groups, with a small number of samples, have reported that licensing through other KIR impacted the NK cell response both to tumor cells and to stimulation through CD16. Together, these studies formulate a hypothesis that different KIRs have distinct impacts on the responsiveness of NK cells via stimulation through CD16 and/or to other activation receptors.  In this proposal we will determine the impact of licensing through two different KIR, KIR3DL1 and 2DL3, on the responsiveness of NK cells to stimulation through CD16 and other activation receptors known to be involved in tumor recognition. Since licensing appears to be critical for the functional competence of NK cells, our study will generate critical data for furthering our understanding of the impact of licensing on the resolution of disease, especially in the context of health disparities among different ethnic populations, and provide the functional explanation for the results of the KIR-HLA disease association studies.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project is directed at understanding the population based differences in innate immunity that result in cancer health disparities. Specifically, the project seeks to define the anti-tumor activity of natural killer cells by studying the genes that control both the killer cell receptor molecules and the target tumor markers.

"Phosphosulindac, miRNAs and cancer racial disparity    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Epidemiological data has demonstrated that colon cancer is disproportional in incidence and mortality between Caucasians and African Americans (AA). Whereas socioeconomic and dietary differences contribute to this disparity other underlying factors must be involved. For instance, the response to chemopreventive agents is different between these two populations. Since chemopreventive agents exert their effect through a molecular target, this disparity would suggest differences at the genetic level. Therefore, the generation and evaluation of chemopreventive agents that address the issue of chemo-resistance is essential. A promising colon cancer chemopreventive agent, phospho-sulindac (P-S), inhibits colon cancer cell growth more potently than sulindac by inhibiting cell proliferation and enhancing cell killing. However, very little is known about the molecular targets in the cancer cell that are responsible for this effect. Our hypothesis, based on preliminary results, is that miRNA expression/regulation differs between AA and Caucasians and this difference may account, at least in part, a) for the differential response to chemoprevention and b) for the differential incidence of colorectal cancer. To test these hypotheses, we propose the following three specific aims: 1) To study the effect of P-S on p53, NF-kB, 2-catenin, and cell kinetics in human colon cancer cell lines originating from Caucasians and AA; 2) To assess the effect of P- S on the miRNA profile in a p53 null murine model of colon cancer; and, 3) Determine the miRNA profile in human colon cancer samples from AA and Caucasian patients. The results from these findings will lead to the understanding of a worldwide issue and provide details for the development of chemopreventive agents that will span diverse populations.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We will define the mechanisms by which P-S exert its inhibitory effect on the growth of colon cancer cells and address racial disparities as a result of genetic mutations. We will evaluate in cell culture, using cell lines derived from Caucasians and AA colon cancer tissues, changes (by microarray analysis) in the expression of transcription factors and miRNAs. In addition, we will test whether our in vitro findings are relevant to a preclinical model of colon cancer. This study will evaluate directly in a p53 null and C57BL/6 (parent background) mice model the effect of P-S on the expressions of transcription factors and miRNAs. Thereby, we will test the key mechanistic findings from the in vitro study. Lastly, we will compare and contrast prospective and retrospective colon cancer tissue of Caucasians and AA at the protein, RNA, and DNA levels. Being able to demonstrate that P-S induces a potentially important molecular change in the malignant colonocytes that may be relevant to its pharmacological actions in cancer would indicate an important breakthrough in the prevention of colon cancer. Also, being able to attribute a genetic causative effect to resistance to chemotherapeutic agents will address the issue of racial disparity.           We will define the mechanisms by which P-S exert its inhibitory effect on the growth of colon cancer cells and address racial disparities as a result of genetic mutations.

"CD4+ T cells in Invasive Aspergillosis    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Dr. Amariliz Rivera is a newly appointed, tenure-track, assistant professor at the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey-New Jersey Medical School (UMDNJ-NJMS). Dr. Rivera is a woman of Puerto Rican descent who is committed to a career as a successful, independent scientist. Her scientific interest lies in performing research with the potential to better the therapeutic options of cancer patients afflicted with opportunistic fungal infections. Dr. Rivera's long-term career goals are: to become a recognized expert in fungal immunology, to establish a successful, well-funded research program and to be a tenured professor with the influence to contribute to diminishing the health disparities in our country. In the short term, she aspires to secure funding to support her new laboratory and its future members and to successfully complete the scientific aims proposed in this application. To attain these goals Dr. Rivera will participate in a variety of programs aimed at promoting her career development including workshops for: grant writing, presentation skills, lab management and leadership. Moreover, Drs. Gause and Salgame will be Amariliz's career development mentors. Both scientists have well-funded laboratories and are tenured-professors who have successfully trained other junior faculty. They will provide personalized advise on her career progression, will review her grants and papers and will guide her through the tenure process. UMDNJ-NJMS is committed to Dr. Rivera's success as a scientist. She has been provided with a fully equipped laboratory and adjacent office as well as with ample space in the vivarium for her mouse strains. More importantly, she will be given protected time to focus on performing research and establishing her laboratory. Dr. Rivera will have access to a diversity of core facilities to aid in her studies and she will be surrounded by a community of fellow scientists with diverse expertise and willingness to help in her career progression. Dr. Rivera's career will also benefit from being a member of the Hispanic Center for Excellence (HCOE) where she will participate in activities specifically designed to enhance the academic performance of individuals from underserved backgrounds. Moreover, through HCOE Dr. Rivera will have the professional support of fellow scientists with common personal backgrounds. The scientific goals of the studies proposed in this K22 application are centered in understanding and exploiting CD4 T lymphocytes in defense against fungal disease. Cancer patients that receive treatment for hematologic malignancies or bone marrow transplantation are at increased risk for developing invasive aspergillosis (IA). IA is a difficult to treat, opportunistic infection with reported mortality rates in excess of 50%. The most common causative agent of IA is Aspergillus fumigatus, a mold frequently present in the environment. Immune based therapies with the potential to benefit IA include vaccination and adoptive T cell transfers. The advancement of such immune-based therapies has been hampered by a lack of understanding of what constitutes protective A.fumigatus-specific, memory CD4 T cell responses and how are they elicited and regulated. In previous studies Dr. Rivera generated a T cell receptor transgenic mouse specific for A. fumigatus (Af3.16-TCR-tg) to track the in vivo activation, trafficking and differentiation of fungus-specific CD4 T cells. Her previous studies dissected the specific contributions of innate cells and innate receptors in shaping fungus-specific CD4 T cell differentiation in response to a primary, pulmonary infection with A.fumigatus spores. In the proposed studies she would further exploit Af3.16-TCR-tg mice to assess the formation of memory CD4 T cell responses to A.fumigatus. The specific aims of the proposed studies are: 1) Determine the impact of immune regulatory mechanisms in controlling fungus-specific CD4 T cell memory formation, 2) To examine the role of innate cell subsets and innate receptors in regulating the expansion and differentiation of fungus- specific CD4 T cell memory responses, 3) To establish optimal adoptive T cell therapies for diverse models of invasive fungal disease. Altogether, the proposed studies would significantly further our understanding of A.fumigatus-specific CD4 T cell memory formation, regulation and potential therapeutic benefit. Moreover, the successful completion of the proposed studies is likely to contribute to the development of novel therapeutic interventions to combat invasive fungal diseases.         Invasive Aspergillosis (IA) is an opportunistic fungal infection that affects cancer patients with hematologic malignancies. The studies proposed in this application are aimed at identifying crucial immune cells, receptors and regulatory factors that control the formation of protective memory CD4 T cell responses against the causative agent of IA and to explore innovative adoptive T cell transfer strategies for the treatment of IA. Altogether, these studies will have important implications for the development of novel anti-fungal vaccines and immune based therapies against clinically important fungi.

"Reducing Urban Women's HIV Risk: Soap Opera Videos on Video Capable Cell Phones    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Reducing Urban Women's HIV Risk: Soap Opera Videos on Video-Capable Cell Phones According to the CDC, the majority (80%) of women with HIV became infected by unprotected sex with an infected male partner. Black and Latina women accounted for 82% of AIDS diagnoses in women in 2005. The purpose of this proposal is to evaluate whether a series of 12-weekly data and theory-based urban soap operas will promote a reduction in HIV sex risk behavior in young urban African American and Latina women. Toni's Story is based on content analysis of focus group discussions with the target population. By grounding stories in urban women's own experiences, via a popular medium of the soap opera, women can identify with the heroines' emotionally charged process of change, transforming their behavior through a new awareness of their value as women, of their choices, and their potential. Messages about reducing HIV sexual risk are designed to fulfill familiar relationship needs. Because trust, sexual pressure and power form the nexus of sex scripts associated with HIV sexual risk, these themes are examined through the pursuits of the various characters as sub-plots. A randomized controlled trial (RCT) with 250 high-risk women aged 18 to 29, recruited in neighborhood settings in Newark and Jersey City, will be conducted to test the effect of the video-based intervention on HIV sexual risk behavior. A control group will receive text messages with audio that stress HIV health promotion messages. The series of 12 20-minute videos to the video intervention group (n=125) and 12- weekly HIV-risk reduction text/ audio messages to the control group (n=125) will be viewed over video-capable cell phones so that women may view the videos and text messages repeatedly and in privacy. It is expected that as a result of watching the video series, the video intervention group will demonstrate greater reductions in unprotected sex from baseline to 3 and 6 months than will the control group. Further, it is expected that they will demonstrate lower sexual pressure, indicating lower stereotypical expectations to engage in unprotected sex. Secondary analyses will determine whether there are differences in these results by partner type, whether there is a reduction in the number of high risk sex partners, and whether choosing to watch the videos more frequently will relate to further reduction in risk behavior. Interviews will be conducted by audio computer assisted self-interview (ACASI). The program will track when, how often, and for how long the videos are viewed. If the aims of this proposal are achieved, the use of the cell phone to view videos could change the paradigm of how health promotion is amplified between clinic sessions. Potentially hard to reach young urban women who may be at risk for HIV, will be able to access video-based interventions on their own cell phones. The popularity of the cell phone and use of the Internet for multimedia offer a new communication channel to address health disparities in young urban women.

"NCMHD Southeastern Exploratory Sickle Cell Center of Excellence    DESCRIPTION: Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a genetic disorder of hemoglobin and afflicts ~110,000 African-Americans in the US. Because of its complex pathophysiology through chronic hemolytic anemia, microvascularocclusion, and a chronic inflammatory state, it affects multiple organ systems and leads to significant morbidity and organ damage as well as leads to frequent hospitalizations and health care encounters. During the past 35 years, primarily through research and patient care conducted by the NIH funded Comprehensive Sickle Cell Centers and some pivotal clinical trials, the life expectancy of patients with SCD has increased from the teens to mid- to late forties. This is still considerably shorter than that of African-Americans who do not have sickle cell disease and can be viewed as a major disparity even in this underserved minority population. While significant advances have been made in the understanding of the disease pathophysiology and in novel therapies through basic and translational research, these advances have been slow to be taken to clinical practice. The Southeastern Exploratory Sickle Cell Center of Excellence seeks to improve the care and quality of life of the SCD patient population by i) investigating the basic mechanism of action of a highly successful and effective hemoglobin F inducing drug, hydroxyurea, ii) identifying genetic variations underlying the frequency of pain, response to narcotics, and thus addressing the important issue of biologic/genetic bases of pain and its under treatment leading to the stigmatization of many SCD patients and its resulting disparity, iii) investigating the medical, social, and economic reasons for underutilization of hydroxyurea in SCD, iv) training primary care physicians with evidence based medicine in the care of patients with SCD, given the sobering reality that there will not be enough specialists in non-malignant hematology to meet the needs of the growing adult SCD population, and v) implementing innovative methods and concepts for the care of SCD patients in the ED and for transitioning from pediatric to adult care. Relieving the health disparity of SCD patients is the primary goal of this application.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Sickle cell disease in the United States primarily affects African-Americans and is considered an orphan disease. Because of the lack of knowledge of health care providers in the management and treatment of painful episodes and other complications of this disease, patients are most often undertreated or not treated at all, which has created an enormous health disparity for these patients.",NCMHD Southeastern Exploratory Sickle Cell Center of Excellence,8211068,P20MD003383,[''],NIMHD,AUGUSTA UNIVERSITY,P20,2012,1962450,0.04988924315436819
"Gender Differences in Experimental Aortic Aneurysms    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) comprise the 10th leading cause of death in Caucasian males 65-74 years of age and accounted for nearly 16,000 deaths overall in the year 2000. Understanding the pathophysiology of AAAs is an important undertaking. Clinically, multiple risk factors are associated with the development of AAAs, including increasing age, positive smoking history, and hypertension. Male gender is also a well-established risk factor for the development of an AAA with a 4:1 male to female ratio. The reason for this gender disparity is unknown. The pathogenesis of AAAs formation is complex and multifactorial. Histologically, AAAs are characterized by early chemokine driven leukocyte infiltration into the aortic wall with subsequent destruction of elastin and collagen in the media and adventitia by excessive local production of matrix degrading enzymes, and smooth muscle cell loss with thinning of the aortic wall. At present, there are no medical therapies available to treat patients with aortic aneurysms, using only the crude measurement of aortic diameter as a threshold for which patients must undergo life-threatening and costly surgery, either open or endovascularly. Therefore, defining the early mechanisms underlying gender-related differences in AAA formation are critical and will be the focus of the present investigation. Understanding differences in disease patterns based on gender may allow us to develop new translational approaches to the prevention and treatment of patients with aortic aneurysms. Overall hypothesis: Gender- related differences in aortic aneurysm formation are mediated by the hormonal (androgen: estrogen ratio) regulation of leukocyte trafficking into the aortic wall. Specific Aim 1. To define the mechanism by which early inflammatory cell recruitment is accelerated in males during AAA formation. Studies will test the hypothesis that increased incidence of AAAs in males is secondary to increased recruitment of leukocytes into the aortic wall driven by an excess of androgens relative to estrogens. Specific Aim 2. To demonstrate that gonadal hormones can be used to modulate the inflammatory response accompanying AAA formation. Studies will test the hypothesis that altering the androgen: estrogen environment can dictate the prevalence of aneurysm formation by altering the aforementioned specific soluble mediator dependent leukocyte trafficking, ultimately driving the balance of matrix degradation and repair toward aneurysm formation.

"Phosphosulindac, miRNAs and cancer racial disparity    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Epidemiological data has demonstrated that colon cancer is disproportional in incidence and mortality between Caucasians and African Americans (AA). Whereas socioeconomic and dietary differences contribute to this disparity other underlying factors must be involved. For instance, the response to chemopreventive agents is different between these two populations. Since chemopreventive agents exert their effect through a molecular target, this disparity would suggest differences at the genetic level. Therefore, the generation and evaluation of chemopreventive agents that address the issue of chemo-resistance is essential. A promising colon cancer chemopreventive agent, phospho-sulindac (P-S), inhibits colon cancer cell growth more potently than sulindac by inhibiting cell proliferation and enhancing cell killing. However, very little is known about the molecular targets in the cancer cell that are responsible for this effect. Our hypothesis, based on preliminary results, is that miRNA expression/regulation differs between AA and Caucasians and this difference may account, at least in part, a) for the differential response to chemoprevention and b) for the differential incidence of colorectal cancer. To test these hypotheses, we propose the following three specific aims: 1) To study the effect of P-S on p53, NF-kB, 2-catenin, and cell kinetics in human colon cancer cell lines originating from Caucasians and AA; 2) To assess the effect of P- S on the miRNA profile in a p53 null murine model of colon cancer; and, 3) Determine the miRNA profile in human colon cancer samples from AA and Caucasian patients. The results from these findings will lead to the understanding of a worldwide issue and provide details for the development of chemopreventive agents that will span diverse populations.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We will define the mechanisms by which P-S exert its inhibitory effect on the growth of colon cancer cells and address racial disparities as a result of genetic mutations. We will evaluate in cell culture, using cell lines derived from Caucasians and AA colon cancer tissues, changes (by microarray analysis) in the expression of transcription factors and miRNAs. In addition, we will test whether our in vitro findings are relevant to a preclinical model of colon cancer. This study will evaluate directly in a p53 null and C57BL/6 (parent background) mice model the effect of P-S on the expressions of transcription factors and miRNAs. Thereby, we will test the key mechanistic findings from the in vitro study. Lastly, we will compare and contrast prospective and retrospective colon cancer tissue of Caucasians and AA at the protein, RNA, and DNA levels. Being able to demonstrate that P-S induces a potentially important molecular change in the malignant colonocytes that may be relevant to its pharmacological actions in cancer would indicate an important breakthrough in the prevention of colon cancer. Also, being able to attribute a genetic causative effect to resistance to chemotherapeutic agents will address the issue of racial disparity.

"Reducing Urban Women's HIV Risk: Soap Opera Videos on Video Capable Cell Phones    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Reducing Urban Women's HIV Risk: Soap Opera Videos on Video-Capable Cell Phones According to the CDC, the majority (80%) of women with HIV became infected by unprotected sex with an infected male partner. Black and Latina women accounted for 82% of AIDS diagnoses in women in 2005. The purpose of this proposal is to evaluate whether a series of 12-weekly data and theory-based urban soap operas will promote a reduction in HIV sex risk behavior in young urban African American and Latina women. Toni's Story is based on content analysis of focus group discussions with the target population. By grounding stories in urban women's own experiences, via a popular medium of the soap opera, women can identify with the heroines' emotionally charged process of change, transforming their behavior through a new awareness of their value as women, of their choices, and their potential. Messages about reducing HIV sexual risk are designed to fulfill familiar relationship needs. Because trust, sexual pressure and power form the nexus of sex scripts associated with HIV sexual risk, these themes are examined through the pursuits of the various characters as sub-plots. A randomized controlled trial (RCT) with 250 high-risk women aged 18 to 29, recruited in neighborhood settings in Newark and Jersey City, will be conducted to test the effect of the video-based intervention on HIV sexual risk behavior. A control group will receive text messages with audio that stress HIV health promotion messages. The series of 12 20-minute videos to the video intervention group (n=125) and 12- weekly HIV-risk reduction text/ audio messages to the control group (n=125) will be viewed over video-capable cell phones so that women may view the videos and text messages repeatedly and in privacy. It is expected that as a result of watching the video series, the video intervention group will demonstrate greater reductions in unprotected sex from baseline to 3 and 6 months than will the control group. Further, it is expected that they will demonstrate lower sexual pressure, indicating lower stereotypical expectations to engage in unprotected sex. Secondary analyses will determine whether there are differences in these results by partner type, whether there is a reduction in the number of high risk sex partners, and whether choosing to watch the videos more frequently will relate to further reduction in risk behavior. Interviews will be conducted by audio computer assisted self-interview (ACASI). The program will track when, how often, and for how long the videos are viewed. If the aims of this proposal are achieved, the use of the cell phone to view videos could change the paradigm of how health promotion is amplified between clinic sessions. Potentially hard to reach young urban women who may be at risk for HIV, will be able to access video-based interventions on their own cell phones. The popularity of the cell phone and use of the Internet for multimedia offer a new communication channel to address health disparities in young urban women.

"MYCN-induced calcium and magnesium signaling regulates Neuroblastoma progression DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Neuroblastoma (NB) is an extra-cranial pediatric cancer. Amplification of the proto-oncogene MYCN is associated with advanced stage, high risk NB and poor prognosis. Novel drugs and alternative treatments are being investigated for patients with advanced NB with MYCN amplification. However, finding an effective treatment strategy for advanced stage NB remains elusive. In order to address this limitation, the proposed project examines the effects of calcium and magnesium signaling on cell migration and invasion in NB cells with different MYCN status. The preliminary data indicate that MYCN initiates a change in calcium signaling, accompanied by a change in the transcriptional regulation of calcium channels, namely Orai1, Orai3 and TRPM7. In addition, MYCN induces calcium-dependent NB cell migration. These observations support the hypothesis that MYCN alters calcium and magnesium homeostasis during cell migration and invasion through a mechanism that involves calcium-mediated regulation of integrin signaling and focal adhesion turnover, and calcium- and magnesium-permeable ion channels. The research plan has the following specific aims: (1) Examine the effect of MYCN on [Ca2+] and [Mg2+] homeostasis in NB cells. NB cells with different MYCN status will be cultured in external media with different extracellular [Ca2+]/[Mg2+] ratios. The intracellular calcium and magnesium will be measured, and migration and invasion rates will be determined in these cells. (2) Elucidate the mechanism by which MYCN regulation of calcium and magnesium promotes NB migration and invasion. The effect of calcium and magnesium on the expression and phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase and integrin, focal adhesion turnover rate (assembly, disassembly and recycling of focal adhesion proteins), and actin cytoskeletal re-organization will be examined in NB cells that are actively migrating. (3) Identify the molecular components regulating NB migration and invasion. The calcium- permeable ORAI channels and the calcium- and magnesium-permeable TRPM7 channel protein will be modulated pharmacologically or using molecular methods (RNAi or transient over-expression), and the effect of these changes on cell migration and invasion, focal adhesion turnover (assembly, disassembly, and recycling of focal adhesion proteins), and intracellular [Ca2+] will be determined in NB cells. This study may identify new biomarkers for advanced stage NB, and reveal novel targets for the development of more effective chemotherapeutic drugs. In addition, this study may lead to a new model of the regulation of NB progression, which includes monitoring the status of the prognostic marker MYCN as well as the dietary intake, metabolism and cellular regulation of calcium and magnesium. This new model may apply to other cancers with MYC amplification (e.g. breast and prostate cancers, and lymphoma, etc). Neuroblastoma (NB) is a pediatric tumor. Calcium and magnesium ions regulate cell migration and invasion. I propose to elucidate the mechanisms by which calcium and magnesium regulate these processes in NB cells. This study will improve our current knowledge of NB progression, and reveal more innovative treatment strategies for NB.",MYCN-induced calcium and magnesium signaling regulates Neuroblastoma progression,8442216,K01CA154758,"['Actins ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' Factor IV ', ' Coagulation Factor IV ', ' Ca++ element ', ' Blood Coagulation Factor IV ', ' Calcium ', ' Voltage-Dependent Calcium Channels ', ' VDCC ', ' Calcium Ion Channels ', ' Calcium Channel Blocker Receptors ', ' Calcium Channel Antagonist Receptor ', ' Calcium Channel ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Motility ', ' Cellular Motility ', ' Cellular Migration ', ' Cell Movement ', ' Cell Migration ', ' Cell Locomotion ', ' cell motility ', ' Cells ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Downregulation ', ' Down-Regulation (Physiology) ', ' Down-Regulation ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' natural gene amplification ', ' Gene Amplification ', ' Goals ', ' Physiological Homeostasis ', ' Autoregulation ', ' Homeostasis ', ' Integrins Extracellular Matrix ', ' Integrins ', ' Membrane Channels ', ' Ionic Channels ', ' Ion Channel ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Literature ', ' Reticulolymphosarcoma ', ' Malignant Lymphoma ', "" Lymphoma (Hodgkin's and Non-Hodgkin's) "", ' Germinoblastoma ', ' Germinoblastic Sarcoma ', ' Lymphoma ', ' Mg element ', ' Magnesium ', ' Metabolic Processes ', ' Intermediary Metabolism ', ' Metabolism ', ' Methods ', ' Method LOINC Axis 6 ', ' Methodology ', ' Neuroblastoma (Schwannian Stroma-Poor) ', ' Neuroblastoma ', ' Patients ', ' Peer Review ', ' Protein Phosphorylation ', ' Phosphorylation ', ' Prognosis ', ' outcome forecast ', ' gene product ', ' Proteins ', ' protooncogene ', ' c-ONC ', ' Cellular Oncogene ', ' Proto-Oncogenes ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Publications ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Support ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Survival Rate ', ' Time ', ' pp125(FAK) ', ' p125FAK ', ' p125(FAK) ', ' focal adhesion-associated protein tyrosine kinase pp125FAK ', ' focal adhesion protein tyrosine kinase ', ' focal adhesion kinase ', ' endogenous substrate pp120 ', ' PTK2 Protein Tyrosine Kinase 2 ', ' Focal Adhesion Kinase 1 ', ' Measures ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' Mediating ', ' Treatment Failure ', ' neoplastic progression ', ' neoplasm progression ', ' cancer progression ', ' tumor progression ', ' improved ', ' Cranial ', ' Cephalic ', ' Malignant ', ' Malignant -

"HORMONAL INFLUENCES ON AIRWAY DISEASE    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   Airway diseases are the most common of the lung disorders, however, treatment for these illnesses remains inadequate. Epidemiologic data indicates that a gender disparity exists in patients with airway diseases including bronchiectasis, asthma, and chronic obstructive lung disease, with women demonstrating worse severity and outcomes along with an increased prevalence in some circumstances. Few studies have addressed the biologic basis of this disparity, but sex hormones are a potentially important variable. A full understanding of the hormonal influences on the airways may lead to novel therapies to help treat these debilitating illnesses. In airway disease, the mucociliary apparatus, made up of cilia, mucous, and airway epithelial cell surface liquid, plays a critical role in protecting the lung from pathogens and is a target for hormone regulation. Indeed, our preliminary data indicates that female sex hormones alter mucociliary function. Accordingly, the goal of this proposal is to determine the impact of sex hormones, specifically progesterone, on mucociliary clearance, as a basis of explanation for the gender disparity in airways diseases. The central hypothesis is that women have more severe airway diseases than men due to progesterone-mediated alterations in airway epithelial mucociliary function. The long term goals of these studies are to understand the mechanisms leading to gender differences in airway diseases, improve current treatment, and develop novel therapies.  To address these long term goals, we will apply a bench-to-bedside approach to this proposal by pursuing three specific aims at the in vitro, in vivo, and clinical levels. In Aim 1, we will characterize progesterone receptor expression, cell specificity, and receptor trafficking in primary human airway cells and in human lung tissues. In Aim 2, we will determine the impact of progesterone on mucociliary clearance by comparing cilia beat frequency of primary human airway epithelial cells in hormone stimulated conditions and by measuring airway clearance in hormone manipulated mice. We will also evaluate progesterone-dependent pathways that influence airway epithelial cell function to understand the mechanisms involved in sex hormone influences on mucociliary clearance. In Aim 3, using Cystic Fibrosis (CF) bronchiectasis as a model airway disease, we will utilize the national CF Foundation registry to retrospectively compare lung function and pulmonary exacerbations in men and women pre- and post-puberty and recruit CF bronchiectasis women locally to prospectively assess lung health during hormonal phases of the ovulatory cycle. Further understanding of these findings could lead to new therapeutic approaches involving inhaled hormone manipulation in bronchiectasis and other airway diseases. This work, in combination with a program of mentored research and a targeted educational program, will serve as the foundation for the PI's physician-scientist career.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Airway diseases are the most common of the lung diseases, and currently have limited therapies. Multiple epidemiologic studies indicate that women with airway diseases have increased severity and worse outcomes than men. The objective of this proposal is to identify the influences of sex hormones on mucociliary clearance and the pathways involved. These findings could lead to novel therapeutic approaches involving inhaled hormone manipulation in patients with bronchiectasis and other airway diseases such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

"Xenograft Model to Study Impact of CRLF2-Ligand in Hispanic Childhood B-ALL     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Hispanic children have a 39% higher death rate due to ALL than white children. A major cause of this health disparity in survival is the lack of therapies that specifically target the high-risk B-ALL caused by deregulated CRLF2 (CRLF2-d). Genetic defects resulting in B cells that overexpress the cytokine receptor component, CRLF2, lead to malignant transformation and high-risk CRLF2-d B-ALL with poor prognosis. B-ALL arising from CRLF2-d is five times more frequent among children of Hispanic/Latino ethnicity than others. CRLF2 is part of a signaling receptor activated by ligation with the cytokine TSLP. TSLP has been reported to expand B- ALL cells and to protect them from mTOR inhibitors. Human B-ALL-mouse xenograft models that mimic the in vivo BM environment are the model of choice for identifying therapies that target the mechanisms of chemoresistance that are characteristic of high-risk B-ALL. However, mouse TSLP does not interact with human CRLF2. Thus, existing xenograft models of B-ALL are inadequate for studies of CRLF2-d B-ALL because they do not provide the human TSLP that is required to induce CRLF2-mediated signals. The development of xenograft models of CRLF2 function in B-ALL are essential for identifying therapies that will selectively target CRLF2-d and reduce the health disparity in survival for Hispanic children due to high-risk CRLF2-d B-ALL. The objective of this proposal is to develop an in vivo model of CRLF2 function in B-ALL by expressing human TSLP (hTSLP) in a xenograft model of B-ALL and to use this model to investigate CRLF-2- TSLP interactions as a therapeutic target for high risk CRLF2-d B-ALL. We will achieve this objective through the following aims: Specific Aim 1: Develop a human-mouse xenograft model to identify therapies that will specifically target CRLF2-d B-ALL. We will: 1.1. Engineer immunodeficient mice for lentiviral expression of human hTSLP. 1.2.Optimize the human-mouse xenograft model system for engraftment with CRLF2-d B- ALL cells. Our overarching hypothesis is that TSLP induces CRLF2-mediated signals that are responsible for the disease progression and chemoresistance of CRLF2-d B-ALL that results in poor survival for Hispanic children with B-ALL. To test this hypothesis we will: Specific Aim 2. Determine the impact of CRLF2 ligation on the progression of CRLF2-d B-ALL. Using the hTSLP+/- xenograft model system we will 2.2 Determine the extent of bone marrow disease. 2.3 Evaluate TSLP receptor signaling in B-ALL cells. The xenograft model of CRLF2 function in B-ALL that we will develop in this application will be essential for identifying therapies that will selectively target CRLF2-d and reduce the health disparity in survival for Hispanic children due to high-risk CRLF2-d B-ALL.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Hispanic children disproportionately develop and die from high-risk B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B- ALL). Defects in B cells that cause increased levels of the growth factor receptor CRLF2 are five times more frequent among children of Hispanic/Latino ethnicity than others and contribute to their increased death from high-risk B-ALL. We will develop a unique animal model that allows us to study and target the mechanism by which CRLF2 contributes to leukemia and reduce health disparities in Hispanic childhood B-ALL.               Hispanic children disproportionately develop and die from high-risk B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B- ALL).

"Use of Allogenicity to Stimulate Effector Responses Against Multiple Myeloma     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Multiple myeloma (MM) is a bone marrow plasma cell cancer with a mortality rate greater than 50%1.  According to the National Program of Cancer Registries United States Cancer Statistics, both incidence and death rates among African-Americans were approximately twice that seen in the other ethnic populations2.  It is therefore important to examine those factors unique to this population which may contribute to the unequal rates of morbidity and mortality associated with this disease.  Of the available treatments for MM, remission has primarily been observed following autologous and allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation3,4.  Immunotherapy strategies have also been developed.  For example, the human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-A2  restricted MM-associated protein HM1.24, which is overexpressed in Multiple myeloma cells, has been shown to stimulate interferon gamma expression by myeloma-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs)7.  However, at present, these therapeutic approaches alone do not consistently elicit antitumor cytotoxic effects in in vitro or in vivo studies8,9.  This is due, in part, to the lack of understanding of te factors which contribute to T cell activation in the largely tolerizing tumor setting, such as allogenicity.  However, the greater diversity of HLA polymorphisms in African-Americans provides a unique resource for interrogating the biophysical underpinnings of HLA restriction in targeted tumor immunotherapies for diseases such as MM.  The general objective of the project detailed in this proposal is to determine the effect of allogeneic variation in HLA-A2 on the induction of CTLs to immunodominant peptides of the HM1.24 antigen.  The prevalence of certain HLA-A2 alleles may differ between African-Americans and Caucasians, and it is possible that these differences contribute to different responses against HLA-A2-restricted tumor associated antigens.  Thus, in Aim 1, the most prevalent HLA-A class I alleles within the African-American population will be identified.  Immunogenic peptides of MM HM1.24 specific for those alleles will be determined by in silico analysis.  This will be used in Aim 2 to design and construct structurally allogeneic variants of HLA-A2-HM1.24 complexes by molecular modeling and molecular biology techniques.  Finally, in Aim 3, to investigate the impact of allogeneic variation on CTL responses, the complexes will be delivered to antigen presenting cells using a novel application of the lentiviral vector system.  The APCs will then be co-cultured with HLA-A2-restricted, HM1.24-specific CTLs in CTL effector assays.  The hypothesis being tested is that allogeneic variants of this MM associated HLA-peptide complex can be engineered to augment CTL responses.  This project utilizes bioinformatics, molecular biology, and tissue culture techniques to address how biophysical and genetic components of HLA-A2-peptide complexes contribute to the allogeneic responses of T cells.  Ultimately, this project seeks to contribute to the knowledge base currently being used to develop immunotherapies for diseases such as MM, specifically in populations which demonstrate well-documented health disparities.            PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Multiple myeloma is a destructive plasma cell cancer which disproportionately affects African-Americans and for which no definitive cure exists.  This project may contribute a putative model for designing and optimizing vectors which uses the genetic variation within the African-American population to promote anti-cancer immune responses.  This model could perhaps be used to develop personalized therapies for diseases such as Multiple myeloma, which exhibit health disparities in unique populations.                 Multiple myeloma is a destructive plasma cell cancer which disproportionately affects African-Americans and for which no definitive cure exists.

"Regulation of osteoclast biology by anion exchanger SLC4A2 in mouse and human sys    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Bone is a dynamic tissue that remodels to grow, adapt to stress and maintain integrity. Two cell types control this process, the osteoblast (OB) and the osteoclast (OC), which synthesize and degrade bone, respectively. Pathologic inequality in bone remodeling favoring resorption over formation leads to diseases such as osteoporosis, rheumatoid arthritis and metastatic bone cancer. Currently, over 30 million Americans have low bone mass and nearly 1% of our population suffers from rheumatoid arthritis. The yearly health care cost burden of these diseases is immense. Currently approved therapeutics targeting OCs are inadequate, necessitating the discovery of new targets. To resorb bone, osteoclasts secrete hydrochloric acid. To prevent a reciprocal build up of cytoplasmic base, electroneutral exchange of bicarbonate for chloride occurs through an anion exchanger. The identity of this exchanger eluded identification until our recent report showing Solute carrier family 4, anion exchanger, member 2 (Slc4a2, Ae2) is absolutely required for osteoclast activity during development. In its absence, mice develop profound osteopetrosis. A recent publication has identified a nearly identical phenotype in cattle that lack SLC4A2. To date, only a handful of mutations have been identified that so dramatically curtail the ability of osteoclasts to resorb calcified tissue. Our preliminary data suggest that SCL4A2 plays an unexpected complex role in OC physiology. We have found that SLC4A2 deficiency not only prevents OCs from properly secreting acid and performing anion exchange, but also profoundly affects the organization of their cytoskeleton. Many important questions remain regarding the biology of SLC4A2 in the OC. We do not know whether SLC4A2 is important in bone remodeling beyond the developmental period or in the pathogenesis of inflammatory skeletal disease. The relative contribution of the cytoplasmic and transmembrane domains of SLC4A2 to the regulation of osteoclast biology is unknown. Moreover, whether human osteoclasts utilize SLC4A2 is undefined. Four specific aims are proposed to answer these questions: 1) Establish the OC-intrinsic role of SLC4A2 and resolve the contribution of osteopetrosis to the lethal phenotype of Slc4a2-/- mice; 2) Establish the requirement of SLC4A2 in a mouse model of inflammatory arthritis; 3) Perform a structure-function analysis of SLC4A2 in OCs and 4) Confirm a role for SLC4A2 in human OCs. I will take advantage of the unique environment in Boston to facilitate these studies. Collaborations have been established with local experts in anion exchange physiology, OC cell biology, mouse models of RA and RNA interference. By analyzing the function of a gene that so profoundly affects OC biology, this grant will advance basic understanding of skeletal remodeling, make important contributions to general cell biology and signal transduction and, most importantly, define a new target to suppress pathologic bone loss.        Dynamic remodeling of bone allows our skeleton to grow and adapt to stress, but makes it susceptible to diseases such as osteoporosis and rheumatoid arthritis. The only cell capable of destroying bone is the osteoclast, a multinucleated giant cell that secretes hydrochloric acid and proteolytic enzymes. This grant aims to better understand how osteoclasts work by probing the function of an ion exchanger (SLC4A2) that osteoclasts require to perform this remarkable, but often pathologic, feat.

"Helper T Cell Regulation In Murine Leishmaniasis    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The clonal selection theory of adaptive immunity suggests that proliferation of a single lymphocyte should provide sufficient function for acute defense (effector cells), yet the regenerative capacity to maintain the selected lineage (memory cells). The progeny of a CD4+ helper T cell selected for an immune response against parasitic pathogens must also have the plasticity to choose among several effector lineages (Th1, Th2, Th17) in order to mobilize the most appropriate defense mechanisms for elimination of a single-celled intracellular protozoan or a multi-celled extracellular helminth. This proposal tests the hypothesis that signals directing the activation of a CD4+ helper T cell during the immune response against the parasite Leishmania major may trigger a program of cell fate diversity among the initial daughter cells of the selected microbe-specific T cell. Preliminary evidence suggests such diversification may be accomplished using an evolutionarily conserved mechanism, called asymmetric cell division, wherein critical cell fate determinants are inherited unequally by two daughter cells. This competing continuation proposal seeks to determine the extent of disparity in the inheritance of signaling molecules and fate regulators in the initial cellular progeny of a CD4+ helper T cell responding to L. major, to evaluate the fate of the initial daughter and grand-daughter CD4+ T cells, and to assess genetically whether critical daughter cell fates depend on regulators of asymmetric cell division. These studies should provide novel insight into some of the most important remaining questions regarding the programming of CD4+ helper T cell function and the immunological control of parasitic infections that are relevant to humankind.Public Health Relevance Statement       Helper T lymphocytes are specialized white blood cells that orchestrate the actions of our immune system to protect us against infections. This project will reveal the inner workings of how helper T cells match their function appropriately to the type of infection we encounter, and how they prevent themselves from becoming depleted when the infection persists for our lifetime.

"Estrogen-ERbeta Axis In Disparity of Prostate Cancer DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): African Americans (AA) with prostate cancer (PC) have twice the incidence and mortality than European Americans (EA) and any other ethnic groups, however, the mechanism/s linked to this health disparity is not understood. The uncontrolled androgen receptor (AR) signaling in PC cells increases tumor development which is controlled by androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) in patients. However, ADT selects for androgen- independence and recurrence of aggressive tumors in AA-men. Notably, AA-men with PC have significantly higher circulating estrogens than EA-men. Since adipose tissue is the major source of estrogens in men and since PC risk increases with age and obesity, there appears to be a crucial link between adiposity and estrogenic signaling in PC progression. Indeed, estrogenic signaling via the estrogen receptor-beta (ERP) is implicated in aggressive tumor growth and metastasis. Our combined suppressive subtractive hybridization (SSH) analysis and race-based cDNA microarrays, showed a selective up-regulation of both the ERa co- repressor, SAFB2 and the ERf3 isoform, in freshly microdissected PC specimen. In the AA-derived PC cell line MDA-PCa-2b, activation of estrogen-ERP signaling axis conferred AR transactivation and proliferative responses in PC cells, even in the absence of androgen. Furthermore, adipose stem cells (ADMSCs) from AA-men secreted estrogens in response to tumor-derived factors and increased PC cell growth both in vitro and in vivo. We therefore hypothesize that activation ofAR signaling by estrogen-ERP axis is pivotal to the progression of PC in AA-men despite androgen ablation therapy. Our hypothesis will be tested by the following specific aims: (1) to evaluate the clinical utility of SAFB2 and ERb expression levels as biomarkers and/or prognostic indicators of aggressive PC in African Americans. (2) To determine if the estrogen-ERp axis augments AR-mediated growth and metastasis in SAFB2-expressing PC cells in vitro. (3) To investigate in vitro whether local estrogen production by ADMSCs from AA-men contributes to ERp-dependent enhanced growth and metastasis of PC cells under ADC in vitro, and (4) To demonstrate that ERp activation by systemic and/or ADMSC-derived estrogens increases growth of PC tumors under ADC in vivo. RELEVANCE (See Instructions): The discovery of alternate signaling pathways that may lead to androgen resistance and aggressive PC growth in AA-men, would be of crucial importance. A crucial role of estrogen-ERP signaling axis in PC progression and the contribution of adipose stem cell derived estrogens on growth and metastasis of PC cells, will provide new clues for understanding the disproportionate incidence and mortality due to PC in African American natients and will rifilineate novel theraneutic strategies that can be easily implemented.",Estrogen-ERbeta Axis In Disparity of Prostate Cancer,8328901,U01CA149204,"['yellow adipose tissue ', ' white adipose tissue ', ' adipose ', ' Fatty Tissue ', ' Adipose tissue ', ' Age ', ' Therapeutic Androgen ', ' Androgenic Compounds ', ' Androgenic Agents ', ' Androgens ', ' Cells ', ' Charcoal ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Enzymes ', ' Therapeutic Estrogen ', ' Estrogenic Compounds ', ' Estrogenic Agents ', ' Estrogens ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Genes ', ' Gonads ', ' Gonadal structure ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Growth ', ' Therapeutic Hormone ', ' Endocrine Gland Secretion ', ' Chemotherapy-Hormones/Steroids ', ' Hormones ', ' In Vitro ', ' Incidence ', ' Injections ', ' Injection of therapeutic agent ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Athymic Nude Mouse ', ' Athymic Mice ', ' Nude Mice ', ' Mortality ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' tumor cell metastasis ', ' cancer metastasis ', ' Tumor Cell Migration ', ' Secondary Tumor ', ' Secondary Neoplasm ', ' Metastatic Tumor ', ' Metastatic Neoplasm ', ' Metastasize ', ' Metastasis ', ' Neoplasm Metastasis ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Obesity ', ' Patients ', ' Play ', ' Production ', ' Prostatic Neoplasia ', ' Prostate Tumor ', ' Prostate Neoplasms ', ' Prostatic Neoplasms ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Androgen Receptor ', ' recruit ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' Recurrent ', ' Recurrence ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Signal Pathway ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Progenitor Cells ', ' Stem cells ', ' Testing ', ' Trans-Testosterone ', ' Therapeutic Testosterone ', ' Testosterone ', ' Transactivation ', ' Trans-Activation (Genetics) ', ' Upregulation ', ' Up-Regulation ', ' Up-Regulation (Physiology) ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' Mediating ', ' Conditioned Medium ', ' Conditioned Culture Media ', ' base ', ' neoplastic progression ', ' neoplasm progression ', ' cancer progression ', ' tumor progression ', ' Clinical ', ' Link ', ' European ', ' Disease Progression ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Malignant Cell ', ' cancer cell ', ' scaffolding ', ' scaffold ', ' Nature ', ' Research Specimen ', ' Specimen ', ' Prostatic Cancer ', ' Prostate Cancer ', ' Prostate CA ', ' Malignant prostatic tumor ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Prostate ', ' Malignant neoplasm of prostate ', ' Source ', ' ERbeta ', ' Estrogen Receptor beta ', ' interest ', ' Ablation ', ' American ', ' cancer risk ', ' Tumor Cell ', ' neoplastic cell ', ' Isoforms ', ' Protein Isoforms ', ' tumor growth ', ' expression vector ', ' cohort ', ' novel ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' research study ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' deprivation ', ' cDNA Microarray ', ' cDNA Arrays ', ' siRNA ', ' Small Interfering RNA ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Mesenchymal Progenitor Cell ', ' Mesenchymal Stem Cells ', ' Preventive ', ' Ectopic Expression ', ' Receptor Signaling ', ' in vivo ', ' Cancer Cell Growth ', ' Cancer Patient ', ' Clonal Expansion ', ' Tissue Chip ', ' Tissue Arrays ', ' Tissue Microarray ', ' Tumor-Derived ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Instruction ', ' prostate cancer cell line ', ' PC3 cell line ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' resistant ', ' Resistance ', ' short hairpin RNA ', ' shRNA ', ' small hairpin RNA ', ' therapeutic target ', ' tumor ', ' overexpress ', ' overexpression ', ' prognostic indicator ', ' biomarker ', ' adverse consequence ', ' adverse outcome ', ' ']",NCI,TULANE UNIVERSITY OF LOUISIANA,U01,2012,341946,0.07549469751343538
"Instant Pediatric POC Blood Analysis    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose to develop a Point-of-Care Blood Analyzer that will require ten times smaller blood volume or less and it will provide instant results to improve health of children in health disparity populations. The analyzer would be used for monitoring of anemia in children; neutropenia in children; evaluation for infections (total white count, increased white blood cells with neutrophil predominance, as an inflammatory marker); screening newborns for anemia, high WBC or neutropenia, with the use of very low blood volumes; clinical trial use in patients from diverse populations and ages.  Morbidity and mortality are disproportionally high in children under five years of age particularly in resource poor or disenfranchised populations including those in urban and rural areas in the United States. The major issues affecting infants and young children is infection followed by anemia and poor nutrition. A complete blood count is commonly used for diagnosis and the proposed analyzer will be the first to measure RBC, WBC, 3-part differential, hemoglobin, and platelets at the point-of-care.  The underlying technology of this transformative imaging platform was demonstrated by Prof. Ozcan's Group at UCLA [1 to 13]. It relies on innovative lensfree holographic imaging of cells, bacteria or other micro-scale particles on a low-cost cell phone camera chip at unprecedented throughputs. The holographic diffraction patterns of various blood cells are quite rich in information to enable characterization of cells based on shape and texture analysis through digital signal processing. This basic platform, termed Holographic LUCAS, will be developed in this SBIR Phase I project. Accuracy, precision, and linearity of the LUCAS platform will be compared with standard laboratory hematology analyzer using unidentified blood specimens.  Specific aims are to: (1) Develop an experimental platform consisting of a prototype Holographic CBC Analyzer and a lab cuvette design suitable for use as a sample holder in Phase I. (2) Research imaging of WBC 3-part differential (granulocytes, monocytes, and lymphocytes) with a holographic LUCAS imager and demonstrate accurate counting; (3) Develop a manual sample preparation process to be used with lab cuvettes for sample preparation in Phase I. The process is the first step in the development of an automated unidose cuvette in Phase II. (4) The final aim of this research will be to measure analyzer performance for RBC, WBC, 3-Part Differential, Hemoglobin, and Platelets. Preliminary tests will be done with purchased blood from the blood bank and final tests with unidentified specimens from UCI clinical laboratory. At least 100 samples will be measured to achieve desired statistical confidence. The results will be compared with the gold standard laboratory hematology analyzer (such as Beckman Coulter LH 750) and with manual microscopy.  After commercialization this analyzer will dramatically lower the cost and barriers to use as a point-of-care diagnostic instrument for health disparity populations and also for general use in the US, the developed world, and resource-limited countries. Future applications include CBC, Malaria, TB, HIV, and others.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  We propose a new technological platform that will enable CBC blood analysis for children in health disparity populations using a compact, light-weight and cost-effective unit that can be operated by minimally trained personnel right at the point of care or in resource poor settings such as rural areas. This proposed platform will enable effective monitoring of anemia in children; neutropenia in children; assist in the evaluation for infections; screen newborns for anemia, neutropenia or infections with the use of very low blood volumes.

"Microbicide properties of RT inhibitor combinations DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Topical microbicides are an important strategy to minimize heterosexual transmission of HIV. Several single agent microbicides are in clinical trials, including one based on the nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) UC781 that we discovered as a potential microbicidal agent. However, combination microbicides may be preferable, yet only a single combination microbicide is currently under evaluation. There is also an urgent need to identify new pipeline microbicidal agents. We have found that the nucleoside RT inhibitor (NRTI) 4'-ethynyl-2-fluoro-deoxyadenosine (4'E-2FdA) provides a potent and prolonged barrier to HIV- 1 infection of cells in the subsequent absence of exogenous drug, a property previously only noted for NNRTI such as UC781. The ""memory effect"" barrier is imparted by 4'E-2FdA at drug levels orders of magnitude less than those needed for protection by the nucleotide tenofovir, currently in clinical assessment for microbicide use. We hypothesize that microbicides comprising combinations of different classes of highly potent RT inhibitors, namely the NNRTI UC781 and an NRTI such as 4'E-2FdA, will provide an optimal barrier to HIV-1 transmission. We therefore propose these Specific Aims for this R21/R33 phased innovation application: R21 Aim 1. To evaluate the in vitro (cell-based) microbicidal properties of NRTI and UC781 alone and in combination. These studies include assessment of antiviral activity and ""memory effect"" protection imparted by NRTIs and UC781 alone and in combination using primary cells (PBMCs, CD4+ T-cells, macrophages) and different HIV drug-sensitive and drug-resistant strains, isolates and clades. R21 Aim 2. To elucidate the mechanism of 4'E-2FdA (and analogs) induced protective barrier or ""memory effect"" in HIV susceptible cells. These studies include characterization of uptake, conversion to triphosphate and intracellular stability of the NRTI-TPs, as well as detailed kinetic evaluations of the NRTI substrate activity with enzymes involved in metabolism of the NRTIs. R21 Deliverables: Identification of a lead NRTI and two back-ups for use with UC781 for development as a combination microbicide. R33 Aim 1. To formulate the NRTI/NNRTI combinations selected in the R21 phase into an appropriate delivery system for vaginal topical use. NRTIs and NNRTIs have different chemical properties, thus appropriate delivery systems must be identified to enable incorporation and release of the active agents. We will prepare and evaluate both gel and rapidly dissolving film formulations for the combination microbicide. R33 Aim 2. To evaluate the anti-HIV microbicidal activity of formulated NRTI/NNRTI combinations in an ex vivo cervical explant tissue model. These studies will use a newly developed physiologically relevant polarized cervical tissue model to assess the impact of formulated microbicides alone and in combination on HIV transmission and infectivity. R33 Deliverables: Identification of an appropriate delivery formulation for the selected NRTI/NNRTI combination for entry into subsequent preclinical safety and efficacy studies. This project seeks to develop anti-HIV microbicides based on the non-nucleoside RT inhibitor UC781 in combination with novel 4'-substituted nucleosides, a combination found to provide profound and protracted protection of susceptible cells against HIV infection in vitro.

"Antigen Specific T Cell tolerance by Anti CD3 Antibodies    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Transplantation of hematopoietic stem cells from an allogeneic donor can be followed by serious graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) despite the best available regimen for immune suppression. Experimental animal data and results of clinical trials have demonstrated that T cells play a central role in GVHD. Recent advances in understanding the mechanisms of peripheral T cell tolerance have made it feasible to test the hypothesis that GVHD can be prevented in man by T cell receptor (TCR) partial agonist ligands through the selective depletion of alloreactive T cells. Transplantation tolerance is facilitated by activation-induced cell death (AICD) of peripheral T cells triggered by the specific alloantigens, and TCR signals are indispensable for induction of antigen-specific tolerance. TCR engagement can induce either T cell proliferation and differentiation or AICD. Monoclonal antibodies (mAb) to CD3, a monomorphic chain associated to the TCR complex, mimic antigen and induce TCR signaling and T cell activation. Fc receptor (FcR)-binding anti-CD3 mAbs recruit antigen-presenting cells (APC) and deliver full agonist signals that promote T cell proliferation and effector functions, independent of antigen. In contrast, non-FcR-binding anti-CD3 mAbs induce a partial agonist TCR signaling pattern causing anergy in naive T cells and AICD in antigen-activated, cycling T cells. In mice, we found that non-FcR-binding anti-CD3 mAbs induce selective depletion of donor T cells that recognize recipient alloantigens thereby preventing GVHD across MHC disparities, and spare T cell specific to third party antigens. In collaboration with J. Tso, we designed a `humanized' non-FcR-binding anti-CD3 mAb, visilizumab, which delivers a partial agonist signal to the TCR. Visilizumab is more effective than other anti-CD3 mAbs in inducing AICD of activated, cycling human T cells. Our preliminary results in human trials show that visilizumab can induce complete clinical responses in some patients with severe acute GVHD, refractory to conventional immune suppressive agents. We propose here to study efficacy of visilizumab in the prevention of GVHD after hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) from HLA incompatible donors, and assess whether its immune suppressive effects are selective for alloantigens. We will pursue the following specific aims: Aim 1: Determine the safety and efficacy of humanized non-FcR-binding anti-CD3 mAb visilizumab in preventing severe GVHD after transplantation of T-replete hematopoietic cell grafts from HLA-incompatible donors. Aim 2: Investigate whether visilizumab therapy depletes the alloreactive T cell pool, while sparing immunity to third party alloantigens, cytomegalovirus (CMV) and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), and tumor- associated antigen WT1. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The development of effective regimens for the prevention of GVHD will improve patient safety and survival after transplantation, and extend the use of this procedure to a larger number of patients. Progress in the prevention of GVHD has the potential for advancing the fields of organ transplantation and therapy for autoimmune disorders. Anti-CD3 mAbs represent the prototype of a new class of therapeutic agents that suppress the immune system by inducing an abortive activation and T cell death. What makes anti-CD3 mAbs unique and more attractive than other agents is the potential for achieving immunological tolerance rapidly and irreversibly. Showing that non-FcR-binding anti-CD3 mAbs spare T cells specific for viral and tumor-associated antigens is key to predict patient safety.

"Targeting pERK1/2 in Human Mammary Cancer Stem Cells    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Breast cancer is a complex disease associated with specific morphological and clinical features. Significant health disparity and high mortality rate is reported in African American (AA) patients, who suffer from unique and highly aggressive breast tumors. AA triple negative (TN) breast cancer patients suffer worse outcomes to chemotherapy compared with Caucasian women. Aggressive TN breast tumors contain poorly differentiated cells and express embryonic stem cell specific gene sets. These poorly differentiated mammary cancer stem cells (MCSCs) are the most tumorigenic cell types that drive initiation and progression of breast cancers. RAS/Raf/ERK1/2 signaling cascade has been found to promote every aspect of breast tumor progression including aggressive behavior like high angiogenesis and motility. We hypothesize that ""Mammary cancer stem cells drive aggressive TN breast tumors in AA women through sustained ERK1/2 signaling."" We will test this hypothesis with the following Specific Aims: 1) Establish whether mammary cancer stem cells from AA TN breast tumors form aggressive xenografts in nude mice. 2) Examine whether sustained ERK1/2 increases aggressive behavior of mammary cancer stem cells enriched mammospheres from AA TN breast tumors. 3) Examine whether inhibition of ERK1/2 signaling is effective in attenuating aggressive properties of mammary cancer stem cells from AA TN breast tumors. Fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) will be used to enrich MCSCs (Lin-/CD44+/CD24- /ALDH1+) from TN AA and Caucasian breast tumors, which will injected into the nude mice to form xenotransplants. These xenografts will be used to compare tumor volume, expression of angiogenesis stimulating factors (VEGF, CD31, MMP9), and motility of cells (Boyden Chamber Assay) between the two groups. MCSCs will also be enriched as mammospheres and pERK1/2-mediated effect on cell motility and expression of angiogenesis stimulating factors will be analyzed. ERK1/2 signaling will be attenuated in MCSCs by Nup153 shRNA and its effect on tumor promoting behavior will be analyzed both in vitro and in vivo. Increased understanding of the critical role of ERK1/2 signaling in MCSCs from AA patients and may provide novel targets for therapeutic drug design.        This project will test the effectiveness of phospho-ERK1/2 targeting in human mammary cancer stem cells isolated from African American and Caucasian patients. Mammary cancer stem cells will be isolated from the discarded fresh tissue samples from patient and their ability to form tumors in Nude mice will be tested before and after inhibition of ERK1/2 signaling.

"Asymmetric CD8+ T Cell Division in the Initiation of Immunity    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): CD8+ T cells play a critical role in host defense against microbes pertinent to biodefense. A hallmark of adaptive immunity against agents such as Listeria monocytogenes, LCMV virus, and Toxoplasma gondii is heterogeneity of cell fate among antigen-experienced CD8+ T cells. Substantial preliminary evidence outlined in this proposal indicates that the first division of a CD8+ T cell responding to a pathogen, in vivo, is characterized by unequal partitioning of proteins with established roles in signaling, cell fate specification, and asymmetric cell division. In addition, the first daughter T cells of the immune response appear to be differentially fated as precursors of the effector and memory lineages. This project will test whether asymmetric cell division is a general feature of the CD8+ T cell response against pathogens, whether ancestral regulators of cell polarity are responsible for establishing cytoskeletal features necessary for asymmetric division, and how asymmetrically inherited signaling proteins could mediate fate disparity in daughter T cells. These studies should provide a framework for rational engineering of immune responses and vaccines against agents of biodefense, and address fundamental uncertainties regarding the principle of clonal selection of lymphocytes in response to infectious diseases.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Specialized white blood cells, called lymphocytes, increase in number to help protect us against infections. This project will provide fundamental insight into how immunity against re-infection is maintained for one's entire life.

"Hematopoietic Stem Cell and Cord Blood Transplantation    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Blood disorders including leukemia and lymphoma can be cured with unrelated donor (URD) hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) and cord blood transplantation (CBT). Post-transplant complications and mortality may be lowered through comprehensive HLA matching of the stem cell source. KIR-HLA interactions further define transplant outcome. The clinical practice of URD HCT and CBT today has several unmet needs. HLA identity of the URD does not guarantee that the patient will not develop life-threatening post-transplant complications, indicating the presence of undetected MHC region variation. For patients who lack matched URDs, the rules that govern permissible HLA mismatches are needed so as to broaden the availability of HCT to all patients in need. In CBT, the relevance of undetected disparity at HLA-A, B, C, DR, and DQ is unknown. Natural killer (NK)-mediated effects may further modulate transplant risks. Overall, clinical outcome is inferior for patients of non-Caucasian ethnicity. This project has two major goals. First, we will define the clinical importance of MHC residue variation after URD HCT and CBT by measuring the impact of HLA mismatching in non-Caucasian populations, identifying non-permissible HLA mismatches, and novel MHC resident genes. Second, we will define the clinical impact of KIR-HLA interactions, determine the molecular mechanisms underlying donor NK alloreactivity through a systematic evaluation of activating KIRs and haplotypes, and define mechanisms involved for the development of NK alloreactivity. These research questions will address the current roadblocks in URD HCT and CBT and provide novel laboratory-based information that can be translated to clinical practice for all patients of diverse racial background.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE (provided by applicant: Even though blood disorders such as leukemia and lymphoma can be cured through transplantation of stem cells from a healthy unrelated donor or cord blood stem cells, patients suffer from life-threatening complications. The risks of complications after transplantation are caused by variation in the genetic code between the patient and the stem cells. This project will find the genes that are causing the complications so that the information may be used to select unrelated donors and cord blood stem cells that lower risks. In this way, patients can be cured of their cancer and live longer healthier lives.

"CD4+ T cells in Invasive Aspergillosis Dr. Amariliz Rivera is a newly appointed, tenure-track, assistant professor at the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey-New Jersey Medical School (UMDNJ-NJMS). Dr. Rivera is a woman of Puerto Rican descent who is committed to a career as a successful, independent scientist. Her scientific interest lies in performing research with the potential to better the therapeutic options of cancer patients afflicted with opportunistic fungal infections. Dr. Rivera's long-term career goals are: to become a recognized expert in fungal immunology, to establish a successful, well-funded research program and to be a tenured professor with the influence to contribute to diminishing the health disparities in our country. In the short term, she aspires to secure funding to support her new laboratory and its future members and to successfully complete the scientific aims proposed in this application. To attain these goals Dr. Rivera will participate in a variety of programs aimed at promoting her career development including workshops for: grant writing, presentation skills, lab management and leadership. Moreover, Drs. Gause and Salgame will be Amariliz's career development mentors. Both scientists have well-funded laboratories and are tenured-professors who have successfully trained other junior faculty. They will provide personalized advise on her career progression, will review her grants and papers and will guide her through the tenure process.   UMDNJ-NJMS is committed to Dr. Rivera's success as a scientist. She has been provided with a fully equipped laboratory and adjacent office as well as with ample space in the vivarium for her mouse strains. More importantly, she will be given protected time to focus on performing research and establishing her laboratory. Dr. Rivera will have access to a diversity of core facilities to aid in her studies and she will be surrounded by a community of fellow scientists with diverse expertise and willingness to help in her career progression. Dr. Rivera's career will also benefit from being a member of the Hispanic Center for Excellence (HCOE) where she will participate in activities specifically designed to enhance the academic performance of individuals from underserved backgrounds. Moreover, through HCOE Dr. Rivera will have the professional support of fellow scientists with common personal backgrounds.   The scientific goals of the studies proposed in this K22 application are centered in understanding and exploiting CD4 T lymphocytes in defense against fungal disease. Cancer patients that receive treatment for hematologic malignancies or bone marrow transplantation are at increased risk for developing invasive aspergillosis (IA). IA is a difficult to treat, opportunistic infection with reported mortality rates in excess of 50%. The most common causative agent of IA is Aspergillus fumigatus, a mold frequently present in the environment. Immune based therapies with the potential to benefit IA include vaccination and adoptive T cell transfers. The advancement of such immune-based therapies has been hampered by a lack of understanding of what constitutes protective A.fumigatus-specific, memory CD4 T cell responses and how are they elicited and regulated. In previous studies Dr. Rivera generated a T cell receptor transgenic mouse specific for A. fumigatus (Af3.16-TCR-tg) to track the in vivo activation, trafficking and differentiation of fungus-specific CD4 T cells. Her previous studies dissected the specific contributions of innate cells and innate receptors in shaping fungus-specific CD4 T cell differentiation in response to a primary, pulmonary infection with A.fumigatus spores. In the proposed studies she would further exploit Af3.16-TCR-tg mice to assess the formation of memory CD4 T cell responses to A.fumigatus. The specific aims of the proposed studies are: 1) Determine the impact of immune regulatory mechanisms in controlling fungus-specific CD4 T cell memory formation, 2) To examine the role of innate cell subsets and innate receptors in regulating the expansion and differentiation of fungus- specific CD4 T cell memory responses, 3) To establish optimal adoptive T cell therapies for diverse models of invasive fungal disease. Altogether, the proposed studies would significantly further our understanding of A.fumigatus-specific CD4 T cell memory formation, regulation and potential therapeutic benefit. Moreover, the successful completion of the proposed studies is likely to contribute to the development of novel therapeutic interventions to combat invasive fungal diseases. Invasive Aspergillosis (IA) is an opportunistic fungal infection that affects cancer patients with hematologic malignancies. The studies proposed in this application are aimed at identifying crucial immune cells, receptors and regulatory factors that control the formation of protective memory CD4 T cell responses against the causative agent of IA and to explore innovative adoptive T cell transfer strategies for the treatment of IA. Altogether, these studies will have important implications for the development of novel anti-fungal vaccines and immune based therapies against clinically important fungi.",CD4+ T cells in Invasive Aspergillosis,8701011,K22CA160874,[''],NCI,RBHS-NEW JERSEY MEDICAL SCHOOL,K22,2012,36793,0.19647506939563383
"Sexual Dimorphism and Dysregulated Immune Responses in SLE: The Role of Leptin    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal aims to advance the current understanding of the cellular and molecular immune events that associate with the increased susceptibility to develop systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) in females. Gender disparities associate with several biological differences that most apparently involve an evident dissimilarity between sexes in the levels of sex hormones and their receptors. However, although very important, the differences in the expression and responsiveness to sex hormones may not be sufficient to fully explain the increased incidence of SLE in females. During the past decade, our group has been interested in investigating the effects of the hormone adipokine leptin on immune responses. We and others have shown that this sexually dimorphic hormone - found at concentrations 5-10 times higher in females than in males with similar body mass index - has proinflammatory activities that greatly favor the development and the progression of several autoimmune diseases including SLE. We have also shown that leptin constraints the ability of regulatory T cells to suppress autoreactive immune responses in vitro and in vivo, and together with others we have shown that regulatory T cells can modulate SLE disease activity. Here we propose to dissect the effects of leptin on regulatory T cells in SLE by testing the hypothesis that elevated levels of leptin in females can modulate key characteristics of the regulatory T cells in SLE. Three integrated aims will study the influence of leptin on the phenotype and function of regulatory T cells in SLE at the cellular, molecular and biochemical levels. By identifying specific events that can be modulated by leptin in SLE, we aim to ultimately identify surrogate markers of therapeutic intervention that could lead to a better management of the disease.        In this application we will explore new mechanisms that may contribute to the increased susceptibility to develop systemic lupus erythematosus ( SLE) in females. We will investigate the role of a hormone that is expressed in much higher concentration in females as a possible major contributor to the pathogenesis of SLE. The role of this hormone, leptin, will be investigated in great detail for its capacity to inhibit the activity of cells that suppress autoimmunity in SLE, as preliminary work seems to suggest.

"NcoA5, a unique nuclear receptor coactivator in hepatocarcinogenesis    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is two to four times higher in men than in women and the progression of chronic liver diseases to cirrhosis is much faster in men than in women. These suggest an important role of sex hormones in hepatocarcinogenesis. However, the molecular mechanism underlying the gender disparity in HCC still remains poorly understood. And there have been controversies on the use of hormonal therapies for patients with HCC. Hence, a better understanding of the genetic and epigenetic alterations that contribute to HCC development, especially to the gender disparity of HCC, may lead to a discovery of new etiologic, prognostic or therapeutic targets. The long- term goal is to understand how the genetic alterations in cells lead to hepatocarcinogenesis. The objective of this proposal is to determine the mechanism by which down regulation of nuclear receptor coactivator 5 (Ncoa5) contributes to the development of HCC. The central hypothesis is that Ncoa5 deficiency preferentially promotes hepatocarcinogenesis in males through inhibition of estrogen receptor 1 (ER?) activity and upregulation of androgen receptor (AR) expression in the liver. This hypothesis has been formulated on the basis of our recent preliminary data. The rationale for the proposed research is that understanding of the mechanism underlying Ncoa5-mediated suppression of HCC will reveal a novel regulatory pathway and new targets for developing innovative strategies to the prevention and treatment of HCC. This hypothesis will be tested by the following two specific aims: 1). Determine the effects of estrogen on Ncoa5 deficiency induced hepatocarcinogenesis using a novel genetically-engineered mouse model; and 2) Determine the molecular mechanism by which Ncoa5 exerts its effect on Kupffer cells and hepatocytes. The approach is innovative, because it utilizes a novel genetically-engineered mouse model of spontaneous HCC to prove a critical role of Ncoa5 in the suppression of HCC development. The proposed research is significant, because it is expected to demonstrate Ncoa5 as a novel mouse tumor suppressor with haploinsufficiency that links up ER? and AR mediated regulatory pathways to HCC. This will not only advance our understanding of the etiological mechanisms of HCC, but also provide the fields of basic and preclinical studies with a new mouse model that mimics the initiation and progression of human HCC.         The proposed research is relevant to public health because the development of an animal model of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and discovery of the mechanism underlying the gender disparity of HCC will not only contribute to a more comprehensive picture of the roles of sex hormone in Hepatocarcinogenesis, but also lead to the discovery of new etiologic, prognostic or therapeutic targets. Thus, the proposed research is relevant to the part of NIH's mission that pertains to developing the prevention and/or treatment of liver cancer.

"Phosphosulindac, miRNAs and cancer racial disparity    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Epidemiological data has demonstrated that colon cancer is disproportional in incidence and mortality between Caucasians and African Americans (AA). Whereas socioeconomic and dietary differences contribute to this disparity other underlying factors must be involved. For instance, the response to chemopreventive agents is different between these two populations. Since chemopreventive agents exert their effect through a molecular target, this disparity would suggest differences at the genetic level. Therefore, the generation and evaluation of chemopreventive agents that address the issue of chemo-resistance is essential. A promising colon cancer chemopreventive agent, phospho-sulindac (P-S), inhibits colon cancer cell growth more potently than sulindac by inhibiting cell proliferation and enhancing cell killing. However, very little is known about the molecular targets in the cancer cell that are responsible for this effect. Our hypothesis, based on preliminary results, is that miRNA expression/regulation differs between AA and Caucasians and this difference may account, at least in part, a) for the differential response to chemoprevention and b) for the differential incidence of colorectal cancer. To test these hypotheses, we propose the following three specific aims: 1) To study the effect of P-S on p53, NF-kB, 2-catenin, and cell kinetics in human colon cancer cell lines originating from Caucasians and AA; 2) To assess the effect of P- S on the miRNA profile in a p53 null murine model of colon cancer; and, 3) Determine the miRNA profile in human colon cancer samples from AA and Caucasian patients. The results from these findings will lead to the understanding of a worldwide issue and provide details for the development of chemopreventive agents that will span diverse populations.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We will define the mechanisms by which P-S exert its inhibitory effect on the growth of colon cancer cells and address racial disparities as a result of genetic mutations. We will evaluate in cell culture, using cell lines derived from Caucasians and AA colon cancer tissues, changes (by microarray analysis) in the expression of transcription factors and miRNAs. In addition, we will test whether our in vitro findings are relevant to a preclinical model of colon cancer. This study will evaluate directly in a p53 null and C57BL/6 (parent background) mice model the effect of P-S on the expressions of transcription factors and miRNAs. Thereby, we will test the key mechanistic findings from the in vitro study. Lastly, we will compare and contrast prospective and retrospective colon cancer tissue of Caucasians and AA at the protein, RNA, and DNA levels. Being able to demonstrate that P-S induces a potentially important molecular change in the malignant colonocytes that may be relevant to its pharmacological actions in cancer would indicate an important breakthrough in the prevention of colon cancer. Also, being able to attribute a genetic causative effect to resistance to chemotherapeutic agents will address the issue of racial disparity.           We will define the mechanisms by which P-S exert its inhibitory effect on the growth of colon cancer cells and address racial disparities as a result of genetic mutations. We will evaluate in cell culture, using cell lines derived from Caucasians and AA colon cancer tissues, changes (by microarray analysis) in the expression of transcription factors and miRNAs. In addition, we will test whether our in vitro findings are relevant to a preclinical model of colon cancer.

"Cytoprotective Autophagy in Bone Metastatic Prostate Cancer Project Summary/Abstract Candidate: My immediate career goals are to obtain the necessary training and skill set required to be competitive for a tenured faculty position and to accumulate data sufficient for an R01 or similar funding mechanism. My long term career goals are to be a tenured, funded cancer biology professor, a mentor, and a science administrator. To this end, the key elements of my career plan are focused on 1) developing my independent research, 2) continuing my technical and research administrative education, 3) honing my communication skills, and 4) gaining more mentoring experience.  Environment: I can successfully meet my goals because I have access to state-of-the-art equipment, core facilities, and educational resources at Rice University, the Texas Medical Center, and through a prostate cancer P01 collaboration that includes the University of Delaware, Emory University, and Cedars-Sinai. I also have a team of phenomenal mentors who are leaders in the prostate cancer and cancer health disparities fields. These mentors include my primary mentor, Dr. Mary Farach-Carson, co-mentor, Dr. Leland Chung, and Drs. Nora Navone and Lovell Jones, who have each agreed to provide me with career development guidance.  Research: Prostate cancer (PCa) is the second leading cause of death in North American men, where 80% of PCa mortality is due to bone metastasis. PCa tumors can contain neuronal-like neuroendocrine (NE) PCa cells, which correlates with poor prognosis. NE PCa cells are resistant to apoptosis, secrete proteins to induce cell proliferation and angiogenesis, and can de-differentiate to contribute to tumor growth. Our lab recently published data revealing that bone marrow stromal cell (BMSC) paracrine signaling induces apoptosis in co-cultured bone metastatic PCa cells. However, a subpopulation of the bone metastatic PCa cells can avoid cell death and undergo neuroendocrine differentiation (NED). One process that has been shown to mediate cancer cell survival and cell differentiation is autophagy, the homeostatic process of intracellular degradation and recycling. Thus, I propose that autophagy is a cytoprotective mechanism that PCa cells use to survive and undergo NED in the bone marrow stromal microenvironment. To address my hypothesis, I will (1) dissect autophagy regulation in PCa cells exposed to BMSC, (2) demonstrate that autophagy enhances PCa cell survival and promotes NED, and (3) show that autophagy attenuation increases PCa cell death. Autophagy induction and function will be analyzed using immuno-blot and -staining for autophagy markers, such as LC3, and using acidic vesicle dyes, such as monodansylcadaverin. PCa cells will be subjected to genetic and pharmacological autophagy modulation and assayed for cell viability and the NED phenotype. My investigation will identify pathways to attenuate autophagy and redirect bone metastatic PCa cells towards cell death. Project Narrative  Prostate cancer (PCa) bone metastasis is responsible for 80% of PCa death. Therefore, it is imperative to understand the biology of bone metastatic PCa cells in the bone environment. Hence, the purpose of this project is to determine the role of autophagy, a homeostatic process, in bone metastatic PCa cell survival and to determine if inhibition of autophagy can kill bone metastatic PCa cells.",Cytoprotective Autophagy in Bone Metastatic Prostate Cancer,8298867,K01CA160602,"['abstracting ', ' autophagy ', ' Autophagocytosis ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Biology ', ' bone ', ' Bone Marrow Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Bone Marrow ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Cell Division Cycle ', ' Cell Cycle ', ' necrocytosis ', ' Cell Death ', ' Cell Differentiation ', ' Cell Differentiation process ', ' Subcellular Process ', ' Cellular Process ', ' Cellular Physiology ', ' Cellular Function ', ' Cell Process ', ' Cell Function ', ' Cell physiology ', ' Cell Viability ', ' Cell Survival ', ' Cells ', ' Communication ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Delaware ', ' Coloring Agents ', ' Dyes ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Elements ', ' Environment ', ' Equipment ', ' Faculty ', ' Goals ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Growth ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Mentors ', ' Mortality ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' neuronal ', ' Neurocyte ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Neurons ', ' Neuroendocrine System ', ' Neuroendocrine ', ' Neurosecretory Systems ', ' Phenotype ', ' Prognosis ', ' outcome forecast ', ' gene product ', ' Proteins ', ' Publishing ', ' Research ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Rice ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Science ', ' Signal Pathway ', ' Stains ', ' Texas ', ' Universities ', ' Administrator ', ' Mediating ', ' bone neoplasm secondary ', ' Skeletal metastasis ', ' Secondary malignant neoplasm of bone ', ' Secondary malignancy of bone ', ' Secondary cancer of bone ', ' Osseous metastasis ', ' Metastatic malignant neoplasm to bone ', ' Metastatic Tumor to the Bone ', ' Metastatic Cancer to the Bone ', ' Metastasis to bone ', ' Bony metastasis ', ' Bone cancer metastatic ', ' Bone Metastasis ', ' Metastatic Neoplasm to the Bone ', ' Killings ', ' Stromal Cells ', ' Programmed Cell Death ', ' Apoptosis Pathway ', ' Apoptosis ', ' career ', ' Site ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' Funding ', ' Recycling ', ' Collaborations ', ' Coculture ', ' Cocultivation ', ' Co-culture ', ' Coculture Techniques ', ' angiogenesis ', ' Genetic ', ' Exposure to ', ' Attenuated ', ' Vesicle ', ' Malignant Cell ', ' cancer cell ', ' Prostatic Cancer ', ' Prostate Cancer ', ' Prostate CA ', ' Malignant prostatic tumor ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Prostate ', ' Malignant neoplasm of prostate ', ' Investigation ', ' Stainings ', ' Staining method ', ' Paracrine Signaling ', ' Paracrine Communication ', ' meetings ', ' skills training ', ' Medical center ', ' American ', ' Cellular Proliferation ', ' Cell Multiplication ', ' Cell Growth in Number ', ' Cell Proliferation ', ' experience ', ' paracrine ', ' tumor growth ', ' professor ', ' attenuation ', ' skills ', ' Phenocopy ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Regulation ', ' ray (radiation) ', ' Radiation ', ' Modeling ', ' career development ', ' response ', ' Prostate Carcinoma Metastatic ', ' Metastatic Prostate Cancer ', ' Address ', ' Core Facility ', ' cytotoxic ', ' Data ', ' Mitotic ', ' Apoptotic ', ' Cancer Biology ', ' Funding Mechanisms ', ' Molecular Tumor Suppression ', ' Tumor Suppression ', ' Process ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' Metabolic stress ', ' cancer disparity ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' resistant ', ' Resistance ', ' tumor ', ' inhibition of autophagy ', ' ']",NCI,RICE UNIVERSITY,K01,2012,115020,0.0210667541007562
"Xenograft Model to Study Impact of CRLF2-Ligand in Hispanic Childhood B-ALL     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Hispanic children have a 39% higher death rate due to ALL than white children. A major cause of this health disparity in survival is the lack of therapies that specifically target the high-risk B-ALL caused by deregulated CRLF2 (CRLF2-d). Genetic defects resulting in B cells that overexpress the cytokine receptor component, CRLF2, lead to malignant transformation and high-risk CRLF2-d B-ALL with poor prognosis. B-ALL arising from CRLF2-d is five times more frequent among children of Hispanic/Latino ethnicity than others. CRLF2 is part of a signaling receptor activated by ligation with the cytokine TSLP. TSLP has been reported to expand B- ALL cells and to protect them from mTOR inhibitors. Human B-ALL-mouse xenograft models that mimic the in vivo BM environment are the model of choice for identifying therapies that target the mechanisms of chemoresistance that are characteristic of high-risk B-ALL. However, mouse TSLP does not interact with human CRLF2. Thus, existing xenograft models of B-ALL are inadequate for studies of CRLF2-d B-ALL because they do not provide the human TSLP that is required to induce CRLF2-mediated signals. The development of xenograft models of CRLF2 function in B-ALL are essential for identifying therapies that will selectively target CRLF2-d and reduce the health disparity in survival for Hispanic children due to high-risk CRLF2-d B-ALL. The objective of this proposal is to develop an in vivo model of CRLF2 function in B-ALL by expressing human TSLP (hTSLP) in a xenograft model of B-ALL and to use this model to investigate CRLF-2- TSLP interactions as a therapeutic target for high risk CRLF2-d B-ALL. We will achieve this objective through the following aims: Specific Aim 1: Develop a human-mouse xenograft model to identify therapies that will specifically target CRLF2-d B-ALL. We will: 1.1. Engineer immunodeficient mice for lentiviral expression of human hTSLP. 1.2.Optimize the human-mouse xenograft model system for engraftment with CRLF2-d B- ALL cells. Our overarching hypothesis is that TSLP induces CRLF2-mediated signals that are responsible for the disease progression and chemoresistance of CRLF2-d B-ALL that results in poor survival for Hispanic children with B-ALL. To test this hypothesis we will: Specific Aim 2. Determine the impact of CRLF2 ligation on the progression of CRLF2-d B-ALL. Using the hTSLP+/- xenograft model system we will 2.2 Determine the extent of bone marrow disease. 2.3 Evaluate TSLP receptor signaling in B-ALL cells. The xenograft model of CRLF2 function in B-ALL that we will develop in this application will be essential for identifying therapies that will selectively target CRLF2-d and reduce the health disparity in survival for Hispanic children due to high-risk CRLF2-d B-ALL.          Hispanic children disproportionately develop and die from high-risk B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B- ALL). Defects in B cells that cause increased levels of the growth factor receptor CRLF2 are five times more frequent among children of Hispanic/Latino ethnicity than others and contribute to their increased death from high-risk B-ALL. We will develop a unique animal model that allows us to study and target the mechanism by which CRLF2 contributes to leukemia and reduce health disparities in Hispanic childhood B-ALL.

"Characterization of novel compounds with anti-lymphoma activity     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Although the incidence for cancer in the US has declined slightly in the past decade, it still claims the lives of more than half a million individals a year. There are a great number of distinct types of lymphocyte malignancies that represent the various stages of B- and T-cell development and these represent approximately 9% of all cancers in this country. Lymphomas represent ~54% of blood cell cancers and the main forms are Hodgkin and non-Hodgkin lymphomas (NLH). The latter is the most common type of lymphoma and affects Caucasians at a highest rate followed closely by people of Hispanic descent. Patients with NLH have a 5 year survival rate of ~67% while African Americans have a lower survival rate of 56%. Patients with Hodgkin lymphoma have a survival rate of 83% for whites and 77% for African Americans. There are many factors that not only affect cancer incidence but also mortality, and some of these are the likely causes of the observed health disparities. Unfortunately, finding a cure for all types of cancer is highly unlikely as there are many genetic alterations that are involved and many distinct types of cancers. However, there are new drugs being discovered on a fairly frequent basis that affect specific cancer types by targeting specific pathways that interfere with their growth or induce cell death. In recent months, we have developed and validated a screening assay that was used to test a small library of compounds on B- and T-cell lymphomas. These screening efforts have resulted in the identification of several related compounds that are highly cytotoxic to lymphomas. The main goal of this project is to characterize the novel anti-lymphoma compounds that have been identified. The specific aims of the project are to (1) characterize the identified anti-lymphoma compounds (2) determine the mode of action of lead compounds, and (3) examine the effects of the most promising compounds in vivo. The identification and characterization of drugs that are cytotoxic to specific types of lymphomas can lead to novel therapeutic agents.              PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The second leading cause of death in the United States is cancer. Apart from the most commons types of cancer such as breast and prostate, there are a great number of hematopoietic and lymphoid malignancies. Our group has identified greater than fifty related compounds with strong cytotoxic activity against human lymphomas that need to be fully characterized. The identification and characterization of drugs that are cytotoxic to specific types of lymphomas can lead to the implementation of new agents that alone or in combination can cure or increase life expectancy of those affected by specific lymphoid neoplasms.            ",Characterization of novel compounds with anti-lymphoma activity,8414350,SC3GM103713,"['Affect ', ' Age ', ' anticancer drug ', ' anticancer agent ', ' Tumor-Specific Treatment Agents ', ' Neoplastic Disease Chemotherapeutic Agents ', ' Cancer Drug ', ' Antineoplastics ', ' Antineoplastic Drugs ', ' Anti-Cancer Agents ', ' Antineoplastic Agents ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Peripheral Blood Cell ', ' Blood Cells ', ' Breast ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' white race ', ' Occidental ', ' Caucasoid ', ' Caucasian Race ', ' Caucasian ', ' Caucasoid Race ', ' Cause of Death ', ' necrocytosis ', ' Cell Death ', ' cultured cell line ', ' Strains Cell Lines ', ' CellLine ', ' Cell Line ', ' Evaluation Studies, Drug, Preclinical ', ' Evaluation Studies, Drug, Pre-Clinical ', ' Drug Screening ', ' Preclinical Drug Evaluation ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Growth ', ' lymphogranulomatosis (malignant) ', ' Malignant Lymphogranuloma ', ' Hodgkins lymphoma ', "" Hodgkin's disease "", "" Hodgkin's Lymphoma "", "" Hodgkin's "", ' Hodgkin lymphoma ', ' Hodgkin Disorder ', ' Hodgkin Disease ', ' Modern Man ', ' Man (Taxonomy) ', ' Human ', ' In Vitro ', ' Incidence ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Libraries ', ' Life Expectancy ', ' lymph cell ', ' Lymphocytic ', ' Lymphocyte ', ' Reticulolymphosarcoma ', ' Malignant Lymphoma ', "" Lymphoma (Hodgkin's and Non-Hodgkin's) "", ' Germinoblastoma ', ' Germinoblastic Sarcoma ', ' Lymphoma ', ' non-Hodgkins lymphoma ', ' non-Hodgkins disease ', ' Nonhodgkins Lymphoma ', "" Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma "", ' Mortality ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' genome mutation ', ' Genetic defect ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Mutation ', ' Patients ', ' Prostatic Gland ', ' Prostate Gland ', ' Prostate ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Survival Rate ', ' Testing ', ' transplant ', ' Transplantation ', ' United States ', ' Caucasians ', "" T-Cell and NK-Cell Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma "", ' T-Cell NonHodgkins Lymphoma ', "" T-Cell Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma "", ' T-Cell Lymphoma ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Hispanics ', ' TimeLine ', ' Programmed Cell Death ', ' Apoptosis Pathway ', ' Apoptosis ', ' base ', ' cytotoxicity test ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Therapeutic Agents ', ' Cytotoxic drug ', ' Cytotoxic agent ', ' Staging ', ' blood cancer ', ' Malignant Hematopoietic Neoplasm ', ' Hematopoietic and Lymphoid Neoplasms ', ' Hematopoietic and Lymphoid Cell Neoplasm ', ' Hematopoietic Tumor ', ' Hematopoietic Neoplasms including Lymphomas ', ' Hematopoietic Malignancies ', ' Hematopoietic Cell Tumor ', ' Hematopoietic Neoplasms ', ' Country ', ' Lymphoid and Plasmacytic Tumour ', ' Lymphoid and Plasmacytic Neoplasm ', ' Lymphoid and Plasma Cell Tumour ', ' Lymphoid Tumor ', ' Lymphocytic and Plasmacytic Neoplasm ', ' Lymphocytic and Plasma Cell Tumour ', ' Lymphocytic and Plasma Cell Neoplasm ', ' Lymphocytic Tumor ', ' Lymphocytic Neoplasm ', ' lymphoid neoplasm ', ' novel ', ' lymphoid malignancy ', ' Malignant lymphoid neoplasm ', ' treatment adverse effect ', ' therapy adverse effect ', ' side effect ', ' Treatment Side Effects ', ' Adverse effects ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Dose ', ' cytotoxic ', ' Data ', ' Immunodeficient Mouse ', ' T-Lymphocyte Development ', ' T-Cell Ontogeny ', ' T-Cell Development ', ' in vivo ', ' New Agents ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' resistant to therapy ', ' resistance to therapy ', ' therapy resistant ', ' lymphoma/leukemia ', ' leukemia/lymphoma ', ' cancer type ', ' resistant ', ' Resistance ', ' next generation therapeutics ', ' new therapeutics ', ' novel therapeutics ', ' public health relevance ', ' screening ', ' ']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS EL PASO,SC3,2013,113125,0.018967989078437192
"NCMHD Southeastern Exploratory Sickle Cell Center of Excellence    DESCRIPTION: Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a genetic disorder of hemoglobin and afflicts ~110,000 African-Americans in the US. Because of its complex pathophysiology through chronic hemolytic anemia, microvascularocclusion, and a chronic inflammatory state, it affects multiple organ systems and leads to significant morbidity and organ damage as well as leads to frequent hospitalizations and health care encounters. During the past 35 years, primarily through research and patient care conducted by the NIH funded Comprehensive Sickle Cell Centers and some pivotal clinical trials, the life expectancy of patients with SCD has increased from the teens to mid- to late forties. This is still considerably shorter than that of African-Americans who do not have sickle cell disease and can be viewed as a major disparity even in this underserved minority population. While significant advances have been made in the understanding of the disease pathophysiology and in novel therapies through basic and translational research, these advances have been slow to be taken to clinical practice. The Southeastern Exploratory Sickle Cell Center of Excellence seeks to improve the care and quality of life of the SCD patient population by i) investigating the basic mechanism of action of a highly successful and effective hemoglobin F inducing drug, hydroxyurea, ii) identifying genetic variations underlying the frequency of pain, response to narcotics, and thus addressing the important issue of biologic/genetic bases of pain and its under treatment leading to the stigmatization of many SCD patients and its resulting disparity, iii) investigating the medical, social, and economic reasons for underutilization of hydroxyurea in SCD, iv) training primary care physicians with evidence based medicine in the care of patients with SCD, given the sobering reality that there will not be enough specialists in non-malignant hematology to meet the needs of the growing adult SCD population, and v) implementing innovative methods and concepts for the care of SCD patients in the ED and for transitioning from pediatric to adult care.

"Immune regulatory mechanisms and fungus-specific memory T cell responses     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The opportunistic fungal pathogen Aspergillus fumigatus is the causative agent of more than 90% of all Invasive Aspergillosis (IA) infections diagnosed in immunosuppressed patients. Exposure to A. fumigatus can also lead to the development of allergic asthma and Allergic Bronchopulmonary Aspergillosis (ABPA) in patients with atopic asthma or Cystic Fibrosis. Fungus-specific CD4 T cell responses are important in defense against invasive disease and mediate the development of allergic responses. Thus, understanding the factors that control the expansion and formation of fungus-specific memory CD4 T cells will lay the foundation for the future development of novel immune-based therapeutic strategies to enhance or inhibit fungus-specific immunity. In this proposal, the applicant will examine the contributions of regulatory T cells (Tregs) and T cell-intrinsic inhibitry receptors (PD-1 and CTLA-4) in controlling fungus-specific CD4 T cell responses. Moreover, the proposed studies will determine the mechanism of action of inhibitory receptors and Tregs and how they impact fungus-driven allergic airway disease progression. The applicant will be supported by a comprehensive training plan to promote her career development as an independent scientist and to help her attain a PhD degree. The long-term goal of the applicant is to become a successful, well- funded, independent researcher. As a woman of Hispanic descent the applicant is committed to contributing to the future development of research programs to address health disparities and diversity in biomedical science's workforce.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The opportunistic fungal pathogen Aspergillus fumigatus is the most common causative agent of invasive aspergillosis and can also trigger the development of allergic asthma responses. Immune responses to this fungus are central in the pathogenesis of fungal allergic asthma and in the prevention of invasive fungal disease. The studies proposed in this application will elucidate the specific contributions of immune regulatory mechanisms that promote the proper eradication of A. fumigatus while preventing excessive tissue damage to the host.

"Mechanisms of Immune Evasion and Recognition in Human Syphilis     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Syphilis, a multi-stage sexually transmitted disease caused by the spirochete Treponema pallidum (Tp), continues to be a major worldwide public health problem. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that approximately 10.6 million new syphilis cases occur yearly throughout the globe. The clinical manifestations of syphilis reflect the propensity of Tp to disseminate systemically and induce a chronic inflammation which occurs in stages, being secondary syphilis (SS) the focus of this proposal. Despite the robust nature of the adaptive and humoral immune responses during SS, including the emergence of high titers of opsonic antibodies, it takes weeks to months for host defenses to gain control of the invading pathogen. How the bacterium is able to evade human host defenses, while at the same time evoking vigorous cellular and humoral immune responses, is the principal scientific objective of the current proposal. A careful analysis of Tp¿s unique ultrastructural characteristics, which contains very few outer membrane proteins (OMPs), provides potential explanations for the paradoxical nature of SS. Inefficient antibody binding to the sparse spirochetal OMP antigenic targets is thought to allow a large proportion of spirochetes to shun antibody binding and opsonophagocytosis; a mechanism which we have shown is an essential requirement for Tp driven innate immune cell activation. The new finding that circulating natural killer (NK) cells reveal immunophenotypic alterations (emergence of a CD56negativeCD16high NK-cell subset), which exhibits both poor cytolytic activity and impaired cytokine production suggests that additional immunologic factors play a role in the duality of the immune response to Tp. We now propose a new syphilis immune-pathogenesis model, where antibodies to Tp¿s rare OMPs are only capable of binding a sub-population of spirochetes, thus allowing immune escape of organisms and at the same time recognition and bacterial clearance of different tissues. Over time, the host's expanding repertoire of antibodies against these rare OMPs broadens and intensifies, leading to more efficient opsonophagocytosis, bacterial clearance and lesion resolution. To accomplish our goals and examine mechanistic aspects of the proposed model, we have formulated the following Specific Aims. In Aim 1: we will further characterize spirochete burdens, spirochete diversity and the antibody responses in the blood of secondary syphilis patients; and in aim 2: we will study the role of the dermal macrophage as a driver of both inflammation and spirochetal clearance in secondary syphilis patient's dermal lesions. And in aim 3, w will further characterize NK cells in blood of SS patients. In concert wit the Fogarty International Center's mission to reduce health disparities amongst nations, the planned activities will also: (1) support collaborative syphilis immunobiology research between the LMIC PI and the US collaborators (2) strengthen CIDEIM¿s research capabilities and technical base; (3) continue providing needed epidemiological data about venereal syphilis for that region of Colombia.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Syphilis, caused by the spirochetal bacterium, Treponema pallidum, remains rampant throughout the world with more than 10.6 million cases occurring every year. This proposed research will allow us to advance our understanding of spirochetal immune recognition and immune evasion by its obligate human host and equally importantly, will address a major public health problem in Colombia, continue to provide local health authorities much needed epidemiological data about venereal syphilis in Cali and will allow the investigative team to carry on with education and training of local health professionals about the complexities of syphilis diagnosis and management.            ",Mechanisms of Immune Evasion and Recognition in Human Syphilis,8411525,R03TW009172,"['Antibodies ', ' immunoglobulin biosynthesis ', ' antibody biosynthesis ', ' Antibody Response ', ' Antibody Production ', ' Antibody Formation ', ' Bacteria ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Blood ', ' Chancre ', ' Syphilitic chancre ', ' Colombia ', ' Veiled Cells ', ' Dendritic Cells ', ' Under-Developed Nations ', ' Under-Developed Countries ', ' Third-World Nations ', ' Third-World Countries ', ' Less-Developed Nations ', ' Less-Developed Countries ', ' Developing Nations ', ' Developing Nation ', ' Developing Country ', ' Developing Countries ', ' Diagnosis ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' Exhibits ', ' Freeze Fracturings ', ' Freeze Fracturing ', ' Glycolipids ', ' Goals ', ' Gram-Negative Bacteria ', ' Health ', ' Modern Man ', ' Man (Taxonomy) ', ' Human ', ' immunological substance ', ' immunologic substance ', ' Immunological Factors ', ' Immunologic Factors ', ' Infection ', ' Inflammation ', ' Transmembrane Protein ', ' Intrinsic Membrane Protein ', ' Integral Membrane Protein ', ' NK Cells ', ' K lymphocyte ', ' Cytotoxic cell ', ' Natural Killer Cells ', ' Lipids ', ' Lipopolysaccharides ', ' macrophage ', ' Surface Proteins ', ' Membrane-Associated Proteins ', ' Membrane Proteins ', ' Microscopy ', ' Mission ', ' living system ', ' Organism ', ' Patients ', ' Play ', ' Production ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' immune receptor ', ' Immunological Receptors ', ' Immunologic Receptors ', ' Research ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Venereal Infections ', ' Venereal Disorders ', ' Venereal Diseases ', ' Sexually Transmitted Infection ', ' Sexually Transmitted Disorder ', ' Sexually Transmitted Diseases ', ' Diagnostic Findings ', ' Signs and Symptoms ', ' Spirochetes ', ' Spirochaetales ', ' Order Spirochaetales ', ' great pox ', ' Syphilis ', ' Latent Syphilis ', ' thymus derived lymphocyte ', ' Thymus-Dependent Lymphocytes ', ' T-Cells ', ' T-Lymphocyte ', ' Time ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Tissues ', ' T.pallidum ', ' T. pallidum ', ' Treponema pallidum ', ' United States ', ' Western Europe ', ' Wit ', ' World Health Organization ', ' cytokine ', ' Mediating ', ' base ', ' Organ ', ' Surface ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Lesion ', ' Dermal ', ' Individual ', ' Research Activity ', ' uptake ', ' immunoresponse ', ' host response ', ' Immune response ', ' Staging ', ' Nature ', ' Immune ', ' Organ System ', ' body system ', ' Host Defense ', ' periplasmic ', ' Periplasmic Space ', ' periplasm ', ' Training and Education ', ' membrane structure ', ' Membrane ', ' international center ', ' authority ', ' TLR protein ', ' Toll-like receptors ', ' Pathogenesis ', ' Appearance ', ' Modeling ', ' Skin ', ' Immune Cell Activation ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' Binding ', ' Binding (Molecular Function) ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' polypeptide ', ' cell mediated immune response ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Immunophysiology ', ' Immunobiology ', ' Resolution ', ' Antibody Repertoire ', ' Invaded ', ' Immunochemical Immunologic ', ' Immunologics ', ' Characteristics ', ' Healthcare professional ', ' Health Care Professional ', ' Health Professional ', ' pathogen ', ' Population ', ' NH2-terminal ', ' N-terminal ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' translational approach ', ' public health relevance ', ' ']",FIC,CENTRO INTERNACIONAL  (CIDEIM),R03,2013,48304,0.06704394188098561
"Gender Disparity in Bladder Cancer and Chemopreventive Intervention     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Bladder cancer (BC) is the 4th most common cancer in men, but BC incidence is nearly 4 fold higher in men than in women across race; the underlying cause is not understood. Lack of such knowledge impedes progress in BC prevention. On the basis of our published and unpublished data, we hypothesize that hepatic UDP-glucuronosyltransferase 1A3 (UGT1A3) is a key determinant of the gender disparity in human BC development through converting androgen signal to increased urinary delivery of arylamine carcinogens to bladder tissue. Arylamines, 4-aminobiphenyl (ABP) in particular, are the main cause of human BC. We also hypothesize that sulforaphane (SF), a common dietary phytochemical, can block UGT1A3 from promoting arylamine-induced bladder carcinogenesis by boosting cytoprotective defense in the bladder. These hypotheses will be examined in four specific aims using complementary approaches of cultured cells and transgenic mouse models. Aim 1 is to test our hypothesis that liver UGT1A3 is a key molecule that determines the gender disparity in BC development. Wild-type mice and UGT1A3 transgenic mice (liver- specific and androgen-independent expression) will be compared for ABP-induced bladder carcinogenesis. Comparison will also be made between mice with and without castration. Another carcinogen 2- acetylaminofluorene (2-AAF) will be used to rule out ABP-specific effects. Aim 2 is to assess the impact of UGT1A3 polymorphism on its catalytic activity toward ABP and 2-AAF and on the susceptibility of bladder cells and liver cells to DNA damage induced by ABP and 2-AAF. Six single nucleotide polymorphisms occur in UGT1A3 gene. All the polymorphic variants together with the wild-type gene will be evaluated. Aim 3 is to test our hypothesis that SF can block UGT1A3 from promoting bladder carcinogenesis by stimulating cytoprotective defense against arylamine carcinogens (ABP and 2-AAF) in the bladder, without modulating UGT1A3 in the liver. Non-interference of liver UGT1A3 may be desirable, since this enzyme may be physiologically important, such as metabolizing estrone. SF is a promising cancer-preventive agent and is selectively delivered to bladder tissue through urinary excretion. Two animal models will be used to test the hypothesis, including the UGT1A3 mouse model described above and the Tg-UGT1 mouse model (mice carry both the coding and the regulatory sequences of the human UGT1A3 gene). Aim 4 is to confirm that UGT1A3 is transcriptionally stimulated by androgen in vivo and to elucidate the molecular mechanism by which androgen stimulates UGT1A3. This will be accomplished by using both cell models and the Tg-UGT1 mouse model. Impact: The proposed studies are expected to lead to the elucidation of the molecular basis of the gender disparity in BC and the development of new strategy for effective prevention of this disease.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: It has been known for several decades that the incidence of bladder cancer is nearly 4 fold higher in men than in women across race, but the reason has remained poorly understood. Lack of such knowledge impedes progress in bladder cancer prevention, and no chemopreventive agent is currently available for prevention of bladder cancer. This application will examine the hypothesis that UGT1A3 is a key determinant of gender disparity in human bladder cancer development and also examine the hypothesis that sulforaphane, a common dietary phytochemical, can block the bladder cancer-promoting activity of UGT1A3 and inhibit bladder cancer development, and the project is expected to significantly advance the knowledge about bladder cancer and to lead to development of a new strategy for effective prevention of this disease.            ",Gender Disparity in Bladder Cancer and Chemopreventive

"Estrogen-ERbeta Axis In Disparity of Prostate Cancer DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): African Americans (AA) with prostate cancer (PC) have twice the incidence and mortality than European Americans (EA) and any other ethnic groups, however, the mechanism/s linked to this health disparity is not understood. The uncontrolled androgen receptor (AR) signaling in PC cells increases tumor development which is controlled by androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) in patients. However, ADT selects for androgen- independence and recurrence of aggressive tumors in AA-men. Notably, AA-men with PC have significantly higher circulating estrogens than EA-men. Since adipose tissue is the major source of estrogens in men and since PC risk increases with age and obesity, there appears to be a crucial link between adiposity and estrogenic signaling in PC progression. Indeed, estrogenic signaling via the estrogen receptor-beta (ERP) is implicated in aggressive tumor growth and metastasis. Our combined suppressive subtractive hybridization (SSH) analysis and race-based cDNA microarrays, showed a selective up-regulation of both the ERa co- repressor, SAFB2 and the ERf3 isoform, in freshly microdissected PC specimen. In the AA-derived PC cell line MDA-PCa-2b, activation of estrogen-ERP signaling axis conferred AR transactivation and proliferative responses in PC cells, even in the absence of androgen. Furthermore, adipose stem cells (ADMSCs) from AA-men secreted estrogens in response to tumor-derived factors and increased PC cell growth both in vitro and in vivo. We therefore hypothesize that activation ofAR signaling by estrogen-ERP axis is pivotal to the progression of PC in AA-men despite androgen ablation therapy. Our hypothesis will be tested by the following specific aims: (1) to evaluate the clinical utility of SAFB2 and ERb expression levels as biomarkers and/or prognostic indicators of aggressive PC in African Americans. (2) To determine if the estrogen-ERp axis augments AR-mediated growth and metastasis in SAFB2-expressing PC cells in vitro.

"Uterine Leiomyoma Development in Mouse Models     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Uterine fibroids (leiomyomata uteri) are the most common tumors in the female reproductive tract. Some estimates indicate that more than 50% of American women have uterine fibroids. Additionally, there is a significant disparity in the incidence of fibroids since African-American women are 2-3 times more likely to develop fibroids. These tumors can be very painful and are a leading cause of infertility in women. Also, because these tumors can become very large, and although the uterus is indispensable for mammalian reproduction, they remain the main reason for hysterectomies in the US. Despite the healthcare burden caused by uterine fibroids, their etiology and pathophysiology are unknown. We have developed mutant mice in which nuclear ¿-catenin signaling has been specifically induced in reproductive tract tissues. Normally, mice do not develop fibroids; however, these mutant mice develop smooth muscle tumors in their uteri with 100% penetrance by 8 weeks of age. These tumors exhibit characteristics of human fibroids by histological and immunohistochemical criteria. ¿-Catenin, a well-known downstream effector of Wnt signaling, induces organ and tissue malformations and tumor development following dysregulation of its activity. The mice also express higher levels of mTor, as observed in the Tsc2-mutant Eker rat fibroid model and in approximately 50% of human fibroids, suggesting that mTor activation may be a common pathway in leiomyoma development. We will investigate this mouse model further, placing particular emphasis on the regulation of mTor gene expression and activity for comparison with other mutant mouse models lacking myometrial Lkb1, the gene mutated in patients with Peutz-Jeghers Syndrome, and Tsc1, both of which also induce mTor activity and induce uterine fibroids as shown in our preliminary results. We propose to investigate the intracellular mechanisms and pathways affected by dysregulated Wnt/¿-catenin in our unique mouse model that induce mTor activity for comparison with Lkb1- and Tsc2-deleted uteri. To better understand the etiology and pathogenesis of fibroids, we will study the molecular mechanisms controlling fibrosis in the mutant myometrial cells such as cell polarity, extracellular matrix deposition, and myometrial differentiation. We will determine which characteristics of the mouse models most closely resemble human leiomyomas and are best suited for preclinical studies. Lastly, we will determine whether disrupted Wnt/¿-catenin signaling contributes to human leiomyoma development. The results from the studies in this proposal will provide new insights into the etiology and progression of these tumors, as well as provide the rationale for investigating therapies targeting the mechanisms involved in leiomyoma development and progression.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Uterine fibroids affect approximately 50% of American women during their reproductive years and are a significant source of pelvic pain, abnormal uterine bleeding, and infertility. Despite the major health care burden posed by uterine fibroids, very little is known about their cause or the best treatment strategies. As a result, if the symptoms are severe enough, patients can be managed by surgical intervention. The overall aims of the proposed studies are to understand the underlying causes of uterine fibroid development and growth and to develop new therapeutic options that could offer a safer alternative for treating this disease.            ",Uterine Leiomyoma Development in Mouse Models,8439082,R01HD072489,"['Accounting ', ' Myokinase ', ' Adenylokinase ', ' ATP-AMP Transphosphorylase ', '

"Use of Allogenicity to Stimulate Effector Responses Against Multiple Myeloma     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Multiple myeloma (MM) is a bone marrow plasma cell cancer with a mortality rate greater than 50%1.  According to the National Program of Cancer Registries United States Cancer Statistics, both incidence and death rates among African-Americans were approximately twice that seen in the other ethnic populations2.  It is therefore important to examine those factors unique to this population which may contribute to the unequal rates of morbidity and mortality associated with this disease.  Of the available treatments for MM, remission has primarily been observed following autologous and allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation3,4.  Immunotherapy strategies have also been developed.  For example, the human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-A2  restricted MM-associated protein HM1.24, which is overexpressed in Multiple myeloma cells, has been shown to stimulate interferon gamma expression by myeloma-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs)7.  However, at present, these therapeutic approaches alone do not consistently elicit antitumor cytotoxic effects in in vitro or in vivo studies8,9.  This is due, in part, to the lack of understanding of te factors which contribute to T cell activation in the largely tolerizing tumor setting, such as allogenicity.  However, the greater diversity of HLA polymorphisms in African-Americans provides a unique resource for interrogating the biophysical underpinnings of HLA restriction in targeted tumor immunotherapies for diseases such as MM.  The general objective of the project detailed in this proposal is to determine the effect of allogeneic variation in HLA-A2 on the induction of CTLs to immunodominant peptides of the HM1.24 antigen.  The prevalence of certain HLA-A2 alleles may differ between African-Americans and Caucasians, and it is possible that these differences contribute to different responses against HLA-A2-restricted tumor associated antigens.  Thus, in Aim 1, the most prevalent HLA-A class I alleles within the African-American population will be identified.  Immunogenic peptides of MM HM1.24 specific for those alleles will be determined by in silico analysis.  This will be used in Aim 2 to design and construct structurally allogeneic variants of HLA-A2-HM1.24 complexes by molecular modeling and molecular biology techniques.  Finally, in Aim 3, to investigate the impact of allogeneic variation on CTL responses, the complexes will be delivered to antigen presenting cells using a novel application of the lentiviral vector system.  The APCs will then be co-cultured with HLA-A2-restricted, HM1.24-specific CTLs in CTL effector assays.  The hypothesis being tested is that allogeneic variants of this MM associated HLA-peptide complex can be engineered to augment CTL responses.  This project utilizes bioinformatics, molecular biology, and tissue culture techniques to address how biophysical and genetic components of HLA-A2-peptide complexes contribute to the allogeneic responses of T cells.  Ultimately, this project seeks to contribute to the knowledge base currently being used to develop immunotherapies for diseases such as MM, specifically in populations which demonstrate well-documented health disparities.              Multiple myeloma is a destructive plasma cell cancer which disproportionately affects African-Americans and for which no definitive cure exists.  This project may contribute a putative model for designing and optimizing vectors which uses the genetic variation within the African-American population to promote anti-cancer immune responses.  This model could perhaps be used to develop personalized therapies for diseases such as Multiple myeloma, which exhibit health disparities in unique populations.

"Phosphosulindac, miRNAs and cancer racial disparity    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Epidemiological data has demonstrated that colon cancer is disproportional in incidence and mortality between Caucasians and African Americans (AA). Whereas socioeconomic and dietary differences contribute to this disparity other underlying factors must be involved. For instance, the response to chemopreventive agents is different between these two populations. Since chemopreventive agents exert their effect through a molecular target, this disparity would suggest differences at the genetic level. Therefore, the generation and evaluation of chemopreventive agents that address the issue of chemo-resistance is essential. A promising colon cancer chemopreventive agent, phospho-sulindac (P-S), inhibits colon cancer cell growth more potently than sulindac by inhibiting cell proliferation and enhancing cell killing. However, very little is known about the molecular targets in the cancer cell that are responsible for this effect. Our hypothesis, based on preliminary results, is that miRNA expression/regulation differs between AA and Caucasians and this difference may account, at least in part, a) for the differential response to chemoprevention and b) for the differential incidence of colorectal cancer. To test these hypotheses, we propose the following three specific aims: 1) To study the effect of P-S on p53, NF-kB, 2-catenin, and cell kinetics in human colon cancer cell lines originating from Caucasians and AA; 2) To assess the effect of P- S on the miRNA profile in a p53 null murine model of colon cancer; and, 3) Determine the miRNA profile in human colon cancer samples from AA and Caucasian patients. The results from these findings will lead to the understanding of a worldwide issue and provide details for the development of chemopreventive agents that will span diverse populations.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We will define the mechanisms by which P-S exert its inhibitory effect on the growth of colon cancer cells and address racial disparities as a result of genetic mutations. We will evaluate in cell culture, using cell lines derived from Caucasians and AA colon cancer tissues, changes (by microarray analysis) in the expression of transcription factors and miRNAs. In addition, we will test whether our in vitro findings are relevant to a preclinical model of colon cancer. This study will evaluate directly in a p53 null and C57BL/6 (parent background) mice model the effect of P-S on the expressions of transcription factors and miRNAs. Thereby, we will test the key mechanistic findings from the in vitro study. Lastly, we will compare and contrast prospective and retrospective colon cancer tissue of Caucasians and AA at the protein, RNA, and DNA levels. Being able to demonstrate that P-S induces a potentially important molecular change in the malignant colonocytes that may be relevant to its pharmacological actions in cancer would indicate an important breakthrough in the prevention of colon cancer. Also, being able to attribute a genetic causative effect to resistance to chemotherapeutic agents will address the issue of racial disparity.

"Cytoprotective Autophagy in Bone Metastatic Prostate Cancer Project Summary/Abstract Candidate: My immediate career goals are to obtain the necessary training and skill set required to be competitive for a tenured faculty position and to accumulate data sufficient for an R01 or similar funding mechanism. My long term career goals are to be a tenured, funded cancer biology professor, a mentor, and a science administrator. To this end, the key elements of my career plan are focused on 1) developing my independent research, 2) continuing my technical and research administrative education, 3) honing my communication skills, and 4) gaining more mentoring experience.  Environment: I can successfully meet my goals because I have access to state-of-the-art equipment, core facilities, and educational resources at Rice University, the Texas Medical Center, and through a prostate cancer P01 collaboration that includes the University of Delaware, Emory University, and Cedars-Sinai. I also have a team of phenomenal mentors who are leaders in the prostate cancer and cancer health disparities fields. These mentors include my primary mentor, Dr. Mary Farach-Carson, co-mentor, Dr. Leland Chung, and Drs. Nora Navone and Lovell Jones, who have each agreed to provide me with career development guidance.  Research: Prostate cancer (PCa) is the second leading cause of death in North American men, where 80% of PCa mortality is due to bone metastasis. PCa tumors can contain neuronal-like neuroendocrine (NE) PCa cells, which correlates with poor prognosis. NE PCa cells are resistant to apoptosis, secrete proteins to induce cell proliferation and angiogenesis, and can de-differentiate to contribute to tumor growth. Our lab recently published data revealing that bone marrow stromal cell (BMSC) paracrine signaling induces apoptosis in co-cultured bone metastatic PCa cells. However, a subpopulation of the bone metastatic PCa cells can avoid cell death and undergo neuroendocrine differentiation (NED). One process that has been shown to mediate cancer cell survival and cell differentiation is autophagy, the homeostatic process of intracellular degradation and recycling. Thus, I propose that autophagy is a cytoprotective mechanism that PCa cells use to survive and undergo NED in the bone marrow stromal microenvironment. To address my hypothesis, I will (1) dissect autophagy regulation in PCa cells exposed to BMSC, (2) demonstrate that autophagy enhances PCa cell survival and promotes NED, and (3) show that autophagy attenuation increases PCa cell death. Autophagy induction and function will be analyzed using immuno-blot and -staining for autophagy markers, such as LC3, and using acidic vesicle dyes, such as monodansylcadaverin. PCa cells will be subjected to genetic and pharmacological autophagy modulation and assayed for cell viability and the NED phenotype. My investigation will identify pathways to attenuate autophagy and redirect bone metastatic PCa cells towards cell death.

"Hematopoietic Stem Cell and Cord Blood Transplantation    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Blood disorders including leukemia and lymphoma can be cured with unrelated donor (URD) hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) and cord blood transplantation (CBT). Post-transplant complications and mortality may be lowered through comprehensive HLA matching of the stem cell source. KIR-HLA interactions further define transplant outcome. The clinical practice of URD HCT and CBT today has several unmet needs. HLA identity of the URD does not guarantee that the patient will not develop life-threatening post-transplant complications, indicating the presence of undetected MHC region variation. For patients who lack matched URDs, the rules that govern permissible HLA mismatches are needed so as to broaden the availability of HCT to all patients in need. In CBT, the relevance of undetected disparity at HLA-A, B, C, DR, and DQ is unknown. Natural killer (NK)-mediated effects may further modulate transplant risks. Overall, clinical outcome is inferior for patients of non-Caucasian ethnicity. This project has two major goals. First, we will define the clinical importance of MHC residue variation after URD HCT and CBT by measuring the impact of HLA mismatching in non-Caucasian populations, identifying non-permissible HLA mismatches, and novel MHC resident genes. Second, we will define the clinical impact of KIR-HLA interactions, determine the molecular mechanisms underlying donor NK alloreactivity through a systematic evaluation of activating KIRs and haplotypes, and define mechanisms involved for the development of NK alloreactivity. These research questions will address the current roadblocks in URD HCT and CBT and provide novel laboratory-based information that can be translated to clinical practice for all patients of diverse racial background.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE (provided by applicant: Even though blood disorders such as leukemia and lymphoma can be cured through transplantation of stem cells from a healthy unrelated donor or cord blood stem cells, patients suffer from life-threatening complications. The risks of complications after transplantation are caused by variation in the genetic code between the patient and the stem cells. This project will find the genes that are causing the complications so that the information may be used to select unrelated donors and cord blood stem cells that lower risks. In this way, patients can be cured of their cancer and live longer healthier lives.

"Targeting pERK1/2 in Human Mammary Cancer Stem Cells    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Breast cancer is a complex disease associated with specific morphological and clinical features. Significant health disparity and high mortality rate is reported in African American (AA) patients, who suffer from unique and highly aggressive breast tumors. AA triple negative (TN) breast cancer patients suffer worse outcomes to chemotherapy compared with Caucasian women. Aggressive TN breast tumors contain poorly differentiated cells and express embryonic stem cell specific gene sets. These poorly differentiated mammary cancer stem cells (MCSCs) are the most tumorigenic cell types that drive initiation and progression of breast cancers. RAS/Raf/ERK1/2 signaling cascade has been found to promote every aspect of breast tumor progression including aggressive behavior like high angiogenesis and motility. We hypothesize that ""Mammary cancer stem cells drive aggressive TN breast tumors in AA women through sustained ERK1/2 signaling."" We will test this hypothesis with the following Specific Aims: 1) Establish whether mammary cancer stem cells from AA TN breast tumors form aggressive xenografts in nude mice. 2) Examine whether sustained ERK1/2 increases aggressive behavior of mammary cancer stem cells enriched mammospheres from AA TN breast tumors. 3) Examine whether inhibition of ERK1/2 signaling is effective in attenuating aggressive properties of mammary cancer stem cells from AA TN breast tumors. Fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) will be used to enrich MCSCs (Lin-/CD44+/CD24- /ALDH1+) from TN AA and Caucasian breast tumors, which will injected into the nude mice to form xenotransplants. These xenografts will be used to compare tumor volume, expression of angiogenesis stimulating factors (VEGF, CD31, MMP9), and motility of cells (Boyden Chamber Assay) between the two groups. MCSCs will also be enriched as mammospheres and pERK1/2-mediated effect on cell motility and expression of angiogenesis stimulating factors will be analyzed. ERK1/2 signaling will be attenuated in MCSCs by Nup153 shRNA and its effect on tumor promoting behavior will be analyzed both in vitro and in vivo. Increased understanding of the critical role of ERK1/2 signaling in MCSCs from AA patients and may provide novel targets for therapeutic drug design.        This project will test the effectiveness of phospho-ERK1/2 targeting in human mammary cancer stem cells isolated from African American and Caucasian patients. Mammary cancer stem cells will be isolated from the discarded fresh tissue samples from patient and their ability to form tumors in Nude mice will be tested before and after inhibition of ERK1/2 signaling. Our studies if validated by our preliminary data may provide unique approach to clinical practice by designing therapeutic drugs to specifically target pERK1/2 in mammary cancer stem cells, which are highly stable and provide key oncogenic trigger.

"HORMONAL INFLUENCES ON AIRWAY DISEASE    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   Airway diseases are the most common of the lung disorders, however, treatment for these illnesses remains inadequate. Epidemiologic data indicates that a gender disparity exists in patients with airway diseases including bronchiectasis, asthma, and chronic obstructive lung disease, with women demonstrating worse severity and outcomes along with an increased prevalence in some circumstances. Few studies have addressed the biologic basis of this disparity, but sex hormones are a potentially important variable. A full understanding of the hormonal influences on the airways may lead to novel therapies to help treat these debilitating illnesses. In airway disease, the mucociliary apparatus, made up of cilia, mucous, and airway epithelial cell surface liquid, plays a critical role in protecting the lung from pathogens and is a target for hormone regulation. Indeed, our preliminary data indicates that female sex hormones alter mucociliary function. Accordingly, the goal of this proposal is to determine the impact of sex hormones, specifically progesterone, on mucociliary clearance, as a basis of explanation for the gender disparity in airways diseases. The central hypothesis is that women have more severe airway diseases than men due to progesterone-mediated alterations in airway epithelial mucociliary function. The long term goals of these studies are to understand the mechanisms leading to gender differences in airway diseases, improve current treatment, and develop novel therapies.  To address these long term goals, we will apply a bench-to-bedside approach to this proposal by pursuing three specific aims at the in vitro, in vivo, and clinical levels. In Aim 1, we will characterize progesterone receptor expression, cell specificity, and receptor trafficking in primary human airway cells and in human lung tissues. In Aim 2, we will determine the impact of progesterone on mucociliary clearance by comparing cilia beat frequency of primary human airway epithelial cells in hormone stimulated conditions and by measuring airway clearance in hormone manipulated mice. We will also evaluate progesterone-dependent pathways that influence airway epithelial cell function to understand the mechanisms involved in sex hormone influences on mucociliary clearance. In Aim 3, using Cystic Fibrosis (CF) bronchiectasis as a model airway disease, we will utilize the national CF Foundation registry to retrospectively compare lung function and pulmonary exacerbations in men and women pre- and post-puberty and recruit CF bronchiectasis women locally to prospectively assess lung health during hormonal phases of the ovulatory cycle. Further understanding of these findings could lead to new therapeutic approaches involving inhaled hormone manipulation in bronchiectasis and other airway diseases. This work, in combination with a program of mentored research and a targeted educational program, will serve as the foundation for the PI's physician-scientist career.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Airway diseases are the most common of the lung diseases, and currently have limited therapies. Multiple epidemiologic studies indicate that women with airway diseases have increased severity and worse outcomes than men. The objective of this proposal is to identify the influences of sex hormones on mucociliary clearance and the pathways involved. These findings could lead to novel therapeutic approaches involving inhaled hormone manipulation in patients with bronchiectasis and other airway diseases such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

"Phosphosulindac, miRNAs and cancer racial disparity    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Epidemiological data has demonstrated that colon cancer is disproportional in incidence and mortality between Caucasians and African Americans (AA). Whereas socioeconomic and dietary differences contribute to this disparity other underlying factors must be involved. For instance, the response to chemopreventive agents is different between these two populations. Since chemopreventive agents exert their effect through a molecular target, this disparity would suggest differences at the genetic level. Therefore, the generation and evaluation of chemopreventive agents that address the issue of chemo-resistance is essential. A promising colon cancer chemopreventive agent, phospho-sulindac (P-S), inhibits colon cancer cell growth more potently than sulindac by inhibiting cell proliferation and enhancing cell killing. However, very little is known about the molecular targets in the cancer cell that are responsible for this effect. Our hypothesis, based on preliminary results, is that miRNA expression/regulation differs between AA and Caucasians and this difference may account, at least in part, a) for the differential response to chemoprevention and b) for the differential incidence of colorectal cancer. To test these hypotheses, we propose the following three specific aims: 1) To study the effect of P-S on p53, NF-kB, 2-catenin, and cell kinetics in human colon cancer cell lines originating from Caucasians and AA; 2) To assess the effect of P- S on the miRNA profile in a p53 null murine model of colon cancer; and, 3) Determine the miRNA profile in human colon cancer samples from AA and Caucasian patients. The results from these findings will lead to the understanding of a worldwide issue and provide details for the development of chemopreventive agents that will span diverse populations.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We will define the mechanisms by which P-S exert its inhibitory effect on the growth of colon cancer cells and address racial disparities as a result of genetic mutations. We will evaluate in cell culture, using cell lines derived from Caucasians and AA colon cancer tissues, changes (by microarray analysis) in the expression of transcription factors and miRNAs. In addition, we will test whether our in vitro findings are relevant to a preclinical model of colon cancer. This study will evaluate directly in a p53 null and C57BL/6 (parent background) mice model the effect of P-S on the expressions of transcription factors and miRNAs. Thereby, we will test the key mechanistic findings from the in vitro study. Lastly, we will compare and contrast prospective and retrospective colon cancer tissue of Caucasians and AA at the protein, RNA, and DNA levels. Being able to demonstrate that P-S induces a potentially important molecular change in the malignant colonocytes that may be relevant to its pharmacological actions in cancer would indicate an important breakthrough in the prevention of colon cancer. Also, being able to attribute a genetic causative effect to resistance to chemotherapeutic agents will address the issue of racial disparity.

"Regulation of osteoclast biology by anion exchanger SLC4A2 in mouse and human sys    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Bone is a dynamic tissue that remodels to grow, adapt to stress and maintain integrity. Two cell types control this process, the osteoblast (OB) and the osteoclast (OC), which synthesize and degrade bone, respectively. Pathologic inequality in bone remodeling favoring resorption over formation leads to diseases such as osteoporosis, rheumatoid arthritis and metastatic bone cancer. Currently, over 30 million Americans have low bone mass and nearly 1% of our population suffers from rheumatoid arthritis. The yearly health care cost burden of these diseases is immense. Currently approved therapeutics targeting OCs are inadequate, necessitating the discovery of new targets. To resorb bone, osteoclasts secrete hydrochloric acid. To prevent a reciprocal build up of cytoplasmic base, electroneutral exchange of bicarbonate for chloride occurs through an anion exchanger. The identity of this exchanger eluded identification until our recent report showing Solute carrier family 4, anion exchanger, member 2 (Slc4a2, Ae2) is absolutely required for osteoclast activity during development. In its absence, mice develop profound osteopetrosis. A recent publication has identified a nearly identical phenotype in cattle that lack SLC4A2. To date, only a handful of mutations have been identified that so dramatically curtail the ability of osteoclasts to resorb calcified tissue. Our preliminary data suggest that SCL4A2 plays an unexpected complex role in OC physiology. We have found that SLC4A2 deficiency not only prevents OCs from properly secreting acid and performing anion exchange, but also profoundly affects the organization of their cytoskeleton. Many important questions remain regarding the biology of SLC4A2 in the OC. We do not know whether SLC4A2 is important in bone remodeling beyond the developmental period or in the pathogenesis of inflammatory skeletal disease. The relative contribution of the cytoplasmic and transmembrane domains of SLC4A2 to the regulation of osteoclast biology is unknown. Moreover, whether human osteoclasts utilize SLC4A2 is undefined. Four specific aims are proposed to answer these questions: 1) Establish the OC-intrinsic role of SLC4A2 and resolve the contribution of osteopetrosis to the lethal phenotype of Slc4a2-/- mice; 2) Establish the requirement of SLC4A2 in a mouse model of inflammatory arthritis; 3) Perform a structure-function analysis of SLC4A2 in OCs and 4) Confirm a role for SLC4A2 in human OCs. I will take advantage of the unique environment in Boston to facilitate these studies. Collaborations have been established with local experts in anion exchange physiology, OC cell biology, mouse models of RA and RNA interference. By analyzing the function of a gene that so profoundly affects OC biology, this grant will advance basic understanding of skeletal remodeling, make important contributions to general cell biology and signal transduction and, most importantly, define a new target to suppress pathologic bone loss.        Dynamic remodeling of bone allows our skeleton to grow and adapt to stress, but makes it susceptible to diseases such as osteoporosis and rheumatoid arthritis. The only cell capable of destroying bone is the osteoclast, a multinucleated giant cell that secretes hydrochloric acid and proteolytic enzymes. This grant aims to better understand how osteoclasts work by probing the function of an ion exchanger (SLC4A2) that osteoclasts require to perform this remarkable, but often pathologic, feat.

"MYCN-induced calcium and magnesium signaling regulates Neuroblastoma progression DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Neuroblastoma (NB) is an extra-cranial pediatric cancer. Amplification of the proto-oncogene MYCN is associated with advanced stage, high risk NB and poor prognosis. Novel drugs and alternative treatments are being investigated for patients with advanced NB with MYCN amplification. However, finding an effective treatment strategy for advanced stage NB remains elusive. In order to address this limitation, the proposed project examines the effects of calcium and magnesium signaling on cell migration and invasion in NB cells with different MYCN status. The preliminary data indicate that MYCN initiates a change in calcium signaling, accompanied by a change in the transcriptional regulation of calcium channels, namely Orai1, Orai3 and TRPM7. In addition, MYCN induces calcium-dependent NB cell migration. These observations support the hypothesis that MYCN alters calcium and magnesium homeostasis during cell migration and invasion through a mechanism that involves calcium-mediated regulation of integrin signaling and focal adhesion turnover, and calcium- and magnesium-permeable ion channels. The research plan has the following specific aims: (1) Examine the effect of MYCN on [Ca2+] and [Mg2+] homeostasis in NB cells. NB cells with different MYCN status will be cultured in external media with different extracellular [Ca2+]/[Mg2+] ratios. The intracellular calcium and magnesium will be measured, and migration and invasion rates will be determined in these cells. (2) Elucidate the mechanism by which MYCN regulation of calcium and magnesium promotes NB migration and invasion. The effect of calcium and magnesium on the expression and phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase and integrin, focal adhesion turnover rate (assembly, disassembly and recycling of focal adhesion proteins), and actin cytoskeletal re-organization will be examined in NB cells that are actively migrating. (3) Identify the molecular components regulating NB migration and invasion. The calcium- permeable ORAI channels and the calcium- and magnesium-permeable TRPM7 channel protein will be modulated pharmacologically or using molecular methods (RNAi or transient over-expression), and the effect of these changes on cell migration and invasion, focal adhesion turnover (assembly, disassembly, and recycling of focal adhesion proteins), and intracellular [Ca2+] will be determined in NB cells. This study may identify new biomarkers for advanced stage NB, and reveal novel targets for the development of more effective chemotherapeutic drugs. In addition, this study may lead to a new model of the regulation of NB progression, which includes monitoring the status of the prognostic marker MYCN as well as the dietary intake, metabolism and cellular regulation of calcium and magnesium. This new model may apply to other cancers with MYC amplification (e.g. breast and prostate cancers, and lymphoma, etc). Neuroblastoma (NB) is a pediatric tumor. Calcium and magnesium ions regulate cell migration and invasion. I propose to elucidate the mechanisms by which calcium and magnesium regulate these processes in NB cells.

"Global transcriptome analysis of mucosal gonococcal infection DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Neisseria gonorrhoeae is the causative agent of the sexually transmitted disease (STD) gonorrhea, a high morbidity disease worldwide with an estimated 62 million cases annually (WHO). Although infection of the male urethra is usually symptomatic, nearly 80% of females infected with N. gonorrhoeae are asymptomatic. This is particularly dangerous as prolonged untreated gonococcal infections can lead to pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), a common cause of infertility and ectopic pregnancy. Through an existing Clinical Core in partnership with a NIAID funded U19 grant (AI084048), we have the unique opportunity to work with our collaborators at the National Center for STD Control (NCSTD) in Nanjing, China to address the disparity in symptomatic responses to N. gonorrhoeae infection. The NCSTD clinic currently obtains urethral specimens from males who report with gonococcal symptoms. These men are often co-infected with one or more STIs. The NCSTD also obtains matched cervico-vaginal lavage specimens from females who may be infected with gonococcal or gonococcal/chlamydial strains contracted from their matched male partners. We propose in this study to use RNA deep sequencing to define genital mucosal responses to gonorrhea, how they shift during gonococcal infection, and how differential male and female responses lead to different symptomatic outcomes in both. In new studies we have utilized RNA seq analysis to define the global transcriptome of N. gonorrhoeae during in vivo infection and during in vitro incubation with host cells. Our analysis revealed a unique signature of gonococcal stress response, metabolism, and respiratory genes expressed during in vivo infection. Based on these results we hypothesize N. gonorrhoeae expresses a unique set of genes during in vivo infection that is influenced by the specific host environment present during infection of the male and female genital tract. Furthermore, host gender-specific differences result in distinct gonococcal transcriptomes. We propose the following Aims to address this hypothesis: Aim 1. To compare the transcriptomic profile of N. gonorrhoeae during in vivo infection of the female genital tract to incubation with endocervical epithelial cells and growth i vitro in media. Aim 2. To compare the transcriptomic profile of N. gonorrhoeae during in vivo infection of the male genital tract to incubation with urethral epithelial cells and growth in vitr in media. Aim 3. To compare the transcriptomic profile of N. gonorrhoeae during in vivo infection of both male and female genital tract and incubation with male urethral epithelial cells and endocervical epithelial cells. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: A number of bacterial factors expressed during human infection likely contribute to development of gonococcal disease, to the persistent nature of the infection, and to the disparate symptomatic response. In this study we will examine N. gonorrhoeae gene expression during natural infection in men and women.

"Gender Disparity in Bladder Cancer and Chemopreventive Intervention     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Bladder cancer (BC) is the 4th most common cancer in men, but BC incidence is nearly 4 fold higher in men than in women across race; the underlying cause is not understood. Lack of such knowledge impedes progress in BC prevention. On the basis of our published and unpublished data, we hypothesize that hepatic UDP-glucuronosyltransferase 1A3 (UGT1A3) is a key determinant of the gender disparity in human BC development through converting androgen signal to increased urinary delivery of arylamine carcinogens to bladder tissue. Arylamines, 4-aminobiphenyl (ABP) in particular, are the main cause of human BC. We also hypothesize that sulforaphane (SF), a common dietary phytochemical, can block UGT1A3 from promoting arylamine-induced bladder carcinogenesis by boosting cytoprotective defense in the bladder. These hypotheses will be examined in four specific aims using complementary approaches of cultured cells and transgenic mouse models. Aim 1 is to test our hypothesis that liver UGT1A3 is a key molecule that determines the gender disparity in BC development. Wild-type mice and UGT1A3 transgenic mice (liver- specific and androgen-independent expression) will be compared for ABP-induced bladder carcinogenesis. Comparison will also be made between mice with and without castration. Another carcinogen 2- acetylaminofluorene (2-AAF) will be used to rule out ABP-specific effects. Aim 2 is to assess the impact of UGT1A3 polymorphism on its catalytic activity toward ABP and 2-AAF and on the susceptibility of bladder cells and liver cells to DNA damage induced by ABP and 2-AAF. Six single nucleotide polymorphisms occur in UGT1A3 gene. All the polymorphic variants together with the wild-type gene will be evaluated. Aim 3 is to test our hypothesis that SF can block UGT1A3 from promoting bladder carcinogenesis by stimulating cytoprotective defense against arylamine carcinogens (ABP and 2-AAF) in the bladder, without modulating UGT1A3 in the liver. Non-interference of liver UGT1A3 may be desirable, since this enzyme may be physiologically important, such as metabolizing estrone. SF is a promising cancer-preventive agent and is selectively delivered to bladder tissue through urinary excretion. Two animal models will be used to test the hypothesis, including the UGT1A3 mouse model described above and the Tg-UGT1 mouse model (mice carry both the coding and the regulatory sequences of the human UGT1A3 gene). Aim 4 is to confirm that UGT1A3 is transcriptionally stimulated by androgen in vivo and to elucidate the molecular mechanism by which androgen stimulates UGT1A3. This will be accomplished by using both cell models and the Tg-UGT1 mouse model. Impact: The proposed studies are expected to lead to the elucidation of the molecular basis of the gender disparity in BC and the development of new strategy for effective prevention of this disease.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: It has been known for several decades that the incidence of bladder cancer is nearly 4 fold higher in men than in women across race, but the reason has remained poorly understood. Lack of such knowledge impedes progress in bladder cancer prevention, and no chemopreventive agent is currently available for prevention of bladder cancer. This application will examine the hypothesis that UGT1A3 is a key determinant of gender disparity in human bladder cancer development and also examine the hypothesis that sulforaphane, a common dietary phytochemical, can block the bladder cancer-promoting activity of UGT1A3 and inhibit bladder cancer development, and the project is expected to significantly advance the knowledge about

"Measurement Error in Population Health Inequity Research using Novel Biomeasures-Supplement     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Progress in eliminating health disparities requires interdisciplinary efforts among social and biological scientists, and population-based data sets through which complex hypotheses linking environmental, psychosocial, behavioral and biological processes can be tested. The proposed project is an interdisciplinary collaborative effort integrating expertise in population health disparities, molecular biology, and the statisticl impact of measurement error on parameter estimates directly pertinent to population health research. We will address the question of whether DNA from blood or saliva banked with large population based data sets is valid for use in population health studies of telomere length (TL) - an intriguing new biomeasure of stress- mediated health, development, and aging -- and, if so, what sample sizes are needed.  Research on population differences in TL is largely based on highly select, racially homogeneous, clinical, or convenience samples. Socioeconomic measures are often absent or rudimentary. The state-of-the-art approach to measuring TL is via leukocyte-derived DNA extracted from fresh venous blood samples. Launching new population-based data collection activities that include blood draws, molecular measurements and the broad swath of social, environmental, behavioral, and health variables needed is costly and takes years before data can be analyzed. However, extant population-based data collections are increasingly isolating blood DNA for storage in specimen repositories after the cells have been transformed and immortalized using Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) or storing DNA in saliva. Neither approach is ideal for TL measurement. The critical unanswered question for population research is whether the error introduced in these TL measures is random or systematic with respect to original TL or to populations of interest.  We propose to estimate the validity of using EBV-immortalized blood cells or saliva cells to estimate population differences in TL. We will collect blood and saliva from 150 adult black, white, or Mexican-origin women in Detroit and Ann Arbor and measure each woman's TL multiple times using DNA directly isolated from fresh blood cells, DNA isolated from cells that we will EBV- immortalize, and DNA extracted from saliva. By stratifying the sample along key axes of comparison - race/ethnicity, socioeconomic status, stress- level, and neighborhood - and making within-woman comparisons on TL between immortalized and fresh blood samples, and between fresh blood samples and saliva, we will directly gauge the effect that immortalization or tissue type has on the validity and reliability o findings from TL studies that use stored specimens and on the future potential use of stored specimens for testing interdisciplinary hypotheses on population health disparities.

"MYCN-induced calcium and magnesium signaling regulates Neuroblastoma progression DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Neuroblastoma (NB) is an extra-cranial pediatric cancer. Amplification of the proto-oncogene MYCN is associated with advanced stage, high risk NB and poor prognosis. Novel drugs and alternative treatments are being investigated for patients with advanced NB with MYCN amplification. However, finding an effective treatment strategy for advanced stage NB remains elusive. In order to address this limitation, the proposed project examines the effects of calcium and magnesium signaling on cell migration and invasion in NB cells with different MYCN status. The preliminary data indicate that MYCN initiates a change in calcium signaling, accompanied by a change in the transcriptional regulation of calcium channels, namely Orai1, Orai3 and TRPM7. In addition, MYCN induces calcium-dependent NB cell migration. These observations support the hypothesis that MYCN alters calcium and magnesium homeostasis during cell migration and invasion through a mechanism that involves calcium-mediated regulation of integrin signaling and focal adhesion turnover, and calcium- and magnesium-permeable ion channels. The research plan has the following specific aims: (1) Examine the effect of MYCN on [Ca2+] and [Mg2+] homeostasis in NB cells. NB cells with different MYCN status will be cultured in external media with different extracellular [Ca2+]/[Mg2+] ratios. The intracellular calcium and magnesium will be measured, and migration and invasion rates will be determined in these cells. (2) Elucidate the mechanism by which MYCN regulation of calcium and magnesium promotes NB migration and invasion. The effect of calcium and magnesium on the expression and phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase and integrin, focal adhesion turnover rate (assembly, disassembly and recycling of focal adhesion proteins), and actin cytoskeletal re-organization will be examined in NB cells that are actively migrating. (3) Identify the molecular components regulating NB migration and invasion. The calcium- permeable ORAI channels and the calcium- and magnesium-permeable TRPM7 channel protein will be modulated pharmacologically or using molecular methods (RNAi or transient over-expression), and the effect of these changes on cell migration and invasion, focal adhesion turnover (assembly, disassembly, and recycling of focal adhesion proteins), and intracellular [Ca2+] will be determined in NB cells. This study may identify new biomarkers for advanced stage NB, and reveal novel targets for the development of more effective chemotherapeutic drugs. In addition, this study may lead to a new model of the regulation of NB progression, which includes monitoring the status of the prognostic marker MYCN as well as the dietary intake, metabolism and cellular regulation of calcium and magnesium. This new model may apply to other cancers with MYC amplification (e.g. breast and prostate cancers, and lymphoma, etc). Neuroblastoma (NB) is a pediatric tumor. Calcium and magnesium ions regulate cell migration and invasion. I propose to elucidate the mechanisms by which calcium and magnesium regulate these processes in NB cells. This study will improve our current knowledge of NB progression, and reveal more innovative treatment strategies for NB.",MYCN-induced calcium and magnesium signaling regulates Neuroblastoma progression,8727482,K01CA154758,"['Actins ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' Factor IV ', ' Coagulation Factor IV ', ' Ca++ element ', ' Blood Coagulation Factor IV ', ' Calcium ', ' Voltage-Dependent Calcium Channels ', ' VDCC ', ' Calcium Ion Channels ', ' Calcium Channel Blocker Receptors ', ' Calcium Channel Antagonist Receptor ', ' Calcium Channel ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Motility ', ' Cellular Motility ', ' Cellular Migration ', ' Cell Movement ', ' Cell Migration ', ' Cell Locomotion ', ' cell motility ', ' Cells ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Downregulation ', ' Down-Regulation (Physiology) ', ' Down-Regulation ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' natural gene amplification ', ' Gene Amplification ', ' Goals ', ' Physiological Homeostasis ', ' Autoregulation ', ' Homeostasis ', ' Integrins Extracellular Matrix ', ' Integrins ', ' Membrane Channels ', ' Ionic Channels ', ' Ion Channel ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Literature ', ' Reticulolymphosarcoma ', ' Malignant Lymphoma ', "" Lymphoma (Hodgkin's and Non-Hodgkin's) "", ' Germinoblastoma ', ' Germinoblastic Sarcoma ', ' Lymphoma ', ' Mg element ', ' Magnesium ', ' Metabolic Processes ', ' Intermediary Metabolism ', ' Metabolism ', ' Methods ', ' Method LOINC Axis 6 ', ' Methodology ', ' Neuroblastoma (Schwannian Stroma-Poor) ', ' Neuroblastoma ', ' Patients ', ' Peer Review ', ' Protein Phosphorylation ', ' Phosphorylation ', ' Prognosis ', ' outcome forecast ', ' gene product ', ' Proteins ', ' protooncogene ', ' c-ONC ', ' Cellular Oncogene ', ' Proto-Oncogenes ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Publications ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Support ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Survival Rate ', ' Time ', ' pp125(FAK) ', ' p125FAK ', ' p125(FAK) ', ' focal adhesion-associated protein tyrosine kinase pp125FAK ', ' focal adhesion protein tyrosine kinase ', ' focal adhesion kinase ', ' endogenous substrate pp120 ', ' PTK2 Protein Tyrosine Kinase 2 ', ' Focal Adhesion Kinase 1 ', ' Measures ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' Mediating ', ' Treatment Failure ', ' neoplastic progression ', ' neoplasm progression ', ' cancer progression ', ' tumor progression ', ' improved ', ' Cranial ', ' Cephalic ', ' Malignant ', ' Malignant -

"Social regulation of pro-inflammatory monocytes DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposed research seeks to determine how adverse social environments influence the risk of inflammation-related disease by up-regulating the expression of pro-inflammatory genes. These studies test the hypothesis that adverse social environments stimulate the hematopoietic production of immature pro-inflammatory monocytes (CD16- in humans, Ly-6c-high in mice) via threat-induced activation of beta-adrenergic receptors in bone marrow myelopoietic cells. Specific aims will: (Aim 1) Define the neural and endocrine pathways by which chronic threat up-regulates pro-inflammatory monocytes; (Aim 2) Define the specific beta-adrenergic receptors and target cell types mediating threat-induced expansion of pro- inflammatory monocytes; and (Aim 3) Define the myelopoietic molecules mediating beta-adrenergic expansion of pro-inflammatory monocytes (including GM-CSF, TGF-beta, and the CXCL12/CXCR4 chemokine signaling axis). When complete, these studies will provide an integrated mechanistic model of the neural / hematopoietic pathway by which chronic adversity can up-regulate inflammatory gene expression in circulating immune cells. The overarching goal of these studies is to develop a comprehensive theory that explains how common social risk factors can influence multiple inflammation-related diseases. In addition to clarifying the basic physiologic mechanisms involved in ""defensive programming"" of the immune system transcriptome, these studies will identify specific CNS mechanisms (e.g., Crf gene activation in central nucleus of the amygdala), pharmacologic intervention strategies (e.g., beta-2 and beta-3 adrenergic antagonists, and antagonists of GM-CSF, TGF-beta, and/or CXCR4), and mechanistic biomarkers (e.g., myelopoietic molecules and circulating monocyte phenotypes) that can be applied in future studies to clarify how stress-induced up- regulation of pro-inflammatory monocytes impacts specific inflammation-related diseases such as atherosclerosis, Type II diabetes, Alzheimer's disease, and cancer. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This research seeks to improve public health by clarifying the biological pathways through which adverse social environments such as social isolation or poverty influence the risk of inflammation-related diseases such as heart disease, Alzheimer's disease, and cancer. This research will establish new risk factors, neural mechanisms, pharmacologic intervention strategies, and cellular and molecular biomarkers of individual health status to help protect human health in the context of adverse social environments and thus reduce socially-related health disparities.",Social regulation of pro-inflammatory monocytes,8629640,R01AG043404,"['Adrenergics ', ' Adrenergic Drugs ', ' Adrenergic Agents ', ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Alzheimers Dementia ', "" Alzheimer's "", ' Alzheimer syndrome ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' amygdaloid nuclear complex ', ' Amygdaloid Nucleus ', ' Amygdaloid Body ', ' Amygdala ', ' Amygdaloid structure ', ' epidemiologic investigation ', ' Epidemiology Research ', ' Epidemiological Studies ', ' Epidemiologic Research ', ' Epidemiologic Studies ', ' Antiinflammatory Agents ', ' Antiinflammatories ', ' Anti-Inflammatories ', ' Anti-Inflammatory Agents ', ' atherosclerotic vascular disease ', ' atheromatosis ', ' Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease ', ' Atheroscleroses ', ' Atherosclerosis ', ' Bereavement ', ' vascular ', ' Blood Vessels ', ' Bone Marrow Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Bone Marrow ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Nucleus ', ' Cell Nucleus ', ' Cells ', ' type II DM ', ' type 2 DM ', ' maturity onset diabetes ', ' ketosis resistant diabetes ', ' adult onset diabetes ', ' Type II diabetes ', ' Type II Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Type 2 diabetes ', ' Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus ', ' T2DM ', ' T2D ', ' T2 DM ', ' Stable Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Slow-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Noninsulin Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Non-Insulin Dependent Diabetes ', ' NIDDM ', ' Maturity-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' MODY ', ' Ketosis-Resistant Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Adult-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Diagnosis ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Gene Activation ', ' Gene Expression ', ' genetic therapy ', ' gene-based therapy ', ' Genetic Intervention ', ' Gene-Tx ', ' Gene Transfer Procedure ', ' Gene Transfer Clinical ', ' Gene Therapy Molecular Biology ', ' DNA Therapy ', ' gene therapy ', ' Genes ', ' Therapeutic Glucocorticoid ', ' Glucocorticoids ', ' Goals ', ' Granulocytic cell ', ' Granular Leukocytes ', ' Blood granulocytic cell ', ' granulocyte ', ' Proteins Growth Factors ', ' Growth Substances ', ' Growth Agents ', ' GFAC ', ' Growth Factor ', ' Health ', ' Level of Health ', ' Health Status ', ' heart disorder ', ' Cardiac Disorders ', ' Cardiac Diseases ', ' Heart Diseases ', ' Hematopoietic Progenitor Cells ', ' Blood Precursor Cell ', ' Hematopoietic stem cells ', ' hereditary disorder ', ' genetic disorder ', ' Molecular Disease ', ' Genetic Diseases ', ' Genetic Condition ', ' Hereditary Disease ', ' Modern Man ', ' Man (Taxonomy) ', ' Human ', ' hypothalamic ', ' Hypothalamus ', ' Hypothalamic structure ', ' allergic/immunologic organ system ', ' allergic/immunologic body system ', ' Immune system ', ' Inflammation ', ' Literature ', ' macrophage ', ' Genetic Models ', ' Marrow monocyte ', ' Blood monocyte ', ' monocyte ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity -

"Mechanisms of Immune Evasion and Recognition in Human Syphilis     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Syphilis, a multi-stage sexually transmitted disease caused by the spirochete Treponema pallidum (Tp), continues to be a major worldwide public health problem. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that approximately 10.6 million new syphilis cases occur yearly throughout the globe. The clinical manifestations of syphilis reflect the propensity of Tp to disseminate systemically and induce a chronic inflammation which occurs in stages, being secondary syphilis (SS) the focus of this proposal. Despite the robust nature of the adaptive and humoral immune responses during SS, including the emergence of high titers of opsonic antibodies, it takes weeks to months for host defenses to gain control of the invading pathogen. How the bacterium is able to evade human host defenses, while at the same time evoking vigorous cellular and humoral immune responses, is the principal scientific objective of the current proposal. A careful analysis of Tp¿s unique ultrastructural characteristics, which contains very few outer membrane proteins (OMPs), provides potential explanations for the paradoxical nature of SS. Inefficient antibody binding to the sparse spirochetal OMP antigenic targets is thought to allow a large proportion of spirochetes to shun antibody binding and opsonophagocytosis; a mechanism which we have shown is an essential requirement for Tp driven innate immune cell activation. The new finding that circulating natural killer (NK) cells reveal immunophenotypic alterations (emergence of a CD56negativeCD16high NK-cell subset), which exhibits both poor cytolytic activity and impaired cytokine production suggests that additional immunologic factors play a role in the duality of the immune response to Tp. We now propose a new syphilis immune-pathogenesis model, where antibodies to Tp¿s rare OMPs are only capable of binding a sub-population of spirochetes, thus allowing immune escape of organisms and at the same time recognition and bacterial clearance of different tissues. Over time, the host's expanding repertoire of antibodies against these rare OMPs broadens and intensifies, leading to more efficient opsonophagocytosis, bacterial clearance and lesion resolution. To accomplish our goals and examine mechanistic aspects of the proposed model, we have formulated the following Specific Aims. In Aim 1: we will further characterize spirochete burdens, spirochete diversity and the antibody responses in the blood of secondary syphilis patients; and in aim 2: we will study the role of the dermal macrophage as a driver of both inflammation and spirochetal clearance in secondary syphilis patient's dermal lesions. And in aim 3, w will further characterize NK cells in blood of SS patients. In concert wit the Fogarty International Center's mission to reduce health disparities amongst nations, the planned activities will also: (1) support collaborative syphilis immunobiology research between the LMIC PI and the US collaborators (2) strengthen CIDEIM¿s research capabilities and technical base; (3) continue providing needed epidemiological data about venereal syphilis for that region of Colombia.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Syphilis, caused by the spirochetal bacterium, Treponema pallidum, remains rampant throughout the world with more than 10.6 million cases occurring every year. This proposed research will allow us to advance our understanding of spirochetal immune recognition and immune evasion by its obligate human host and equally importantly, will address a major public health problem in Colombia, continue to provide local health authorities much needed epidemiological data about venereal syphilis in Cali and will allow the investigative team to carry on with education and training of local health professionals about the complexities of syphilis diagnosis and management.            ",Mechanisms of Immune Evasion and Recognition in Human Syphilis,8627221,R03TW009172,"['Antibodies ', ' immunoglobulin biosynthesis ', ' antibody biosynthesis ', ' Antibody Response ', ' Antibody Production ', ' Antibody Formation ', ' Bacteria ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Blood ', ' Chancre ', ' Syphilitic chancre ', ' Colombia ', ' Veiled Cells ', ' Dendritic Cells ', ' Under-Developed Nations ', ' Under-Developed Countries ', ' Third-World Nations ', ' Third-World Countries ', ' Less-Developed Nations ', ' Less-Developed Countries ', ' Developing Nations ', ' Developing Nation ', ' Developing Country ', ' Developing Countries ', ' Diagnosis ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' Exhibits ', ' Freeze Fracturings ', ' Freeze Fracturing ', ' Glycolipids ', ' Goals ', ' Gram-Negative Bacteria ', ' Health ', ' Modern Man ', ' Man (Taxonomy) ', ' Human ', ' immunological substance ', ' immunologic substance ', ' Immunological Factors ', ' Immunologic Factors ', ' Infection ', ' Inflammation ', ' Transmembrane Protein ', ' Intrinsic Membrane Protein ', ' Integral Membrane Protein ', ' NK Cells ', ' K lymphocyte ', ' Cytotoxic cell ', ' Natural Killer Cells ', ' Lipids ', ' Lipopolysaccharides ', ' macrophage ', ' Surface Proteins ', ' Membrane-Associated Proteins ', ' Membrane Proteins ', ' Microscopy ', ' Mission ', ' living system ', ' Organism ', ' Patients ', ' Play ', ' Production ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' immune receptor ', ' Immunological Receptors ', ' Immunologic Receptors ', ' Research ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Venereal Infections ', ' Venereal Disorders ', ' Venereal Diseases ', ' Sexually Transmitted Infection ', ' Sexually Transmitted Disorder ', ' Sexually Transmitted Diseases ', ' Diagnostic Findings ', ' Signs and Symptoms ', ' Spirochetes ', ' Spirochaetales ', ' Order Spirochaetales ', ' great pox ', ' Syphilis ', ' Latent Syphilis ', ' thymus derived lymphocyte ', ' Thymus-Dependent Lymphocytes ', ' T-Cells ', ' T-Lymphocyte ', ' Time ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Tissues ', ' T.pallidum ', ' T. pallidum ', ' Treponema pallidum ', ' United States ', ' Western Europe ', ' Wit ', ' World Health Organization ', ' cytokine ', ' Mediating ', ' base ', ' Organ ', ' Surface ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Lesion ', ' Dermal ', ' Individual ', ' Research Activity ', ' uptake ', ' immunoresponse ', ' host response ', ' Immune response ', ' Staging ', ' Nature ', ' Immune ', ' Organ System ', ' body system ', ' Host Defense ', ' periplasmic ', ' Periplasmic Space ', ' periplasm ', ' Training and Education ', ' membrane structure ', ' Membrane ', ' international center ', ' authority ', ' TLR protein ', ' Toll-like receptors ', ' Pathogenesis ', ' Appearance ', ' Modeling ', ' Skin ', ' Immune Cell Activation ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' Binding ', ' Binding (Molecular Function) ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' polypeptide ', ' cell mediated immune response ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Immunophysiology ', ' Immunobiology ', ' Resolution ', ' Antibody Repertoire ', ' Invaded ', ' Immunochemical Immunologic ', ' Immunologics ', ' Characteristics ', ' Healthcare professional ', ' Health Care Professional ', ' Health Professional ', ' pathogen ', ' Population ', ' NH2-terminal ', ' N-terminal ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' translational approach ', ' public health relevance ', ' ']",FIC,CENTRO INTERNACIONAL  (CIDEIM),R03,2014,47087,0.06704394188098561
"Hemoglobin Modifiers for Sickle Cell Disease Therapy     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our goal is to design and establish novel therapeutic agents for sickle cell disease (SCD), namely drugs that inhibit the initial sickle hemoglobin (HbS) polymerization and the subsequent pathophysiology. When deoxygenated, HbS polymerizes into long, rigid, and insoluble fibers causing red blood cells (RBCs) to sickle, a process worsened by the unusual low affinity of HbS for oxygen, resulting in premature release of oxygen. Based on several evidence--our preliminary data, studies by others, and the results of a recently completed phase I/II clinical testing of our lead compound, 5-HMF (an allosteric effector of Hb, AEH)-we hypothesize that AEHs, not only prevent HbS polymerization, but also mitigates several secondary sickling related pathological events that include inflammation, oxidative stress/damage, RBC hemolysis, and pain. We also have preliminary evidence that our next generation AEHs (INN- and TD-series) exhibit enhanced potency and improved in-vitro duration of action. These AEHs act via a novel mechanism of action, i.e., destabilize HbS polymer contacts, in addition to increasing Hb affinity for oxygen; providing positive synergistic effects. We propose to test our hypothesis by further investigating candidate drugs from the INN- and TD-series, as well as derivatives of 5-HMF and INN-312 for their pharmacologic properties, focusing on the secondary SCD pathways, as well as the underlying HbS polymerization problem using our model systems. The specific aims are: 1. Design and synthesis of novel allosteric effectors of hemoglobin (AEHs). We will modify our parent compounds and synthesize derivatives with enhanced efficacy and prolonged half-lives. We will also synthesize prod rugs to protect the active aldehyde functional moiety from aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH)- mediated metabolism as necessary. 2. Investigate in-vitro functional, ant sickling, and cytotoxicity activities of novel AEHs. We will investigate the AEHs for their in-vitro ant sickling/functional activities (RBC sickling tests, P50 analyses, HbS solubility, and Hb adduct formation), and carefully monitor for adverse effects. 3. Determine in-vivo/in-vitro PK/PD properties, binding and metabolism and evaluate preclinical efficacy of AEHs in SCD Berkeley mice. We will show that serum albumin binding and/or metabolism by ALDH in RBC or hepatic cytosol are not likely to adversely affect in-vivo pharmacologic activity. We will demonstrate using a Berkeley mouse model of SCD transgenic mice that AEHs show potent pharmacologic effects, increase short- and long-term survival rates of mice. We will also study their potential beneficial effects, e.g. amelioration of hemolysis, inflammation, endothelial damage, and overall reversal of the SCD pathophysiology observed in this model. 4. Determine the atomic interactions between AEHs and Hb. X-ray crystallography will be used to validate our hypothesis that AEH potency is directly dependent upon their abilities to bind Hb with their pyridyl substituents toward the surface of the Hb molecule.

Most common therapeutic intervention includes blood transfusions and hydroxyurea therapies, however, these therapies are associated with some undesirable side effects and not all patients benefit from the treatment.

"Targeted Combination Therapy for Lung Cancer     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Lung cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer deaths in the US with 5 year survival rate of ~15% due to the lack of specificity, poor efficacy, and side effects associated with current therapies. The lung cancer incidences are highest in African Americans, American Indians/Alaska Natives, and Pacific Islanders. The non- small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is most prevalent (~80% occurrence) among lung cancer patient. NSCLC has wide molecular heterogeneity, which mandates simultaneous targeting of multiple pathways. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) gene over-expression (in ~90% of NSCLC's) is associated with growth, survival, and angiogenesis. The use of VEGF antibodies to block VEGF has been limited due to their non- specificity, poor efficacy and adverse effects. In this line, silencing VEGF using VEGF-siRNA (siRNA-V) will be an effective option, however, the clinical utility of siRNA has been hampered due to non-specific effect, poor cell permeation and rapid in vivo elimination. The use of nanocarriers for siRNA-V delivery will help to overcome these issues. Furthermore, PI3K/mTOR was found to be predominantly activated in NSCLC, additionally, mTOR inhibition results in compensatory activation of Akt (a promoter of cell survival and proliferation). Hence, simultaneous targeting of mTOR and Akt along with VEGF silencing will pave the way for more effective NSCLC therapy. PF-04691502 (PF0) is a potent PI3K/mTOR/AKT inhibitor. Targeting mTOR/AKT pathway using PF0 along with VEGF silencing will complement the clinical potential of these bioactives against NSCLC. LHRH receptors are over-expressed on NSCLC cells with restricted expression on normal tissues. For the first time, we are herewith proposing the development of biodegradable, LHRH receptor-targeted PEGylated hybrid nanocarrier (HNC) for the simultaneous targeted delivery of siRNA-V and PF0 (HNC-VP-L) to NSCLC. We hypothesize that the development of stable, LHRH receptor-guided PEGylated albumin-chitosan based hybrid nanocarriers will deliver the synergistically-acting siRNA-V and PF0 in a targeted fashion to NSCLC tumors and will result in a significant improvement of anticancer activity, at lower doses, while overcoming adverse effects. We plan to test our hypothesis by following specific aims: Aim 1: To evaluate the combination effect of siRNA-V and PF0; development and evaluation of HNC-VP-L; Aim 2: To evaluate the in vivo efficacy of HNC-VP-L in nude mice; and Aim 3: To elucidate mechanism, evaluate metastasis and toxicological parameters. We plan to utilize LHRH receptor positive and LHRH receptor negative tumor cell based in vitro as well as in vivo models (xenograft and orthotropic) to investigate the targeting potential of developed nan carriers. Our approach aims at developing a more effective treatment modality for the treatment of NSCLC to reduce the burden of lung cancer disparity. The long term goal is to advance this novel delivery concept to the clinic level. We will be able to establish the first nan carrier based extramural cancer program in the state of Hawaii and train the unrepresented students through this project.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Lung cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer deaths and has poor survival rates compared to other types of cancers. The lung cancer incidence is highest in African Americans, underserved Whites, American Indians/Alaska Natives, and Pacific Islanders thereby the disparities in treatment outcomes exists. The non- small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is prevalent (~80% occurrence) among lung cancer patient. The site specific delivery of therapeutic agents to tumors is still a major challenge in cancer research. NSCLC has wide molecular heterogeneity and therefore, warrants targeting of multiple pathways for improving the outcome among lung cancer patients. The tumor specific delivery of therapeutic agents targeting multiple pathways involved in NSCLC progression represents a potential approach to treat the NSCLC owing to its advantages over existing treatment modalities. In this regard, some attempts have been made to deliver chemotherapeutic agents using Nan carriers, however, our proposed combination therapy of PF-04691502 (PF0), an ATP- competitive PI3K/mTOR/AKT dual inhibitor and siRNA-V using targeted hybrid nan carriers of natural biopolymers (albumin and chitosan) for the treatment of NSCLC is novel and has not been studies so far. Stable, biodegradable, and tumor-specific LHRH receptor-guided hybrid nan carriers loaded with synergistically acting PF0 and siRNA-V will selectively deliver PF0 and siRNA-V to NSCLC and exert significant antitumor activity while sparing normal tissues. This is the first time targeted hybrid Nan carriers are being explored for the simultaneous co-delivery of PF0 and siRNA-V for the treatment of NSCLC. This project combines a highly innovative and collaborative approach with advanced nanotechnologies and in vivo cancer cell biology including LHRH receptor positive and LHRH receptor negative tumor cell based models to evaluate developed targeted delivery system. Our proposed studies are aimed at developing a more effective and reliable treatment modality that can be safely used for the treatment of NSCLC and also help to reduce the burden of lung cancer disparity. We will be able to establish the first Nan carrier based cancer program in the state of Hawaii, obtain extramural NIH/DOD funding, and train the unrepresented students through this project. The results will also provide the proof-of-concept for similar targeted Nan carrier therapies against other forms of cancer.            ",Targeted Combination Therapy for Lung

"Targeting pERK1/2 in Human Mammary Cancer Stem Cells    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Breast cancer is a complex disease associated with specific morphological and clinical features. Significant health disparity and high mortality rate is reported in African American (AA) patients, who suffer from unique and highly aggressive breast tumors. AA triple negative (TN) breast cancer patients suffer worse outcomes to chemotherapy compared with Caucasian women. Aggressive TN breast tumors contain poorly differentiated cells and express embryonic stem cell specific gene sets. These poorly differentiated mammary cancer stem cells (MCSCs) are the most tumorigenic cell types that drive initiation and progression of breast cancers. RAS/Raf/ERK1/2 signaling cascade has been found to promote every aspect of breast tumor progression including aggressive behavior like high angiogenesis and motility. We hypothesize that ""Mammary cancer stem cells drive aggressive TN breast tumors in AA women through sustained ERK1/2 signaling."" We will test this hypothesis with the following Specific Aims: 1) Establish whether mammary cancer stem cells from AA TN breast tumors form aggressive xenografts in nude mice. 2) Examine whether sustained ERK1/2 increases aggressive behavior of mammary cancer stem cells enriched mammospheres from AA TN breast tumors. 3) Examine whether inhibition of ERK1/2 signaling is effective in attenuating aggressive properties of mammary cancer stem cells from AA TN breast tumors. Fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) will be used to enrich MCSCs (Lin-/CD44+/CD24- /ALDH1+) from TN AA and Caucasian breast tumors, which will injected into the nude mice to form xenotransplants. These xenografts will be used to compare tumor volume, expression of angiogenesis stimulating factors (VEGF, CD31, MMP9), and motility of cells (Boyden Chamber Assay) between the two groups. MCSCs will also be enriched as mammospheres and pERK1/2-mediated effect on cell motility and expression of angiogenesis stimulating factors will be analyzed. ERK1/2 signaling will be attenuated in MCSCs by Nup153 shRNA and its effect on tumor promoting behavior will be analyzed both in vitro and in vivo. Increased understanding of the critical role of ERK1/2 signaling in MCSCs from AA patients and may provide novel targets for therapeutic drug design.        This project will test the effectiveness of phospho-ERK1/2 targeting in human mammary cancer stem cells isolated from African American and Caucasian patients. Mammary cancer stem cells will be isolated from the discarded fresh tissue samples from patient and their ability to form tumors in Nude mice will be tested before and after inhibition of ERK1/2 signaling. Our studies if validated by our preliminary data may provide unique approach to clinical practice by designing therapeutic drugs to specifically target pERK1/2 in mammary cancer stem cells, which are highly stable and provide key oncogenic trigger.

"Uterine Leiomyoma Development in Mouse Models     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Uterine fibroids (leiomyomata uteri) are the most common tumors in the female reproductive tract. Some estimates indicate that more than 50% of American women have uterine fibroids. Additionally, there is a significant disparity in the incidence of fibroids since African-American women are 2-3 times more likely to develop fibroids. These tumors can be very painful and are a leading cause of infertility in women. Also, because these tumors can become very large, and although the uterus is indispensable for mammalian reproduction, they remain the main reason for hysterectomies in the US. Despite the healthcare burden caused by uterine fibroids, their etiology and pathophysiology are unknown. We have developed mutant mice in which nuclear ¿-catenin signaling has been specifically induced in reproductive tract tissues. Normally, mice do not develop fibroids; however, these mutant mice develop smooth muscle tumors in their uteri with 100% penetrance by 8 weeks of age. These tumors exhibit characteristics of human fibroids by histological and immunohistochemical criteria. ¿-Catenin, a well-known downstream effector of Wnt signaling, induces organ and tissue malformations and tumor development following dysregulation of its activity. The mice also express higher levels of mTor, as observed in the Tsc2-mutant Eker rat fibroid model and in approximately 50% of human fibroids, suggesting that mTor activation may be a common pathway in leiomyoma development. We will investigate this mouse model further, placing particular emphasis on the regulation of mTor gene expression and activity for comparison with other mutant mouse models lacking myometrial Lkb1, the gene mutated in patients with Peutz-Jeghers Syndrome, and Tsc1, both of which also induce mTor activity and induce uterine fibroids as shown in our preliminary results. We propose to investigate the intracellular mechanisms and pathways affected by dysregulated Wnt/¿-catenin in our unique mouse model that induce mTor activity for comparison with Lkb1- and Tsc2-deleted uteri. To better understand the etiology and pathogenesis of fibroids, we will study the molecular mechanisms controlling fibrosis in the mutant myometrial cells such as cell polarity, extracellular matrix deposition, and myometrial differentiation. We will determine which characteristics of the mouse models most closely resemble human leiomyomas and are best suited for preclinical studies. Lastly, we will determine whether disrupted Wnt/¿-catenin signaling contributes to human leiomyoma development. The results from the studies in this proposal will provide new insights into the etiology and progression of these tumors, as well as provide the rationale for investigating therapies targeting the mechanisms involved in leiomyoma development and progression.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Uterine fibroids affect approximately 50% of American women during their reproductive years and are a significant source of pelvic pain, abnormal uterine bleeding, and infertility. Despite the major health care burden posed by uterine fibroids, very little is known about their cause or the best treatment strategies. As a result, if the symptoms are severe enough, patients can be managed by surgical intervention. The overall aims of the proposed studies are to understand the underlying causes of uterine fibroid development and growth and to develop new therapeutic options that could offer a safer alternative for treating this disease.

"HORMONAL INFLUENCES ON AIRWAY DISEASE    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   Airway diseases are the most common of the lung disorders, however, treatment for these illnesses remains inadequate. Epidemiologic data indicates that a gender disparity exists in patients with airway diseases including bronchiectasis, asthma, and chronic obstructive lung disease, with women demonstrating worse severity and outcomes along with an increased prevalence in some circumstances. Few studies have addressed the biologic basis of this disparity, but sex hormones are a potentially important variable. A full understanding of the hormonal influences on the airways may lead to novel therapies to help treat these debilitating illnesses. In airway disease, the mucociliary apparatus, made up of cilia, mucous, and airway epithelial cell surface liquid, plays a critical role in protecting the lung from pathogens and is a target for hormone regulation. Indeed, our preliminary data indicates that female sex hormones alter mucociliary function. Accordingly, the goal of this proposal is to determine the impact of sex hormones, specifically progesterone, on mucociliary clearance, as a basis of explanation for the gender disparity in airways diseases. The central hypothesis is that women have more severe airway diseases than men due to progesterone-mediated alterations in airway epithelial mucociliary function. The long term goals of these studies are to understand the mechanisms leading to gender differences in airway diseases, improve current treatment, and develop novel therapies.  To address these long term goals, we will apply a bench-to-bedside approach to this proposal by pursuing three specific aims at the in vitro, in vivo, and clinical levels. In Aim 1, we will characterize progesterone receptor expression, cell specificity, and receptor trafficking in primary human airway cells and in human lung tissues. In Aim 2, we will determine the impact of progesterone on mucociliary clearance by comparing cilia beat frequency of primary human airway epithelial cells in hormone stimulated conditions and by measuring airway clearance in hormone manipulated mice. We will also evaluate progesterone-dependent pathways that influence airway epithelial cell function to understand the mechanisms involved in sex hormone influences on mucociliary clearance. In Aim 3, using Cystic Fibrosis (CF) bronchiectasis as a model airway disease, we will utilize the national CF Foundation registry to retrospectively compare lung function and pulmonary exacerbations in men and women pre- and post-puberty and recruit CF bronchiectasis women locally to prospectively assess lung health during hormonal phases of the ovulatory cycle. Further understanding of these findings could lead to new therapeutic approaches involving inhaled hormone manipulation in bronchiectasis and other airway diseases. This work, in combination with a program of mentored research and a targeted educational program, will serve as the foundation for the PI's physician-scientist career.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Airway diseases are the most common of the lung diseases, and currently have limited therapies. Multiple epidemiologic studies indicate that women with airway diseases have increased severity and worse outcomes than men. The objective of this proposal is to identify the influences of sex hormones on mucociliary clearance and the pathways involved. These findings could lead to novel therapeutic approaches involving inhaled hormone manipulation in patients with bronchiectasis and other airway diseases such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

"Measurement Error in Population Health Inequity Research using Novel Biomeasures     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Progress in eliminating health disparities requires interdisciplinary efforts among social and biological scientists, and population-based data sets through which complex hypotheses linking environmental, psychosocial, behavioral and biological processes can be tested. The proposed project is an interdisciplinary collaborative effort integrating expertise in population health disparities, molecular biology, and the statisticl impact of measurement error on parameter estimates directly pertinent to population health research. We will address the question of whether DNA from blood or saliva banked with large population based data sets is valid for use in population health studies of telomere length (TL) - an intriguing new biomeasure of stress- mediated health, development, and aging -- and, if so, what sample sizes are needed.  Research on population differences in TL is largely based on highly select, racially homogeneous, clinical, or convenience samples. Socioeconomic measures are often absent or rudimentary. The state-of-the-art approach to measuring TL is via leukocyte-derived DNA extracted from fresh venous blood samples. Launching new population-based data collection activities that include blood draws, molecular measurements and the broad swath of social, environmental, behavioral, and health variables needed is costly and takes years before data can be analyzed. However, extant population-based data collections are increasingly isolating blood DNA for storage in specimen repositories after the cells have been transformed and immortalized using Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) or storing DNA in saliva. Neither approach is ideal for TL measurement. The critical unanswered question for population research is whether the error introduced in these TL measures is random or systematic with respect to original TL or to populations of interest.  We propose to estimate the validity of using EBV-immortalized blood cells or saliva cells to estimate population differences in TL. We will collect blood and saliva from 150 adult black, white, or Mexican-origin women in Detroit and Ann Arbor and measure each woman's TL multiple times using DNA directly isolated from fresh blood cells, DNA isolated from cells that we will EBV- immortalize, and DNA extracted from saliva. By stratifying the sample along key axes of comparison - race/ethnicity, socioeconomic status, stress- level, and neighborhood - and making within-woman comparisons on TL between immortalized and fresh blood samples, and between fresh blood samples and saliva, we will directly gauge the effect that immortalization or tissue type has on the validity and reliability o findings from TL studies that use stored specimens and on the future potential use of stored specimens for testing interdisciplinary hypotheses on population health disparities. Findings can be applied toward increasing the pace of health disparities research, whatever the conclusion on the validity of using immortalized blood or saliva cells to measure TL.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Eliminating social disparities in health is a high-priority national public health objective. Learning how different social or physical environments and life experiences influence biological processes to impact health is fundamental. By studying whether banked biomeasures are valid for use in population-studies we hope to improve and accelerate research on health disparities.            ",Measurement Error in Population Health Inequity Research using Novel Biomeasures,8667828,R01AG047167,"['adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Age ', ' Aging ', ' atherosclerotic vascular disease ', ' atheromatosis ', ' Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease ', ' Atheroscleroses ', ' Atherosclerosis ', ' Biology ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Blood ', ' Peripheral Blood Cell ', ' Blood Cells ', ' Cells ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Data Collection ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' DNA ', ' Environment ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' human herpesvirus 4 group ', ' Infectious Mononucleosis Virus ', ' Herpesvirus 4 (gamma), Human ', ' HHV-4 ', ' Epstein-Barr Virus ', ' Epstein Barr Virus ', ' EBV ', ' EB virus ', ' E-B Virus ', ' Burkitt Lymphoma Virus ', ' Burkitt Herpesvirus ', ' Human Herpesvirus 4 ', ' Family ', ' Future ', ' behavior genetics ', ' Genetic Determinants of Behavior ', ' Behavioral Genetics ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health Surveys ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' histocompatibility typing ', ' Tissue Typing ', ' Tissue Crossmatching ', ' Histocompatibility Testing ', ' Learning ', ' white blood corpuscle ', ' white blood cell ', ' White Cell ', ' White Blood Cells ', ' Marrow leukocyte ', ' Leukocytes Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Blood leukocyte ', ' Leukocytes ', ' Life Experience ', ' life course ', ' Life Cycle ', ' Life Cycle Stages ', ' long-term study ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' Michigan ', ' DNA Molecular Biology ', ' Molecular Biology ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Poverty Areas ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' recruit ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' Validity and Reliability ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Retirement ', ' Saliva ', ' Sampling Studies ', ' socioenvironment ', ' social context ', ' social climate ', ' Social Environment ', ' Stress ', ' Testing ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' telomere ', ' Mediating ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' Telomerase ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Cell Size ', ' base ', ' Blood Sample ', ' Blood specimen ', ' improved ', ' Phlebotomy ', ' Venous blood sampling ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Biological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Adolescent ', ' Link ', ' Mexican ', ' Measurement ', ' Sample Size ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Biological Function ', ' Biological Process ', ' Venous ', ' Research Specimen ', ' Specimen ', ' Scientist ', ' Complex ', ' psychosocial ', ' interest ', ' Physical environment ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Population Study ', ' social ', ' Sampling ', ' behavioral health ', ' theories ', ' repository ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Address ', ' Length ', ' Data ', ' Population Research ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' Molecular ', ' Process ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomic ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio economic ', ' socioeconomics ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' cost ', ' time use ', ' social disparities ', ' Population ', ' racial/ethnic ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' public health relevance ', ' population based ', ' population health ', ' ']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2014,320127,0.07617542566341139
"Characterization of novel compounds with anti-lymphoma activity     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Although the incidence for cancer in the US has declined slightly in the past decade, it still claims the lives of more than half a million individals a year. There are a great number of distinct types of lymphocyte malignancies that represent the various stages of B- and T-cell development and these represent approximately 9% of all cancers in this country. Lymphomas represent ~54% of blood cell cancers and the main forms are Hodgkin and non-Hodgkin lymphomas (NLH). The latter is the most common type of lymphoma and affects Caucasians at a highest rate followed closely by people of Hispanic descent. Patients with NLH have a 5 year survival rate of ~67% while African Americans have a lower survival rate of 56%. Patients with Hodgkin lymphoma have a survival rate of 83% for whites and 77% for African Americans. There are many factors that not only affect cancer incidence but also mortality, and some of these are the likely causes of the observed health disparities. Unfortunately, finding a cure for all types of cancer is highly unlikely as there are many genetic alterations that are involved and many distinct types of cancers. However, there are new drugs being discovered on a fairly frequent basis that affect specific cancer types by targeting specific pathways that interfere with their growth or induce cell death. In recent months, we have developed and validated a screening assay that was used to test a small library of compounds on B- and T-cell lymphomas. These screening efforts have resulted in the identification of several related compounds that are highly cytotoxic to lymphomas. The main goal of this project is to characterize the novel anti-lymphoma compounds that have been identified. The specific aims of the project are to (1) characterize the identified anti-lymphoma compounds (2) determine the mode of action of lead compounds, and (3) examine the effects of the most promising compounds in vivo. The identification and characterization of drugs that are cytotoxic to specific types of lymphomas can lead to novel therapeutic agents.              PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The second leading cause of death in the United States is cancer. Apart from the most commons types of cancer such as breast and prostate, there are a great number of hematopoietic and lymphoid malignancies. Our group has identified greater than fifty related compounds with strong cytotoxic activity against human lymphomas that need to be fully characterized. The identification and characterization of drugs that are cytotoxic to specific types of lymphomas can lead to the implementation of new agents that alone or in combination can cure or increase life expectancy of those affected by specific lymphoid neoplasms.            ",Characterization of novel compounds with anti-lymphoma activity,8650908,SC3GM103713,"['Affect ', ' Age ', ' anticancer drug ', ' anticancer agent ', ' Tumor-Specific Treatment Agents ', ' Neoplastic Disease Chemotherapeutic Agents ', ' Cancer Drug ', ' Antineoplastics ', ' Antineoplastic Drugs ', ' Anti-Cancer Agents ', ' Antineoplastic Agents ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Peripheral Blood Cell ', ' Blood Cells ', ' Breast ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' white race ', ' Occidental ', ' Caucasoid ', ' Caucasian Race ', ' Caucasian ', ' Caucasoid Race ', ' Cause of Death ', ' necrocytosis ', ' Cell Death ', ' cultured cell line ', ' Strains Cell Lines ', ' CellLine ', ' Cell Line ', ' Evaluation Studies, Drug, Preclinical ', ' Evaluation Studies, Drug, Pre-Clinical ', ' Drug Screening ', ' Preclinical Drug Evaluation ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Growth ', ' lymphogranulomatosis (malignant) ', ' Malignant Lymphogranuloma ', ' Hodgkins lymphoma ', "" Hodgkin's disease "", "" Hodgkin's Lymphoma "", "" Hodgkin's "", ' Hodgkin lymphoma ', ' Hodgkin Disorder ', ' Hodgkin Disease ', ' Modern Man ', ' Man (Taxonomy) ', ' Human ', ' In Vitro ', ' Incidence ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Libraries ', ' Life Expectancy ', ' lymph cell ', ' Lymphocytic ', ' Lymphocyte ', ' Reticulolymphosarcoma ', ' Malignant Lymphoma ', "" Lymphoma (Hodgkin's and Non-Hodgkin's) "", ' Germinoblastoma ', ' Germinoblastic Sarcoma ', ' Lymphoma ', ' non-Hodgkins lymphoma ', ' non-Hodgkins disease ', ' Nonhodgkins Lymphoma ', "" Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma "", ' Mortality ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' genome mutation ', ' Genetic defect ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Mutation ', ' Patients ', ' Prostatic Gland ', ' Prostate Gland ', ' Prostate ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Survival Rate ', ' Testing ', ' transplant ', ' Transplantation ', ' United States ', ' Caucasians ', "" T-Cell and NK-Cell Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma "", ' T-Cell NonHodgkins Lymphoma ', "" T-Cell Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma "", ' T-Cell Lymphoma ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Hispanics ', ' TimeLine ', ' Programmed Cell Death ', ' Apoptosis Pathway ', ' Apoptosis ', ' base ', ' cytotoxicity test ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Therapeutic Agents ', ' Cytotoxic drug ', ' Cytotoxic agent ', ' Staging ', ' blood cancer ', ' Malignant Hematopoietic Neoplasm ', ' Hematopoietic and Lymphoid Neoplasms ', ' Hematopoietic and Lymphoid Cell Neoplasm ', ' Hematopoietic Tumor ', ' Hematopoietic Neoplasms including Lymphomas ', ' Hematopoietic Malignancies ', ' Hematopoietic Cell Tumor ', ' Hematopoietic Neoplasms ', ' Country ', ' Lymphoid and Plasmacytic Tumour ', ' Lymphoid and Plasmacytic Neoplasm ', ' Lymphoid and Plasma Cell Tumour ', ' Lymphoid Tumor ', ' Lymphocytic and Plasmacytic Neoplasm ', ' Lymphocytic and Plasma Cell Tumour ', ' Lymphocytic and Plasma Cell Neoplasm ', ' Lymphocytic Tumor ', ' Lymphocytic Neoplasm ', ' lymphoid neoplasm ', ' novel ', ' lymphoid malignancy ', ' Malignant lymphoid neoplasm ', ' treatment adverse effect ', ' therapy adverse effect ', ' side effect ', ' Treatment Side Effects ', ' Adverse effects ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Dose ', ' cytotoxic ', ' Data ', ' Immunodeficient Mouse ', ' T-Lymphocyte Development ', ' T-Cell Ontogeny ', ' T-Cell Development ', ' in vivo ', ' New Agents ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' resistant to therapy ', ' resistance to therapy ', ' therapy resistant ', ' lymphoma/leukemia ', ' leukemia/lymphoma ', ' cancer type ', ' resistant ', ' Resistance ', ' next generation therapeutics ', ' new therapeutics ', ' novel therapeutics ', ' public health relevance ', ' screening ', ' ']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS EL PASO,SC3,2014,113250,0.018967989078437192
"Cryptoprotective Autophagy in Bone Metastatic Prostate Cancer Project Summary/Abstract Candidate: My immediate career goals are to obtain the necessary training and skill set required to be competitive for a tenured faculty position and to accumulate data sufficient for an R01 or similar funding mechanism. My long term career goals are to be a tenured, funded cancer biology professor, a mentor, and a science administrator. To this end, the key elements of my career plan are focused on 1) developing my independent research, 2) continuing my technical and research administrative education, 3) honing my communication skills, and 4) gaining more mentoring experience.  Environment: I can successfully meet my goals because I have access to state-of-the-art equipment, core facilities, and educational resources at Rice University, the Texas Medical Center, and through a prostate cancer P01 collaboration that includes the University of Delaware, Emory University, and Cedars-Sinai. I also have a team of phenomenal mentors who are leaders in the prostate cancer and cancer health disparities fields. These mentors include my primary mentor, Dr. Mary Farach-Carson, co-mentor, Dr. Leland Chung, and Drs. Nora Navone and Lovell Jones, who have each agreed to provide me with career development guidance.  Research: Prostate cancer (PCa) is the second leading cause of death in North American men, where 80% of PCa mortality is due to bone metastasis. PCa tumors can contain neuronal-like neuroendocrine (NE) PCa cells, which correlates with poor prognosis. NE PCa cells are resistant to apoptosis, secrete proteins to induce cell proliferation and angiogenesis, and can de-differentiate to contribute to tumor growth. Our lab recently published data revealing that bone marrow stromal cell (BMSC) paracrine signaling induces apoptosis in co-cultured bone metastatic PCa cells. However, a subpopulation of the bone metastatic PCa cells can avoid cell death and undergo neuroendocrine differentiation (NED). One process that has been shown to mediate cancer cell survival and cell differentiation is autophagy, the homeostatic process of intracellular degradation and recycling. Thus, I propose that autophagy is a cytoprotective mechanism that PCa cells use to survive and undergo NED in the bone marrow stromal microenvironment. To address my hypothesis, I will (1) dissect autophagy regulation in PCa cells exposed to BMSC, (2) demonstrate that autophagy enhances PCa cell survival and promotes NED, and (3) show that autophagy attenuation increases PCa cell death. Autophagy induction and function will be analyzed using immuno-blot and -staining for autophagy markers, such as LC3, and using acidic vesicle dyes, such as monodansylcadaverin. PCa cells will be subjected to genetic and pharmacological autophagy modulation and assayed for cell viability and the NED phenotype. My investigation will identify pathways to attenuate autophagy and redirect bone metastatic PCa cells towards cell death. Project Narrative  Prostate cancer (PCa) bone metastasis is responsible for 80% of PCa death. Therefore, it is imperative to understand the biology of bone metastatic PCa cells in the bone environment. Hence, the purpose of this project is to determine the role of autophagy, a homeostatic process, in bone metastatic PCa cell survival and to determine if inhibition of autophagy can kill bone metastatic PCa cells.",Cryptoprotective Autophagy in Bone Metastatic Prostate Cancer,8847542,K01CA160602,"['abstracting ', ' autophagy ', ' Autophagocytosis ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Biology ', ' bone ', ' Bone Marrow Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Bone Marrow ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Cell Division Cycle ', ' Cell Cycle ', ' necrocytosis ', ' Cell Death ', ' Cell Differentiation ', ' Cell Differentiation process ', ' Subcellular Process ', ' Cellular Process ', ' Cellular Physiology ', ' Cellular Function ', ' Cell Process ', ' Cell Function ', ' Cell physiology ', ' Cell Viability ', ' Cell Survival ', ' Cells ', ' Communication ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Delaware ', ' Coloring Agents ', ' Dyes ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Elements ', ' Environment ', ' Equipment ', ' Faculty ', ' Goals ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Growth ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Mentors ', ' Mortality ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' neuronal ', ' Neurocyte ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Neurons ', ' Neuroendocrine System ', ' Neuroendocrine ', ' Neurosecretory Systems ', ' Phenotype ', ' Prognosis ', ' outcome forecast ', ' gene product ', ' Proteins ', ' Publishing ', ' Research ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Rice ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Science ', ' Signal Pathway ', ' Stains ', ' Texas ', ' Universities ', ' Administrator ', ' Mediating ', ' bone neoplasm secondary ', ' Skeletal metastasis ', ' Secondary malignant neoplasm of bone ', ' Secondary malignancy of bone ', ' Secondary cancer of bone ', ' Osseous metastasis ', ' Metastatic malignant neoplasm to bone ', ' Metastatic Tumor to the Bone ', ' Metastatic Cancer to the Bone ', ' Metastasis to bone ', ' Bony metastasis ', ' Bone cancer metastatic ', ' Bone Metastasis ', ' Metastatic Neoplasm to the Bone ', ' Killings ', ' Stromal Cells ', ' Programmed Cell Death ', ' Apoptosis Pathway ', ' Apoptosis ', ' career ', ' Site ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' Funding ', ' Recycling ', ' Collaborations ', ' Coculture ', ' Cocultivation ', ' Co-culture ', ' Coculture Techniques ', ' angiogenesis ', ' Genetic ', ' Exposure to ', ' Attenuated ', ' Vesicle ', ' Malignant Cell ', ' cancer cell ', ' Prostatic Cancer ', ' Prostate Cancer ', ' Prostate CA ', ' Malignant prostatic tumor ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Prostate ', ' Malignant neoplasm of prostate ', ' Investigation ', ' Stainings ', ' Staining method ', ' Paracrine Signaling ', ' Paracrine Communication ', ' meetings ', ' skills training ', ' Medical center ', ' American ', ' Cellular Proliferation ', ' Cell Multiplication ', ' Cell Growth in Number ', ' Cell Proliferation ', ' experience ', ' paracrine ', ' tumor growth ', ' professor ', ' attenuation ', ' skills ', ' Phenocopy ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Regulation ', ' ray (radiation) ', ' Radiation ', ' Modeling ', ' career development ', ' response ', ' Prostate Carcinoma Metastatic ', ' Metastatic Prostate Cancer ', ' Address ', ' Core Facility ', ' cytotoxic ', ' Data ', ' Mitotic ', ' Apoptotic ', ' Cancer Biology ', ' Funding Mechanisms ', ' Molecular Tumor Suppression ', ' Tumor Suppression ', ' Process ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' Metabolic stress ', ' cancer disparity ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' resistant ', ' Resistance ', ' tumor ', ' inhibition of autophagy ', ' prostate cancer cell ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS DALLAS,K01,2014,115020,0.0210667541007562
"Immune regulatory mechanisms and fungus-specific memory T cell responses     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The opportunistic fungal pathogen Aspergillus fumigatus is the causative agent of more than 90% of all Invasive Aspergillosis (IA) infections diagnosed in immunosuppressed patients. Exposure to A. fumigatus can also lead to the development of allergic asthma and Allergic Bronchopulmonary Aspergillosis (ABPA) in patients with atopic asthma or Cystic Fibrosis. Fungus-specific CD4 T cell responses are important in defense against invasive disease and mediate the development of allergic responses. Thus, understanding the factors that control the expansion and formation of fungus-specific memory CD4 T cells will lay the foundation for the future development of novel immune-based therapeutic strategies to enhance or inhibit fungus-specific immunity. In this proposal, the applicant will examine the contributions of regulatory T cells (Tregs) and T cell-intrinsic inhibitry receptors (PD-1 and CTLA-4) in controlling fungus-specific CD4 T cell responses. Moreover, the proposed studies will determine the mechanism of action of inhibitory receptors and Tregs and how they impact fungus-driven allergic airway disease progression. The applicant will be supported by a comprehensive training plan to promote her career development as an independent scientist and to help her attain a PhD degree. The long-term goal of the applicant is to become a successful, well- funded, independent researcher. As a woman of Hispanic descent the applicant is committed to contributing to the future development of research programs to address health disparities and diversity in biomedical science's workforce.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The opportunistic fungal pathogen Aspergillus fumigatus is the most common causative agent of invasive aspergillosis and can also trigger the development of allergic asthma responses. Immune responses to this fungus are central in the pathogenesis of fungal allergic asthma and in the prevention of invasive fungal disease. The studies proposed in this application will elucidate the specific contributions of immune regulatory mechanisms that promote the proper eradication of A. fumigatus while preventing excessive tissue damage to the host. The characterization of relevant immune regulatory mechanisms will facilitate the development of novel immune based therapeutic interventions for the treatment of invasive fungal disease and allergic

"(PQC3) Immunological Basis of Health Disparities in Multiple Myeloma ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Multiple myeloma (MM) is an incurable B-cell proliferative disorder of malignant plasma cells. MM is an example of a cancer health disparity with one of the highest African American/European American (AA/EA) incidence rate ratios of all cancers. The explanation for this race-related difference needs to be found in the etiology of the MM premalignant condition known as monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS), since the prevalence of MGUS in AA is much higher than that observed in EA, while the probability for transition from MGUS to MM is the same in both races. We postulate that this health disparity can be explained by differences in the IgE-(mast cell) system, which are the mediators of the allergic immune response. This response is due to the presence of mast cells (MC) in tissue that are sensitized by IgE antibodies, which when bound to a multivalent antigen (allergen) lead to the cross-linking of the high affinity IgE receptor I (FceRI) and degranulation f MC, resulting in the release of histamine and other mediators of the acute inflammatory (allergic) response. However, in addition to this well-known degranulating response, when bound to MC in the absence of antigens (monomeric IgE), IgE activates MC and prolongs their survival without inducing degranulation. Activated MC secrete the cytokine interleukin-6 (IL-6) and express CD40L on their surface, both of which provide strong signals that activate B cells and trigger their differentiation into plasma cells. Since B-cell activation involves the expressio of the DNA mutating enzyme activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID), this would increase the probability of mutations that lead to abnormal plasma cells (MGUS). It is well known that the total IgE blood level is higher in AA compared to EA, with and without other pathological conditions associated with high IgE levels. Thus, we hypothesize that the higher IgE levels in AA result in a higher incidence of MGUS through enhanced chronic activation of the MC-(B-cell) axis. Interestingly, there are also differences in MC structure and enzymatic content between AA and EA, with unknown functional implications. Therefore, we also hypothesize that MC from AA have stronger stimulatory activity, compared to those from EA, when exposed to the same amount of monomeric IgE, or even without IgE. However, both hypotheses are not mutually exclusive. We have two specific aims: Aim 1: Define the differences in MC in AA and EA in the absence of IgE and Aim 2: Define the differences of MC in AA and EA in the presence of IgE. In addition to using antigen free (monomeric) IgE to monitor its efficacy to activate the MC:B-cell axis, we will also explore the use of a therapeutic IgE targeting an antigen on MM cells to trigger degranulation and anti-tumor activity, a process known as the ""re-education of MC to fight cancer"". This artificially induced event is possible because degranulating MC release pro-apoptotic molecules with anti-tumor effects and should not be confused with that induced by total levels of IgE activating the MC:B-cell axis. Thus, our proposal has relevant implications in both the prevention and therapy of MM.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Multiple myeloma (MM) is an incurable blood cancer that disproportionally affects African Americans compared to European Americas (whites) and all other racial groups; however, the basis for this race-related difference is unknown. The main goal of this project is to understand the causes of a premalignant (benign) condition known as ""monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance"" (MGUS) that precedes MM and is the key to understanding this cancer health disparity. The present proposal aims to discover the immunological basis of MGUS focusing on key players of the allergic immune response that may promote this premalignant condition (mast cells and IgE antibody) and also aims to reprogram this immune response to eventually eliminate MM.            ",(PQC3) Immunological Basis of Health Disparities in Multiple Myeloma,8870884,R21CA193953,"['Structure ', '

"Regulation of osteoclast biology by anion exchanger SLC4A2 in mouse and human sys    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Bone is a dynamic tissue that remodels to grow, adapt to stress and maintain integrity. Two cell types control this process, the osteoblast (OB) and the osteoclast (OC), which synthesize and degrade bone, respectively. Pathologic inequality in bone remodeling favoring resorption over formation leads to diseases such as osteoporosis, rheumatoid arthritis and metastatic bone cancer. Currently, over 30 million Americans have low bone mass and nearly 1% of our population suffers from rheumatoid arthritis. The yearly health care cost burden of these diseases is immense. Currently approved therapeutics targeting OCs are inadequate, necessitating the discovery of new targets. To resorb bone, osteoclasts secrete hydrochloric acid. To prevent a reciprocal build up of cytoplasmic base, electroneutral exchange of bicarbonate for chloride occurs through an anion exchanger. The identity of this exchanger eluded identification until our recent report showing Solute carrier family 4, anion exchanger, member 2 (Slc4a2, Ae2) is absolutely required for osteoclast activity during development. In its absence, mice develop profound osteopetrosis. A recent publication has identified a nearly identical phenotype in cattle that lack SLC4A2. To date, only a handful of mutations have been identified that so dramatically curtail the ability of osteoclasts to resorb calcified tissue. Our preliminary data suggest that SCL4A2 plays an unexpected complex role in OC physiology. We have found that SLC4A2 deficiency not only prevents OCs from properly secreting acid and performing anion exchange, but also profoundly affects the organization of their cytoskeleton. Many important questions remain regarding the biology of SLC4A2 in the OC. We do not know whether SLC4A2 is important in bone remodeling beyond the developmental period or in the pathogenesis of inflammatory skeletal disease. The relative contribution of the cytoplasmic and transmembrane domains of SLC4A2 to the regulation of osteoclast biology is unknown. Moreover, whether human osteoclasts utilize SLC4A2 is undefined. Four specific aims are proposed to answer these questions: 1) Establish the OC-intrinsic role of SLC4A2 and resolve the contribution of osteopetrosis to the lethal phenotype of Slc4a2-/- mice; 2) Establish the requirement of SLC4A2 in a mouse model of inflammatory arthritis; 3) Perform a structure-function analysis of SLC4A2 in OCs and 4) Confirm a role for SLC4A2 in human OCs. I will take advantage of the unique environment in Boston to facilitate these studies. Collaborations have been established with local experts in anion exchange physiology, OC cell biology, mouse models of RA and RNA interference. By analyzing the function of a gene that so profoundly affects OC biology, this grant will advance basic understanding of skeletal remodeling, make important contributions to general cell biology and signal transduction and, most importantly, define a new target to suppress pathologic bone loss.        Dynamic remodeling of bone allows our skeleton to grow and adapt to stress, but makes it susceptible to diseases such as osteoporosis and rheumatoid arthritis. The only cell capable of destroying bone is the osteoclast, a multinucleated giant cell that secretes hydrochloric acid and proteolytic enzymes. This grant aims to better understand how osteoclasts work by probing the function of an ion exchanger (SLC4A2) that osteoclasts require to perform this remarkable, but often pathologic, feat.

"Detection of 5-hmC as a Novel Screening Biomarker for Pancreatic Cancer ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Pancreatic cancer (PaC) ranks the fourth in the US and eighth worldwide for cancer mortality. Early diagnosis and prevention is the only viable option for impacting the mortality rate. Due to the low prevalence of PaC in the population, however, most positive screening tests are likely false positives. Therefore, it remains a grand challenge to identify more accurate biomarkers for early screening and prognosis prediction. Given the complex pathogenesis of PaC, identification of biomarkers for PaC will benefit from a systematical search targeting various gene regulation mechanisms, considering that gene expression dysregulation underlies the disease development. Recent studies using high-throughput epigenomic profiling technologies have demonstrated aberrant modifications of CpG sites in PaC cell lines and tumor tissues, suggesting the potential applications of these epigenetic markers to early detection of this dreadful disease. In particular, 5- hydroxymethylcytosine (5-hmC), which can be generated by oxidation of 5-methylcytosine (5-mC) through the Tet family of enzymes, was recently re-discovered to be a stable base in various human tissues, with emerging gene regulatory role and implications for human cancers. We reasoned that determining the exact types of cytosine modifications (5-mC or 5-hmC) implicated in PaC will provide novel insights into its pathogenesis, as well as novel epigenetic biomarkers for PaC early detection. Specifically, The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) data will be explored to guide the selection of PaC-specific CpGs to be tested for the existence of 5-hmC in a panel of PaC cell lines with varying degrees of genetic complexity using a novel and proven technique, Tet- assisted Bisulfite Sequencing (TAB-Seq), developed by our colleague and collaborator, Dr. Chuan He (HHMI Investigator). We will also use the TAB-Seq assay to examine 5-hmC directly in PaC tumor and surrounding normal tissue samples that have already been collected from 30 US and 30 Chinese patients in our previous or ongoing projects. Our design of including two diverse populations will allow investigation of the role of these epigeneti markers in the health disparities in this disease. To examine the clinical significance of the 5-hmC, we will evaluate our detected CpG markers (5-mC and 5-hmC) in cells from endoscopically- and histologically normal-appearing periampullary duodenal biopsies from 30 US and 30 Chinese PaC patients as well as 30/30 matched controls in relation to the nanoscale cellular architecture alterations due to field carcinogenesis using a novel biophotonic technology. In summary, this project will for the first time define which cytosine modifications, 5 hmC or 5-mC or both, are implicated in PaC. The results from this proposal will lay the foundation of applying CpG markers including 5-hmC as a novel class of early screening and predictive biomarkers for PaC. Finally, the PIs, Drs. Zhang and Hou have assembled an excellent investigative team with significant achievements in relevant research areas and complimentary expertise, therefore ensuring the success of this multidisciplinary and highly innovative project.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This works seeks to understand how covalent cytosine modifications (5-methylcytosines and/or 5-hydroxymethylcytosines) implicate in pancreatic cancer. Through an understanding of this epigenetic control, we may be able to utilize cytosine modifications as biomarkers for the prevention, diagnosis and prognosis of pancreatic cancer. This approach may also be applied to other human cancers.            ",Detection of 5-hmC as a Novel Screening Biomarker for Pancreatic Cancer,8881578,R21CA187869,"['Achievement Attainment ', ' Achievement ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Architecture ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Biopsy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cells ', ' 2(1H)-Pyrimidinone, 4-amino- ', ' Cytosine ', ' Diagnosis ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Enzymes ', ' Family ', ' Foundations ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Gene Expression Regulation ', ' Gene Regulation Process ', ' Gene Regulation ', ' Gene Action Regulation ', ' Genes ', ' Regulator Genes ', ' trans acting element ', ' regulatory gene ', ' Transcriptional Regulatory Elements ', ' Modern Man ', ' Man (Taxonomy) ', ' Human ', ' In Vitro ', ' Incidence ', ' Laboratories ', ' Mortality ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' oxidation ', ' Patients ', ' Play ', ' Prognosis ', ' outcome forecast ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Science ', ' Spectrum Analyses ', ' Spectroscopy ', ' Spectrum Analysis ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Tumor Cell Line ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' diverse populations ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' Chinese ', ' Chinese People ', ' base ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Histologically ', ' Histologic ', ' Ensure ', ' Evaluation ', ' insight ', ' Funding ', ' Genetic ', ' Staging ', ' Normal Tissue ', ' Normal tissue morphology ', ' tool ', ' Pancreatic Cancer ', ' Pancreas Cancer ', ' Malignant Pancreatic Neoplasm ', ' Malignant neoplasm of pancreas ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Investigation ', ' Complex ', ' human tissue ', ' Techniques ', ' Tumor Tissue ', ' Cancer Induction ', ' carcinogenesis ', ' early detection ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' success ', ' Base Pairing ', ' novel ', ' Prevention ', ' Pathogenesis ', ' Risk Reduction ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Normal Cell ', ' Tissue Sample ', ' Address ', ' Biophotonics ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Molecular Epidemiology of Cancer ', ' Resolution ', ' Tet ', ' Tetanus Helper Peptide ', ' Cancer Patient ', ' Epigenetic Mechanism ', ' Epigenetic Change ', ' Epigenetic ', ' Epigenetic Process ', ' Low Prevalence ', ' Modification ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' epigenomics ', ' cancer research ', ' anticancer research ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' nanometer sized ', ' nanometer scale ', ' nano scale ', ' nano meter sized ', ' nano meter scale ', ' nanoscale ', ' Cancer cell line ', ' Population ', ' cancer type ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' clinical significance ', ' clinically significant ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' tumor ', ' public health relevance ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' genomewide ', ' genome-wide ', ' pancreatic cancer cells ', ' TCGA ', ' The Cancer Genome Atlas ', ' epigenetic biomarker ', ' epigenetic marker ', ' screening ', ' ']",NCI,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,R21,2015,216485,0.0444099748014523
"Uterine Leiomyoma Development in Mouse Models DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Uterine fibroids (leiomyomata uteri) are the most common tumors in the female reproductive tract. Some estimates indicate that more than 50% of American women have uterine fibroids. Additionally, there is a significant disparity in the incidence of fibroids since African-American women are 2-3 times more likely to develop fibroids. These tumors can be very painful and are a leading cause of infertility in women. Also, because these tumors can become very large, and although the uterus is indispensable for mammalian reproduction, they remain the main reason for hysterectomies in the US. Despite the healthcare burden caused by uterine fibroids, their etiology and pathophysiology are unknown. We have developed mutant mice in which nuclear �-catenin signaling has been specifically induced in reproductive tract tissues. Normally, mice do not develop fibroids; however, these mutant mice develop smooth muscle tumors in their uteri with 100% penetrance by 8 weeks of age. These tumors exhibit characteristics of human fibroids by histological and immunohistochemical criteria. �-Catenin, a well-known downstream effector of Wnt signaling, induces organ and tissue malformations and tumor development following dysregulation of its activity. The mice also express higher levels of mTor, as observed in the Tsc2-mutant Eker rat fibroid model and in approximately 50% of human fibroids, suggesting that mTor activation may be a common pathway in leiomyoma development. We will investigate this mouse model further, placing particular emphasis on the regulation of mTor gene expression and activity for comparison with other mutant mouse models lacking myometrial Lkb1, the gene mutated in patients with Peutz-Jeghers Syndrome, and Tsc1, both of which also induce mTor activity and induce uterine fibroids as shown in our preliminary results. We propose to investigate the intracellular mechanisms and pathways affected by dysregulated Wnt/�-catenin in our unique mouse model that induce mTor activity for comparison with Lkb1- and Tsc2-deleted uteri. To better understand the etiology and pathogenesis of fibroids, we will study the molecular mechanisms controlling fibrosis in the mutant myometrial cells such as cell polarity, extracellular matrix deposition, and myometrial differentiation. We will determine which characteristics of the mouse models most closely resemble human leiomyomas and are best suited for preclinical studies. Lastly, we will determine whether disrupted Wnt/�-catenin signaling contributes to human leiomyoma development. The results from the studies in this proposal will provide new insights into the etiology and progression of these tumors, as well as provide the rationale for investigating therapies targeting the mechanisms involved in leiomyoma development and progression. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Uterine fibroids affect approximately 50% of American women during their reproductive years and are a significant source of pelvic pain, abnormal uterine bleeding, and infertility. Despite the major health care burden posed by uterine fibroids, very little is known about their cause or the best treatment strategies. As a result, if the symptoms are severe enough, patients can be managed by surgical intervention. The overall aims of the proposed studies are to understand the underlying causes of uterine fibroid development and growth and to develop new therapeutic options that could offer a safer alternative

"Targeted Combination Therapy for Lung Cancer DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Lung cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer deaths in the US with 5 year survival rate of ~15% due to the lack of specificity, poor efficacy, and side effects associated with current therapies. The lung cancer incidences are highest in African Americans, American Indians/Alaska Natives, and Pacific Islanders. The non- small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is most prevalent (~80% occurrence) among lung cancer patient. NSCLC has wide molecular heterogeneity, which mandates simultaneous targeting of multiple pathways. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) gene over-expression (in ~90% of NSCLC's) is associated with growth, survival, and angiogenesis. The use of VEGF antibodies to block VEGF has been limited due to their non- specificity, poor efficacy and adverse effects. In this line, silencing VEGF using VEGF-siRNA (siRNA-V) will be an effective option, however, the clinical utility of siRNA has been hampered due to non-specific effect, poor cell permeation and rapid in vivo elimination. The use of nanocarriers for siRNA-V delivery will help to overcome these issues. Furthermore, PI3K/mTOR was found to be predominantly activated in NSCLC, additionally, mTOR inhibition results in compensatory activation of Akt (a promoter of cell survival and proliferation). Hence, simultaneous targeting of mTOR and Akt along with VEGF silencing will pave the way for more effective NSCLC therapy. PF-04691502 (PF0) is a potent PI3K/mTOR/AKT inhibitor. Targeting mTOR/AKT pathway using PF0 along with VEGF silencing will complement the clinical potential of these bioactives against NSCLC. LHRH receptors are over-expressed on NSCLC cells with restricted expression on normal tissues. For the first time, we are herewith proposing the development of biodegradable, LHRH receptor-targeted PEGylated hybrid nanocarrier (HNC) for the simultaneous targeted delivery of siRNA-V and PF0 (HNC-VP-L) to NSCLC. We hypothesize that the development of stable, LHRH receptor-guided PEGylated albumin-chitosan based hybrid nanocarriers will deliver the synergistically-acting siRNA-V and PF0 in a targeted fashion to NSCLC tumors and will result in a significant improvement of anticancer activity, at lower doses, while overcoming adverse effects. We plan to test our hypothesis by following specific aims: Aim 1: To evaluate the combination effect of siRNA-V and PF0; development and evaluation of HNC-VP-L; Aim 2: To evaluate the in vivo efficacy of HNC-VP-L in nude mice; and Aim 3: To elucidate mechanism, evaluate metastasis and toxicological parameters. We plan to utilize LHRH receptor positive and LHRH receptor negative tumor cell based in vitro as well as in vivo models (xenograft and orthotropic) to investigate the targeting potential of developed nan carriers. Our approach aims at developing a more effective treatment modality for the treatment of NSCLC to reduce the burden of lung cancer disparity. The long term goal is to advance this novel delivery concept to the clinic level. We will be able to establish the first nan carrier based extramural cancer program in the state of Hawaii and train the unrepresented students through this project. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Lung cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer deaths and has poor survival rates compared to other types of cancers. The lung cancer incidence is highest in African Americans, underserved Whites, American Indians/Alaska Natives, and Pacific Islanders thereby the disparities in treatment outcomes exists. The non- small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is prevalent (~80% occurrence) among lung cancer patient. The site specific delivery of therapeutic agents to tumors is still a major challenge in cancer research. NSCLC has wide molecular heterogeneity and therefore, warrants targeting of multiple pathways for improving the outcome among lung cancer patients. The tumor specific delivery of therapeutic agents targeting multiple pathways involved in NSCLC progression represents a potential approach to treat the NSCLC owing to its advantages over existing treatment modalities. In this regard, some attempts have been made to deliver chemotherapeutic agents using Nan carriers, however, our proposed combination therapy of PF-04691502 (PF0), an ATP- competitive PI3K/mTOR/AKT dual inhibitor and siRNA-V using targeted hybrid nan carriers of natural biopolymers (albumin and chitosan) for the treatment of NSCLC is novel and has not been studies so far. Stable, biodegradable, and tumor-specific LHRH receptor-guided hybrid nan carriers loaded with synergistically acting PF0 and siRNA-V will selectively deliver PF0 and siRNA-V to NSCLC and exert significant antitumor activity while sparing normal tissues. This is the first time targeted hybrid Nan carriers are being explored for the simultaneous co-delivery of PF0 and siRNA-V for the treatment of NSCLC. This project combines a highly innovative and collaborative approach with advanced nanotechnologies and in vivo cancer cell biology including LHRH receptor positive and LHRH receptor negative tumor cell based models to evaluate developed targeted delivery system. Our proposed studies are aimed at developing a more effective and reliable treatment modality that can be safely used for the treatment of NSCLC and also help to reduce the burden of lung cancer disparity. We will be able to establish the first Nan carrier based cancer program in the state of Hawaii, obtain extramural NIH/DOD funding, and train the unrepresented students through this project. The results will also provide the proof-of-concept for similar targeted Nan carrier therapies against other forms of cancer.",Targeted Combination Therapy for Lung

"Cryptoprotective Autophagy in Bone Metastatic Prostate Cancer Project Summary/Abstract Candidate: My immediate career goals are to obtain the necessary training and skill set required to be competitive for a tenured faculty position and to accumulate data sufficient for an R01 or similar funding mechanism. My long term career goals are to be a tenured, funded cancer biology professor, a mentor, and a science administrator. To this end, the key elements of my career plan are focused on 1) developing my independent research, 2) continuing my technical and research administrative education, 3) honing my communication skills, and 4) gaining more mentoring experience.  Environment: I can successfully meet my goals because I have access to state-of-the-art equipment, core facilities, and educational resources at Rice University, the Texas Medical Center, and through a prostate cancer P01 collaboration that includes the University of Delaware, Emory University, and Cedars-Sinai. I also have a team of phenomenal mentors who are leaders in the prostate cancer and cancer health disparities fields. These mentors include my primary mentor, Dr. Mary Farach-Carson, co-mentor, Dr. Leland Chung, and Drs. Nora Navone and Lovell Jones, who have each agreed to provide me with career development guidance.  Research: Prostate cancer (PCa) is the second leading cause of death in North American men, where 80% of PCa mortality is due to bone metastasis. PCa tumors can contain neuronal-like neuroendocrine (NE) PCa cells, which correlates with poor prognosis. NE PCa cells are resistant to apoptosis, secrete proteins to induce cell proliferation and angiogenesis, and can de-differentiate to contribute to tumor growth. Our lab recently published data revealing that bone marrow stromal cell (BMSC) paracrine signaling induces apoptosis in co-cultured bone metastatic PCa cells. However, a subpopulation of the bone metastatic PCa cells can avoid cell death and undergo neuroendocrine differentiation (NED). One process that has been shown to mediate cancer cell survival and cell differentiation is autophagy, the homeostatic process of intracellular degradation and recycling. Thus, I propose that autophagy is a cytoprotective mechanism that PCa cells use to survive and undergo NED in the bone marrow stromal microenvironment. To address my hypothesis, I will (1) dissect autophagy regulation in PCa cells exposed to BMSC, (2) demonstrate that autophagy enhances PCa cell survival and promotes NED, and (3) show that autophagy attenuation increases PCa cell death. Autophagy induction and function will be analyzed using immuno-blot and -staining for autophagy markers, such as LC3, and using acidic vesicle dyes, such as monodansylcadaverin. PCa cells will be subjected to genetic and pharmacological autophagy modulation and assayed for cell viability and the NED phenotype. My investigation will identify pathways to attenuate autophagy and redirect bone metastatic PCa cells towards cell death. Project Narrative  Prostate cancer (PCa) bone metastasis is responsible for 80% of PCa death. Therefore, it is imperative to understand the biology of bone metastatic PCa cells in the bone environment. Hence, the purpose of this project is to determine the role of autophagy, a homeostatic process, in bone metastatic PCa cell survival and to determine if inhibition of autophagy can kill bone metastatic PCa cells.",Cryptoprotective Autophagy in Bone Metastatic Prostate Cancer,8717605,K01CA160602,"['abstracting ', ' autophagy ', ' Autophagocytosis ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Biology ', ' bone ', ' Bone Marrow Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Bone Marrow ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Cell Division Cycle ', ' Cell Cycle ', ' necrocytosis ', ' Cell Death ', ' Cell Differentiation ', ' Cell Differentiation process ', ' Subcellular Process ', ' Cellular Process ', ' Cellular Physiology ', ' Cellular Function ', ' Cell Process ', ' Cell Function ', ' Cell physiology ', ' Cell Viability ', ' Cell Survival ', ' Cells ', ' Communication ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Delaware ', ' Coloring Agents ', ' Dyes ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Elements ', ' Environment ', ' Equipment ', ' Faculty ', ' Goals ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Growth ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Mentors ', ' Mortality ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' neuronal ', ' Neurocyte ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Neurons ', ' Neuroendocrine System ', ' Neuroendocrine ', ' Neurosecretory Systems ', ' Phenotype ', ' Prognosis ', ' outcome forecast ', ' gene product ', ' Proteins ', ' Publishing ', ' Research ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Rice ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Science ', ' Signal Pathway ', ' Stains ', ' Texas ', ' Universities ', ' Administrator ', ' Mediating ', ' bone neoplasm secondary ', ' Skeletal metastasis ', ' Secondary malignant neoplasm of bone ', ' Secondary malignancy of bone ', ' Secondary cancer of bone ', ' Osseous metastasis ', ' Metastatic malignant neoplasm to bone ', ' Metastatic Tumor to the Bone ', ' Metastatic Cancer to the Bone ', ' Metastasis to bone ', ' Bony metastasis ', ' Bone cancer metastatic ', ' Bone Metastasis ', ' Metastatic Neoplasm to the Bone ', ' Killings ', ' Stromal Cells ', ' Programmed Cell Death ', ' Apoptosis Pathway ', ' Apoptosis ', ' career ', ' Site ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' Funding ', ' Recycling ', ' Collaborations ', ' Coculture ', ' Cocultivation ', ' Co-culture ', ' Coculture Techniques ', ' angiogenesis ', ' Genetic ', ' Exposure to ', ' Attenuated ', ' Vesicle ', ' Malignant Cell ', ' cancer cell ', ' Prostatic Cancer ', ' Prostate Cancer ', ' Prostate CA ', ' Malignant prostatic tumor ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Prostate ', ' Malignant neoplasm of prostate ', ' Investigation ', ' Stainings ', ' Staining method ', ' Paracrine Signaling ', ' Paracrine Communication ', ' meetings ', ' skills training ', ' Medical center ', ' American ', ' Cellular Proliferation ', ' Cell Multiplication ', ' Cell Growth in Number ', ' Cell Proliferation ', ' experience ', ' paracrine ', ' tumor growth ', ' professor ', ' attenuation ', ' skills ', ' Phenocopy ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Regulation ', ' ray (radiation) ', ' Radiation ', ' Modeling ', ' career development ', ' response ', ' Prostate Carcinoma Metastatic ', ' Metastatic Prostate Cancer ', ' Address ', ' Core Facility ', ' cytotoxic ', ' Data ', ' Mitotic ', ' Apoptotic ', ' Cancer Biology ', ' Funding Mechanisms ', ' Molecular Tumor Suppression ', ' Tumor Suppression ', ' Process ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' Metabolic stress ', ' cancer disparity ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' resistant ', ' Resistance ', ' tumor ', ' inhibition of autophagy ', ' prostate cancer cell ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS DALLAS,K01,2015,24341,0.0210667541007562
"Immune regulatory mechanisms and fungus-specific memory T cell responses DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The opportunistic fungal pathogen Aspergillus fumigatus is the causative agent of more than 90% of all Invasive Aspergillosis (IA) infections diagnosed in immunosuppressed patients. Exposure to A. fumigatus can also lead to the development of allergic asthma and Allergic Bronchopulmonary Aspergillosis (ABPA) in patients with atopic asthma or Cystic Fibrosis. Fungus-specific CD4 T cell responses are important in defense against invasive disease and mediate the development of allergic responses. Thus, understanding the factors that control the expansion and formation of fungus-specific memory CD4 T cells will lay the foundation for the future development of novel immune-based therapeutic strategies to enhance or inhibit fungus-specific immunity. In this proposal, the applicant will examine the contributions of regulatory T cells (Tregs) and T cell-intrinsic inhibitry receptors (PD-1 and CTLA-4) in controlling fungus-specific CD4 T cell responses. Moreover, the proposed studies will determine the mechanism of action of inhibitory receptors and Tregs and how they impact fungus-driven allergic airway disease progression. The applicant will be supported by a comprehensive training plan to promote her career development as an independent scientist and to help her attain a PhD degree. The long-term goal of the applicant is to become a successful, well- funded, independent researcher. As a woman of Hispanic descent the applicant is committed to contributing to the future development of research programs to address health disparities and diversity in biomedical science's workforce. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The opportunistic fungal pathogen Aspergillus fumigatus is the most common causative agent of invasive aspergillosis and can also trigger the development of allergic asthma responses. Immune responses to this fungus are central in the pathogenesis of fungal allergic asthma and in the prevention of invasive fungal disease. The studies proposed in this application will elucidate the specific contributions of immune regulatory mechanisms that promote the proper eradication of A. fumigatus while preventing excessive tissue damage to the host.

"Characterization of novel compounds with anti-lymphoma activity DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Although the incidence for cancer in the US has declined slightly in the past decade, it still claims the lives of more than half a million individals a year. There are a great number of distinct types of lymphocyte malignancies that represent the various stages of B- and T-cell development and these represent approximately 9% of all cancers in this country. Lymphomas represent ~54% of blood cell cancers and the main forms are Hodgkin and non-Hodgkin lymphomas (NLH). The latter is the most common type of lymphoma and affects Caucasians at a highest rate followed closely by people of Hispanic descent. Patients with NLH have a 5 year survival rate of ~67% while African Americans have a lower survival rate of 56%. Patients with Hodgkin lymphoma have a survival rate of 83% for whites and 77% for African Americans. There are many factors that not only affect cancer incidence but also mortality, and some of these are the likely causes of the observed health disparities. Unfortunately, finding a cure for all types of cancer is highly unlikely as there are many genetic alterations that are involved and many distinct types of cancers. However, there are new drugs being discovered on a fairly frequent basis that affect specific cancer types by targeting specific pathways that interfere with their growth or induce cell death. In recent months, we have developed and validated a screening assay that was used to test a small library of compounds on B- and T-cell lymphomas. These screening efforts have resulted in the identification of several related compounds that are highly cytotoxic to lymphomas. The main goal of this project is to characterize the novel anti-lymphoma compounds that have been identified. The specific aims of the project are to (1) characterize the identified anti-lymphoma compounds (2) determine the mode of action of lead compounds, and (3) examine the effects of the most promising compounds in vivo. The identification and characterization of drugs that are cytotoxic to specific types of lymphomas can lead to novel therapeutic agents. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The second leading cause of death in the United States is cancer. Apart from the most commons types of cancer such as breast and prostate, there are a great number of hematopoietic and lymphoid malignancies. Our group has identified greater than fifty related compounds with strong cytotoxic activity against human lymphomas that need to be fully characterized.

"Mechanisms of Immune Evasion and Recognition in Human Syphilis DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Syphilis, a multi-stage sexually transmitted disease caused by the spirochete Treponema pallidum (Tp), continues to be a major worldwide public health problem. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that approximately 10.6 million new syphilis cases occur yearly throughout the globe. The clinical manifestations of syphilis reflect the propensity of Tp to disseminate systemically and induce a chronic inflammation which occurs in stages, being secondary syphilis (SS) the focus of this proposal. Despite the robust nature of the adaptive and humoral immune responses during SS, including the emergence of high titers of opsonic antibodies, it takes weeks to months for host defenses to gain control of the invading pathogen. How the bacterium is able to evade human host defenses, while at the same time evoking vigorous cellular and humoral immune responses, is the principal scientific objective of the current proposal. A careful analysis of Tp¿s unique ultrastructural characteristics, which contains very few outer membrane proteins (OMPs), provides potential explanations for the paradoxical nature of SS. Inefficient antibody binding to the sparse spirochetal OMP antigenic targets is thought to allow a large proportion of spirochetes to shun antibody binding and opsonophagocytosis; a mechanism which we have shown is an essential requirement for Tp driven innate immune cell activation. The new finding that circulating natural killer (NK) cells reveal immunophenotypic alterations (emergence of a CD56negativeCD16high NK-cell subset), which exhibits both poor cytolytic activity and impaired cytokine production suggests that additional immunologic factors play a role in the duality of the immune response to Tp. We now propose a new syphilis immune-pathogenesis model, where antibodies to Tp¿s rare OMPs are only capable of binding a sub-population of spirochetes, thus allowing immune escape of organisms and at the same time recognition and bacterial clearance of different tissues. Over time, the host's expanding repertoire of antibodies against these rare OMPs broadens and intensifies, leading to more efficient opsonophagocytosis, bacterial clearance and lesion resolution. To accomplish our goals and examine mechanistic aspects of the proposed model, we have formulated the following Specific Aims. In Aim 1: we will further characterize spirochete burdens, spirochete diversity and the antibody responses in the blood of secondary syphilis patients; and in aim 2: we will study the role of the dermal macrophage as a driver of both inflammation and spirochetal clearance in secondary syphilis patient's dermal lesions. And in aim 3, w will further characterize NK cells in blood of SS patients. In concert wit the Fogarty International Center's mission to reduce health disparities amongst nations, the planned activities will also: (1) support collaborative syphilis immunobiology research between the LMIC PI and the US collaborators (2) strengthen CIDEIM¿s research capabilities and technical base; (3) continue providing needed epidemiological data about venereal syphilis for that region of Colombia. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Syphilis, caused by the spirochetal bacterium, Treponema pallidum, remains rampant throughout the world with more than 10.6 million cases occurring every year. This proposed research will allow us to advance our understanding of spirochetal immune recognition and immune evasion by its obligate human host and equally importantly, will address a major public health problem in Colombia, continue to provide local health authorities much needed epidemiological data about venereal syphilis in Cali and will allow the investigative team to carry on with education and training of local health professionals about the complexities of syphilis diagnosis and management.",Mechanisms of Immune Evasion and Recognition in Human Syphilis,8820955,R03TW009172,"['Antibodies ', ' Bacteria ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Blood ', ' Chancre ', ' Syphilitic chancre ', ' Colombia ', ' Veiled Cells ', ' Dendritic Cells ', ' Under-Developed Nations ', ' Under-Developed Countries ', ' Third-World Nations ', ' Third-World Countries ', ' Less-Developed Nations ', ' Less-Developed Countries ', ' Developing Nations ', ' Developing Nation ', ' Developing Country ', ' Developing Countries ', ' Diagnosis ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' Exhibits ', ' Freeze Fracturings ', ' Freeze Fracturing ', ' Glycolipids ', ' Goals ', ' Gram-Negative Bacteria ', ' Health ', ' Modern Man ', ' Man (Taxonomy) ', ' Human ', ' immunological substance ', ' immunologic substance ', ' Immunological Factors ', ' Immunologic Factors ', ' Infection ', ' Inflammation ', ' Transmembrane Protein ', ' Intrinsic Membrane Protein ', ' Integral Membrane Protein ', ' NK Cells ', ' K lymphocyte ', ' Cytotoxic cell ', ' Natural Killer Cells ', ' Lipids ', ' Lipopolysaccharides ', ' macrophage ', ' Surface Proteins ', ' Membrane-Associated Proteins ', ' Membrane Proteins ', ' Microscopy ', ' Mission ', ' living system ', ' Organism ', ' Patients ', ' Play ', ' Production ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' immune receptor ', ' Immunological Receptors ', ' Immunologic Receptors ', ' Research ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Venereal Infections ', ' Venereal Disorders ', ' Venereal Diseases ', ' Sexually Transmitted Infection ', ' Sexually Transmitted Disorder ', ' Sexually Transmitted Diseases ', ' Diagnostic Findings ', ' Signs and Symptoms ', ' Spirochetes ', ' Spirochaetales ', ' Order Spirochaetales ', ' great pox ', ' Syphilis ', ' Latent Syphilis ', ' thymus derived lymphocyte ', ' Thymus-Dependent Lymphocytes ', ' T-Cells ', ' T-Lymphocyte ', ' Time ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Tissues ', ' T.pallidum ', ' T. pallidum ', ' Treponema pallidum ', ' United States ', ' Western Europe ', ' Wit ', ' World Health Organization ', ' cytokine ', ' Mediating ', ' base ', ' Organ ', ' Surface ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Lesion ', ' Dermal ', ' Individual ', ' Research Activity ', ' uptake ', ' immunoresponse ', ' host response ', ' Immune response ', ' Staging ', ' Nature ', ' Immune ', ' Organ System ', ' body system ', ' Host Defense ', ' periplasmic ', ' Periplasmic Space ', ' periplasm ', ' Training and Education ', ' membrane structure ', ' Membrane ', ' international center ', ' authority ', ' TLR protein ', ' Toll-like receptors ', ' Pathogenesis ', ' Appearance ', ' Modeling ', ' Skin ', ' Immune Cell Activation ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' Binding ', ' Binding (Molecular Function) ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' polypeptide ', ' cell mediated immune response ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Immunophysiology ', ' Immunobiology ', ' Resolution ', ' Antibody Repertoire ', ' Invaded ', ' Immunochemical Immunologic ', ' Immunologics ', ' Characteristics ', ' Healthcare professional ', ' Health Care Professional ', ' Health Professional ', ' pathogen ', ' Population ', ' NH2-terminal ', ' N-terminal ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' translational approach ', ' adaptive immunity ', ' ']",FIC,CENTRO INTERNACIONAL  (CIDEIM),R03,2015,47087,0.06704394188098561
"Prevalence and Progression of Monoclonal Gammopathies DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Multiple myeloma (MM) is a life-threatening plasma cell malignancy. MM has a prolonged clinically detectable premalignant phase called monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) that can be identified by detection of the secreted monoclonal immunoglobulin (M protein) and through the presence of an abnormal immunoglobulin kappa/lambda free light chain (FLC) ratio. Over the last 10 years we have extensively characterized the various precursor stages of MM, and conducted numerous studies establishing monoclonal elevations of FLC and abnormalities in the FLC ratio as biomarkers for diagnosis, prognosis, response assessment, and risk stratification across a spectrum of plasma cell disorders. One of the goals of this renewal is to determine why MGUS occurs, and whether polyclonal plasma cell proliferation in response to infection or inflammation plays a role in pathogenesis of MGUS, MM and related malignancies. We are also investigating the reasons for dramatic racial disparity in incidence of MM; young blacks for example have a 3-fold higher risk than whites. Our studies show that a major reason for the racial discrepancy is a marked excess in the incidence of the precursor MGUS phase in blacks. Similarly, we have uncovered a significant familial predisposition in MGUS and MM. Since MM consists of multiple unique entities from a cytogenetic standpoint, we need to determine the precise cytogenetic subtypes responsible for racial disparity and familial predisposition. Thus two fundamental questions are: 1) Can we identify biomarkers that predict risk of MM prior to the premalignant MGUS stage (precursor of the precursor stage)? 2) What are the specific cytogenetic subtypes that account for the increased risk of MM in blacks and in first degree-relatives? In Aim 1 we will determine if polyclonal elevations of serum immunoglobulin FLC are associated with an increased risk of MGUS, MM and related B cell malignancies in a large cohort of nearly 16,000 patients. In Aim 2 we will assemble and study a cohort of 800 blacks with MM to identify the specific cytogenetic subtype(s) of MM associated with increased risk of MM, and also identify predictors of response to therapy and survival. In Aim 3 we will conduct studies to identify the specific cytogenetic subtypes associated with familial predisposition in MGUS. We believe our studies are highly innovative, and will have a far-reaching impact on our understanding of the etiology of MGUS, and the cytogenetic basis for racial disparity and familial predisposition. Our studies will result in a promising biomarker to identify patients at high risk for MM and related malignancies in the general population. Aims 2 and 3 will have a major impact on the management of patients with MGUS and MM, especially African Americans and first-degree relatives or persons with MGUS. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Multiple myeloma (MM) is a life-threatening plasma cell malignancy that is always preceded by a prolonged premalignant phase called monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS).

"A novel mechanism of action for N-acetyl cysteine ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) has been shown to improve aspects of cognitive function in Alzheimer's disease (AD), increase brain glutathione (GSH) levels in Parkinson's disease (PD), and double the chances of symptom resolution in soldiers suffering traumatic brain injury. Our recent studies reveal that NAC can have both GSH-dependent and GSH-independent actions. We have discovered that NAC can protect neuronal cell lines, primary astrocytes, and primary neurons through heat shock proteins. In all 3 cellular models, the pan-Hsp70 inhibitor VER155008 abolished the protective effects of NAC against the proteasome inhibitor MG132. NAC upregulated HspA1/2, the major member of the Hsp70 family, in MG132-treated N2a cells. NAC did not interfere with direct or acute MG132 inhibition of chymotrypsin-like proteasome activity in N2a cells, but did eventually reduce the MG132-induced increase in ubiquitinated proteins in an Hsp70- dependent manner. Thus, we hypothesize that NAC protects neurons against protein-misfolding stress through Hsp70. In Aim 1, we will generate a comprehensive NAC concentration-response curve in primary cortical and hippocampal neurons treated with two proteasome inhibitors: MG132 and lactacystin. We will perform three independent, unbiased viability assays that we have shown to be linearly correlated with cell density. NAC-induced changes in HspA1/2, Hsc70, mitochondrial Hsp70, and GRP78 will be assessed in both models by two techniques: immunoblotting and RT-PCR. Toxin action will be verified by measuring both proteasome activity and K48-linked ubiquitinated proteins. We will test if three pan-Hsp70 inhibitors, VER155008, MAL3-101, and 2-phenylethyne-sulfonamide attenuate NAC-mediated protection. We will then perform subcellular fractionation followed by Westerns to determine if NAC elicits nuclear translocation of Nrf2 or HSF1, both of which are known to control Hsp70 gene transcription. Nrf2 is normally inhibited by Keap1. Keap1 and HSF1 have reactive cysteine residues that may react with nucleophiles such as NAC in thiol exchange reactions. We will also assess HSF1 activation via phosphorylation at Ser230. If NAC elicits Nrf2 or HSF1 activation, we will knock them down to see if NAC-mediated protection and Hsp70 induction is abolished. In Aim 2, we will generate a dose-response curve with hippocampal and cortical infusions of lactacystin in mice and perform stereological counts of NeuN+ cells to determine the ~LD50 for neuron loss. We will then inject vehicle or various doses of NAC into lactacystin or vehicle-treated mice to see if NAC reduces lactacystin toxicity in vivo. We will also measure Hsp70 proteins, Nrf2/HSF1 activation, proteasome activity, and ubiquitinated proteins in vivo. These studies are expected to shed light on why NAC may be efficacious in the clinic and seed future grants to a) inhibit Hsp70 proteins in vivo, 2) administe ß-amyloid oligomers and α-synuclein fibrils to NAC-treated cells, 3) examine the impact of NAC in fibroblasts from PD and AD patients, and 4) mutate cysteine residues in HSF1 and Keap1 to alanine to see if NAC action is thereby abolished.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) has been used to ameliorate the symptoms of multiple neurological and psychiatric conditions. NAC is tolerable and inexpensive (9¢/capsule), helping to improve patient compliance and reduce health disparities. We recently discovered that NAC may elicit protection in a heat shock protein- dependent manner. Our goal is to examine this possibility in hippocampal and cortical neurons in vitro and in vivo and to identify whether it increases heat shock proteins through Nrf2 or HSF1 activation. Our studies may identify potential mechanisms underlying NAC-mediated effects in the clinic.            ",A novel mechanism of action for N-acetyl cysteine,8890994,R03NS088395,"['L-Isomer Alanine

"Targeting pERK1/2 in Human Mammary Cancer Stem Cells DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Breast cancer is a complex disease associated with specific morphological and clinical features. Significant health disparity and high mortality rate is reported in African American (AA) patients, who suffer from unique and highly aggressive breast tumors. AA triple negative (TN) breast cancer patients suffer worse outcomes to chemotherapy compared with Caucasian women. Aggressive TN breast tumors contain poorly differentiated cells and express embryonic stem cell specific gene sets. These poorly differentiated mammary cancer stem cells (MCSCs) are the most tumorigenic cell types that drive initiation and progression of breast cancers. RAS/Raf/ERK1/2 signaling cascade has been found to promote every aspect of breast tumor progression including aggressive behavior like high angiogenesis and motility. We hypothesize that ""Mammary cancer stem cells drive aggressive TN breast tumors in AA women through sustained ERK1/2 signaling."" We will test this hypothesis with the following Specific Aims: 1) Establish whether mammary cancer stem cells from AA TN breast tumors form aggressive xenografts in nude mice. 2) Examine whether sustained ERK1/2 increases aggressive behavior of mammary cancer stem cells enriched mammospheres from AA TN breast tumors. 3) Examine whether inhibition of ERK1/2 signaling is effective in attenuating aggressive properties of mammary cancer stem cells from AA TN breast tumors. Fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) will be used to enrich MCSCs (Lin-/CD44+/CD24- /ALDH1+) from TN AA and Caucasian breast tumors, which will injected into the nude mice to form xenotransplants. These xenografts will be used to compare tumor volume, expression of angiogenesis stimulating factors (VEGF, CD31, MMP9), and motility of cells (Boyden Chamber Assay) between the two groups. MCSCs will also be enriched as mammospheres and pERK1/2-mediated effect on cell motility and expression of angiogenesis stimulating factors will be analyzed. ERK1/2 signaling will be attenuated in MCSCs by Nup153 shRNA and its effect on tumor promoting behavior will be analyzed both in vitro and in vivo. Increased understanding of the critical role of ERK1/2 signaling in MCSCs from AA patients and may provide novel targets for therapeutic drug design. This project will test the effectiveness of phospho-ERK1/2 targeting in human mammary cancer stem cells isolated from African American and Caucasian patients.

"Bi-directional interactions with tumor microenvironment enhance BRCA1-IRIS overexpressing TNBC tumor cells aggressiveness ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Bi-directional interactions with tumor microenvironment enhance BRCA1-IRIS overexpressing TNBC tumor cells aggressiveness. TNBC is an aggressive breast cancer lacks ER/PR expression and Her2 amplification, therefore lacks targeted therapy. TNBC is over-represented in African American women, the majority live in Mississippi. TNBC is an aggressive rapidly advanced disease that metastasizes to lung, liver, and brain. BRCA1-IRIS is upregulated in the majority of TNBC. BRCA1-IRIS overexpression (hereafter IRISOE) promotes formation and metastasis of TNBC tumors, and its silencing prevents both. The objective of this study is to identify the molecular mechanism(s) responsible for enhanced metastasis by IRISOE. Our central hypothesis is that due to massive proliferation triggered by IRISOE, IRISOE tumors become avascular and necrotic in their cores. Hypoxia developed in areas surrounding these necrotic cores (we refer to this necrotic/hypoxic core as the aggressiveness niche) aggravates IRISOE tumor cells metastatic ability. Our data show that in the niche, hypoxia triggers IRISOE/TNBC tumor cells to secrete IL-6 and that induces IL-6R expression on MSCs. This signaling loop attracts MSCs to the vicinity of IRISOE/TNBC tumor cells and activates them to secrete PGE2. PGE2 binds to IRISOE/TNBC tumor cells through EP2/4 re-activates IRISOE/TNBC tumor cells to secrete other cytokines, e.g., GM-CSF and VEGF. GM-CSF is a potent recruiter of monocytes and VEGF of endothelial cells (EC). GM-CSF binding to CSF-2R on tumor associated macrophages (TAMs) and VEGF binding to VEGFR on ECs recruit them to the vicinity of IRISOE/TNBC tumor cells and activates them to secret factors, such as TGF-1ß from TAMs and IL8 from ECs. TGF-1ß binding to TßRI/II and IL8 to CXCR1/2 on IRISOE/TNBC tumor cells, in addition to PGE2/EP2/4 enhance IRISOE/TNBC cells aggressiveness and their dissemination and metastatic potential. In Specific Aim One, we will validate the bidirectional interactions between IRISOE/TNBC tumor cells and MSCs promoting IRISOE/TNBC tumor cells aggressiveness. In Specific Aim Two, we will validate the bidirectional interactions between IRISOE/TNBC tumor cells and M2- TAMs promoting IRISOE/TNBC tumor cells aggressiveness. Finally in Specific Aim Three, we will validate the bidirectional interactions between IRISOE/TNBC tumor cells and ECs role promoting IRISOE/TNBC tumor cells aggressiveness. The proposed studies are in line with the aims of the NIH of generating better understanding of the mechanisms that drive breast cancer progression and produce validated biomarkers for early detection and therapeutic targets. We believe our grant fulfills all these criteria and provide a compelling therapeutic rationale for th development of anti-BRCA1-IRIS drug to specifically target TNBC tumor cells in patients with high risk of recurrence and poor prognosis.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Most early breast tumors are estrogen receptor positive, sensitive to chemo- endocrine treatment. The majority of these tumors progress to a more aggressive tumors that are chemo- endocrine resistance, and often develop into distant metastases. Both resistance to anticancer drugs and poor prognosis may result from the presence of reactive stromal cells within these tumors that reciprocally interact with tumor cells and promote their progress to metastatic cells.

"Asymmetric Lymphocyte Division in the Immune Response     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): B lymphocytes and the antibodies they produce play a critical role in host defense. Cell fate diversification of activated lymphocytes is essential to achieve the regenerative state required for long-lived immunity. The mechanisms responsible for generating B cell fate diversity, however, are poorly understood. Substantial preliminary data suggest B cells can diversify the fates and functions of their daughter cells using an evolutionarily conserved strategy to allocate unequal amounts of key components. This project will test whether asymmetric cell division is a cardinal feature of the B cell- mediated immune response. The proposal develops novel methodologies to image the characteristics of dividing B cells during the course of an immune response. The aims of the project are to test the importance of unequal cellular inheritance of three different transcriptional regulators of B cells Bcl-6, Pax5, and T-bet, each of which is known to regulate critical cell fate decisions. The experiments will test the hypotheses that asymmetric division is iteratively used to meet the opposing demands of terminal differentiation and self-renewal, as well to refine and diversify the functional properties of antibodies by regulating germinal center entry and class switch choice. This project will also examine whether ancestral regulators of cell polarity are responsible for establishing asymmetric B cell division, and how asymmetrically inherited proteins could mediate fate disparity in daughter B cells. These studies should provide a framework for rational engineering of immune responses and vaccines against microbial agents. This project should also address fundamental uncertainties regarding the principle of clonal selection of lymphocytes in response to infectious diseases or during situations when our immune cells attack our own selves.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: B lymphocytes are specialized white blood cells that protect us against infection. These cells need to be able to replenish themselves for vaccines to work properly.

"MYCN-induced calcium and magnesium signaling regulates Neuroblastoma progression DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Neuroblastoma (NB) is an extra-cranial pediatric cancer. Amplification of the proto-oncogene MYCN is associated with advanced stage, high risk NB and poor prognosis. Novel drugs and alternative treatments are being investigated for patients with advanced NB with MYCN amplification. However, finding an effective treatment strategy for advanced stage NB remains elusive. In order to address this limitation, the proposed project examines the effects of calcium and magnesium signaling on cell migration and invasion in NB cells with different MYCN status. The preliminary data indicate that MYCN initiates a change in calcium signaling, accompanied by a change in the transcriptional regulation of calcium channels, namely Orai1, Orai3 and TRPM7. In addition, MYCN induces calcium-dependent NB cell migration. These observations support the hypothesis that MYCN alters calcium and magnesium homeostasis during cell migration and invasion through a mechanism that involves calcium-mediated regulation of integrin signaling and focal adhesion turnover, and calcium- and magnesium-permeable ion channels. The research plan has the following specific aims: (1) Examine the effect of MYCN on [Ca2+] and [Mg2+] homeostasis in NB cells. NB cells with different MYCN status will be cultured in external media with different extracellular [Ca2+]/[Mg2+] ratios. The intracellular calcium and magnesium will be measured, and migration and invasion rates will be determined in these cells. (2) Elucidate the mechanism by which MYCN regulation of calcium and magnesium promotes NB migration and invasion. The effect of calcium and magnesium on the expression and phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase and integrin, focal adhesion turnover rate (assembly, disassembly and recycling of focal adhesion proteins), and actin cytoskeletal re-organization will be examined in NB cells that are actively migrating. (3) Identify the molecular components regulating NB migration and invasion. The calcium- permeable ORAI channels and the calcium- and magnesium-permeable TRPM7 channel protein will be modulated pharmacologically or using molecular methods (RNAi or transient over-expression), and the effect of these changes on cell migration and invasion, focal adhesion turnover (assembly, disassembly, and recycling of focal adhesion proteins), and intracellular [Ca2+] will be determined in NB cells. This study may identify new biomarkers for advanced stage NB, and reveal novel targets for the development of more effective chemotherapeutic drugs. In addition, this study may lead to a new model of the regulation of NB progression, which includes monitoring the status of the prognostic marker MYCN as well as the dietary intake, metabolism and cellular regulation of calcium and magnesium. This new model may apply to other cancers with MYC amplification (e.g. breast and prostate cancers, and lymphoma, etc). Neuroblastoma (NB) is a pediatric tumor. Calcium and magnesium ions regulate cell migration and invasion. I propose to elucidate the mechanisms by which calcium and magnesium regulate these processes in NB cells. This study will improve our current knowledge of NB progression, and reveal more innovative treatment strategies for NB.",MYCN-induced calcium and magnesium signaling regulates Neuroblastoma progression,8911783,K01CA154758,"['Actins ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' Factor IV ', ' Coagulation Factor IV ', ' Ca++ element ', ' Blood Coagulation Factor IV ', ' Calcium ', ' Voltage-Dependent Calcium Channels ', ' VDCC ', ' Calcium Ion Channels ', ' Calcium Channel Blocker Receptors ', ' Calcium Channel Antagonist Receptor ', ' Calcium Channel ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Motility ', ' Cellular Motility ', ' Cellular Migration ', ' Cell Movement ', ' Cell Migration ', ' Cell Locomotion ', ' cell motility ', ' Cells ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Downregulation ', ' Down-Regulation (Physiology) ', ' Down-Regulation ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Gene Amplification ', ' natural gene amplification ', ' Goals ', ' Physiological Homeostasis ', ' Autoregulation ', ' Homeostasis ', ' Integrins Extracellular Matrix ', ' Integrins ', ' Membrane Channels ', ' Ionic Channels ', ' Ion Channel ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Literature ', ' Reticulolymphosarcoma ', ' Malignant Lymphoma ', "" Lymphoma (Hodgkin's and Non-Hodgkin's) "", ' Germinoblastoma ', ' Germinoblastic Sarcoma ', ' Lymphoma ', ' Mg element ', ' Magnesium ', ' Metabolic Processes ', ' Intermediary Metabolism ', ' Metabolism ', ' Methods ', ' Method LOINC Axis 6 ', ' Methodology ', ' Neuroblastoma (Schwannian Stroma-Poor) ', ' Neuroblastoma ', ' Patients ', ' Peer Review ', ' Protein Phosphorylation ', ' Phosphorylation ', ' Prognosis ', ' outcome forecast ', ' gene product ', ' Proteins ', ' protooncogene ', ' c-ONC ', ' Cellular Oncogene ', ' Proto-Oncogenes ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Publications ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Support ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Survival Rate ', ' Time ', ' pp125(FAK) ', ' p125FAK ', ' p125(FAK) ', ' focal adhesion-associated protein tyrosine kinase pp125FAK ', ' focal adhesion protein tyrosine kinase ', ' focal adhesion kinase ', ' endogenous substrate pp120 ', ' PTK2 Protein Tyrosine Kinase 2 ', ' Focal Adhesion Kinase 1 ', ' Measures ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' Mediating ', ' Treatment Failure ', ' neoplastic progression ', ' neoplasm progression ', ' cancer progression ', ' tumor progression ', ' improved ', ' Cranial ', ' Cephalic ', ' Malignant ', ' Malignant -

"Exosomes Promote Disease aggressiveness in African American Prostate Cancer ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Prostate cancer (PCA) exhibits the most striking racial disparity as African American men are at higher risk of being diagnosed and dying of PCA, in comparison with Caucasian men. Although, multiple factors including socio-economic status contribute to this disparity but it is essential to identify the molecular and underlying biological differences that contribute to the more aggressive phenotype in African American PCA. There have been several studies investigating the genetic and epigenetic differences between African American and Caucasian PCA; however in the past, limited attention has been given to the role of tumor microenvironment contributing towards disease aggressiveness in African American PCA. In this regard, our preliminary studies discovered a unique capability of African American PCA cells to survive under hypoxic (low oxygen condition) conditions dependent upon cellular RAB5A expression, the master regulator of exosomes biogenesis, as the survival of African American PCA cells was completely compromised in RAB5A knock-down condition. More importantly, compared to Caucasian PCA cells, African American PCA cells secreted significantly higher amount of exosomes under hypoxic conditions. Interestingly, African American PCA cells seem to better adapt to hypoxia through exporting metabolic product lactic acid packaged in exosomes. Recent studies have also provided ample evidence that lactic acid is used not only as a fuel for bioenergy and biosynthesis but lactic acid also activates several mitogenic signaling pathways in various tumor microenvironment cellular components including endothelial cells, fibroblasts, macrophages and PCA cells in the normoxic areas. Taken together, we hypothesize that ""African American PCA cells have the unique capability to survive hypoxia via RAB5A-mediated exosomes secretion loaded with lactic acid, and the secreted exosomes promote extensive tumor microenvironment remodeling and disease aggressiveness'. Following specific aims are proposed to test our hypothesis: (I) to characterize and establish RAB5A role in exosomes secretion and survival of African American PCA cells under hypoxia; and (II) to examine and establish the role of exosomes secreted by African American PCA cells in tumor microenvironment remodeling. Proposed studies will bring a paradigm shift in our approach to understand and treat PCA in African American men brining greater focus on tumor microenvironment both for prognosis as well as treatment purposes.

"Translating Transplant Practices for Sickle Cell Disease in the US and France: National Commitments, Institutional Regimens, Private Sentiments ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This pre-doctoral research examines how healthcare centers are making a risky, expensive, yet potentially curative procedure available to children affected by sickle cell disease (SCD), a disabling genetic disorder common to minority and immigrant populations in the United States and France. Although hematopoietic cell transplantation (also known as bone marrow, umbilical cord blood, and stem cell transplantation) has been available to children with SCD for nearly three decades in the US, only a few hundred cases have been documented in the medical literature. Remarkably, a disproportionate number of these cases have taken place in France. Given that private and state-funded insurers in the US universally cover hematopoietic cell transplantation for children with sickle cell disease (who are also federally mandated to receive access to healthcare) other factors need to be considered to explain this disparity, in addition to the question of healthcare cost and access. Using ethnographic methods, including participant observation, in-depth interviews, oral histories, and archival research, this proposal systematically considers the health policy, institutional, and interpersonal contexts that are producing transplant research design, clinical experience, and ethical practice at the level of the healthcare institution. Data collection is being carried out in local healthcare contexts in the US and France at sites that share leadership in SCD research and clinical care; serve vulnerable populations, including historically underserved minorities, immigrants, and children; and yet are experiencing divergence in their transplant practices. This study is an ecological examination of medical innovation and its translation to clinical practice and designed to identify potentially modifiable social and health system determinants and patient-centered outcomes to mitigate disparities when introducing novel treatment options. Building upon her clinical background and ongoing doctoral work in anthropology, the candidate proposes enhanced mentorship and training in hematology, social epidemiology, and mixed methods research to prepare her to become independent public health researcher and medical anthropologist with strengths in clinical investigation and interdisciplinary research in the care of SCD affected populations.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This pre-doctoral research aims to enhance public understandings of complex treatment options through the ethnographic study of hematopoietic cell transplantation in the care of children with sickle cell disease. This study will identify the biomedical, interpersonal, and institutional barriers and facilitators that contribute to whether ad how advanced medical technologies are made available and become utilized among historically underserved minorities and children. An underlying goal of this research is to identify modifiable social and health systems determinants to mitigate widening health disparities when introducing novel treatment options.

"Exosomes Promote Disease Aggressiveness in African American Prostate Cancer ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Prostate cancer (PCA) exhibits the most striking racial disparity as African American men are at higher risk of being diagnosed and dying of PCA, in comparison with Caucasian men. Although, multiple factors including socio-economic status contribute to this disparity but it is essential to identify the molecular and underlying biological differences that contribute to the more aggressive phenotype in African American PCA. There have been several studies investigating the genetic and epigenetic differences between African American and Caucasian PCA; however in the past, limited attention has been given to the role of tumor microenvironment contributing towards disease aggressiveness in African American PCA. In this regard, our preliminary studies discovered a unique capability of African American PCA cells to survive under hypoxic (low oxygen condition) conditions dependent upon cellular RAB5A expression, the master regulator of exosomes biogenesis, as the survival of African American PCA cells was completely compromised in RAB5A knock-down condition. More importantly, compared to Caucasian PCA cells, African American PCA cells secreted significantly higher amount of exosomes under hypoxic conditions. Interestingly, African American PCA cells seem to better adapt to hypoxia through exporting metabolic product lactic acid packaged in exosomes. Recent studies have also provided ample evidence that lactic acid is used not only as a fuel for bioenergy and biosynthesis but lactic acid also activates several mitogenic signaling pathways in various tumor microenvironment cellular components including endothelial cells, fibroblasts, macrophages and PCA cells in the normoxic areas. Taken together, we hypothesize that ""African American PCA cells have the unique capability to survive hypoxia via RAB5A-mediated exosomes secretion loaded with lactic acid, and the secreted exosomes promote extensive tumor microenvironment remodeling and disease aggressiveness'. Following specific aims are proposed to test our hypothesis: (I) to characterize and establish RAB5A role in exosomes secretion and survival of African American PCA cells under hypoxia; and (II) to examine and establish the role of exosomes secreted by African American PCA cells in tumor microenvironment remodeling. Proposed studies will bring a paradigm shift in our approach to understand and treat PCA in African American men brining greater focus on tumor microenvironment both for prognosis as well as treatment purposes. Overall, present proposal is highly significant and will help to narrow the huge health disparity gap faced by African American PCA patients, and reduce the PCA-caused mortality and morbidity in these patients.

"Social regulation of pro-inflammatory monocytes DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposed research seeks to determine how adverse social environments influence the risk of inflammation-related disease by up-regulating the expression of pro-inflammatory genes. These studies test the hypothesis that adverse social environments stimulate the hematopoietic production of immature pro-inflammatory monocytes (CD16- in humans, Ly-6c-high in mice) via threat-induced activation of beta-adrenergic receptors in bone marrow myelopoietic cells. Specific aims will: (Aim 1) Define the neural and endocrine pathways by which chronic threat up-regulates pro-inflammatory monocytes; (Aim 2) Define the specific beta-adrenergic receptors and target cell types mediating threat-induced expansion of pro- inflammatory monocytes; and (Aim 3) Define the myelopoietic molecules mediating beta-adrenergic expansion of pro-inflammatory monocytes (including GM-CSF, TGF-beta, and the CXCL12/CXCR4 chemokine signaling axis). When complete, these studies will provide an integrated mechanistic model of the neural / hematopoietic pathway by which chronic adversity can up-regulate inflammatory gene expression in circulating immune cells. The overarching goal of these studies is to develop a comprehensive theory that explains how common social risk factors can influence multiple inflammation-related diseases. In addition to clarifying the basic physiologic mechanisms involved in ""defensive programming"" of the immune system transcriptome, these studies will identify specific CNS mechanisms (e.g., Crf gene activation in central nucleus of the amygdala), pharmacologic intervention strategies (e.g., beta-2 and beta-3 adrenergic antagonists, and antagonists of GM-CSF, TGF-beta, and/or CXCR4), and mechanistic biomarkers (e.g., myelopoietic molecules and circulating monocyte phenotypes) that can be applied in future studies to clarify how stress-induced up- regulation of pro-inflammatory monocytes impacts specific inflammation-related diseases such as atherosclerosis, Type II diabetes, Alzheimer's disease, and cancer. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This research seeks to improve public health by clarifying the biological pathways through which adverse social environments such as social isolation or poverty influence the risk of inflammation-related diseases such as heart disease, Alzheimer's disease, and cancer. This research will establish new risk factors, neural mechanisms, pharmacologic intervention strategies, and cellular and molecular biomarkers of individual health status to help protect human health in the context of adverse social environments and thus reduce socially-related health disparities.",Social regulation of pro-inflammatory monocytes,8874818,R01AG043404,"['Adrenergics ', ' Adrenergic Drugs ', ' Adrenergic Agents ', ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Alzheimers Dementia ', "" Alzheimer's "", ' Alzheimer syndrome ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' amygdaloid nuclear complex ', ' Amygdaloid Nucleus ', ' Amygdaloid Body ', ' Amygdala ', ' Amygdaloid structure ', ' epidemiologic investigation ', ' Epidemiology Research ', ' Epidemiological Studies ', ' Epidemiologic Research ', ' Epidemiologic Studies ', ' Antiinflammatory Agents ', ' Antiinflammatories ', ' Anti-Inflammatories ', ' Anti-Inflammatory Agents ', ' atherosclerotic vascular disease ', ' atheromatosis ', ' Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease ', ' Atheroscleroses ', ' Atherosclerosis ', ' Bereavement ', ' vascular ', ' Blood Vessels ', ' Bone Marrow Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Bone Marrow ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Nucleus ', ' Cell Nucleus ', ' Cells ', ' type II DM ', ' type 2 DM ', ' maturity onset diabetes ', ' ketosis resistant diabetes ', ' adult onset diabetes ', ' Type II diabetes ', ' Type II Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Type 2 diabetes ', ' Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus ', ' T2DM ', ' T2D ', ' T2 DM ', ' Stable Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Slow-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Noninsulin Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Non-Insulin Dependent Diabetes ', ' NIDDM ', ' Maturity-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' MODY ', ' Ketosis-Resistant Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Adult-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Diagnosis ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Gene Activation ', ' Gene Expression ', ' gene therapy ', ' genetic therapy ', ' gene-based therapy ', ' Genetic Intervention ', ' Gene-Tx ', ' Gene Transfer Procedure ', ' Gene Transfer Clinical ', ' Gene Therapy Molecular Biology ', ' DNA Therapy ', ' Genes ', ' Therapeutic Glucocorticoid ', ' Glucocorticoids ', ' Goals ', ' Granulocytic cell ', ' Granular Leukocytes ', ' Blood granulocytic cell ', ' granulocyte ', ' Proteins Growth Factors ', ' Growth Substances ', ' Growth Agents ', ' GFAC ', ' Growth Factor ', ' Health ', ' Level of Health ', ' Health Status ', ' heart disorder ', ' Cardiac Disorders ', ' Cardiac Diseases ', ' Heart Diseases ', ' Hematopoietic Progenitor Cells ', ' Blood Precursor Cell ', ' Hematopoietic stem cells ', ' hereditary disorder ', ' genetic disorder ', ' Molecular Disease ', ' Genetic Diseases ', ' Genetic Condition ', ' Hereditary Disease ', ' Modern Man ', ' Man (Taxonomy) ', ' Human ', ' hypothalamic ', ' Hypothalamus ', ' Hypothalamic structure ', ' allergic/immunologic organ system ', ' allergic/immunologic body system ', ' Immune system ', ' Inflammation ', ' Literature ', ' macrophage ', ' Genetic Models ', ' Marrow monocyte ', ' Blood monocyte ', ' monocyte ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity -

"Hemoglobin Modifiers for Sickle Cell Disease Therapy DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our goal is to design and establish novel therapeutic agents for sickle cell disease (SCD), namely drugs that inhibit the initial sickle hemoglobin (HbS) polymerization and the subsequent pathophysiology. When deoxygenated, HbS polymerizes into long, rigid, and insoluble fibers causing red blood cells (RBCs) to sickle, a process worsened by the unusual low affinity of HbS for oxygen, resulting in premature release of oxygen. Based on several evidence--our preliminary data, studies by others, and the results of a recently completed phase I/II clinical testing of our lead compound, 5-HMF (an allosteric effector of Hb, AEH)-we hypothesize that AEHs, not only prevent HbS polymerization, but also mitigates several secondary sickling related pathological events that include inflammation, oxidative stress/damage, RBC hemolysis, and pain. We also have preliminary evidence that our next generation AEHs (INN- and TD-series) exhibit enhanced potency and improved in-vitro duration of action. These AEHs act via a novel mechanism of action, i.e., destabilize HbS polymer contacts, in addition to increasing Hb affinity for oxygen; providing positive synergistic effects. We propose to test our hypothesis by further investigating candidate drugs from the INN- and TD-series, as well as derivatives of 5-HMF and INN-312 for their pharmacologic properties, focusing on the secondary SCD pathways, as well as the underlying HbS polymerization problem using our model systems. The specific aims are: 1. Design and synthesis of novel allosteric effectors of hemoglobin (AEHs). We will modify our parent compounds and synthesize derivatives with enhanced efficacy and prolonged half-lives. We will also synthesize prod rugs to protect the active aldehyde functional moiety from aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH)- mediated metabolism as necessary. 2. Investigate in-vitro functional, ant sickling, and cytotoxicity activities of novel AEHs. We will investigate the AEHs for their in-vitro ant sickling/functional activities (RBC sickling tests, P50 analyses, HbS solubility, and Hb adduct formation), and carefully monitor for adverse effects. 3. Determine in-vivo/in-vitro PK/PD properties, binding and metabolism and evaluate preclinical efficacy of AEHs in SCD Berkeley mice. We will show that serum albumin binding and/or metabolism by ALDH in RBC or hepatic cytosol are not likely to adversely affect in-vivo pharmacologic activity. We will demonstrate using a Berkeley mouse model of SCD transgenic mice that AEHs show potent pharmacologic effects, increase short- and long-term survival rates of mice. We will also study their potential beneficial effects, e.g. amelioration of hemolysis, inflammation, endothelial damage, and overall reversal of the SCD pathophysiology observed in this model. 4. Determine the atomic interactions between AEHs and Hb. X-ray crystallography will be used to validate our hypothesis that AEH potency is directly dependent upon their abilities to bind Hb with their pyridyl substituents toward the surface of the Hb molecule. The structures would provide valuable insight to help guide rational modifications for better pharmacologic properties. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Sickle cell disease (SCD) is the most common inherited hematologic disorder, affecting over 80,000 people, primarily African-American in the US, exacerbating the disproportionate health disparity among this minority population. Most common therapeutic intervention includes blood transfusions and hydroxyurea therapies, however, these therapies are associated with some undesirable side effects and not all patients benefit from the treatment. Thus, there is still a need to develop new, more effective and non-toxic therapeutic agents against this debilitating disease.",Hemoglobin Modifiers for Sickle Cell Disease Therapy,8890882,R01MD009124,"['Sickle Cell ', ' Blood flow ', ' insight ', ' Oxidative Stress ', ' Disease Progression ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Physiopathology ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Therapeutic Agents ', ' polymerization ', ' Hereditary ', ' Inherited ', ' Event ', ' Oral ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' adduct ', ' Lytotoxicity ', ' cytotoxicity ', ' experience ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' ALDH ', ' aldehyde dehydrogenases ', ' intervention therapy ', ' Therapeutic Intervention ', ' Modeling ', ' LOINC Axis 2 Property ', ' Property ', ' Adverse Experience ', ' Adverse event ', ' treatment adverse effect ', ' therapy adverse effect ', ' side effect ', ' Treatment Side Effects ', ' Adverse effects ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' Binding ', ' Binding (Molecular Function) ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Hydration ', ' Hydration status ', ' p50 ', ' Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor Superfamily Member 5 Gene ', ' TNFRSF5 ', ' MGC9013 ', ' CDW40 ', ' CD40 ', ' Bp50 ', ' TNFRSF5 gene ', ' Dose ', ' Affinity ', ' Data ', ' Disease Pathway ', ' in vivo ', ' clinical test ', ' Clinical Testing ', ' Clinical Evaluation ', ' research clinical testing ', ' Monitor ', ' cell morphology ', ' Cellular Morphology ', ' Process ', ' Modification ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' insoluble fiber ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' next generation ', ' Minority ', ' sickling ', ' Population ', ' next generation therapeutics ', ' new therapeutics ', ' novel therapeutics ', ' mouse model ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' preclinical efficacy ', ' drug candidate ', ' Regimen ', ' Affect ', ' Aldehydes ', ' sicklemia ', ' sickle disease ', ' sickle cell disease ', ' Hemoglobin sickle cell disorder ', ' Hemoglobin sickle cell disease ', ' Hemoglobin S Disease ', ' HbSS disease ', ' Hb SS disease ', ' Sickle Cell Anemia ', ' Antisickling Drugs ', ' Antisickling Agents ', ' Ants ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Physiologic Availability ', ' Biologic Availability ', ' Bioavailability ', ' Biological Availability ', ' Blood Transfusion ', ' Cellular Adhesion ', ' Cell Adhesion ', ' Cells ', ' Cytosol ', ' body water dehydration ', ' Dehydration ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Endothelium ', ' blood corpuscles ', ' Red blood corpuscule ', ' Red Cell ', ' Red Blood Cells ', ' Marrow erythrocyte ', ' Erythrocytic ', ' Erythrocytes Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Blood normocyte ', ' Blood erythrocyte ', ' Erythrocytes ', ' Exhibits ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Hemoglobin S ', ' Sickle Hemoglobin ', ' Hemoglobin ', ' Hemolysis ', ' Modern Man ', ' Man (Taxonomy) ', ' Human ', ' hydroxy-urea ', ' Hydroxycarbamide ', ' Hydroxycarbamid ', ' hydroxyurea ', ' In Vitro ', ' Inflammation ', ' Kinetics ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Metabolic Processes ', ' Intermediary Metabolism ', ' Metabolism ', ' Methods ', ' Method LOINC Axis 6 ', ' Methodology ', ' Transgenic Mice ', ' Model System ', ' Biologic Models ', ' Biological Models ', ' Murine ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Mice ', ' Mus ', ' O2 element ', ' O element ', ' Oxygen ', ' Painful ', ' Pain ', ' Parents ', ' Patients ', ' well-being ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' Polymers ', ' Pro-Drugs ', ' Drug Precursors ', ' Prodrugs ', ' Rats Mammals ', ' Rat ', ' Common Rat Strains ', ' Rattus ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Serum Albumin ', ' Solubility ', ' Survival Rate ', ' Testing ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Tissues ', ' Toxicology ', ' vanillaldehyde ', ' 4-hydroxy-3-methoxybenzaldehyde ', ' vanillin ', ' Generations ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Mediating ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Hepatic ', ' Surface ', ' Acute ', ' prematurity ', ' premature ', ' Phase ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Biological ', ' Series ', ' Xray Crystallography ', ' X-Ray/Neutron Crystallography ', ' X-Ray Diffraction Crystallography ', ' X Ray Crystallographies ', ' Single Crystal Diffraction ', ' X-Ray Crystallography ', ' sickle red blood cell ', ' sickle erythrocyte ', ' sickle RBC ', ' drepanocyte ', ' ']",NIMHD,VIRGINIA COMMONWEALTH UNIVERSITY,R01,2015,395869,0.08070170044325091
"Calcium Channels, Calmodulin and Nuclear CREB Signaling ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Excitation-transcription (E-T) coupling is a process that converts the electrical or chemical activation of a cell to a signal conveyed to the nucleus. n this way, the expression of genes can be modulated in an activity-dependent manner. The neuronal remodeling that results is recognized to be necessary and important for long-term adaptive changes during neuronal development, learning and memory and drug addiction. The most scrutinized example of E-T coupling is Ca2+ signaling to the transcription factor CREB (cAMP response element-binding) protein via phosphorylation at Ser133. As an important source of Ca2+ influx, voltage-gated Ca2+ channels have been well studied for their biophysical and biochemical properties. Interestingly, in E-T coupling it seems that Ca2+ influxes through different Ca2+ channels can engage different signaling pathways to the nucleus. For example, CaV1 (also called L-type) channels enjoy a big advantage over CaV2 channels, even though CaV1 channels contribute only a minority of the overall Ca2+ entry in neurons. Our recent Cell paper uncovered that this disparity in potency can be explained by differences in how the two classes of Ca2+ channels employ local and global Ca2+ signaling. However, the 'private line' for the nanodomain advantage of CaV1 channels is unclear. Now we are poised to provide a detailed characterization of the critical question: what carries the long-distance signal from CaV1-anchored signaling complex to the nucleus? We have an answer: Ca2+/CaM translocation to the nucleus depends on a co-transporter that we now identify as γCaMKII. This shuttle gathers cytoplasmic Ca2+/CaM, sequestering it at the CaV1 channel before traveling to the nucleus under control of a nuclear localization signal. This signaling mechanism relies on γCaMKII, βCaMKII and CaN, signaling molecules that operate in the CaV1 nanodomain and also have been implicated in multiple neuropsychiatric diseases. This proposal focuses on understanding the cellular machinery of γCaMKII/CaM translocation and three specific aims are proposed. (1) Define the dynamics of Ca2+ signaling mechanisms that link CaV1 activity to nuclear CREB phosphorylation and CRE-dependent transcription. We will track γCaMKII translocation in real time and assess the impact of Ca2+/CaM delivered to the nucleus via this shuttle mechanism. (2) We will manipulate the γCaMKII pathway using genetic constructs in order to nail down the molecular components required for CREB phosphorylation. We will alter binding interactions and enzymatic actions involving CaM, βCaMKII, CaN, and PP2A at critical steps along the pathway. (3) Understand CaV1-dependent CaM shuttling in neocortical neurons and define distinct roles of nanodomain Ca2+ signaling and voltage gated conformational signaling for E-T coupling. Gaining a clearer picture of the linkage between CaV1 channels and CREB signaling will have a favorable impact on understanding how changes in gene expression alter the function of neurons in neural networks. Thus, the research is relevant both to basic cell biology and to disease states as diverse as addiction, autism and other neuropsychiatric diseases.     PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The ability to regulate gene expression in response to stimuli from the outside world is critical for the function of nearly all cell types in the body and plays  crucial role in regulating the function of neurons and their assembly into functional networks. This project studies the process by which excitation of neurons by membrane depolarization couples via opening of specific types of calcium channel and activation of cell signaling machinery to transcription of genes in the cell nucleus. Research on basic excitable cell biology will advance our understanding of how cells remodel themselves in health and in diseases such as addiction and autism.        ","Calcium Channels, Calmodulin and Nuclear CREB Signaling",8864898,R01DA040484,"['Action Potentials ', "" Kanner's Syndrome "", ' Infantile Autism ', ' Early Infantile Autism ', ' Autism ', ' Autistic Disorder ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Brain ', ' Voltage-Dependent Calcium Channels ', ' VDCC ', ' Calcium Ion Channels ', ' Calcium Channel Blocker Receptors ', ' Calcium Channel Antagonist Receptor ', ' Calcium Channel ', ' Phosphodiesterase Protein Activator ', ' Phosphodiesterase Activating Factor ', ' Calcium-Dependent Regulator ', ' Calcium-Dependent Activator Protein ', ' Calmodulin ', ' Nucleus ', ' Cell Nucleus ', ' Cells ', ' Complexons ', ' Chelators ', ' Chelating Agents ', ' Communication ', ' Couples ', ' Cytoplasm ', ' Diffusion ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', "" Glycoletherdiamine-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic Acid "", ' GEDTA ', ' Ethylenebis(oxyethylenenitrile)tetraacetic Acid ', ' Ethylene Glycol Tetraacetic Acid ', ' Ethylene Glycol Bis(2-aminoethyl ether)tetraacetic Acid ', ' EGTA ', ' EGATA ', ' 6,9-Dioxa-3,12-diazatetradecanedioic acid, 3,12-bis(carboxymethyl)- ', ' Egtazic Acid ', ' Enzymes ', ' Family ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Goals ', ' disabled people ', ' disabled ', ' Persons with Disabilities ', ' People with Disabilities ', ' Handicapped ', ' Disabled Population ', ' Disabled Persons ', ' Health ', ' Learning ', ' Ligands ', ' Lions ', ' Panthera leo ', ' Memory ', ' body movement ', ' Movement ', ' Nails ', ' Nail plate ', ' neuronal ', ' Neurocyte ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Neurons ', ' Paper ', ' Protein Phosphorylation ', ' Phosphorylation ', ' Transphosphorylases ', ' Kinases ', ' EC 2.7 ', ' Phosphotransferases ', ' Play ', ' Research ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' L-Serine ', ' Serine ', ' Signal Pathway ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Tissues ', ' transcription factor ', ' Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' Travel ', ' visual function ', ' Sight ', ' Vision ', ' Work ', ' cAMP Responsive Element Binding Protein ', ' cAMP Response Element-Binding Protein ', ' Cyclic AMP Responsive Element Binding Protein ', ' Cyclic AMP Response Element-Binding Protein ', ' CREB Protein ', ' CRE Binding Protein ', ' Cyclic AMP-Responsive DNA-Binding Protein ', ' Fusion Protein ', ' Chimera Protein ', ' Chimeric Proteins ', ' base ', ' Label ', ' Peripheral ', ' Surface ', ' Biochemical ', ' Link ', ' Chemicals ', ' Mouth ', ' Cavitas Oris ', ' Buccal Cavity Head and Neck ', ' Buccal Cavity ', ' Oral cavity ', ' Stimulus ', ' Funding ', ' calcium-dependent CaM kinase II ', ' CaMKII ', ' CaM kinase II ', ' CaM PK II ', ' CaM KII ', ' calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II ', ' Protein Phosphatase 2A Regulatory Subunit B Prime ', ' Phosphotyrosyl Phosphatase Activator ', ' PP2A Subunit B Prime ', ' PP2A ', ' Protein Phosphatase 2A Regulatory Subunit PR53 ', ' Genetic ', ' cell biology ', ' Cellular biology ', ' Frequency ', ' Frequencies (time pattern) ', ' Complex ', ' Event ', ' Radius ', ' Radial ', ' Source ', ' cell type ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' Nuclear ', ' Nuclear Localization Signal Peptide ', ' NLS Peptide ', ' Nuclear Localization Signal ', ' membrane structure ', ' Membrane ', ' Molecular Dynamics Simulation ', ' molecular dynamics ', ' mutant ', ' V (voltage) ', ' voltage ', ' symporter (molecular) ', ' Co-Transporters ', ' symporter ', ' neural network ', ' Biological Neural Networks ', ' novel ', ' member ', ' neuropsychiatric ', ' neuropsychiatry ', ' LOINC Axis 2 Property ', ' Property ', ' response ', ' Dephosphorylation ', ' Protein Dephosphorylation ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' Binding ', ' Binding (Molecular Function) ', ' protein expression ', ' Address ', ' Drug Dependency ', ' Drug Dependence ', ' Chemical Dependence ', ' Drug Addiction ', ' cAMP Response Element ', ' Cyclic AMP Response Element ', ' DNA Sequence Alteration ', ' Sum ', ' Scheme ', ' Signaling Molecule ', ' Molecular ', ' Process ', ' Modification ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' neuronal development ', ' neuron development ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' excitatory neuron ', ' Minority ', ' Coupling ', ' resistant ', ' Resistance ', ' short hairpin RNA ', ' shRNA ', ' small hairpin RNA ', ' neocortical ', ' addictive disorder ', ' addiction ', ' public health relevance ', ' Secure ', ' operation ', ' ']",NIDA,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,R01,2015,402563,0.15926729443949508
"Multi-Tensor Decompositions for Personalized Cancer Diagnostics and Prognostics ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Recurring DNA copy-number alterations (CNAs) have been recognized as a hallmark of cancer for >100 years, yet what these alterations imply about a tumor's pathogenesis and a patient's diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment remains poorly understood. This is despite the growing number of large-scale multidimensional datasets recording different aspects of a single disease, e.g., in the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), and due to a fundamental need for mathematical frameworks that can create one coherent model from such multiple datasets arranged in multiple tensors of matched columns, e.g., patients, platforms, and tissues, but independent rows, e.g., probes.  For example, our recent comparative modeling (by using a data-driven two-matrix spectral decomposition) of patient-matched glioblastoma (GBM) brain tumor and normal blood genomic profiles from TCGA (arranged in two matrices, of matched columns but independent rows) uncovered a previously unknown global pattern of tumor-exclusive CNAs that is correlated with, and possibly causally related to, GBM survival and response to chemotherapy. The data had been publicly available since 2008, but this signature remained unknown until we applied our comparative modeling in 2012. Survival analyses showed, and computationally validated, that the signature performs better than, and is statistically independent of, age, the best indicator of GBM survival for >50 years, and existing GBM pathology laboratory tests. A new test for GBM based upon this signature is pending an experimental re-validation at the Associated Regional and University Pathologists (ARUP) Laboratories, Inc., a nonprofit reference laboratory of the Department of Pathology at the University of Utah.  In this NCI U01 project, our multidisciplinary team of researchers from the Departments of Bioengineering, Mathematics, and Pathology, the Scientific Computing and Imaging (SCI) Institute, and the Huntsman Cancer Institute (HCI) at the University of Utah, aims to (i) define, and study the properties of data- driven multi-tensor spectral decompositions; (ii) use these to model patient-, platform-, and tissue-matched but probe-independent TCGA genomic profiles, and gain biological and medical insights into the genotype- phenotype relations in lower-grade astrocytoma (LGA) brain cancer, ovarian serous cystadenocarcinoma (OV), and lung squamous cell carcinoma; and (iii) enable translation of these insights into pathology laboratory tests, by experimentally testing the computational predictions of the existing GBM model, as well as the novel LGA and OV models by using Utah samples.  Ultimately, this project will bring physicians a step closer to one day being able to predict and control the progression of cell division and cancer as readily as NASA engineers plot the trajectories of spacecraft today.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:    Recurring DNA copy-number alterations have been recognized as a hallmark of cancer for >100 years, yet what these alterations imply about a tumor's pathogenesis and a patient's diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment remains poorly understood.

"Estrogen-ERbeta Axis In Disparity of Prostate Cancer DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): African Americans (AA) with prostate cancer (PC) have twice the incidence and mortality than European Americans (EA) and any other ethnic groups, however, the mechanism/s linked to this health disparity is not understood. The uncontrolled androgen receptor (AR) signaling in PC cells increases tumor development which is controlled by androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) in patients. However, ADT selects for androgen- independence and recurrence of aggressive tumors in AA-men. Notably, AA-men with PC have significantly higher circulating estrogens than EA-men. Since adipose tissue is the major source of estrogens in men and since PC risk increases with age and obesity, there appears to be a crucial link between adiposity and estrogenic signaling in PC progression. Indeed, estrogenic signaling via the estrogen receptor-beta (ERP) is implicated in aggressive tumor growth and metastasis. Our combined suppressive subtractive hybridization (SSH) analysis and race-based cDNA microarrays, showed a selective up-regulation of both the ERa co- repressor, SAFB2 and the ERf3 isoform, in freshly microdissected PC specimen. In the AA-derived PC cell line MDA-PCa-2b, activation of estrogen-ERP signaling axis conferred AR transactivation and proliferative responses in PC cells, even in the absence of androgen. Furthermore, adipose stem cells (ADMSCs) from AA-men secreted estrogens in response to tumor-derived factors and increased PC cell growth both in vitro and in vivo. We therefore hypothesize that activation ofAR signaling by estrogen-ERP axis is pivotal to the progression of PC in AA-men despite androgen ablation therapy. Our hypothesis will be tested by the following specific aims: (1) to evaluate the clinical utility of SAFB2 and ERb expression levels as biomarkers and/or prognostic indicators of aggressive PC in African Americans. (2) To determine if the estrogen-ERp axis augments AR-mediated growth and metastasis in SAFB2-expressing PC cells in vitro. (3) To investigate in vitro whether local estrogen production by ADMSCs from AA-men contributes to ERp-dependent enhanced growth and metastasis of PC cells under ADC in vitro, and (4) To demonstrate that ERp activation by systemic and/or ADMSC-derived estrogens increases growth of PC tumors under ADC in vivo. RELEVANCE (See Instructions): The discovery of alternate signaling pathways that may lead to androgen resistance and aggressive PC growth in AA-men, would be of crucial importance. A crucial role of estrogen-ERP signaling axis in PC progression and the contribution of adipose stem cell derived estrogens on growth and metastasis of PC cells, will provide new clues for understanding the disproportionate incidence and mortality due to PC in African American natients and will rifilineate novel theraneutic strategies that can be easily implemented.",Estrogen-ERbeta Axis In Disparity of Prostate Cancer,8914520,U01CA149204,"['yellow adipose tissue ', ' white adipose tissue ', ' adipose ', ' Fatty Tissue ', ' Adipose tissue ', ' Age ', ' Therapeutic Androgen ', ' Androgenic Compounds ', ' Androgenic Agents ', ' Androgens ', ' Cells ', ' Charcoal ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Enzymes ', ' Therapeutic Estrogen ', ' Estrogenic Compounds ', ' Estrogenic Agents ', ' Estrogens ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Genes ', ' Gonads ', ' Gonadal structure ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Growth ', ' Therapeutic Hormone ', ' Endocrine Gland Secretion ', ' Chemotherapy-Hormones/Steroids ', ' Hormones ', ' In Vitro ', ' Incidence ', ' Injections ', ' Injection of therapeutic agent ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Athymic Nude Mouse ', ' Athymic Mice ', ' Nude Mice ', ' Mortality ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' tumor cell metastasis ', ' cancer metastasis ', ' Tumor Cell Migration ', ' Secondary Tumor ', ' Secondary Neoplasm ', ' Metastatic Tumor ', ' Metastatic Neoplasm ', ' Metastasize ', ' Metastasis ', ' Neoplasm Metastasis ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Obesity ', ' Patients ', ' Play ', ' Production ', ' Prostatic Neoplasia ', ' Prostate Tumor ', ' Prostate Neoplasms ', ' Prostatic Neoplasms ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Androgen Receptor ', ' recruit ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' Recurrent ', ' Recurrence ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Signal Pathway ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Progenitor Cells ', ' Stem cells ', ' Testing ', ' Trans-Testosterone ', ' Therapeutic Testosterone ', ' Testosterone ', ' Transactivation ', ' Trans-Activation (Genetics) ', ' Upregulation ', ' Up-Regulation ', ' Up-Regulation (Physiology) ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' Mediating ', ' Conditioned Medium ', ' Conditioned Culture Media ', ' base ', ' neoplastic progression ', ' neoplasm progression ', ' cancer progression ', ' tumor progression ', ' Clinical ', ' Link ', ' European ', ' Disease Progression ', ' Therapeutic ', ' scaffolding ', ' scaffold ', ' Nature ', ' Research Specimen ', ' Specimen ', ' Prostatic Cancer ', ' Prostate Cancer ', ' Prostate CA ', ' Malignant prostatic tumor ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Prostate ', ' Malignant neoplasm of prostate ', ' Source ', ' Estrogen Receptor β ', ' ERβ ', ' ERbeta ', ' Estrogen Receptor beta ', ' interest ', ' Ablation ', ' American ', ' cancer risk ', ' Isoforms ', ' Protein Isoforms ', ' tumor growth ', ' expression vector ', ' cohort ', ' novel ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' research study ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' deprivation ', ' cDNA Microarray ', ' cDNA Arrays ', ' siRNA ', ' Small Interfering RNA ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Mesenchymal Progenitor Cell ', ' Mesenchymal Stem Cells ', ' Preventive ', ' Ectopic Expression ', ' prognostic indicator ', ' prognostic biomarker ', ' Prognosis Marker ', ' Molecular Marker of Prognosis ', ' Prognostic Marker ', ' Receptor Signaling ', ' in vivo ', ' Cancer Cell Growth ', ' Cancer Patient ', ' Clonal Expansion ', ' Tissue Chip ', ' Tissue Arrays ', ' Tissue Microarray ', ' Tumor-Derived ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Instruction ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' resistant ', ' Resistance ', ' short hairpin RNA ', ' shRNA ', ' small hairpin RNA ', ' therapeutic target ', ' tumor ', ' overexpress ', ' overexpression ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' adverse consequence ', ' adverse outcome ', ' prostate cancer cell ', ' ']",NCI,TULANE UNIVERSITY OF LOUISIANA,U01,2015,279828,0.07549469751343538
"Gender Disparity in Bladder Cancer and Chemopreventive Intervention DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Bladder cancer (BC) is the 4th most common cancer in men, but BC incidence is nearly 4 fold higher in men than in women across race; the underlying cause is not understood. Lack of such knowledge impedes progress in BC prevention. On the basis of our published and unpublished data, we hypothesize that hepatic UDP-glucuronosyltransferase 1A3 (UGT1A3) is a key determinant of the gender disparity in human BC development through converting androgen signal to increased urinary delivery of arylamine carcinogens to bladder tissue. Arylamines, 4-aminobiphenyl (ABP) in particular, are the main cause of human BC. We also hypothesize that sulforaphane (SF), a common dietary phytochemical, can block UGT1A3 from promoting arylamine-induced bladder carcinogenesis by boosting cytoprotective defense in the bladder. These hypotheses will be examined in four specific aims using complementary approaches of cultured cells and transgenic mouse models. Aim 1 is to test our hypothesis that liver UGT1A3 is a key molecule that determines the gender disparity in BC development. Wild-type mice and UGT1A3 transgenic mice (liver- specific and androgen-independent expression) will be compared for ABP-induced bladder carcinogenesis. Comparison will also be made between mice with and without castration. Another carcinogen 2- acetylaminofluorene (2-AAF) will be used to rule out ABP-specific effects. Aim 2 is to assess the impact of UGT1A3 polymorphism on its catalytic activity toward ABP and 2-AAF and on the susceptibility of bladder cells and liver cells to DNA damage induced by ABP and 2-AAF. Six single nucleotide polymorphisms occur in UGT1A3 gene. All the polymorphic variants together with the wild-type gene will be evaluated. Aim 3 is to test our hypothesis that SF can block UGT1A3 from promoting bladder carcinogenesis by stimulating cytoprotective defense against arylamine carcinogens (ABP and 2-AAF) in the bladder, without modulating UGT1A3 in the liver. Non-interference of liver UGT1A3 may be desirable, since this enzyme may be physiologically important, such as metabolizing estrone. SF is a promising cancer-preventive agent and is selectively delivered to bladder tissue through urinary excretion. Two animal models will be used to test the hypothesis, including the UGT1A3 mouse model described above and the Tg-UGT1 mouse model (mice carry both the coding and the regulatory sequences of the human UGT1A3 gene). Aim 4 is to confirm that UGT1A3 is transcriptionally stimulated by androgen in vivo and to elucidate the molecular mechanism by which androgen stimulates UGT1A3. This will be accomplished by using both cell models and the Tg-UGT1 mouse model. Impact: The proposed studies are expected to lead to the elucidation of the molecular basis of the gender disparity in BC and the development of new strategy for effective prevention of this disease. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: It has been known for several decades that the incidence of bladder cancer is nearly 4 fold higher in men than in women across race, but the reason has remained poorly understood. Lack of such knowledge impedes progress in bladder cancer prevention, and no chemopreventive agent is currently available for prevention of bladder cancer. This application will examine the hypothesis that UGT1A3 is a key determinant of gender disparity in human bladder cancer development and also examine the hypothesis that sulforaphane, a common dietary phytochemical, can block the bladder cancer-promoting activity of UGT1A3 and inhibit bladder cancer development, and the project is expected to significantly advance the knowledge about bladder cancer and to lead to development of a new strategy for effective prevention of this disease.",Gender Disparity in Bladder Cancer and Chemopreventive Intervention,8786872,R01CA164574,"['Woman

"CTC Screening Assay to Address Health Disparities in Women with Ovarian Cancer ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Epithelial Ovarian Cancer (EOC) is the 5th leading cause of cancer-related deaths among women in the US and is the leading gynecological cancer killer with ~22,000 cases reported in 2014. EOC has been called a ""silent killer"" because most women (>70%) are diagnosed at late stages of disease due to a lack of clinically sensitive and specific screening test and a lack of symptoms until late stage disease onset. While the incidence rate of EOC in the US is highest among white females, there exists a dramatic disparity in post-diagnosis outcomes in other populations with African-American women exhibiting substantially greater mortality based on 5-year survival rates. A combination of insufficient early detection strategies as well as reduced access to surgical treatment (required at later stages of disease) appears to contribute to the disparity. Improved access to advanced screening assays, and thereby earlier detection, is therefore urgently needed to improve outcomes, particularly in disparately effected populations. Analysis of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) from cancer patients' blood have demonstrated prognostic value in metastatic cancers (1) (1)(1)but the use of CTCs for diagnosing early stage disease requires a degree of sensitivity and specificity currently unavailable in existing CTC analysis technologies. An innovative CTC detection technology will emanate from this SBIR research project that will have unique capabilities suited to the early detection of EOC and potentially other cancers as well. The technology uses low-cost, disposable, plastic CTC fluidic cartridge that possess the ability to select CTCs directly from whole blood with extremely high recoveries (>90%), unprecedented purities (>85%) and can enumerate the captured CTCs using a label-less approach with a simple single-cell transducer (micro-CTC Coulter Counter, µC3). The technology provides a simple workflow with full process automation, ideal for a screening test that can be utilized within resource-limited settings. The technology will process whole blood directly (~2 mL input) and affinity select the CTCs, release the CTCs from the capture surface and count them using an on-chip µC3. Unique to our platform is the ability to select different CTCs subpopulations from a single sample. BioFluidica has tested its capture system using a novel CTC-isolation antigen, which, as the preliminary data indicates, is more prevalent in early stage disease compared to the more commonly used selection target, epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM). The ability to capture multiple stage-specific CTC subpopulations has the potential to diagnose patients at early stages of disease as well as assess treatment efficacy and the potential for disease recurrence. The goal of this proposal is to initiate the development of a powerful EOC screening test, accelerating treatment and improving currently poor prognoses, especially in disparately affected African-American women. Successful completion of this Phase I program will provide the impetus to move the technology into early detection scenarios for other cancers that show disparities, such as breast cancer in African-American women.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) exhibits the 5th highest mortality rate amongst women in the US. While its incidence rate is higher among white women, epidemiological data reports a significant reduction in the 5-year survival rates for African-American women. While new screening assays are broadly required to detect early stage disease, an automated, cost-effective and accurate test has the best chance of improving the disparate mortality rates in various populations. This project is focused on developing a transformative technology that can serve as a screening test which isolates circulating tumor cells (CTCs) from blood samples to diagnose early stage EOC appropriate for ethnic groups with EOC health disparities.            ",CTC Screening Assay to Address Health Disparities in Women with Ovarian Cancer,9000971,R43EB021212,"['Affect ', ' Antibodies ', ' immunogen ', ' ATGN ', ' Antigens ', ' Automation ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Blood ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' cell adhesion protein ', ' Adhesion Molecule ', ' Cell Adhesion Molecules ', ' cell sorting ', ' Cell Separation Technology ', ' Cell Segregation ', ' Cell Isolation ', ' Cell Separation ', ' Cells ', ' Cytokeratin ', ' Data Reporting ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Diagnosis ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Electrodes ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' Epithelial Cells ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Exhibits ', ' Female ', ' Goals ', ' orthopedic freezing ', ' Immobilization ', ' Incidence ', ' instrumentation ', ' white blood corpuscle ', ' white blood cell ', ' White Cell ', ' White Blood Cells ', ' Marrow leukocyte ', ' Leukocytes Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Blood leukocyte ', ' Leukocytes ', ' Methods ', ' Mortality ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' circulating tumor cell ', ' circulating neoplastic cell ', ' Neoplasm Circulating Cells ', ' optical ', ' Optics ', ' Patients ', ' Peptides ', ' Plastics ', ' Printing ', ' Prognosis ', ' outcome forecast ', ' Recurrent ', ' Recurrence ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' school of medicine ', ' medical college ', ' medical schools ', ' Sensitivity and Specificity ', ' Survival Rate ', ' Technology ', ' Temperature ', ' Testing ', ' Transducers ', ' Woman ', ' immunophenotype ', ' Immunologic Subtyping ', ' Immunophenotyping ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' case report ', ' Case Study ', ' TimeLine ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' Blood Sample ', ' Blood specimen ', ' Label ', ' improved ', ' Peripheral ', ' Surface ', ' Phase ', ' Biochemical ', ' Epithelial ', ' peripheral blood ', ' Recovery ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' disorder onset ', ' disease onset ', ' Onset of illness ', ' Collaborations ', ' Staging ', ' Metastatic Malignant Neoplasm ', ' Metastatic Cancer ', ' Disseminated Malignant Neoplasm ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Filamentous Fungi ', ' Molds ', ' Whole Blood ', ' programs ', ' Techniques ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' surgery ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' innovative technologies ', ' early detection ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' experience ', ' Coulter counter ', ' Epithelial ovarian cancer ', ' novel ', ' novel technologies ', ' new technology ', ' Modality ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Female Reproductive System ', ' Malignant Gynecologic Tumor ', ' Malignant Gynecologic Neoplasm ', ' Gynecological Cancer ', ' Gynecologic Cancer ', ' Female Reproductive Cancer ', ' Malignant Female Reproductive System Neoplasm ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' ovarian cancer ', ' Ovary Cancer ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Ovary ', ' Malignant Ovarian Tumor ', ' Malignant Ovarian Neoplasm ', ' Malignant neoplasm of ovary ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Microfluidic ', ' Microfluidics ', ' T200 ', ' PTPRC ', ' LY5 ', ' GP180 ', ' CD45 ', ' B220 ', ' PTPRC gene ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Affinity ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Improve Access ', ' Cancer Cause ', ' Cancer Etiology ', ' Cancer Patient ', ' Small Business Innovation Research ', ' SBIRS (R43/44) ', ' SBIR ', ' Small Business Innovation Research Grant ', ' Validation ', ' Genetically Engineered Mouse ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' cost ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' therapy efficacy ', ' therapeutically effective ', ' therapeutic efficacy ', ' intervention efficacy ', ' Treatment Efficacy ', ' Outcome ', ' cost-effective ', ' cost effective ', ' Population ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' cancer disparity ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' chemotherapy ', ' mouse model ', ' tumor ', ' public health relevance ', ' standard of care ', ' treatment response ', ' screening ', ' ']",NIBIB,"BIOFLUIDICA, INC",R43,2015,186774,0.0182784320057352
"Strategies for Personalized Gene Repair using I22I Severe Hemophilia-A as a Model ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Major benefits to hemophilia patients of endogenous expression of coagulation factors include the avoidance of potentially crippling joint bleeds and, importantly, induction of immunological tolerance for hemophilia patients who develop antibodies against replacement coagulation factors. About 20% of all individuals with hemophilia (HA) develop antibodies against Factor VIII (FVIII); but almost half of African American HA patients experience this very deleterious complication. Patients with anti-FVIII antibodies have a poorer prognosis than HA patients able to be effectively treated with replacement FVIII. Current approaches to impart endogenous expression of functional coagulation factors in hemophilia patients rely on the use of viral elements. In a recent clinical trial, six hemophilia B (HB) patiets experienced an improvement from severe to mild or moderate hemophilia following intravenous infusion of a therapeutic adeno-associated virus (AAV) vector bearing a fully functional Factor IX gene (F9). The therapeutic F9 was targeted to liver cells where it was incorporated and expressed. Use of viral elements has drawbacks, however, that may not be overcome. Many patients cannot be treated with AAV vectors because they have antibodies against it based on prior exposure to similar viruses. Also, the AAV capsid is immunogenic at doses used in the HB trial. This is problematic especially since data from studies in the validated canine model of HA show that much higher doses of AAV would be required for efficacy in human HA. A key goal of this project is to develop a viral-free means to restore endogenous expression of FVIII. We plan to repair the most common F8 mutation that causes severe HA, the intron-22-inversion (F8I22I). The F8I22I provides for expression of much of the FVIII protein on a contiguous polypeptide. Only the last portion of FVIII is not expressed by the F8I22I. It has been appreciated that F8I22I may be susceptible to gene repair, yet the molecular tools suitable to enable a safe and effective repair have only recently emerged. The F8I22I mutation that occurs in man also causes HA in dogs, thus providing a model system for preclinical development that would be readily translatable to humans. The blood outgrowth endothelial cell (BOEC) is an ideal cell in which to repair the F8I22I because wild-type BOECs secrete FVIII, are accessible from a simple blood draw, and can expanded up to 1019 cells. Prior work shows that limited numbers of BOECs home to and persist in the liver. We propose to develop (i) the tools for CRISPR- associated nuclease (CasN)-mediated gene repair of F8I22I in model cells lines and (ii) techniques for manipulation of BOECs. These tools and techniques will be utilized to repair the F8I22I mutation in autologous canine BOECs for testing in vivo in HA dogs in subsequent Phase 2 studies. Our proposed proof of concept studies allow us to take the first steps in the preclinical development of a safe, viral-free, CasN-mediated method to restore FVIII secretion in the majority of patients with severe HA.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Hemophilia A (HA) is a genetic bleeding disorder resulting in the inability to stop bleeding normally. People with HA need infusions of a replacement protein called FVIII. We are working on a safe way to repair HA patients' own cells to make FVIII on their own so that these patients avoid the complications of the disease.            ",Strategies for Personalized Gene

"Measurement Error in Population Health Inequity Research using Novel Biomeasures     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Progress in eliminating health disparities requires interdisciplinary efforts among social and biological scientists, and population-based data sets through which complex hypotheses linking environmental, psychosocial, behavioral and biological processes can be tested. The proposed project is an interdisciplinary collaborative effort integrating expertise in population health disparities, molecular biology, and the statisticl impact of measurement error on parameter estimates directly pertinent to population health research. We will address the question of whether DNA from blood or saliva banked with large population based data sets is valid for use in population health studies of telomere length (TL) - an intriguing new biomeasure of stress- mediated health, development, and aging -- and, if so, what sample sizes are needed.  Research on population differences in TL is largely based on highly select, racially homogeneous, clinical, or convenience samples. Socioeconomic measures are often absent or rudimentary. The state-of-the-art approach to measuring TL is via leukocyte-derived DNA extracted from fresh venous blood samples. Launching new population-based data collection activities that include blood draws, molecular measurements and the broad swath of social, environmental, behavioral, and health variables needed is costly and takes years before data can be analyzed. However, extant population-based data collections are increasingly isolating blood DNA for storage in specimen repositories after the cells have been transformed and immortalized using Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) or storing DNA in saliva. Neither approach is ideal for TL measurement. The critical unanswered question for population research is whether the error introduced in these TL measures is random or systematic with respect to original TL or to populations of interest.  We propose to estimate the validity of using EBV-immortalized blood cells or saliva cells to estimate population differences in TL. We will collect blood and saliva from 150 adult black, white, or Mexican-origin women in Detroit and Ann Arbor and measure each woman's TL multiple times using DNA directly isolated from fresh blood cells, DNA isolated from cells that we will EBV- immortalize, and DNA extracted from saliva. By stratifying the sample along key axes of comparison - race/ethnicity, socioeconomic status, stress- level, and neighborhood - and making within-woman comparisons on TL between immortalized and fresh blood samples, and between fresh blood samples and saliva, we will directly gauge the effect that immortalization or tissue type has on the validity and reliability o findings from TL studies that use stored specimens and on the future potential use of stored specimens for testing interdisciplinary hypotheses on population health disparities. Findings can be applied toward increasing the pace of health disparities research, whatever the conclusion on the validity of using immortalized blood or saliva cells to measure TL.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Eliminating social disparities in health is a high-priority national public health objective. Learning how different social or physical environments and life experiences influence biological processes to impact health is fundamental. By studying whether banked biomeasures are valid for use in population-studies we hope to improve and accelerate research on health disparities.            ",Measurement Error in Population Health Inequity Research using Novel Biomeasures,8838034,R01AG047167,"['adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Age ', ' Aging ', ' atherosclerotic vascular disease ', ' atheromatosis ', ' Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease ', ' Atheroscleroses ', ' Atherosclerosis ', ' Biology ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Blood ', ' Peripheral Blood Cell ', ' Blood Cells ', ' Cells ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Data Collection ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' DNA ', ' Environment ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' human herpesvirus 4 group ', ' Infectious Mononucleosis Virus ', ' Herpesvirus 4 (gamma), Human ', ' HHV-4 ', ' Epstein-Barr Virus ', ' Epstein Barr Virus ', ' EBV ', ' EB virus ', ' E-B Virus ', ' Burkitt Lymphoma Virus ', ' Burkitt Herpesvirus ', ' Human Herpesvirus 4 ', ' Family ', ' Future ', ' Behavioral Genetics ', ' behavior genetics ', ' Genetic Determinants of Behavior ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health Surveys ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' histocompatibility typing ', ' Tissue Typing ', ' Tissue Crossmatching ', ' Histocompatibility Testing ', ' Learning ', ' white blood corpuscle ', ' white blood cell ', ' White Cell ', ' White Blood Cells ', ' Marrow leukocyte ', ' Leukocytes Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Blood leukocyte ', ' Leukocytes ', ' Life Experience ', ' life course ', ' Life Cycle ', ' Life Cycle Stages ', ' long-term study ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' Michigan ', ' DNA Molecular Biology ', ' Molecular Biology ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Poverty Areas ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' recruit ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' Validity and Reliability ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Retirement ', ' Saliva ', ' Sampling Studies ', ' socioenvironment ', ' social context ', ' social climate ', ' Social Environment ', ' Stress ', ' Testing ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' telomere ', ' Mediating ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' Telomerase ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Cell Size ', ' base ', ' Blood Sample ', ' Blood specimen ', ' improved ', ' Phlebotomy ', ' Venous blood sampling ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Biological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Adolescent ', ' Link ', ' Mexican ', ' Measurement ', ' Sample Size ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Biological Function ', ' Biological Process ', ' Venous ', ' Research Specimen ', ' Specimen ', ' Scientist ', ' Complex ', ' psychosocial ', ' interest ', ' Physical environment ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Population Study ', ' social ', ' Sampling ', ' behavioral health ', ' theories ', ' repository ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Address ', ' Length ', ' Data ', ' Population Research ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' Molecular ', ' Process ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomic ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio economic ', ' socioeconomics ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' cost ', ' time use ', ' social disparities ', ' Population ', ' racial/ethnic ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' public health relevance ', ' population based ', ' population health ', ' ']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2015,298919,0.07617542566341139
"Hemoglobin Modifiers for Sickle Cell Disease Therapy DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our goal is to design and establish novel therapeutic agents for sickle cell disease (SCD), namely drugs that inhibit the initial sickle hemoglobin (HbS) polymerization and the subsequent pathophysiology. When deoxygenated, HbS polymerizes into long, rigid, and insoluble fibers causing red blood cells (RBCs) to sickle, a process worsened by the unusual low affinity of HbS for oxygen, resulting in premature release of oxygen. Based on several evidence--our preliminary data, studies by others, and the results of a recently completed phase I/II clinical testing of our lead compound, 5-HMF (an allosteric effector of Hb, AEH)-we hypothesize that AEHs, not only prevent HbS polymerization, but also mitigates several secondary sickling related pathological events that include inflammation, oxidative stress/damage, RBC hemolysis, and pain. We also have preliminary evidence that our next generation AEHs (INN- and TD-series) exhibit enhanced potency and improved in-vitro duration of action. These AEHs act via a novel mechanism of action, i.e., destabilize HbS polymer contacts, in addition to increasing Hb affinity for oxygen; providing positive synergistic effects. We propose to test our hypothesis by further investigating candidate drugs from the INN- and TD-series, as well as derivatives of 5-HMF and INN-312 for their pharmacologic properties, focusing on the secondary SCD pathways, as well as the underlying HbS polymerization problem using our model systems. The specific aims are: 1. Design and synthesis of novel allosteric effectors of hemoglobin (AEHs). We will modify our parent compounds and synthesize derivatives with enhanced efficacy and prolonged half-lives. We will also synthesize prod rugs to protect the active aldehyde functional moiety from aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH)- mediated metabolism as necessary. 2. Investigate in-vitro functional, ant sickling, and cytotoxicity activities of novel AEHs. We will investigate the AEHs for their in-vitro ant sickling/functional activities (RBC sickling tests, P50 analyses, HbS solubility, and Hb adduct formation), and carefully monitor for adverse effects. 3. Determine in-vivo/in-vitro PK/PD properties, binding and metabolism and evaluate preclinical efficacy of AEHs in SCD Berkeley mice. We will show that serum albumin binding and/or metabolism by ALDH in RBC or hepatic cytosol are not likely to adversely affect in-vivo pharmacologic activity. We will demonstrate using a Berkeley mouse model of SCD transgenic mice that AEHs show potent pharmacologic effects, increase short- and long-term survival rates of mice. We will also study their potential beneficial effects, e.g. amelioration of hemolysis, inflammation, endothelial damage, and overall reversal of the SCD pathophysiology observed in this model. 4. Determine the atomic interactions between AEHs and Hb. X-ray crystallography will be used to validate our hypothesis that AEH potency is directly dependent upon their abilities to bind Hb with their pyridyl substituents toward the surface of the Hb molecule. The structures would provide valuable insight to help guide rational modifications for better pharmacologic properties. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Sickle cell disease (SCD) is the most common inherited hematologic disorder, affecting over 80,000 people, primarily African-American in the US, exacerbating the disproportionate health disparity among this minority population. Most common therapeutic intervention includes blood transfusions and hydroxyurea therapies, however, these therapies are associated with some undesirable side effects and not all patients benefit from the treatment.

"Prevalence and Progression of Monoclonal Gammopathies DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Multiple myeloma (MM) is a life-threatening plasma cell malignancy. MM has a prolonged clinically detectable premalignant phase called monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) that can be identified by detection of the secreted monoclonal immunoglobulin (M protein) and through the presence of an abnormal immunoglobulin kappa/lambda free light chain (FLC) ratio. Over the last 10 years we have extensively characterized the various precursor stages of MM, and conducted numerous studies establishing monoclonal elevations of FLC and abnormalities in the FLC ratio as biomarkers for diagnosis, prognosis, response assessment, and risk stratification across a spectrum of plasma cell disorders. One of the goals of this renewal is to determine why MGUS occurs, and whether polyclonal plasma cell proliferation in response to infection or inflammation plays a role in pathogenesis of MGUS, MM and related malignancies. We are also investigating the reasons for dramatic racial disparity in incidence of MM; young blacks for example have a 3-fold higher risk than whites. Our studies show that a major reason for the racial discrepancy is a marked excess in the incidence of the precursor MGUS phase in blacks. Similarly, we have uncovered a significant familial predisposition in MGUS and MM. Since MM consists of multiple unique entities from a cytogenetic standpoint, we need to determine the precise cytogenetic subtypes responsible for racial disparity and familial predisposition. Thus two fundamental questions are: 1) Can we identify biomarkers that predict risk of MM prior to the premalignant MGUS stage (precursor of the precursor stage)? 2) What are the specific cytogenetic subtypes that account for the increased risk of MM in blacks and in first degree-relatives? In Aim 1 we will determine if polyclonal elevations of serum immunoglobulin FLC are associated with an increased risk of MGUS, MM and related B cell malignancies in a large cohort of nearly 16,000 patients. In Aim 2 we will assemble and study a cohort of 800 blacks with MM to identify the specific cytogenetic subtype(s) of MM associated with increased risk of MM, and also identify predictors of response to therapy and survival. In Aim 3 we will conduct studies to identify the specific cytogenetic subtypes associated with familial predisposition in MGUS. We believe our studies are highly innovative, and will have a far-reaching impact on our understanding of the etiology of MGUS, and the cytogenetic basis for racial disparity and familial predisposition. Our studies will result in a promising biomarker to identify patients at high risk for MM and related malignancies in the general population. Aims 2 and 3 will have a major impact on the management of patients with MGUS and MM, especially African Americans and first-degree relatives or persons with MGUS. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Multiple myeloma (MM) is a life-threatening plasma cell malignancy that is always preceded by a prolonged premalignant phase called monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS).

"(PQC3) Immunological Basis of Health Disparities in Multiple Myeloma ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Multiple myeloma (MM) is an incurable B-cell proliferative disorder of malignant plasma cells. MM is an example of a cancer health disparity with one of the highest African American/European American (AA/EA) incidence rate ratios of all cancers. The explanation for this race-related difference needs to be found in the etiology of the MM premalignant condition known as monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS), since the prevalence of MGUS in AA is much higher than that observed in EA, while the probability for transition from MGUS to MM is the same in both races. We postulate that this health disparity can be explained by differences in the IgE-(mast cell) system, which are the mediators of the allergic immune response. This response is due to the presence of mast cells (MC) in tissue that are sensitized by IgE antibodies, which when bound to a multivalent antigen (allergen) lead to the cross-linking of the high affinity IgE receptor I (FceRI) and degranulation f MC, resulting in the release of histamine and other mediators of the acute inflammatory (allergic) response. However, in addition to this well-known degranulating response, when bound to MC in the absence of antigens (monomeric IgE), IgE activates MC and prolongs their survival without inducing degranulation. Activated MC secrete the cytokine interleukin-6 (IL-6) and express CD40L on their surface, both of which provide strong signals that activate B cells and trigger their differentiation into plasma cells. Since B-cell activation involves the expressio of the DNA mutating enzyme activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID), this would increase the probability of mutations that lead to abnormal plasma cells (MGUS). It is well known that the total IgE blood level is higher in AA compared to EA, with and without other pathological conditions associated with high IgE levels. Thus, we hypothesize that the higher IgE levels in AA result in a higher incidence of MGUS through enhanced chronic activation of the MC-(B-cell) axis. Interestingly, there are also differences in MC structure and enzymatic content between AA and EA, with unknown functional implications. Therefore, we also hypothesize that MC from AA have stronger stimulatory activity, compared to those from EA, when exposed to the same amount of monomeric IgE, or even without IgE. However, both hypotheses are not mutually exclusive. We have two specific aims: Aim 1: Define the differences in MC in AA and EA in the absence of IgE and Aim 2: Define the differences of MC in AA and EA in the presence of IgE. In addition to using antigen free (monomeric) IgE to monitor its efficacy to activate the MC:B-cell axis, we will also explore the use of a therapeutic IgE targeting an antigen on MM cells to trigger degranulation and anti-tumor activity, a process known as the ""re-education of MC to fight cancer"". This artificially induced event is possible because degranulating MC release pro-apoptotic molecules with anti-tumor effects and should not be confused with that induced by total levels of IgE activating the MC:B-cell axis. Thus, our proposal has relevant implications in both the prevention and therapy of MM. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Multiple myeloma (MM) is an incurable blood cancer that disproportionally affects African Americans compared to European Americas (whites) and all other racial groups; however, the basis for this race-related difference is unknown. The main goal of this project is to understand the causes of a premalignant (benign) condition known as ""monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance"" (MGUS) that precedes MM and is the key to understanding this cancer health disparity. The present proposal aims to discover the immunological basis of MGUS focusing on key players of the allergic immune response that may promote this premalignant condition (mast cells and IgE antibody) and also aims to reprogram this immune response to eventually eliminate MM.",(PQC3) Immunological Basis of Health Disparities in Multiple Myeloma,9054822,R21CA193953,"['adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Affect ', ' Allergens ', ' Americas ', ' Antibodies ', ' Binding Determinants ', ' Antigenic Determinants ', ' Epitopes ', ' immunogen ', ' ATGN ', ' Antigens ', ' autoimmune disorder ', ' Autoimmune Diseases ', ' Bursa-Equivalent Lymphocyte ', ' Bursa-Dependent Lymphocytes ', ' B-Cells ', ' B blood cells ', ' B-Lymphocytes ', ' Immune Regulators ', ' Immune Mediators/Modulators ', ' Immune Mediators ', ' Biomodulators ', ' Biological Response Modifiers ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Blood ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cell-to-Cell Interaction ', ' Cell Interaction ', ' Cell Communication ', ' Cell Degranulation ', ' Cell Viability ', ' Cell Survival ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cells ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' DNA ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' electronic device ', ' Electronics ', ' Enzyme Activation ', ' flow cytophotometry ', ' Flow Microfluorometry ', ' Flow Microfluorimetry ', ' Flow Cytofluorometry ', ' Flow Cytofluorometries ', ' Flow Cytometry ', ' Future ', ' Genes ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Inducer T-Lymphocytes ', ' Inducer Cells ', ' Helper-Inducer T-Cells ', ' Helper T-Lymphocytes ', ' Helper T-Cells ', ' Helper Cells ', ' Helper-Inducer T-Lymphocyte ', ' Histamine ', ' Histamine Liberation ', ' Histamine Release ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Allergy ', ' Hypersensitivity ', ' Immunoglobulin E ', ' IgE ', ' Incidence ', ' interferon beta 2 ', ' Plasmacytoma Growth Factor ', ' Myeloid Differentiation-Inducing Protein ', ' MGI-2 ', ' IL6 Protein ', ' IL-6 ', ' IFNB2 ', ' IFN-beta 2 ', ' Hybridoma Growth Factor ', ' Hepatocyte-Stimulating Factor ', ' HPGF ', ' BSF2 ', ' BSF-2 ', ' BCDF ', ' B-Cell Stimulatory Factor-2 ', ' B-Cell Differentiation Factor-2 ', ' B-Cell Differentiation Factor ', ' B cell stimulating factor 2 ', ' B cell differentiation factor ', ' Interleukin-6 ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' mastocyte ', ' Tissue Basophils ', ' Marrow Mast Cell ', ' Basophilic Histiocyte ', ' mast cell ', ' Microscopy ', ' myelomatosis ', ' myeloma ', ' Plasma-Cell Myeloma ', ' Multiple Myeloma ', ' genome mutation ', ' Genetic defect ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Mutation ', ' Transforming Genes ', ' Oncoproteins ', ' Oncogene Proteins ', ' Oncogene Products ', ' Cancer-Promoting Gene ', ' Cancer Genes ', ' Oncogenes ', ' plasmocyte ', ' Plasmacytes ', ' Blood Plasma Cell ', ' Plasma Cells ', ' Play ', ' precancerous state ', ' Premalignant State ', ' Premalignant Condition ', ' Precancerous Conditions ', ' Probability ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Risk ', ' mRNA ', ' Messenger RNA ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' helper T cell ', ' T4 Lymphocytes ', ' T4 Cells ', ' CD4-Positive Lymphocytes ', ' CD4+ T-Lymphocyte ', ' CD4+ T cell ', ' CD4 lymphocyte ', ' CD4 T cells ', ' CD4 Cells ', ' CD4 Positive T Lymphocytes ', ' Testing ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Tissues ', ' Tumor Antigens ', ' tumor-specific antigen ', ' Tumor-Associated Antigen ', ' United States ', ' Glycocalyx ', ' Cell Coat ', ' cytokine ', ' Generations ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Mediating ', ' IgE Receptors ', ' epsilon Fc Receptors ', ' Immunoglobulin E Receptor ', ' CD23 Antigens ', ' CD 23 Antigens ', ' base ', ' cross-link ', ' crosslink ', ' Surface ', ' Acute ', ' Benign ', ' Chronic ', ' Malignant ', ' Malignant -

"Translating Transplant Practices for Sickle Cell Disease in the US and France: National Commitments, Institutional Regimens, Private Sentiments ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This pre-doctoral research examines how healthcare centers are making a risky, expensive, yet potentially curative procedure available to children affected by sickle cell disease (SCD), a disabling genetic disorder common to minority and immigrant populations in the United States and France. Although hematopoietic cell transplantation (also known as bone marrow, umbilical cord blood, and stem cell transplantation) has been available to children with SCD for nearly three decades in the US, only a few hundred cases have been documented in the medical literature. Remarkably, a disproportionate number of these cases have taken place in France. Given that private and state-funded insurers in the US universally cover hematopoietic cell transplantation for children with sickle cell disease (who are also federally mandated to receive access to healthcare) other factors need to be considered to explain this disparity, in addition to the question of healthcare cost and access. Using ethnographic methods, including participant observation, in-depth interviews, oral histories, and archival research, this proposal systematically considers the health policy, institutional, and interpersonal contexts that are producing transplant research design, clinical experience, and ethical practice at the level of the healthcare institution. Data collection is being carried out in local healthcare contexts in the US and France at sites that share leadership in SCD research and clinical care; serve vulnerable populations, including historically underserved minorities, immigrants, and children; and yet are experiencing divergence in their transplant practices. This study is an ecological examination of medical innovation and its translation to clinical practice and designed to identify potentially modifiable social and health system determinants and patient-centered outcomes to mitigate disparities when introducing novel treatment options. Building upon her clinical background and ongoing doctoral work in anthropology, the candidate proposes enhanced mentorship and training in hematology, social epidemiology, and mixed methods research to prepare her to become independent public health researcher and medical anthropologist with strengths in clinical investigation and interdisciplinary research in the care of SCD affected populations. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This pre-doctoral research aims to enhance public understandings of complex treatment options through the ethnographic study of hematopoietic cell transplantation in the care of children with sickle cell disease. This study will identify the biomedical, interpersonal, and institutional barriers and facilitators that contribute to whether ad how advanced medical technologies are made available and become utilized among historically underserved minorities and children. An underlying goal of this research is to identify modifiable social and health systems determinants to mitigate widening health disparities when introducing novel treatment options.","Translating

"Dissecting gastric cancer clonality with genomic analyses and patient xenografts Abstract Gastric cancer is the third leading cause of cancer mortality worldwide, with over 720,000 individuals succumbing to this disease each year. Survival to this malignancy remains dismal: only 4% of patients with metastatic gastric cancer are alive 5 years after diagnosis. Interestingly, recent gastric cancer genomic studies have shown that this malignancy is highly heterogeneous, with every tumor having hundreds of mutations. It is not known, however, how these mutations are organized into gastric tumor subclonal cell populations. Understanding the subclonal organization of gastric tumors is important as such information will be essential to design optimal molecular testing methods that guide precision medicine. In the present study, we will investigate regional and temporal changes in gastric cancer clonality to understand the levels of intra-tumor heterogeneity and subclonal architecture, and to identify tumor subclones carrying driver mutations that can be targeted for therapy. Although subclonal architecture studies have not yet been carried out in gastric cancer, recent studies in other cancer types, such as lung and renal tumors, have produced interesting, yet contrasting results. While driver mutations tend to be present in most lung tumor subclones, multiple and younger subclones carrying different drivers are characteristic of renal tumors. Thus, while both lung and renal cancer show extensive intra-tumor heterogeneity, these results suggest that limited sampling (i.e. a single biopsy) may be appropriate for molecularly-guided therapies in lung cancer but that more extensive multiregional sampling and analyses will be required for molecular diagnostics in renal cancer. Here we aim to improve our understanding of gastric cancer clonality and its relevance for molecular diagnostics by performing multi- regional sequencing of 30 gastric cancer tumors and by evaluating the levels of histological and genetic similarities of matching tumors when they are implanted into immunosuppressed NSG mice. Our guiding hypothesis is that extensive intra-tumor heterogeneity in gastric cancers leads to complex patters of tumor clonal architecture. Our aims in the study are as follows: (1) To investigate gastric cancer clonal diversity using multiregional sequencing and (2) To assess histological and genomic similarities between primary cancers and tumors derived from patient-derived xenograft models. These experiments will be crucial to elucidate the patterns of gastric cancer clonal evolution and their impact and relevance in precision medicine. In particular, we will uncover the distribution of driver mutations in gastric cancer subclones and will provide a very strong basis to design further preclinical studies and clinical trials that efficiently target such mutations, leading to much needed improvements in gastric cancer survival. Our findings will be also relevant to address cancer disparities in the country as gastric cancer disproportionally affects U.S. Hispanics. Narrative This proposal aims to investigate patterns of gastric cancer clonality in primary tumors and in patient-derived xenografts using single cell and bulk targeted sequencing of cancer driver genes.

"Detection of 5-hmC as a Novel Screening Biomarker for Pancreatic Cancer ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Pancreatic cancer (PaC) ranks the fourth in the US and eighth worldwide for cancer mortality. Early diagnosis and prevention is the only viable option for impacting the mortality rate. Due to the low prevalence of PaC in the population, however, most positive screening tests are likely false positives. Therefore, it remains a grand challenge to identify more accurate biomarkers for early screening and prognosis prediction. Given the complex pathogenesis of PaC, identification of biomarkers for PaC will benefit from a systematical search targeting various gene regulation mechanisms, considering that gene expression dysregulation underlies the disease development. Recent studies using high-throughput epigenomic profiling technologies have demonstrated aberrant modifications of CpG sites in PaC cell lines and tumor tissues, suggesting the potential applications of these epigenetic markers to early detection of this dreadful disease. In particular, 5- hydroxymethylcytosine (5-hmC), which can be generated by oxidation of 5-methylcytosine (5-mC) through the Tet family of enzymes, was recently re-discovered to be a stable base in various human tissues, with emerging gene regulatory role and implications for human cancers. We reasoned that determining the exact types of cytosine modifications (5-mC or 5-hmC) implicated in PaC will provide novel insights into its pathogenesis, as well as novel epigenetic biomarkers for PaC early detection. Specifically, The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) data will be explored to guide the selection of PaC-specific CpGs to be tested for the existence of 5-hmC in a panel of PaC cell lines with varying degrees of genetic complexity using a novel and proven technique, Tet- assisted Bisulfite Sequencing (TAB-Seq), developed by our colleague and collaborator, Dr. Chuan He (HHMI Investigator). We will also use the TAB-Seq assay to examine 5-hmC directly in PaC tumor and surrounding normal tissue samples that have already been collected from 30 US and 30 Chinese patients in our previous or ongoing projects. Our design of including two diverse populations will allow investigation of the role of these epigeneti markers in the health disparities in this disease. To examine the clinical significance of the 5-hmC, we will evaluate our detected CpG markers (5-mC and 5-hmC) in cells from endoscopically- and histologically normal-appearing periampullary duodenal biopsies from 30 US and 30 Chinese PaC patients as well as 30/30 matched controls in relation to the nanoscale cellular architecture alterations due to field carcinogenesis using a novel biophotonic technology. In summary, this project will for the first time define which cytosine modifications, 5 hmC or 5-mC or both, are implicated in PaC. The results from this proposal will lay the foundation of applying CpG markers including 5-hmC as a novel class of early screening and predictive biomarkers for PaC. Finally, the PIs, Drs. Zhang and Hou have assembled an excellent investigative team with significant achievements in relevant research areas and complimentary expertise, therefore ensuring the success of this multidisciplinary and highly innovative project. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This works seeks to understand how covalent cytosine modifications (5-methylcytosines and/or 5-hydroxymethylcytosines) implicate in pancreatic cancer. Through an understanding of this epigenetic control, we may be able to utilize cytosine modifications as biomarkers for the prevention, diagnosis and prognosis of pancreatic cancer. This approach may also be applied to other human cancers.",Detection of 5-hmC as a Novel Screening Biomarker for Pancreatic Cancer,9065531,R21CA187869,"['Achievement Attainment ', ' Achievement ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Architecture ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Biopsy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cells ', ' Cytosine ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Enzyme Gene ', ' Enzymes ', ' Family ', ' Foundations ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Gene Regulation Process ', ' Gene Regulation ', ' Gene Action Regulation ', ' Gene Expression Regulation ', ' Genes ', ' trans acting element ', ' regulatory gene ', ' Transcriptional Regulatory Elements ', ' Regulator Genes ', ' Health ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' In Vitro ', ' Incidence ', ' Laboratories ', ' mortality ', ' oxidation ', ' Patients ', ' Play ', ' Prognosis ', ' outcome forecast ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Science ', ' Spectrum Analyses ', ' Spectroscopy ', ' Spectrum Analysis ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Tumor Cell Line ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' population diversity ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' diverse populations ', ' Chinese People ', ' Chinese ', ' base ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Histologically ', ' Histologic ', ' Ensure ', ' Evaluation ', ' insight ', ' Funding ', ' Genetic ', ' Staging ', ' Normal Tissue ', ' Normal tissue morphology ', ' tool ', ' Pancreatic Cancer ', ' Pancreas Cancer ', ' Malignant Pancreatic Neoplasm ', ' Malignant neoplasm of pancreas ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Investigation ', ' Complex ', ' human tissue ', ' Techniques ', ' Tumor Tissue ', ' Cancer Induction ', ' carcinogenesis ', ' early detection ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' success ', ' Base Pairing ', ' novel ', ' Prevention ', ' Pathogenesis ', ' Risk Reduction ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Normal Cell ', ' Tissue Sample ', ' Address ', ' Biophotonics ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Molecular Epidemiology of Cancer ', ' Resolution ', ' Tet ', ' Tetanus Helper Peptide ', ' Cancer Patient ', ' Epigenetic Mechanism ', ' Epigenetic Change ', ' Epigenetic ', ' Epigenetic Process ', ' Low Prevalence ', ' Modification ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' epigenomics ', ' cancer research ', ' anticancer research ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' nanometer sized ', ' nanometer scale ', ' nano scale ', ' nano meter sized ', ' nano meter scale ', ' nanoscale ', ' Cancer cell line ', ' Population ', ' cancer type ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' clinically significant ', ' clinical significance ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' tumor ', ' Biological Markers ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' genome-wide ', ' genomewide ', ' genome scale ', ' pancreatic cancer cells ', ' The Cancer Genome Atlas ', ' TCGA ', ' epigenetic marker ', ' epigenetic biomarker ', ' screening ', ' predictive marker ', ' predictive molecular biomarker ', ' predictive biomarkers ', ' bisulfite sequencing ', ' bisulfite-seq ', ' BS-seq ', ' biomarker development ', ' early detection biomarkers ', ' early detection markers ', ' cancer biomarkers ', ' cancer markers ', ' specific biomarkers ', ' biomarker identification ', ' marker identification ', ' ']",NCI,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,R21,2016,171851,0.0444099748014523
"Social regulation of pro-inflammatory monocytes DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposed research seeks to determine how adverse social environments influence the risk of inflammation-related disease by up-regulating the expression of pro-inflammatory genes. These studies test the hypothesis that adverse social environments stimulate the hematopoietic production of immature pro-inflammatory monocytes (CD16- in humans, Ly-6c-high in mice) via threat-induced activation of beta-adrenergic receptors in bone marrow myelopoietic cells. Specific aims will: (Aim 1) Define the neural and endocrine pathways by which chronic threat up-regulates pro-inflammatory monocytes; (Aim 2) Define the specific beta-adrenergic receptors and target cell types mediating threat-induced expansion of pro- inflammatory monocytes; and (Aim 3) Define the myelopoietic molecules mediating beta-adrenergic expansion of pro-inflammatory monocytes (including GM-CSF, TGF-beta, and the CXCL12/CXCR4 chemokine signaling axis). When complete, these studies will provide an integrated mechanistic model of the neural / hematopoietic pathway by which chronic adversity can up-regulate inflammatory gene expression in circulating immune cells. The overarching goal of these studies is to develop a comprehensive theory that explains how common social risk factors can influence multiple inflammation-related diseases. In addition to clarifying the basic physiologic mechanisms involved in ""defensive programming"" of the immune system transcriptome, these studies will identify specific CNS mechanisms (e.g., Crf gene activation in central nucleus of the amygdala), pharmacologic intervention strategies (e.g., beta-2 and beta-3 adrenergic antagonists, and antagonists of GM-CSF, TGF-beta, and/or CXCR4), and mechanistic biomarkers (e.g., myelopoietic molecules and circulating monocyte phenotypes) that can be applied in future studies to clarify how stress-induced up- regulation of pro-inflammatory monocytes impacts specific inflammation-related diseases such as atherosclerosis, Type II diabetes, Alzheimer's disease, and cancer. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This research seeks to improve public health by clarifying the biological pathways through which adverse social environments such as social isolation or poverty influence the risk of inflammation-related diseases such as heart disease, Alzheimer's disease, and cancer. This research will establish new risk factors, neural mechanisms, pharmacologic intervention strategies, and cellular and molecular biomarkers of individual health status to help protect human health in the context of adverse social environments and thus reduce socially-related health disparities.",Social regulation of pro-inflammatory monocytes,9058450,R01AG043404,"['Adrenergics ', ' Adrenergic Drugs ', ' Adrenergic Agents ', ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Alzheimers Dementia ', "" Alzheimer's "", ' Alzheimer syndrome ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' amygdaloid nuclear complex ', ' Amygdaloid Nucleus ', ' Amygdaloid Body ', ' Amygdala ', ' Amygdaloid structure ', ' epidemiologic investigation ', ' Epidemiology Research ', ' Epidemiological Studies ', ' Epidemiologic Research ', ' Epidemiologic Studies ', ' Antiinflammatory Agents ', ' Antiinflammatories ', ' Anti-Inflammatories ', ' Anti-Inflammatory Agents ', ' atherosclerotic vascular disease ', ' atherosclerotic disease ', ' atheromatosis ', ' Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease ', ' Atheroscleroses ', ' Atherosclerosis ', ' Bereavement ', ' vascular ', ' Blood Vessels ', ' Bone Marrow Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Bone Marrow ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Nucleus ', ' Cell Nucleus ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cells ', ' type II DM ', ' type 2 DM ', ' maturity onset diabetes ', ' ketosis resistant diabetes ', ' adult onset diabetes ', ' Type II diabetes ', ' Type II Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Type 2 diabetes ', ' Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus ', ' T2DM ', ' T2D ', ' T2 DM ', ' Stable Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Slow-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Noninsulin Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Non-Insulin Dependent Diabetes ', ' NIDDM ', ' Maturity-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' MODY ', ' Ketosis-Resistant Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Adult-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Gene Activation ', ' Gene Expression ', ' genetic therapy ', ' gene-based therapy ', ' Genetic Intervention ', ' Gene-Tx ', ' Gene Transfer Procedure ', ' Gene Transfer Clinical ', ' Gene Therapy Molecular Biology ', ' DNA Therapy ', ' gene therapy ', ' Genes ', ' Glucocorticoids ', ' Goals ', ' Granulocytic cell ', ' Granular Leukocytes ', ' Blood granulocytic cell ', ' granulocyte ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Growth ', ' Health ', ' Level of Health ', ' Health Status ', ' heart disorder ', ' Cardiac Disorders ', ' Cardiac Diseases ', ' Heart Diseases ', ' Hematopoietic Progenitor Cells ', ' Blood Precursor Cell ', ' Hematopoietic stem cells ', ' hereditary disorder ', ' genetic disorder ', ' Molecular Disease ', ' Genetic Diseases ', ' Genetic Condition ', ' Hereditary Disease ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' hypothalamic ', ' Hypothalamus ', ' Hypothalamic structure ', ' allergic/immunologic organ system ', ' allergic/immunologic body system ', ' Immune system ', ' Inflammation ', ' Literature ', ' macrophage ', ' Genetic Models ', ' Marrow monocyte ', ' Blood monocyte ', ' monocyte ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity -

"Estrogen Negatively Modulates Proteoglycan-4 Expression in TMJ ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Temporomandibular joint disorders (TMDs) affect a significant portion of the population of the USA, with the majority of those seeking treatment being women of childbearing age. Owing to this striking sexual dimorphism it has been postulated that sex hormones play a role in the maintenance of normal temporomandibular joint (TMJ) function. Proteoglycan 4 (PRG4) is a secreted lubricating molecule essential for maintaining low frictional levels within articular joints; however, its role in the TMJ is not well characterized. We identified conserved estrogen response elements within the 5' flanking region of the PRG4 gene of human and baboon, and found that treatment of baboon TMJ disc cells with estrogen attenuated PRG4 promoter activity and expression of PRG4 mRNA in vitro. This discovery of negative regulation of PRG4 by estrogen is the basis for the hypothesis that a causative event in the development of TMD is estrogen-mediated down regulation of PRG4 transcription. Insufficient quantity of PRG4 in the TMJ is expected to lead to increased friction and over time, degradation of TMJ components affecting the articulation of the mandibular condyle with the glenoid fossa of the temporal bone and disc placement, which largely describes the human TMD phenotype. In this study we propose three specific aims; 1) to determine the extent that estrogen decreases PRG4 expression in female and male baboon TMJ cells and TMJ organotypic cultures. Immunoblots and qPCR will be used to quantify estrogen effects on PRG4 expression in synovial and cartilage cells and tissues that will be compared to PRG4 expression in TMJ disc cells and tissue. 2) To characterize by ChIP analysis estrogen alpha and beta receptors and estrogen response element binding in PRG4 gene regulation in femal and baboon TMJ cells. 3) To provide a highly mentored environment and rigorous biomedical research training opportunities for the development of underrepresented students in the life sciences.

"Role of SLC13A3 in Renal Cell Carcinoma ABSTRACT  Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is the most common type of kidney cancer. African Americans and males tend to have higher rates of RCC when compared to Whites and Hispanics. Due to the lack of diagnostic tests and the asymptomatic nature of RCC in early stages, about 30% of patients have advanced/metastatic RCC at initial presentation. Metastatic RCC is fatal, with median survival of less than 2 years. There still remains a great need for the discovery of molecular drivers of RCC, and biomarkers that associate with racial disparity and predict clinical outcome in RCC patients. Microarray analysis of normal kidney and RCC tissues revealed that SLC13A3 is downregulated in RCC tissues; more significantly in African American RCC patients, when compared to White and Hispanic patients. SLC13A3 is a transporter of Krebs cycle intermediates and glutathione. Decreased intracellular glutathione levels have been shown to induce reactive oxygen species (ROS) that promote oncogenic functions in cancer cells. Overexpression of SLC13A3 in RCC cell lines decreased cell growth and clonogenic survival. SLC13A3 expression was found to be epigenetically regulated by DNA methylation. This proposal will test the hypothesis that SLC13A3 downregulation is a molecular determinant of RCC growth and progression. Furthermore, SLC13A3 downregulation correlates with racial disparity and is a predictor of clinical outcome (metastasis, treatment response, survival) in RCC patients. SLC13A3 functions, associated mechanisms, and phenotypic readouts will be investigated by expressing SLC13A3 in RCC cells and by its downregulation in normal kidney epithelial cells. The effect of SLC13A3 expression on tumor growth and metastasis will be investigated in RCC xenograft models. SLC13A3 expression in normal kidney and RCC tissues will be correlated with clinical outcome and racial disparity. The proposed study will be the first investigation into the functional role of SLC13A3 in any disease type, including cancer. The study should reveal the molecular changes and phenotypic consequences that occur due to SLC13A3 loss in RCC. The study may lead to the establishment of SLC13A3 as functional biomarker for RCC and for the racial disparity observed in terms of disease severity. PROJECT NARRATIVE  Despite advancements in treatment modalities, and diagnosis, molecular causes of renal cell carcinoma development, growth and progression, as well as, of the racial disparity associated with this disease are largely unknown. Through the discovery of a novel potential negative regulator of RCC, this project will investigate how this negative regulator controls RCC growth and progression, and furthermore, whether it is a predictor of clinical outcome and a biomarker of racial disparity in RCC patients. This project may lead to the identification of a tumor suppressor that is a biomarker of RCC progression and a therapeutic target.",Role of SLC13A3 in Renal Cell Carcinoma,9195513,F31CA210612,"['Accounting ', ' Age ', ' anti-oxidant ', ' Antioxidants ', ' ladakamycin ', ' Azacytidine ', ' AZC ', ' 5-Azacytidine ', ' 5-Aza-cytidine ', ' 5-AC ', ' 5 AZC ', ' Azacitidine ', ' bone ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' kidney adenocarcinoma ', ' Renal Cell Cancer ', ' Renal Cell Adenocarcinoma ', ' Renal Adenocarcinoma ', ' Nephroid Carcinoma ', ' Hypernephroma ', ' Hypernephroid Carcinoma ', ' Grawitz Tumor ', ' Renal Cell Carcinoma ', ' Cellular Growth ', ' Cellular Expansion ', ' cell growth ', ' cultured cell line ', ' Strains Cell Lines ', ' CellLine ', ' Cell Line ', ' Motility ', ' Cellular Motility ', ' Cellular Migration ', ' Cell Movement ', ' Cell Migration ', ' Cell Locomotion ', ' cell motility ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cells ', ' Citrates ', ' Tricarboxylic Acid Cycle ', ' TCA cycle ', ' Krebs Cycle ', ' Citric Acid Cycle ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Downregulation ', ' Down-Regulation ', ' Epithelial Cells ', ' balance function ', ' balance ', ' Equilibrium ', ' Q.

"Molecular causes and mechanistic underpinning of breast cancer racial disparity ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): African American (AA) women are more likely to have aggressive breast cancer (BC) and experience greater mortality rates as compared to Caucasian (CA) women. Another upsetting fact is that this cancer outcome gap has continued to widen over past several years underscoring the immediate need to make progress in this area. It is being increasingly appreciated that tumor microenvironment (TME) may play an important role in BC racial disparity; however, underlying molecular and mechanistic basis is not clearly understood. This project is built upon our novel findings suggesting the existence of a TME-tumor cell interaction-driven regulatory loop, which is predominantly active in AA patients. We demonstrate that 1) serum levels of inflammatory cytokines, resistin and IL6, are significantly elevated in AA BC patients compared to their CA counterparts, 2) AA BCs have significantly greater expression and phosphorylation of STAT3 compared to CA BCs, 3) treatment of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cell lines from both AA and CA patients with resistin promotes expression of STAT3/pSTAT3 and enhances IL6 production, thus suggesting a dominant role of differential TME in overall disease outcome, 4) IL6 mediates the effect of resistin on STAT3 phosphorylation, 5) resistin promotes aggressive tumor phenotypes and therapy-resistance in BC cells through STAT3 induction, 6) resistin also upregulates LIN28A, a regulator of stemness, and downregulates let-7 miRNA, and 7) LIN28A silencing abrogates resistin-induced upregulation of IL6, pSTAT3 and STAT3. Based on these findings, we hypothesize that intrinsic differences in tumor biology contributes to BC racial disparity and resistin-LIN28A-(IL6)- STAT3/pSTAT3 serves as an important regulatory loop controlling the aggressive and therapy-resistant phenotypes of BC cells. This hypothesis will be tested in three specific aims. In aim 1, we will characterize the molecular mechanisms underlying resistin-LIN28A-(IL6)-STAT3/pSTAT3 regulatory loop by examining the pathways regulating resistin-induced LIN28A expression, and whether LIN28A mediates resistin-induced let-7 downregulation, which then leads to STAT3 and IL6 upregulation in BC cells. In aim 2, we will examine the functional significance of this regulatory by using luciferase-tagged, control or LIN28A-/STAT3-silenced BC cell lines and characterize the response of resistin and its downstream effectors on growth, metastasis and therapy-resistance in an orthotopic nude mice model. In aim 3, we will determine the clinical relevance of the components of resistin-LIN28A-(IL6)-STAT3/pSTAT3 regulatory loop in BC racial disparity by examining their expression in clinical samples and assessing their correlation (alone and in combination) with TME and tumor cell characteristics as well as with race and patient's survival. Together, these studies will provide novel insight into molecular causes and mechanistic underpinning of BC racial disparity and provide novel set of biomarkers and potential drug-targets to develop novel ways for reducing the widening gaps in clinical outcome of AA and CA BC patients.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Cancer health disparities represent a major public health concern in the United States and there is a clear perception that these disparities exist at the molecular level and tumor microenvironment (TME) plays an important role. The proposed research will characterize TME-tumor cell interaction-driven molecular cross-talk and confirm its functional and clinical relevance in racially-disparate clinical outcomes of breast cancer (aggressiveness and therapeutic-resistance) between Caucasian (CA) and American (AA) patients. Anticipated findings will be helpful in understanding the molecular and mechanistic basis of breast cancer racial disparity, reveal therapeutically-significant intervention points and identify a novel set of mechanistically-linked biomarkers to serve as risk-predictors and molecular sub-classifiers of disease and thus ultimately be helpful in reducing the observed cancer outcome gaps.

"Characterization of novel compounds with anti-lymphoma activity DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Although the incidence for cancer in the US has declined slightly in the past decade, it still claims the lives of more than half a million individals a year. There are a great number of distinct types of lymphocyte malignancies that represent the various stages of B- and T-cell development and these represent approximately 9% of all cancers in this country. Lymphomas represent ~54% of blood cell cancers and the main forms are Hodgkin and non-Hodgkin lymphomas (NLH). The latter is the most common type of lymphoma and affects Caucasians at a highest rate followed closely by people of Hispanic descent. Patients with NLH have a 5 year survival rate of ~67% while African Americans have a lower survival rate of 56%. Patients with Hodgkin lymphoma have a survival rate of 83% for whites and 77% for African Americans. There are many factors that not only affect cancer incidence but also mortality, and some of these are the likely causes of the observed health disparities. Unfortunately, finding a cure for all types of cancer is highly unlikely as there are many genetic alterations that are involved and many distinct types of cancers. However, there are new drugs being discovered on a fairly frequent basis that affect specific cancer types by targeting specific pathways that interfere with their growth or induce cell death. In recent months, we have developed and validated a screening assay that was used to test a small library of compounds on B- and T-cell lymphomas. These screening efforts have resulted in the identification of several related compounds that are highly cytotoxic to lymphomas. The main goal of this project is to characterize the novel anti-lymphoma compounds that have been identified. The specific aims of the project are to (1) characterize the identified anti-lymphoma compounds (2) determine the mode of action of lead compounds, and (3) examine the effects of the most promising compounds in vivo. The identification and characterization of drugs that are cytotoxic to specific types of lymphomas can lead to novel therapeutic agents. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The second leading cause of death in the United States is cancer. Apart from the most commons types of cancer such as breast and prostate, there are a great number of hematopoietic and lymphoid malignancies. Our group has identified greater than fifty related compounds with strong cytotoxic activity against human lymphomas that need to be fully characterized.

"Regulation of nonmuscle myosin light chain kinase structure and function of ARDS ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We have extended our prior studies demonstrating the non-muscle isoform of myosin light chain kinase (nmMLCK, 1914 aa, gene code-MYLK) as an essential, multi-functional cytoskeletal effector in: i) lung endo- thelial cell (EC) barrier-disruptive and barrier-restorative processes; ii) in lung inflammatory cell trafficking; and in, ii) lung vascular responses to mechanical stress. Each of these events is critical to the pathobiology of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI). We previously per- formed MYLK sequencing and identified coding and non-coding MYLK single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that contribute to ARDS susceptibility and to ARDS outcomes. In addition, many ARDS SNPs were profoundly over-represented in individuals of African descent (AD), a population at risk for reduced survival in ARDS. We will address the functionality of 29 carefully-selected MYLK SNPs that are potentially involved in the dual EC barrier-regulatory roles of nmMLCK both in the development of ARDS and VILI and in the recovery phase associated with EC barrier restoration. The mechanisms involved in regulation of nmMLCK expression are very poorly understood. SA #1 will build upon our recently published studies to characterize the effects of 5' promoter and 3' UTR MYLK SNPs on genetic/epigenetic regulation of nmMLCK expression. Continuing our structure/function interrogation of MYLK, we recently employed RNA sequencing analysis and corroborated our published studies that human lung EC exhibit substantial expression of a unique 1845 aa nmMLCK splice variant, nmMLCK2, generated by a splicing deletion of exon11. As our data indicate that lung EC exposure to inflammatory agonists and excessive mechanical stress selectively increases nmMLCK2 expression, SA #2 will examine the influence of MYLK SNPs and specific splicing factors on the regulation of nmMLCK mRNA splice variant generation. SA #3 will extend our prior studies on the regulatory influence of post-translational modifications (PTMs) such as phosphorylation of Y464 and Y471 located in the spliced out exon 11. SA #3 will further evaluate the effects of PTMs and N-terminal coding SNPs on nmMLCK1 and nmMLCK2 spatially- directed kinase activities, structure/function relationships, and EC barrier responses (peripheral cytoskeletal remodeling, lamellipodia formation, paracellular gap regulation). Finally, SA #4 will validate the in vivo effects of selected nmMLCK coding SNPs and PTMs as well as define nmMLCK antagonism as a potentially novel therapy in preclinical ARDS and VILI models. These highly integrated system biology approaches will allow us to clarify the contributions of lung EC cytoskeletal variants, PTMs and SNPs to ARDS and VILI pathobiology, enhance therapeutic targeting of lung vascular barrier dysregulation, and increase knowledge of the genetic basis for ARDS health disparities.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) is a devastating consequence of systemic inflammatory conditions (such as sepsis) that afflicts an estimated 200,000 people a year in the US with 75,000 deaths. No specific therapy is available to target the underlying mechanistic causes of this syndrome. This proposal seeks to better understand the role of the MYLK gene, its protein product, nmMLCK, and cytoskeletal contractile mechanisms in regulating the pulmonary vascular leak that occurs in this syndrome in order to develop precise, individualized therapies for the critically ill.                ",Regulation of nonmuscle myosin light chain kinase structure and function of ARDS,9027960,R01HL125615,"['Bronchial Asthma ', ' Asthma ', ' driving ', ' Automobile Driving ', ' vascular ', ' Blood Vessels ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cells ', ' Critically Ill ', ' Critical Illness ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Enzyme Gene ', ' Enzymes ', ' Exhibits ', ' Exons ', ' Genes ', ' genetically engineered ', ' Recombinant DNA Technology ', ' Genetic Engineering Molecular Biology ', ' Genetic Engineering Biotechnology ', ' Genetic Engineering ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' In Vitro ', ' pulmonary ', ' Lung Respiratory System ', ' Lung ', ' Murine ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Mice ', ' Mus ', ' smooth muscle myosin light chain kinase ', ' Myosin light chain kinase 2, skeletal/cardiac muscle ', ' Myosin Regulatory Light-Chain Kinase ', ' Myosin Light Polypeptide Kinase ', ' Myosin Light Chain Kinase, Smooth Muscle and Non-Muscle Isozymes ', ' Myosin LCK ', ' Myosin Kinase ', ' MYLK2 ', ' EC 2.7.1.117 ', ' Myosin Light Chain Kinase ', ' Protein Phosphorylation ', ' Phosphorylation ', ' Transphosphorylases ', ' Phosphotransferase Gene ', ' Kinases ', ' Phosphotransferases ', ' Protein Modification ', ' Posttranslational Protein Processing ', ' Posttranslational Modifications ', ' Post-Translational Protein Modification ', ' Post-Translational Modifications ', ' Post-Translational Modification Protein/Amino Acid Biochemistry ', ' Post-Translational Protein Processing ', ' Proteins ', ' Publishing ', ' wet lung ', ' Stiff lung ', ' Shock Lung ', ' Da Nang Lung ', ' Adult RDS ', ' Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome ', ' ARDS ', ' Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome ', ' Risk ', ' Splicing ', ' RNA Splicing ', ' mRNA ', ' Messenger RNA ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Mechanical Stress ', ' structure function relationship ', ' chemical structure function ', ' Structure-Activity Relationship ', ' Syndrome ', ' Testing ', ' Generations ', ' promoter ', ' promotor ', ' RNA Sequence Analyses ', ' RNA Sequence Analysis ', ' base ', ' Peripheral ', ' Phase ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Null Mouse ', ' Knock-out Mice ', ' KO mice ', ' Knockout Mice ', ' Evaluation ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Predisposition ', ' Endothelial Cells ', ' Individual ', ' Recovery ', ' African ', ' Populations at Risk ', ' Agonist ', ' lung injury ', ' Genetic ', ' Exposure to ', ' Inflammatory ', ' Knowledge ', ' Severities ', ' Event ', ' restoration ', ' Isoforms ', ' Protein Isoforms ', ' trafficking ', "" 3'UTR "", "" 3' Untranslated Regions "", ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Protein Gene Products ', ' Gene Proteins ', ' Single Base Polymorphism ', ' Single Nucleotide Polymorphism ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Regulation ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' Stress Fibers ', ' Nontranslated RNA ', ' Noncoding RNA ', ' Non-Coding RNA ', ' Non-Coding ', ' Functional RNA ', ' Untranslated RNA ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' nonmuscle myosin ', ' non-muscle myosin ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' protein expression ', ' Candidate Gene ', ' Candidate Disease Gene ', ' MYLK ', ' MLCK210 ', ' MLCK108 ', ' MLCK ', ' FLJ12216 ', ' MYLK gene ', ' Address ', ' Systems Biology ', ' Data ', ' Resolution ', ' in vivo ', ' cell stress ', ' Cellular Stress ', ' Epigenetic Mechanism ', ' Epigenetic Change ', ' Epigenetic ', ' Epigenetic Process ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' preclinical ', ' pre-clinical ', ' bloodstream infection ', ' Sepsis ', ' Ventilator-induced lung injury ', ' Outcome ', ' N-terminal ', ' NH2-terminal ', ' novel therapeutics ', ' novel therapy ', ' novel drugs ', ' novel drug treatments ', ' next generation therapeutics ', ' new therapy ', ' new therapeutics ', ' new drugs ', ' new drug treatments ', ' therapeutic target ', ' public health relevance ', ' epigenetic regulation ', ' ']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF ARIZONA,R01,2016,262106,0.03073445685362581
"Hemoglobin Modifiers for Sickle Cell Disease Therapy DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our goal is to design and establish novel therapeutic agents for sickle cell disease (SCD), namely drugs that inhibit the initial sickle hemoglobin (HbS) polymerization and the subsequent pathophysiology. When deoxygenated, HbS polymerizes into long, rigid, and insoluble fibers causing red blood cells (RBCs) to sickle, a process worsened by the unusual low affinity of HbS for oxygen, resulting in premature release of oxygen. Based on several evidence--our preliminary data, studies by others, and the results of a recently completed phase I/II clinical testing of our lead compound, 5-HMF (an allosteric effector of Hb, AEH)-we hypothesize that AEHs, not only prevent HbS polymerization, but also mitigates several secondary sickling related pathological events that include inflammation, oxidative stress/damage, RBC hemolysis, and pain. We also have preliminary evidence that our next generation AEHs (INN- and TD-series) exhibit enhanced potency and improved in-vitro duration of action. These AEHs act via a novel mechanism of action, i.e., destabilize HbS polymer contacts, in addition to increasing Hb affinity for oxygen; providing positive synergistic effects. We propose to test our hypothesis by further investigating candidate drugs from the INN- and TD-series, as well as derivatives of 5-HMF and INN-312 for their pharmacologic properties, focusing on the secondary SCD pathways, as well as the underlying HbS polymerization problem using our model systems. The specific aims are: 1. Design and synthesis of novel allosteric effectors of hemoglobin (AEHs). We will modify our parent compounds and synthesize derivatives with enhanced efficacy and prolonged half-lives. We will also synthesize prod rugs to protect the active aldehyde functional moiety from aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH)- mediated metabolism as necessary. 2. Investigate in-vitro functional, ant sickling, and cytotoxicity activities of novel AEHs. We will investigate the AEHs for their in-vitro ant sickling/functional activities (RBC sickling tests, P50 analyses, HbS solubility, and Hb adduct formation), and carefully monitor for adverse effects. 3. Determine in-vivo/in-vitro PK/PD properties, binding and metabolism and evaluate preclinical efficacy of AEHs in SCD Berkeley mice. We will show that serum albumin binding and/or metabolism by ALDH in RBC or hepatic cytosol are not likely to adversely affect in-vivo pharmacologic activity. We will demonstrate using a Berkeley mouse model of SCD transgenic mice that AEHs show potent pharmacologic effects, increase short- and long-term survival rates of mice. We will also study their potential beneficial effects, e.g. amelioration of hemolysis, inflammation, endothelial damage, and overall reversal of the SCD pathophysiology observed in this model. 4. Determine the atomic interactions between AEHs and Hb. X-ray crystallography will be used to validate our hypothesis that AEH potency is directly dependent upon their abilities to bind Hb with their pyridyl substituents toward the surface of the Hb molecule. The structures would provide valuable insight to help guide rational modifications for better pharmacologic properties. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Sickle cell disease (SCD) is the most common inherited hematologic disorder, affecting over 80,000 people, primarily African-American in the US, exacerbating the disproportionate health disparity among this minority population. Most common therapeutic intervention includes blood transfusions and hydroxyurea therapies, however, these therapies are associated with some undesirable side effects and not all patients benefit from the treatment. Thus, there is still a need to develop new, more effective and non-toxic therapeutic agents against this debilitating disease.",Hemoglobin Modifiers for Sickle Cell Disease Therapy,9247343,R01MD009124,"['Affect ', ' Aldehydes ', ' sicklemia ', ' sickle disease ', ' sickle cell disease ', ' Hemoglobin sickle cell disorder ', ' Hemoglobin sickle cell disease ', ' Hemoglobin S Disease ', ' HbSS disease ', ' Hb SS disease ', ' Sickle Cell Anemia ', ' Antisickling Drugs ', ' Antisickling Agents ', ' Ants ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Physiologic Availability ', ' Biologic Availability ', ' Bioavailability ', ' Biological Availability ', ' Blood Transfusion ', ' Cellular Adhesion ', ' Cell Adhesion ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cells ', ' Cytosol ', ' body water dehydration ', ' Dehydration ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Endothelium ', ' blood corpuscles ', ' Red blood corpuscule ', ' Red Cell ', ' Red Blood Cells ', ' Marrow erythrocyte ', ' Erythrocytic ', ' Erythrocytes Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Blood normocyte ', ' Blood erythrocyte ', ' Erythrocytes ', ' Exhibits ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Hemoglobin S ', ' Sickle Hemoglobin ', ' Hemoglobin ', ' Hemolysis ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' hydroxy-urea ', ' Hydroxycarbamide ', ' Hydroxycarbamid ', ' hydroxyurea ', ' In Vitro ', ' Inflammation ', ' Kinetics ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Metabolic Processes ', ' Intermediary Metabolism ', ' Metabolism ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Transgenic Mice ', ' Model System ', ' Biologic Models ', ' Biological Models ', ' Murine ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Mice ', ' Mus ', ' O2 element ', ' O element ', ' Oxygen ', ' Painful ', ' Pain ', ' Parents ', ' Patients ', ' well-being ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' Polymers ', ' Pro-Drugs ', ' Drug Precursors ', ' Prodrugs ', ' Rats Mammals ', ' Rat ', ' Common Rat Strains ', ' Rattus ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Serum Albumin ', ' Solubility ', ' Survival Rate ', ' Testing ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Tissues ', ' Toxicology ', ' vanillin ', ' vanillaldehyde ', ' 4-hydroxy-3-methoxybenzaldehyde ', ' Generations ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Mediating ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Hepatic ', ' Surface ', ' Acute ', ' prematurity ', ' premature ', ' Phase ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Biological ', ' Series ', ' Xray Crystallography ', ' X-Ray/Neutron Crystallography ', ' X-Ray Diffraction Crystallography ', ' X Ray Crystallographies ', ' Single Crystal Diffraction ', ' X-Ray Crystallography ', ' sickle red blood cell ', ' sickle erythrocyte ', ' sickle RBC ', ' drepanocyte ', ' Sickle Cell ', ' Blood flow ', ' insight ', ' Oxidative Stress ', ' Disease Progression ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Physiopathology ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Therapeutic Agents ', ' polymerization ', ' Hereditary ', ' Inherited ', ' Event ', ' Oral ', ' System ', ' adduct ', ' Lytotoxicity ', ' cytotoxicity ', ' experience ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' ALDH ', ' aldehyde dehydrogenases ', ' intervention therapy ', ' Therapeutic Intervention ', ' Modeling ', ' Property ', ' Adverse Experience ', ' Adverse event ', ' treatment adverse effect ', ' therapy adverse effect ', ' side effect ', ' Treatment Side Effects ', ' Adverse effects ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' Binding ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Hydration ', ' Hydration status ', ' p50 ', ' Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor Superfamily Member 5 Gene ', ' TNFRSF5 ', ' MGC9013 ', ' CDW40 ', ' CD40 ', ' Bp50 ', ' TNFRSF5 gene ', ' Dose ', ' Affinity ', ' Data ', ' Disease Pathway ', ' in vivo ', ' clinical test ', ' Clinical Testing ', ' Clinical Evaluation ', ' research clinical testing ', ' Monitor ', ' cell morphology ', ' Cellular Morphology ', ' Process ', ' Modification ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' insoluble fiber ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' next generation ', ' Minority ', ' sickling ', ' Population ', ' novel therapeutics ', ' novel therapy ', ' novel drugs ', ' novel drug treatments ', ' next generation therapeutics ', ' new therapy ', ' new therapeutics ', ' new drugs ', ' new drug treatments ', ' mouse model ', ' murine model ', ' Biological Markers ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' preclinical efficacy ', ' drug candidate ', ' Regimen ', ' atomic interactions ', ' health care disparity ', ' healthcare disparity ', ' disparity in healthcare ', ' disparity in care ', ' ']",NIMHD,VIRGINIA COMMONWEALTH UNIVERSITY,R01,2016,78708,0.08070170044325091
"MOLECULAR BASIS FOR THE IMPACT OF SEX BRAIN TUMORIGENESIS DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Primary and metastatic brain tumors occur more commonly in males than females. This is true regardless of age or region of the world. Thus, sex must affect fundamental mechanisms of neoplastic growth in the central nervous system. In preliminary studies we established conditions that result in the transformation of male but not female astrocytes. This experimental paradigm is an unprecedented opportunity to define the molecular basis for the effects of sex on tumorigenesis. We found that sex affects global gene expression, activation of the tumor suppressor p21cip1, induction of a stem cell phenotype, growth kinetics, cellular senescence and patterns of intracranial malignant growth. Moreover, we found sex differences in human GBM stem cells. In this proposal we will exploit these murine and human GBM models to define the molecular basis for the effect of sex on brain tumorigenesis. In Specific Aim 1 we build on preliminary findings that sexually dimorphic expression of the growth inhibitory molecule p202 results in differential induction of the tumor suppressor p21cip1 and thereby blocks transformation in female astrocytes. In Specific Aim 2 we will follow up on preliminary studies that indicate stem cells are more easily induced in male astrocytes and define how sex, multiple initiating oncogenic events, X chromosome reactivation and cell of origin interact to regulate transformation. In Specific Aim 3 we perform validation studies with human male and female GBM stem cell cultures and test the hypothesis that sex differences in GBM stem cells will impact on responses to therapeutic targeting of CXCR4. Together these studies will advance of fundamental knowledge of cancer biology and have the potential to impact on our approach to treating patients with malignant brain tumors. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Successful cancer therapy may require tailoring treatment approaches to the individual and their unique cancer.

"Exosomes Promote Disease Aggressiveness in African American Prostate Cancer ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Prostate cancer (PCA) exhibits the most striking racial disparity as African American men are at higher risk of being diagnosed and dying of PCA, in comparison with Caucasian men. Although, multiple factors including socio-economic status contribute to this disparity but it is essential to identify the molecular and underlying biological differences that contribute to the more aggressive phenotype in African American PCA. There have been several studies investigating the genetic and epigenetic differences between African American and Caucasian PCA; however in the past, limited attention has been given to the role of tumor microenvironment contributing towards disease aggressiveness in African American PCA. In this regard, our preliminary studies discovered a unique capability of African American PCA cells to survive under hypoxic (low oxygen condition) conditions dependent upon cellular RAB5A expression, the master regulator of exosomes biogenesis, as the survival of African American PCA cells was completely compromised in RAB5A knock-down condition. More importantly, compared to Caucasian PCA cells, African American PCA cells secreted significantly higher amount of exosomes under hypoxic conditions. Interestingly, African American PCA cells seem to better adapt to hypoxia through exporting metabolic product lactic acid packaged in exosomes. Recent studies have also provided ample evidence that lactic acid is used not only as a fuel for bioenergy and biosynthesis but lactic acid also activates several mitogenic signaling pathways in various tumor microenvironment cellular components including endothelial cells, fibroblasts, macrophages and PCA cells in the normoxic areas. Taken together, we hypothesize that ""African American PCA cells have the unique capability to survive hypoxia via RAB5A-mediated exosomes secretion loaded with lactic acid, and the secreted exosomes promote extensive tumor microenvironment remodeling and disease aggressiveness'. Following specific aims are proposed to test our hypothesis: (I) to characterize and establish RAB5A role in exosomes secretion and survival of African American PCA cells under hypoxia; and (II) to examine and establish the role of exosomes secreted by African American PCA cells in tumor microenvironment remodeling. Proposed studies will bring a paradigm shift in our approach to understand and treat PCA in African American men brining greater focus on tumor microenvironment both for prognosis as well as treatment purposes. Overall, present proposal is highly significant and will help to narrow the huge health disparity gap faced by African American PCA patients, and reduce the PCA-caused mortality and morbidity in these patients. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Prostate cancer (PCA) exhibits the most striking racial disparity as African American men are at higher risk of being diagnosed and dying of PCA, in comparison with Caucasian men, and therefore this is an important public health issue.

"Molecular Classification of High Grade Endometrial Cancers: Extending TCGA Findings to a Diverse Population ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Endometrial cancer is the most common gynecological cancer and incidence is increasing in the United States. It also has one of the largest survival disparities of all common cancers, with approximately 20% fewer African American women surviving 5 years after diagnosis compared to white women, and this disparity holds across stages and histologic subtypes. Here we seek to examine a particularly aggressive subtype of endometrial cancers, high grade tumors including endometrioid, serous, clear cell and mixed carcinomas. These cancers are responsible for a disproportionate number of deaths from endometrial cancer, and are also more frequently diagnosed in African Americans. Specifically, we aim to: 1. Assess progression free survival and endometrial cancer-related survival in 500 women (250 African American, 250 white) diagnosed with high grade endometrial cancers, as defined by current pathologic standards; 2. Molecularly characterize (through whole exome sequencing and gene expression analysis) tumors from these women who received surgical treatment at two large research hospitals in Detroit, Michigan. We will perform integrated analysis to classify the tumors into biologically and clinically relevant groups and 3. Analyze the performance of the molecular classifications with respect to progression free survival and endometrial cancer- related survival, adjusting for relevant demographic, clinical, co-morbidity and treatment information. Preliminary work in this area has been done by The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), but the tumors included were primarily from white women, with only 10 endometrioid and 11 serous tumors from African American women used to inform the molecular reclassification analysis. Thus, our project will address a large gap in current knowledge. Public Health Significance: The identification of novel somatic mutations and understanding of the spectrum of molecular variation, particularly among African Americans, will help us move further toward personalized medicine, with the potential to reduce the racial disparities in endometrial cancer survival and ultimately improve survival for all women with endometrial cancer.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This application seeks to examine genomic variation in high grade endometrial cancers from African American and white women. The racial disparity in survival is one of the greatest of all cancers, and persists after controlling for histology, stage and treatment. We hypothesize that the underlying tumor biology is one factor driving this disparity, but data are sparse for African American women.            ",Molecular Classification of High Grade Endometrial Cancers: Extending TCGA Findings to a Diverse Population,9122874,R01CA200864,"['abstracting ', ' Accounting ', ' Affect ', ' driving ', ' Automobile Driving ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' epithelial carcinoma ', ' Malignant Epithelial Tumors ', ' Malignant Epithelial Neoplasms ', ' Carcinoma ', ' Systematics ', ' Classification ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Comorbidity ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Neoplasm of the Endometrium ', ' Endometrium Tumor ', ' Endometrial Tumor ', ' Endometrial Neoplasms ', ' Therapeutic Estrogen ', ' Estrogens ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Female ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Histology ', ' Hospitals ', ' Hysterectomy ', ' Incidence ', ' Medical Records ', ' Michigan ', ' genome mutation ', ' Genetic defect ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Mutation ', ' Utrogestan ', ' Therapeutic Progestin ', ' Syngesterone ', ' Proluton ', ' Prolidon ', ' Progeston ', ' Progestol ', ' Progestogens ', ' Progestogel ', ' Progesterone Agents ', ' Progestational Hormones ', ' Progestational Compounds ', ' Progestational Agents ', ' Progestasert ', ' Progestagenic Agents ', ' Lutromone ', ' Lutogyl ', ' Lutocylin M ', ' Lutocyclin ', ' Luteohormone ', ' Lipo-Lutin ', ' Gestone ', ' Gestiron ', ' Gestagens ', ' Gestagenic Agents ', ' Cyclogest ', ' Corluvite ', ' Corlutina ', ' Progestins ', ' Prognosis ', ' outcome forecast ', ' Public Health ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Research ', ' Survival Analyses ', ' Survival Analysis ', ' United States ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' population diversity ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' diverse populations ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Histologically ', ' Histologic ', ' Clear Cell ', ' Progression-Free Survivals ', ' Exposure to ', ' Staging ', ' Knowledge ', ' Frequencies ', ' Serous ', ' Female Reproductive Endometrioid Tumor ', ' Female Reproductive Endometrioid Neoplasm ', ' Endometrioid Tumor of the Female Reproductive System ', ' Endometrioid Neoplasm of the Female Reproductive System ', ' Endometrioid Neoplasm ', ' Endometrioid Tumor ', ' Tumor Tissue ', ' Endometrium Carcinoma ', ' Endometrium Cancer ', ' Endometrial Cancer ', ' Endometrial Carcinoma ', ' surgery ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' Somatic Mutation ', ' Performance ', ' Adjuvant Therapy ', ' novel ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Female Reproductive System ', ' Malignant Gynecologic Tumor ', ' Malignant Gynecologic Neoplasm ', ' Gynecological Cancer ', ' Gynecologic Cancer ', ' Female Reproductive Cancer ', ' Malignant Female Reproductive System Neoplasm ', ' gene expression assay ', ' gene expression analysis ', ' Transcript Expression Analysis ', ' Transcript Expression Analyses ', ' Gene Expression Pattern Analysis ', ' Gene Expression Monitoring ', ' Gene Expression Profiling ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Microsatellite Instability ', ' cancer diagnosis ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' Address ', ' genomic alteration ', ' Sequence Alteration ', ' Genetic mutation ', ' DNA mutation ', ' DNA Alteration ', ' DNA Sequence Alteration ', ' Data ', ' Molecular Analysis ', ' molecular signature ', ' molecular profile ', ' Molecular Fingerprinting ', ' Expression Profiling ', ' Molecular Profiling ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Tissue-Specific Differential Gene Expression ', ' Differential Gene Expression ', ' Tissue-Specific Gene Expression ', ' Tumor Biology ', ' Pathologic ', ' Molecular ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' aged ', ' hormone related cancer ', ' clinically relevant ', ' clinical relevance ', ' tumor ', ' high risk ', ' public health relevance ', ' The Cancer Genome Atlas ', ' TCGA ', ' transcriptome sequencing ', ' RNAseq ', ' RNA sequencing ', ' RNA Seq ', ' exome sequencing ', ' personalized medicine ', ' personalized treatment ', ' personalized therapy ', ' personalization of treatment ', ' genomic variation ', ' racial disparity ', ' race disparity ', ' disparities in race ', ' improved outcome ', ' study population ', ' cancer survival ', ' ']",NCI,WAYNE STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2016,594568,0.02883966017982795

"Gender Disparity in Bladder Cancer and Chemopreventive Intervention DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Bladder cancer (BC) is the 4th most common cancer in men, but BC incidence is nearly 4 fold higher in men than in women across race; the underlying cause is not understood. Lack of such knowledge impedes progress in BC prevention. On the basis of our published and unpublished data, we hypothesize that hepatic UDP-glucuronosyltransferase 1A3 (UGT1A3) is a key determinant of the gender disparity in human BC development through converting androgen signal to increased urinary delivery of arylamine carcinogens to bladder tissue. Arylamines, 4-aminobiphenyl (ABP) in particular, are the main cause of human BC. We also hypothesize that sulforaphane (SF), a common dietary phytochemical, can block UGT1A3 from promoting arylamine-induced bladder carcinogenesis by boosting cytoprotective defense in the bladder. These hypotheses will be examined in four specific aims using complementary approaches of cultured cells and transgenic mouse models. Aim 1 is to test our hypothesis that liver UGT1A3 is a key molecule that determines the gender disparity in BC development. Wild-type mice and UGT1A3 transgenic mice (liver- specific and androgen-independent expression) will be compared for ABP-induced bladder carcinogenesis. Comparison will also be made between mice with and without castration. Another carcinogen 2- acetylaminofluorene (2-AAF) will be used to rule out ABP-specific effects. Aim 2 is to assess the impact of UGT1A3 polymorphism on its catalytic activity toward ABP and 2-AAF and on the susceptibility of bladder cells and liver cells to DNA damage induced by ABP and 2-AAF. Six single nucleotide polymorphisms occur in UGT1A3 gene. All the polymorphic variants together with the wild-type gene will be evaluated. Aim 3 is to test our hypothesis that SF can block UGT1A3 from promoting bladder carcinogenesis by stimulating cytoprotective defense against arylamine carcinogens (ABP and 2-AAF) in the bladder, without modulating UGT1A3 in the liver. Non-interference of liver UGT1A3 may be desirable, since this enzyme may be physiologically important, such as metabolizing estrone. SF is a promising cancer-preventive agent and is selectively delivered to bladder tissue through urinary excretion. Two animal models will be used to test the hypothesis, including the UGT1A3 mouse model described above and the Tg-UGT1 mouse model (mice carry both the coding and the regulatory sequences of the human UGT1A3 gene). Aim 4 is to confirm that UGT1A3 is transcriptionally stimulated by androgen in vivo and to elucidate the molecular mechanism by which androgen stimulates UGT1A3. This will be accomplished by using both cell models and the Tg-UGT1 mouse model. Impact: The proposed studies are expected to lead to the elucidation of the molecular basis of the gender disparity in BC and the development of new strategy for effective prevention of this disease. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: It has been known for several decades that the incidence of bladder cancer is nearly 4 fold higher in men than in women across race, but the reason has remained poorly understood. Lack of such knowledge impedes progress in bladder cancer prevention, and no chemopreventive agent is currently available for prevention of bladder cancer. This application will examine the hypothesis that UGT1A3 is a key determinant of gender disparity in human bladder cancer development and also examine the hypothesis that sulforaphane, a common dietary phytochemical, can block the bladder cancer-promoting activity of UGT1A3 and inhibit bladder cancer development, and the project is expected to significantly advance the knowledge about bladder cancer and to lead to development of a new strategy for effective prevention of this disease.",Gender Disparity in Bladder Cancer and Chemopreventive Intervention,8990959,R01CA164574,"['N-9H-fluoren-2-yl-acetamide ', ' N-2-Fluorenylacetamide ', ' Fluoren-2-ylacetamide ', ' 2-Fluorenylacetamide ', ' 2-Acetamidofluorene ', ' 2-AAF ', ' 2-Acetylaminofluorene ', ' Accounting ', ' Therapeutic Androgen ', ' Androgenic Compounds ', ' Androgenic Agents ', ' Androgens ', ' urinary bladder ', ' Bladder Urinary System ', ' Bladder ', ' Urinary Bladder Malignant Tumor ', ' Urinary Bladder Cancer ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Bladder ', ' Malignant Bladder Neoplasm ', ' Bladder Cancer ', ' Malignant neoplasm of urinary bladder ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' oncogenic agent ', ' Oncogens ', ' Cancer Causing Agents ', ' Carcinogens ', ' Environmental Carcinogens ', ' Surgical Castration ', ' Castration ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cells ', ' Cultured Cells ', ' DNA Injury ', ' DNA Damage ', ' Enzyme Gene ', ' Enzymes ', ' Therapeutic Estrone ', ' Estrone ', ' Family ', ' Female ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Genes ', ' Health ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Incidence ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' hepatic organ system ', ' hepatic body system ', ' Liver ', ' male ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Metabolic Activation ', ' detoxification ', ' Metabolism of Toxic Agents ', ' Metabolic Drug Detoxications ', ' Drug Metabolic Detoxification ', ' Drug Metabolic Detoxication ', ' Transgenic Mice ', ' Murine ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Mice ', ' Mus ', ' Parents ', ' Play ', ' polymorphism ', ' Genetic Polymorphism ', ' Pseudogenes ', ' Publishing ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Risk Factors ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Testing ', ' Glucuronosyltransferase ', ' UDP Glucuronyl Transferase ', ' UDP Glucuronosyltransferase ', ' Glucuronyltransferase ', ' Glucuronic Transferase ', ' United States ', ' Urine ', ' Urine Urinary System ', ' Woman ', ' 4-biphenylamine ', ' 4-aminodiphenyl ', ' 4-aminobiphenyl ', ' Gender ', ' sulforophane ', ' sulforafan ', ' methylsulfoxybutylisothiocyanate ', ' Sulfaforaphane ', ' Sulforaphane ', ' base ', ' Hepatic ', ' Phase ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Predisposition ', ' excretion ', ' Excretory function ', ' Liver Cells ', ' Hepatic Parenchymal Cell ', ' Hepatic Cells ', ' Hepatocyte ', ' Carcinogen-DNA Adducts ', ' DNA Adducts ', ' Exposure to ', ' malignant liver tumor ', ' liver cancer ', ' Hepatic Cancer ', ' Malignant neoplasm of liver ', ' Knowledge ', ' Tobacco smoke ', ' Source ', ' UGT1A5 ', ' UGT1A1 ', ' UGT1A ', ' UGT1 ', ' UDP glycosyltransferase gene 1 ', ' UDP glycosyltransferase 1 family, polypeptide A1 Gene ', ' GNT1 ', ' UGT1A1 gene ', ' Cancer Induction ', ' carcinogenesis ', ' chemical carcinogenesis ', ' Isoforms ', ' Protein Isoforms ', ' model organism ', ' Animal Models and Related Studies ', ' Animal Model ', ' expectation ', ' disease prevention ', ' disorder prevention ', ' Arylamines ', ' Aromatic Amines ', ' Single Base Polymorphism ', ' Single Nucleotide Polymorphism ', ' Glucuronides ', ' Glucuronic Acids ', ' bladder cancer prevention ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Preventive ', ' Bladder Tissue ', ' Data ', ' in vivo ', ' anticarcinogenic ', ' Chemopreventive ', ' Chemopreventive Agent ', ' Wild Type Mouse ', ' Molecular ', ' urinary ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Dietary Phytochemical ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel approaches ', ' new approaches ', ' novel strategies ', ' Carcinogen exposure ', ' Cell model ', ' Cellular model ', ' mouse model ', ' murine model ', ' overexpression ', ' overexpress ', ' over-expression ', ' gender disparity ', ' ']",NCI,ROSWELL PARK CANCER INSTITUTE CORP,R01,2016,330992,0.06879040337032251
"Implementation of Medical Homes for Evidence Based Care of Adolescents and Adults with Sickle Cell Disease PROJECT SUMMARY Life expectancy for patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) has increased from teens to late forties over the last 30 years. The increase in the number of adults with the disease has created new unmet needs, due to the heavy disease burden and organ damage which increase with age. This is confounded by the inability of the health care system to adequately meet the needs of this population, and thus has resulted in disparities and increase in health care costs. This project attempts to address these problems by creating medical homes and medical neighborhoods in four different settings throughout rural Georgia, which has the fourth largest population of patients with SCD in the country. This will be achieved by building on the GRU Sickle Cell Center's experience in taking care of SCD patients through its outreach clinics, and more recently through its partnership with primary care practices and Hematology/Oncology practices at different locations in the state. In the first two years of the project (Phase I) a needs assessment of patients, communities, and providers will be carried out and a Community Advisory Council will be established. The results of this needs assessment will be used to develop and implement interventions to establish medical homes and neighborhoods to improve evidence-based care for SCD patients in Phase II. PROJECT NARRATIVE Advances in the diagnosis and care of infants and children with sickle cell disease (SCD) has led to an increase in life expectancy of this population and an increase in the number of adults with the disease. Chronic organ damage associated with the natural history of the disease on one hand, and challenges imposed by the health care system (large number of uninsured/underinsured patients, stigmatization, paucity of adult providers with expertise in the care of SCD) on the other, have created unmet needs. This project, in response to RFA HL- 16010, builds on the 30-year experience of the GRU Sickle Cell Center in providing care to patients with SCD in rural Georgia through its extensive outreach clinics and proposes to address these unmet needs by the creation of patient-centered medical homes and neighborhoods in four diverse health care settings.",Implementation of Medical Homes for Evidence Based Care of Adolescents and Adults with Sickle Cell Disease,9180526,U01HL134004,"['Adoption ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Age ', ' sicklemia ', ' sickle disease ', ' sickle cell disease ', ' Hemoglobin sickle cell disorder ', ' Hemoglobin sickle cell disease ', ' Hemoglobin S Disease ', ' HbSS disease ', ' Hb SS disease ', ' Sickle Cell Anemia ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Communities ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Faculty ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Hematology ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' hydroxy-urea ', ' Hydroxycarbamide ', ' Hydroxycarbamid ', ' hydroxyurea ', ' infant health care ', ' Infant Care ', ' Interview ', ' Life Expectancy ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' newborn screening ', ' Newborn Infant Screening ', ' Neonatal Screening ', ' Painful ', ' Pain ', ' Patients ', ' Penicillin Antibiotics ', ' Penicillins ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Primary Care ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' recruit ', ' active recruitment ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' Registries ', ' Research ', ' Stigmatization ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Universities ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Underinsured ', ' Uninsured ', ' chronic pain ', ' chronic painful condition ', ' Caring ', ' Guidelines ', ' Practice Guidelines ', ' base ', ' Organ ', ' improved ', ' Acute Pain ', ' Site ', ' Acute ', ' Chronic ', ' Phase ', ' Medical ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Adolescent ', ' sickle red blood cell ', ' sickle erythrocyte ', ' sickle RBC ', ' drepanocyte ', ' Sickle Cell ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' Individual ', ' Rural ', ' Funding ', ' Oncology Cancer ', ' oncology ', ' Letters ', ' Home ', ' Home environment ', ' Clinic ', ' prophylactic ', ' Location ', ' Country ', ' interest ', ' meetings ', ' Needs Assessment ', ' experience ', ' cohort ', ' disease natural history ', ' Participant ', ' member ', ' outreach ', ' Benefits and Risks ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' disease registry ', ' education planning ', ' patient registry ', ' Provider ', ' Address ', ' Adherence ', ' Consent ', ' Data ', ' Clinical Management ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' teen years ', ' Teen ', ' Teenagers ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' NHLBI ', ' National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute ', ' years of life lost to disease ', ' years of life lost to disability ', ' disease burden ', ' burden of disease ', ' burden of illness ', ' implementation research ', ' underserved people ', ' under served population ', ' Underserved Population ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' patient oriented ', ' patient centered ', ' eligible participant ', ' implementation science ', ' clinical care ', ' evidence base ', ' FDA approved ', ' patient population ', ' effective therapy ', ' effective treatment ', ' Emergency Department Physician ', ' Emergency room physician ', ' Emergency Physician ', ' ER physician ', ' ED Physician ', ' ']",NHLBI,AUGUSTA UNIVERSITY,U01,2016,666408,0.05937433704956774
"Uterine Leiomyoma Development in Mouse Models DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Uterine fibroids (leiomyomata uteri) are the most common tumors in the female reproductive tract. Some estimates indicate that more than 50% of American women have uterine fibroids. Additionally, there is a significant disparity in the incidence of fibroids since African-American women are 2-3 times more likely to develop fibroids. These tumors can be very painful and are a leading cause of infertility in women. Also, because these tumors can become very large, and although the uterus is indispensable for mammalian reproduction, they remain the main reason for hysterectomies in the US. Despite the healthcare burden caused by uterine fibroids, their etiology and pathophysiology are unknown. We have developed mutant mice in which nuclear ß-catenin signaling has been specifically induced in reproductive tract tissues. Normally, mice do not develop fibroids; however, these mutant mice develop smooth muscle tumors in their uteri with 100% penetrance by 8 weeks of age. These tumors exhibit characteristics of human fibroids by histological and immunohistochemical criteria. ß-Catenin, a well-known downstream effector of Wnt signaling, induces organ and tissue malformations and tumor development following dysregulation of its activity. The mice also express higher levels of mTor, as observed in the Tsc2-mutant Eker rat fibroid model and in approximately 50% of human fibroids, suggesting that mTor activation may be a common pathway in leiomyoma development. We will investigate this mouse model further, placing particular emphasis on the regulation of mTor gene expression and activity for comparison with other mutant mouse models lacking myometrial Lkb1, the gene mutated in patients with Peutz-Jeghers Syndrome, and Tsc1, both of which also induce mTor activity and induce uterine fibroids as shown in our preliminary results. We propose to investigate the intracellular mechanisms and pathways affected by dysregulated Wnt/ß-catenin in our unique mouse model that induce mTor activity for comparison with Lkb1- and Tsc2-deleted uteri. To better understand the etiology and pathogenesis of fibroids, we will study the molecular mechanisms controlling fibrosis in the mutant myometrial cells such as cell polarity, extracellular matrix deposition, and myometrial differentiation. We will determine which characteristics of the mouse models most closely resemble human leiomyomas and are best suited for preclinical studies. Lastly, we will determine whether disrupted Wnt/ß-catenin signaling contributes to human leiomyoma development. The results from the studies in this proposal will provide new insights into the etiology and progression of these tumors, as well as provide the rationale for investigating therapies targeting the mechanisms involved in leiomyoma development and progression. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Uterine fibroids affect approximately 50% of American women during their reproductive years and are a significant source of pelvic pain, abnormal uterine bleeding, and infertility. Despite the major health care burden posed by uterine fibroids, very little is known about their cause or the best treatment strategies. As a result, if the symptoms are severe enough, patients can be managed by surgical intervention. The overall aims of the proposed studies are to understand the underlying causes of uterine fibroid development and growth and to develop new therapeutic options that could offer a safer alternative

"Targeted Combination Therapy for Lung Cancer DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Lung cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer deaths in the US with 5 year survival rate of ~15% due to the lack of specificity, poor efficacy, and side effects associated with current therapies. The lung cancer incidences are highest in African Americans, American Indians/Alaska Natives, and Pacific Islanders. The non- small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is most prevalent (~80% occurrence) among lung cancer patient. NSCLC has wide molecular heterogeneity, which mandates simultaneous targeting of multiple pathways. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) gene over-expression (in ~90% of NSCLC's) is associated with growth, survival, and angiogenesis. The use of VEGF antibodies to block VEGF has been limited due to their non- specificity, poor efficacy and adverse effects. In this line, silencing VEGF using VEGF-siRNA (siRNA-V) will be an effective option, however, the clinical utility of siRNA has been hampered due to non-specific effect, poor cell permeation and rapid in vivo elimination. The use of nanocarriers for siRNA-V delivery will help to overcome these issues. Furthermore, PI3K/mTOR was found to be predominantly activated in NSCLC, additionally, mTOR inhibition results in compensatory activation of Akt (a promoter of cell survival and proliferation). Hence, simultaneous targeting of mTOR and Akt along with VEGF silencing will pave the way for more effective NSCLC therapy. PF-04691502 (PF0) is a potent PI3K/mTOR/AKT inhibitor. Targeting mTOR/AKT pathway using PF0 along with VEGF silencing will complement the clinical potential of these bioactives against NSCLC. LHRH receptors are over-expressed on NSCLC cells with restricted expression on normal tissues. For the first time, we are herewith proposing the development of biodegradable, LHRH receptor-targeted PEGylated hybrid nanocarrier (HNC) for the simultaneous targeted delivery of siRNA-V and PF0 (HNC-VP-L) to NSCLC. We hypothesize that the development of stable, LHRH receptor-guided PEGylated albumin-chitosan based hybrid nanocarriers will deliver the synergistically-acting siRNA-V and PF0 in a targeted fashion to NSCLC tumors and will result in a significant improvement of anticancer activity, at lower doses, while overcoming adverse effects. We plan to test our hypothesis by following specific aims: Aim 1: To evaluate the combination effect of siRNA-V and PF0; development and evaluation of HNC-VP-L; Aim 2: To evaluate the in vivo efficacy of HNC-VP-L in nude mice; and Aim 3: To elucidate mechanism, evaluate metastasis and toxicological parameters. We plan to utilize LHRH receptor positive and LHRH receptor negative tumor cell based in vitro as well as in vivo models (xenograft and orthotropic) to investigate the targeting potential of developed nan carriers. Our approach aims at developing a more effective treatment modality for the treatment of NSCLC to reduce the burden of lung cancer disparity. The long term goal is to advance this novel delivery concept to the clinic level. We will be able to establish the first nan carrier based extramural cancer program in the state of Hawaii and train the unrepresented students through this project. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Lung cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer deaths and has poor survival rates compared to other types of cancers. The lung cancer incidence is highest in African Americans, underserved Whites, American Indians/Alaska Natives, and Pacific Islanders thereby the disparities in treatment outcomes exists. The non- small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is prevalent (~80% occurrence) among lung cancer patient. The site specific delivery of therapeutic agents to tumors is still a major challenge in cancer research. NSCLC has wide molecular heterogeneity and therefore, warrants targeting of multiple pathways for improving the outcome among lung cancer patients. The tumor specific delivery of therapeutic agents targeting multiple pathways involved in NSCLC progression represents a potential approach to treat the NSCLC owing to its advantages over existing treatment modalities. In this regard, some attempts have been made to deliver chemotherapeutic agents using Nan carriers, however, our proposed combination therapy of PF-04691502 (PF0), an ATP- competitive PI3K/mTOR/AKT dual inhibitor and siRNA-V using targeted hybrid nan carriers of natural biopolymers (albumin and chitosan) for the treatment of NSCLC is novel and has not been studies so far. Stable, biodegradable, and tumor-specific LHRH receptor-guided hybrid nan carriers loaded with synergistically acting PF0 and siRNA-V will selectively deliver PF0 and siRNA-V to NSCLC and exert significant antitumor activity while sparing normal tissues. This is the first time targeted hybrid Nan carriers are being explored for the simultaneous co-delivery of PF0 and siRNA-V for the treatment of NSCLC. This project combines a highly innovative and collaborative approach with advanced nanotechnologies and in vivo cancer cell biology including LHRH receptor positive and LHRH receptor negative tumor cell based models to evaluate developed targeted delivery system. Our proposed studies are aimed at developing a more effective and reliable treatment modality that can be safely used for the treatment of NSCLC and also help to reduce the burden of lung cancer disparity. We will be able to establish the first Nan carrier based cancer program in the state of Hawaii, obtain extramural NIH/DOD funding, and train the unrepresented students through this project. The results will also provide the proof-of-concept for similar targeted Nan carrier therapies against other forms of cancer.",Targeted Combination Therapy for Lung

"MOLECULAR BASIS FOR THE IMPACT OF SEX ON BRAIN TUMORIGENESIS DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Primary and metastatic brain tumors occur more commonly in males than females. This is true regardless of age or region of the world. Thus, sex must affect fundamental mechanisms of neoplastic growth in the central nervous system. In preliminary studies we established conditions that result in the transformation of male but not female astrocytes. This experimental paradigm is an unprecedented opportunity to define the molecular basis for the effects of sex on tumorigenesis. We found that sex affects global gene expression, activation of the tumor suppressor p21cip1, induction of a stem cell phenotype, growth kinetics, cellular senescence and patterns of intracranial malignant growth. Moreover, we found sex differences in human GBM stem cells. In this proposal we will exploit these murine and human GBM models to define the molecular basis for the effect of sex on brain tumorigenesis. In Specific Aim 1 we build on preliminary findings that sexually dimorphic expression of the growth inhibitory molecule p202 results in differential induction of the tumor suppressor p21cip1 and thereby blocks transformation in female astrocytes. In Specific Aim 2 we will follow up on preliminary studies that indicate stem cells are more easily induced in male astrocytes and define how sex, multiple initiating oncogenic events, X chromosome reactivation and cell of origin interact to regulate transformation. In Specific Aim 3 we perform validation studies with human male and female GBM stem cell cultures and test the hypothesis that sex differences in GBM stem cells will impact on responses to therapeutic targeting of CXCR4. Together these studies will advance of fundamental knowledge of cancer biology and have the potential to impact on our approach to treating patients with malignant brain tumors. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Successful cancer therapy may require tailoring treatment approaches to the individual and their unique cancer. We determined that sex exerts a profound effect on early events during the genesis of malignant brain tumors. These findings have significant implications for both basic cancer biology and clinical neuro-oncology.

"Calcium Channels, Calmodulin and Nuclear CREB Signaling ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Excitation-transcription (E-T) coupling is a process that converts the electrical or chemical activation of a cell to a signal conveyed to the nucleus. n this way, the expression of genes can be modulated in an activity-dependent manner. The neuronal remodeling that results is recognized to be necessary and important for long-term adaptive changes during neuronal development, learning and memory and drug addiction. The most scrutinized example of E-T coupling is Ca2+ signaling to the transcription factor CREB (cAMP response element-binding) protein via phosphorylation at Ser133. As an important source of Ca2+ influx, voltage-gated Ca2+ channels have been well studied for their biophysical and biochemical properties. Interestingly, in E-T coupling it seems that Ca2+ influxes through different Ca2+ channels can engage different signaling pathways to the nucleus. For example, CaV1 (also called L-type) channels enjoy a big advantage over CaV2 channels, even though CaV1 channels contribute only a minority of the overall Ca2+ entry in neurons. Our recent Cell paper uncovered that this disparity in potency can be explained by differences in how the two classes of Ca2+ channels employ local and global Ca2+ signaling. However, the 'private line' for the nanodomain advantage of CaV1 channels is unclear. Now we are poised to provide a detailed characterization of the critical question: what carries the long-distance signal from CaV1-anchored signaling complex to the nucleus? We have an answer: Ca2+/CaM translocation to the nucleus depends on a co-transporter that we now identify as γCaMKII. This shuttle gathers cytoplasmic Ca2+/CaM, sequestering it at the CaV1 channel before traveling to the nucleus under control of a nuclear localization signal. This signaling mechanism relies on γCaMKII, βCaMKII and CaN, signaling molecules that operate in the CaV1 nanodomain and also have been implicated in multiple neuropsychiatric diseases. This proposal focuses on understanding the cellular machinery of γCaMKII/CaM translocation and three specific aims are proposed. (1) Define the dynamics of Ca2+ signaling mechanisms that link CaV1 activity to nuclear CREB phosphorylation and CRE-dependent transcription. We will track γCaMKII translocation in real time and assess the impact of Ca2+/CaM delivered to the nucleus via this shuttle mechanism. (2) We will manipulate the γCaMKII pathway using genetic constructs in order to nail down the molecular components required for CREB phosphorylation. We will alter binding interactions and enzymatic actions involving CaM, βCaMKII, CaN, and PP2A at critical steps along the pathway. (3) Understand CaV1-dependent CaM shuttling in neocortical neurons and define distinct roles of nanodomain Ca2+ signaling and voltage gated conformational signaling for E-T coupling. Gaining a clearer picture of the linkage between CaV1 channels and CREB signaling will have a favorable impact on understanding how changes in gene expression alter the function of neurons in neural networks. Thus, the research is relevant both to basic cell biology and to disease states as diverse as addiction, autism and other neuropsychiatric diseases. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The ability to regulate gene expression in response to stimuli from the outside world is critical for the function of nearly all cell types in the body and plays  crucial role in regulating the function of neurons and their assembly into functional networks. This project studies the process by which excitation of neurons by membrane depolarization couples via opening of specific types of calcium channel and activation of cell signaling machinery to transcription of genes in the cell nucleus. Research on basic excitable cell biology will advance our understanding of how cells remodel themselves in health and in diseases such as addiction and autism.","Calcium Channels, Calmodulin and Nuclear CREB Signaling",9127187,R01DA040484,"['Action Potentials ', "" Kanner's Syndrome "", ' Infantile Autism ', ' Early Infantile Autism ', ' Autism ', ' Autistic Disorder ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Brain ', ' Voltage-Dependent Calcium Channels ', ' VDCC ', ' Calcium Ion Channels ', ' Calcium Channel Blocker Receptors ', ' Calcium Channel Antagonist Receptor ', ' Calcium Channel ', ' Phosphodiesterase Protein Activator ', ' Phosphodiesterase Activating Factor ', ' Calcium-Dependent Regulator ', ' Calcium-Dependent Activator Protein ', ' Calmodulin ', ' Nucleus ', ' Cell Nucleus ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cells ', ' Complexons ', ' Chelators ', ' Chelating Agents ', ' Communication ', ' Couples ', ' Cytoplasm ', ' Diffusion ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' GEDTA ', ' EGTA ', ' EGATA ', ' Egtazic Acid ', ' Enzyme Gene ', ' Enzymes ', ' Family ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Goals ', ' individuals with disabilities ', ' disabled people ', ' disabled individual ', ' disabled ', ' Persons with Disabilities ', ' People with Disabilities ', ' Handicapped ', ' Disabled Population ', ' Disabled Persons ', ' Health ', ' Learning ', ' Ligands ', ' Lions ', ' Panthera leo ', ' Memory ', ' body movement ', ' Movement ', ' Nails ', ' Nail plate ', ' neuronal ', ' Neurocyte ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Neurons ', ' Paper ', ' Protein Phosphorylation ', ' Phosphorylation ', ' Transphosphorylases ', ' Phosphotransferase Gene ', ' Kinases ', ' Phosphotransferases ', ' Play ', ' Research ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' L-Serine ', ' Serine ', ' Signal Pathway ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Tissues ', ' Transcription factor genes ', ' Transcription Factor Proto-Oncogene ', ' General Transcription Factors ', ' General Transcription Factor Gene ', ' Basal transcription factor genes ', ' Basal Transcription Factor ', ' transcription factor ', ' Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' Travel ', ' Vision ', ' visual function ', ' Sight ', ' Work ', ' Cyclic AMP-Responsive DNA-Binding Protein ', ' cAMP Responsive Element Binding Protein ', ' cAMP Response Element-Binding Protein ', ' Cyclic AMP Responsive Element Binding Protein ', ' Cyclic AMP Response Element-Binding Protein ', ' CREB Protein ', ' CRE Binding Protein ', ' Fusion Protein ', ' Chimera Protein ', ' Chimeric Proteins ', ' base ', ' Label ', ' Peripheral ', ' Surface ', ' Biochemical ', ' Link ', ' Chemicals ', ' Mouth ', ' Cavitas Oris ', ' Buccal Cavity Head and Neck ', ' Buccal Cavity ', ' Oral cavity ', ' Stimulus ', ' Funding ', ' calcium-dependent CaM kinase II ', ' CaMKII ', ' CaM kinase II ', ' CaM PK II ', ' CaM KII ', ' calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II ', ' Protein Phosphatase 2A Regulatory Subunit B Prime ', ' Phosphotyrosyl Phosphatase Activator ', ' PP2A Subunit B Prime ', ' PP2A ', ' Protein Phosphatase 2A Regulatory Subunit PR53 ', ' Genetic ', ' cell biology ', ' Cellular biology ', ' Frequencies ', ' Complex ', ' Event ', ' Radius ', ' Radial ', ' Source ', ' cell type ', ' System ', ' Nuclear ', ' Nuclear Localization Signal Peptide ', ' NLS Peptide ', ' Nuclear Localization Signal ', ' membrane structure ', ' Membrane ', ' Molecular Dynamics Simulation ', ' molecular dynamics ', ' mutant ', ' voltage ', ' Co-Transporters ', ' symporter ', ' neural network ', ' Biological Neural Networks ', ' novel ', ' member ', ' Property ', ' response ', ' Dephosphorylation ', ' Protein Dephosphorylation ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' Binding ', ' protein expression ', ' Address ', ' Drug Dependency ', ' Drug Dependence ', ' Chemical Dependence ', ' Drug Addiction ', ' cAMP Response Element ', ' Cyclic AMP Response Element ', ' genomic alteration ', ' Sequence Alteration ', ' Genetic mutation ', ' DNA mutation ', ' DNA Alteration ', ' DNA Sequence Alteration ', ' Sum ', ' Scheme ', ' Signaling Molecule ', ' Molecular ', ' Process ', ' Modification ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' neuronal development ', ' neuron development ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' excitatory neuron ', ' knockdown ', ' knock-down ', ' Minority ', ' Coupling ', ' Resistance ', ' resistant ', ' small hairpin RNA ', ' short hairpin RNA ', ' shRNA ', ' neocortical ', ' addiction ', ' addictive disorder ', ' Secure ', ' operation ', ' neuropsychiatric disorder ', ' neuropsychiatric disease ', ' ']",NIDA,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,R01,2016,398537,0.15926729443949508
"Targeting CRLF2 and Ikaros Alterations to Reduce Health Disparities in Childhood Leukemia SUMMARY  Hispanic children are more likely to develop acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL), and when this occurs they are 39% more likely to die than non-Hispanic Whites. This disparity is due, in part, to a subtype of B-cell precursor ALL (B-ALL) that occurs five times more frequently among Hispanic children than others and has a high relapse rate. This type of leukemia, called CRLF2 B-ALL, is characterized by two genetic alterations: a) overexpression of the cytokine receptor, CRLF2, and b) deletion or inactivation of one allele of the Ikaros (IKZF1) tumor suppressor which is strongly associated with relapse. Our overall hypothesis is that combination therapy that selectively targets the pathways that are deregulated in CRLF2 B-ALL (CRLF2 and Ikaros) will produce a superior therapeutic effect and decrease mortality to reduce the health disparity in survival for Hispanic children with ALL. When the CRLF2 receptor is activated by its ligand, TSLP, downstream pathways (JAK/STAT and PI3/AKT/mTOR) that promote leukemia cell survival, proliferation, and chemoresistance are induced through processes normally kept in check by the Ikaros tumor suppressor. Preliminary data from our team show that treatment with the CK2-specific inhibitor, CX-4945, restores Ikaros tumor suppressor function in high-risk B-ALL from Hispanic patients with deletion of one Ikaros allele, exerting a strong in vivo therapeutic effect. Preclinical studies of CRLF2 B-ALL typically use patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models, where primary leukemia cells from patients with CRLF2 B-ALL are injected into immune deficient mice. Our preliminary data show that mouse TSLP does not activate human CRLF2, making the current PDX models suboptimal for studies of CRLF2 B-ALL. To overcome this obstacle our team engineered immune deficient mice that provide normal human serum levels of human TSLP (+T mice) and generated PDX by injecting these mice with CRLF2 B-ALL cells from Hispanic pediatric patients (+T PDX). Analysis of +T PDX shows CRLF2 activation and gene expression that is more similar to original patient sample than standard PDX. Our preliminary data provide a rationale for novel therapy that targets pathways that are induced by CRLF2 (JAK-STAT5 and PI3K/AKT/mTOR) and by loss of Ikaros tumor suppressor activity using our newly- developed preclinical model for Hispanic CRLF2 B-ALL. To test our hypothesis we will: Aim 1: Establish the in vivo therapeutic efficacy of targeting CRLF2 downstream pathways and their role in CRLF2 B-ALL in Hispanic pediatric patients. Aim 2: Evaluate the in vivo efficacy and mechanisms of combination therapy that restores Ikaros tumor suppressor activity and inhibits the mTOR pathway in Hispanic pediatric CRLF2 B-ALL. The proposed studies use precision medicine approaches (targeting specific pathways and/or functional defects) in context of the health disparity background to develop a novel treatment for CRLF2 B-ALL and reduce childhood cancer health disparities. NARRATIVE   Hispanic children are more likely to develop acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) and when they do they have a 39% higher death rate than non-Hispanic Whites. A contributor to this disparity is a sub-type of high-risk ALL that occurs five times more frequently in Hispanic/Latino children than others.

"Measurement Error in Population Health Inequity Research using Novel Biomeasures DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Progress in eliminating health disparities requires interdisciplinary efforts among social and biological scientists, and population-based data sets through which complex hypotheses linking environmental, psychosocial, behavioral and biological processes can be tested. The proposed project is an interdisciplinary collaborative effort integrating expertise in population health disparities, molecular biology, and the statisticl impact of measurement error on parameter estimates directly pertinent to population health research. We will address the question of whether DNA from blood or saliva banked with large population based data sets is valid for use in population health studies of telomere length (TL) - an intriguing new biomeasure of stress- mediated health, development, and aging -- and, if so, what sample sizes are needed.  Research on population differences in TL is largely based on highly select, racially homogeneous, clinical, or convenience samples. Socioeconomic measures are often absent or rudimentary. The state-of-the-art approach to measuring TL is via leukocyte-derived DNA extracted from fresh venous blood samples. Launching new population-based data collection activities that include blood draws, molecular measurements and the broad swath of social, environmental, behavioral, and health variables needed is costly and takes years before data can be analyzed. However, extant population-based data collections are increasingly isolating blood DNA for storage in specimen repositories after the cells have been transformed and immortalized using Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) or storing DNA in saliva. Neither approach is ideal for TL measurement. The critical unanswered question for population research is whether the error introduced in these TL measures is random or systematic with respect to original TL or to populations of interest.  We propose to estimate the validity of using EBV-immortalized blood cells or saliva cells to estimate population differences in TL. We will collect blood and saliva from 150 adult black, white, or Mexican-origin women in Detroit and Ann Arbor and measure each woman's TL multiple times using DNA directly isolated from fresh blood cells, DNA isolated from cells that we will EBV- immortalize, and DNA extracted from saliva. By stratifying the sample along key axes of comparison - race/ethnicity, socioeconomic status, stress- level, and neighborhood - and making within-woman comparisons on TL between immortalized and fresh blood samples, and between fresh blood samples and saliva, we will directly gauge the effect that immortalization or tissue type has on the validity and reliability o findings from TL studies that use stored specimens and on the future potential use of stored specimens for testing interdisciplinary hypotheses on population health disparities. Findings can be applied toward increasing the pace of health disparities research, whatever the conclusion on the validity of using immortalized blood or saliva cells to measure TL. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Eliminating social disparities in health is a high-priority national public health objective. Learning how different social or physical environments and life experiences influence biological processes to impact health is fundamental. By studying whether banked biomeasures are valid for use in population-studies we hope to improve and accelerate research on health disparities.",Measurement Error in Population Health Inequity Research using Novel Biomeasures,9150492,R01AG047167,"['adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Age ', ' Aging ', ' atherosclerotic vascular disease ', ' atherosclerotic disease ', ' atheromatosis ', ' Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease ', ' Atheroscleroses ', ' Atherosclerosis ', ' Biology ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Blood ', ' Peripheral Blood Cell ', ' Blood Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cells ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Data Collection ', ' statistical analysis ', ' Statistical Data Analysis ', ' Statistical Data Analyses ', ' Statistical Data Interpretation ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' DNA ', ' Environment ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' Infectious Mononucleosis Virus ', ' HHV-4 ', ' Epstein-Barr Virus ', ' Epstein Barr Virus ', ' EBV ', ' EB virus ', ' E-B Virus ', ' Burkitt Lymphoma Virus ', ' Burkitt Herpesvirus ', ' Human Herpesvirus 4 ', ' Family ', ' Future ', ' behavior genetics ', ' Genetic Determinants of Behavior ', ' Behavioral Genetics ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health Surveys ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' histocompatibility typing ', ' Tissue Typing ', ' Tissue Crossmatching ', ' Histocompatibility Testing ', ' Learning ', ' white blood corpuscle ', ' white blood cell ', ' White Cell ', ' White Blood Cells ', ' Marrow leukocyte ', ' Leukocytes Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Blood leukocyte ', ' Leukocytes ', ' Life Experience ', ' life course ', ' Life Cycle ', ' Life Cycle Stages ', ' long-term study ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' Michigan ', ' DNA Molecular Biology ', ' Molecular Biology ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Poverty Areas ', ' Public Health ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' recruit ', ' active recruitment ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' Validity and Reliability ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Retirement ', ' Saliva ', ' Sampling Studies ', ' socioenvironment ', ' social context ', ' social climate ', ' Social Environment ', ' Stress ', ' Testing ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' telomere ', ' Mediating ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Telomerase ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Cell Size ', ' base ', ' Blood Sample ', ' Blood specimen ', ' improved ', ' Phlebotomy ', ' Venous blood sampling ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Biological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' Link ', ' Mexican ', ' Measurement ', ' Sample Size ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Biological Function ', ' Biological Process ', ' Venous ', ' Research Specimen ', ' Specimen ', ' Scientist ', ' Complex ', ' psychosocial ', ' interest ', ' Physical environment ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' social ', ' Sampling ', ' behavioral health ', ' theories ', ' repository ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Address ', ' Length ', ' Data ', ' Population Research ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' Molecular ', ' Process ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socio-economically ', ' socio-economic ', ' socioeconomics ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' cost ', ' time use ', ' social disparities ', ' Population ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' population based ', ' population health ', ' adolescent health ', ' ']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2016,307874,0.07617542566341139
"Cryptoprotective Autophagy in Bone Metastatic Prostate Cancer Project Summary/Abstract Candidate: My immediate career goals are to obtain the necessary training and skill set required to be competitive for a tenured faculty position and to accumulate data sufficient for an R01 or similar funding mechanism. My long term career goals are to be a tenured, funded cancer biology professor, a mentor, and a science administrator. To this end, the key elements of my career plan are focused on 1) developing my independent research, 2) continuing my technical and research administrative education, 3) honing my communication skills, and 4) gaining more mentoring experience.  Environment: I can successfully meet my goals because I have access to state-of-the-art equipment, core facilities, and educational resources at Rice University, the Texas Medical Center, and through a prostate cancer P01 collaboration that includes the University of Delaware, Emory University, and Cedars-Sinai. I also have a team of phenomenal mentors who are leaders in the prostate cancer and cancer health disparities fields. These mentors include my primary mentor, Dr. Mary Farach-Carson, co-mentor, Dr. Leland Chung, and Drs. Nora Navone and Lovell Jones, who have each agreed to provide me with career development guidance.  Research: Prostate cancer (PCa) is the second leading cause of death in North American men, where 80% of PCa mortality is due to bone metastasis. PCa tumors can contain neuronal-like neuroendocrine (NE) PCa cells, which correlates with poor prognosis. NE PCa cells are resistant to apoptosis, secrete proteins to induce cell proliferation and angiogenesis, and can de-differentiate to contribute to tumor growth. Our lab recently published data revealing that bone marrow stromal cell (BMSC) paracrine signaling induces apoptosis in co-cultured bone metastatic PCa cells. However, a subpopulation of the bone metastatic PCa cells can avoid cell death and undergo neuroendocrine differentiation (NED). One process that has been shown to mediate cancer cell survival and cell differentiation is autophagy, the homeostatic process of intracellular degradation and recycling. Thus, I propose that autophagy is a cytoprotective mechanism that PCa cells use to survive and undergo NED in the bone marrow stromal microenvironment. To address my hypothesis, I will (1) dissect autophagy regulation in PCa cells exposed to BMSC, (2) demonstrate that autophagy enhances PCa cell survival and promotes NED, and (3) show that autophagy attenuation increases PCa cell death. Autophagy induction and function will be analyzed using immuno-blot and -staining for autophagy markers, such as LC3, and using acidic vesicle dyes, such as monodansylcadaverin. PCa cells will be subjected to genetic and pharmacological autophagy modulation and assayed for cell viability and the NED phenotype. My investigation will identify pathways to attenuate autophagy and redirect bone metastatic PCa cells towards cell death. Project Narrative  Prostate cancer (PCa) bone metastasis is responsible for 80% of PCa death. Therefore, it is imperative to understand the biology of bone metastatic PCa cells in the bone environment. Hence, the purpose of this project is to determine the role of autophagy, a homeostatic process, in bone metastatic PCa cell survival and to determine if inhibition of autophagy can kill bone metastatic PCa cells.",Cryptoprotective Autophagy in Bone Metastatic Prostate Cancer,9146159,K01CA160602,"['abstracting ', ' autophagy ', ' Autophagocytosis ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Biology ', ' bone ', ' Bone Marrow Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Bone Marrow ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Cell Division Cycle ', ' Cell Cycle ', ' necrocytosis ', ' Cell Death ', ' Cell Differentiation ', ' Cell Differentiation process ', ' Subcellular Process ', ' Cellular Process ', ' Cellular Physiology ', ' Cellular Function ', ' Cell Process ', ' Cell Function ', ' Cell physiology ', ' Cell Viability ', ' Cell Survival ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cells ', ' Communication ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Delaware ', ' Coloring Agents ', ' Dyes ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Elements ', ' Environment ', ' Equipment ', ' Faculty ', ' Goals ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Growth ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Mentors ', ' mortality ', ' neuronal ', ' Neurocyte ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Neurons ', ' Neuroendocrine System ', ' Neuroendocrine ', ' Neurosecretory Systems ', ' Phenotype ', ' Prognosis ', ' outcome forecast ', ' Proteins ', ' Publishing ', ' Research ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Rice ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Science ', ' Signal Pathway ', ' Stains ', ' Texas ', ' Universities ', ' Administrator ', ' Mediating ', ' Metastatic Neoplasm to the Bone ', ' bone neoplasm secondary ', ' Skeletal metastasis ', ' Secondary malignant neoplasm of bone ', ' Secondary malignancy of bone ', ' Secondary cancer of bone ', ' Osseous metastasis ', ' Metastatic malignant neoplasm to bone ', ' Metastatic Tumor to the Bone ', ' Metastatic Cancer to the Bone ', ' Metastasis to bone ', ' Bony metastasis ', ' Bone cancer metastatic ', ' Bone Metastasis ', ' Killings ', ' Stromal Cells ', ' Apoptosis ', ' Programmed Cell Death ', ' Apoptosis Pathway ', ' career ', ' Site ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' Funding ', ' Recycling ', ' Collaborations ', ' Coculture ', ' Cocultivation ', ' Co-culture ', ' Coculture Techniques ', ' angiogenesis ', ' Genetic ', ' Exposure to ', ' Attenuated ', ' Vesicle ', ' Malignant Cell ', ' cancer cell ', ' Prostatic Cancer ', ' Prostate Cancer ', ' Prostate CA ', ' Malignant prostatic tumor ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Prostate ', ' Malignant neoplasm of prostate ', ' Investigation ', ' Stainings ', ' Staining method ', ' Paracrine Signaling ', ' Paracrine Communication ', ' meetings ', ' skills training ', ' Medical center ', ' American ', ' Cellular Proliferation ', ' Cell Multiplication ', ' Cell Growth in Number ', ' Cell Proliferation ', ' experience ', ' paracrine ', ' tumor growth ', ' professor ', ' attenuation ', ' skills ', ' Phenocopy ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Regulation ', ' Radiation ', ' Modeling ', ' career development ', ' response ', ' Prostate Carcinoma Metastatic ', ' Metastatic Prostate Cancer ', ' Address ', ' Core Facility ', ' cytotoxic ', ' Data ', ' Mitotic ', ' Apoptotic ', ' Cancer Biology ', ' Funding Mechanisms ', ' Molecular Tumor Suppression ', ' Tumor Suppression ', ' Process ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' Metabolic stress ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' disparity in cancer ', ' cancer disparity ', ' Resistance ', ' resistant ', ' tumor ', ' inhibition of autophagy ', ' prostate cancer cell ', ' prostate tumor cell ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS DALLAS,K01,2016,115020,0.0210667541007562
"CTC Screening Assay to Address Health Disparities in Women with Ovarian Cancer ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Epithelial Ovarian Cancer (EOC) is the 5th leading cause of cancer-related deaths among women in the US and is the leading gynecological cancer killer with ~22,000 cases reported in 2014. EOC has been called a ""silent killer"" because most women (>70%) are diagnosed at late stages of disease due to a lack of clinically sensitive and specific screening test and a lack of symptoms until late stage disease onset. While the incidence rate of EOC in the US is highest among white females, there exists a dramatic disparity in post-diagnosis outcomes in other populations with African-American women exhibiting substantially greater mortality based on 5-year survival rates. A combination of insufficient early detection strategies as well as reduced access to surgical treatment (required at later stages of disease) appears to contribute to the disparity. Improved access to advanced screening assays, and thereby earlier detection, is therefore urgently needed to improve outcomes, particularly in disparately effected populations. Analysis of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) from cancer patients' blood have demonstrated prognostic value in metastatic cancers (1) (1)(1)but the use of CTCs for diagnosing early stage disease requires a degree of sensitivity and specificity currently unavailable in existing CTC analysis technologies. An innovative CTC detection technology will emanate from this SBIR research project that will have unique capabilities suited to the early detection of EOC and potentially other cancers as well. The technology uses low-cost, disposable, plastic CTC fluidic cartridge that possess the ability to select CTCs directly from whole blood with extremely high recoveries (>90%), unprecedented purities (>85%) and can enumerate the captured CTCs using a label-less approach with a simple single-cell transducer (micro-CTC Coulter Counter, µC3). The technology provides a simple workflow with full process automation, ideal for a screening test that can be utilized within resource-limited settings. The technology will process whole blood directly (~2 mL input) and affinity select the CTCs, release the CTCs from the capture surface and count them using an on-chip µC3. Unique to our platform is the ability to select different CTCs subpopulations from a single sample. BioFluidica has tested its capture system using a novel CTC-isolation antigen, which, as the preliminary data indicates, is more prevalent in early stage disease compared to the more commonly used selection target, epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM). The ability to capture multiple stage-specific CTC subpopulations has the potential to diagnose patients at early stages of disease as well as assess treatment efficacy and the potential for disease recurrence. The goal of this proposal is to initiate the development of a powerful EOC screening test, accelerating treatment and improving currently poor prognoses, especially in disparately affected African-American women. Successful completion of this Phase I program will provide the impetus to move the technology into early detection scenarios for other cancers that show disparities, such as breast cancer in African-American women. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) exhibits the 5th highest mortality rate amongst women in the US. While its incidence rate is higher among white women, epidemiological data reports a significant reduction in the 5-year survival rates for African-American women. While new screening assays are broadly required to detect early stage disease, an automated, cost-effective and accurate test has the best chance of improving the disparate mortality rates in various populations. This project is focused on developing a transformative technology that can serve as a screening test which isolates circulating tumor cells (CTCs) from blood samples to diagnose early stage EOC appropriate for ethnic groups with EOC health disparities.",CTC Screening Assay to Address Health Disparities in Women with Ovarian Cancer,9145687,R43EB021212,"['Affect ', ' Antibodies ', ' immunogen ', ' ATGN ', ' Antigens ', ' Automation ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Blood ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' cell adhesion protein ', ' Cell Adhesion Molecule Gene ', ' Adhesion Molecule ', ' Cell Adhesion Molecules ', ' cell sorting ', ' Cell Separation Technology ', ' Cell Segregation ', ' Cell Isolation ', ' Cell Separation ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cells ', ' Cytokeratin ', ' data representation ', ' Data Reporting ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Electrodes ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' Epithelial Cells ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Exhibits ', ' Female ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' orthopedic freezing ', ' Immobilization ', ' Incidence ', ' instrumentation ', ' white blood corpuscle ', ' white blood cell ', ' White Cell ', ' White Blood Cells ', ' Marrow leukocyte ', ' Leukocytes Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Blood leukocyte ', ' Leukocytes ', ' Methods ', ' mortality ', ' circulating tumor cell ', ' circulating neoplastic cell ', ' Neoplasm Circulating Cells ', ' optical ', ' Optics ', ' Patients ', ' Peptides ', ' Printing ', ' Prognosis ', ' outcome forecast ', ' Recurrent ', ' Recurrence ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' school of medicine ', ' medical college ', ' medical schools ', ' Sensitivity and Specificity ', ' Survival Rate ', ' Technology ', ' Temperature ', ' Testing ', ' Transducers ', ' Woman ', ' Immunophenotyping ', ' immunophenotype ', ' Immunologic Subtyping ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Case Study ', ' case report ', ' TimeLine ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' Blood Sample ', ' Blood specimen ', ' Label ', ' improved ', ' Peripheral ', ' Surface ', ' Phase ', ' Biochemical ', ' Epithelial ', ' peripheral blood ', ' Recovery ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' disorder onset ', ' disease onset ', ' Onset of illness ', ' Collaborations ', ' Staging ', ' Metastatic Malignant Neoplasm ', ' Metastatic Cancer ', ' Disseminated Malignant Neoplasm ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Filamentous Fungi ', ' Molds ', ' Whole Blood ', ' programs ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' surgery ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' innovative technologies ', ' early detection ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' experience ', ' Coulter counter ', ' Epithelial ovarian cancer ', ' novel ', ' novel technologies ', ' new technology ', ' Modality ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Female Reproductive System ', ' Malignant Gynecologic Tumor ', ' Malignant Gynecologic Neoplasm ', ' Gynecological Cancer ', ' Gynecologic Cancer ', ' Female Reproductive Cancer ', ' Malignant Female Reproductive System Neoplasm ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' ovarian cancer ', ' Ovary Cancer ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Ovary ', ' Malignant Ovarian Tumor ', ' Malignant Ovarian Neoplasm ', ' Malignant neoplasm of ovary ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Microfluidic ', ' Microfluidics ', ' T200 ', ' PTPRC ', ' LY5 ', ' GP180 ', ' CD45 ', ' B220 ', ' PTPRC gene ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Affinity ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Improve Access ', ' Cancer Cause ', ' Cancer Etiology ', ' Cancer Patient ', ' Small Business Innovation Research ', ' SBIR ', ' Small Business Innovation Research Grant ', ' Validation ', ' GEM model ', ' Genetically Engineered Mouse ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' cost ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Treatment Efficacy ', ' therapy efficacy ', ' therapeutically effective ', ' therapeutic efficacy ', ' intervention efficacy ', ' Outcome ', ' cost effective ', ' cost-effective ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' disparity in cancer ', ' cancer disparity ', ' chemotherapy ', ' mouse model ', ' murine model ', ' tumor ', ' standard of care ', ' treatment response ', ' therapeutic response ', ' response to treatment ', ' screening ', ' prognostic value ', ' improved outcome ', ' ']",NIBIB,"BIOFLUIDICA, INC",R43,2016,186760,0.0182784320057352
"Molecular mechanisms of estrogen receptor alpha modulating the inflammatory response in systematic lupus erythematosus ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Ninety percent of those diagnosed with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) are women, with peak incidence between the ages of 15 and 45, when women are most hormonally active. Despite significant research effort, the mechanisms underlying this sex bias remain unclear. Our laboratory previously backcrossed estrogen receptor alpha knockout (ERαKO) mice onto the NZM2410 lupus prone background. We demonstrated that female NZM/ERαKO mice had significantly less renal disease and significantly prolonged survival compared to WT littermates despite similar serum autoantibodies and glomerular immune complex deposition. ERαKO mice are not ERα null, but rather express an N-terminally truncated ERα. They have physiologic deficiencies including infertility due to disruption of a critical activation domain (AF-1). We showed that dendritic cell (DCs) from NZM/ERαKO mice have a blunted inflammatory response to Toll-like receptor (TLR) ligands. When these mice were ovariectomized, the protective phenotype was lost. Upon estradiol-repletion, protection was restored. True ERα null mice are not protected, suggesting that estrogen in the presence of the AF-1 mutant confers protection, rather than the absence of the full-length ERα66. Interestingly, the truncated ERα expressed in the ERαKO animal is structurally similar to ERα46, an endogenous ERα splice variant that lacks the AF-1 domain, and is a negative regulator of gene transcription. ERα46 has an identical DNA binding domain to ERα66 and is a powerful inhibitor of ERα66. We hypothesize that ERα46 expression has a protective effect in lupus. The goal of this project is to determine the role of ERα46 in SLE and TLR-induced inflammation and to improve our understanding of ERα-mediated transcription in the setting of inflammation. In order to accomplish this, Dr. Cunningham will (1) Define the in vitro molecular mechanisms underlying ERα46- and ERα66-regulated transcriptional activity impacting the innate inflammatory response of murine DCs, (2) Determine ex vivo and in vivo the role of ERα46 in TLR-induced lupus utilizing a murine strain expressing an A/B truncation mutant of ERα (ERαAF10), and (3) Use human peripheral blood monocyte (PBMC)-derived DCs to define the role of ERα46 and ERα66 in regulation of the innate immune response in DCs from controls vs. lupus patients. Dr. Cunningham is a clinician-investigator with a long-term career goal of becoming an independent basic and translational researcher in the field of immunology with a focus on SLE. To facilitate her transition to independence, she seeks to further her training in dendritic cell biology, ChIPseq and bioinformatics, and the use of human cells from patient samples. Dr. Cunningham has a mentorship team with an outstanding mentoring track record and wide expertise to support her project. The studies proposed in this K08 mentored grant application will significantly advance the field by providing understanding of ERα-mediated transcription in the setting of TLR-induced inflammation, including ERα binding partners, gene targets, and modulation by ERα46, which represents a potential therapeutic agent.           PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project is highly relevant to public health because females have a higher prevalence and significantly increased risk of autoimmune diseases such as lupus. The reasons for this health disparity remain unclear.

"MYCN-induced calcium and magnesium signaling regulates Neuroblastoma progression DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Neuroblastoma (NB) is an extra-cranial pediatric cancer. Amplification of the proto-oncogene MYCN is associated with advanced stage, high risk NB and poor prognosis. Novel drugs and alternative treatments are being investigated for patients with advanced NB with MYCN amplification. However, finding an effective treatment strategy for advanced stage NB remains elusive. In order to address this limitation, the proposed project examines the effects of calcium and magnesium signaling on cell migration and invasion in NB cells with different MYCN status. The preliminary data indicate that MYCN initiates a change in calcium signaling, accompanied by a change in the transcriptional regulation of calcium channels, namely Orai1, Orai3 and TRPM7. In addition, MYCN induces calcium-dependent NB cell migration. These observations support the hypothesis that MYCN alters calcium and magnesium homeostasis during cell migration and invasion through a mechanism that involves calcium-mediated regulation of integrin signaling and focal adhesion turnover, and calcium- and magnesium-permeable ion channels. The research plan has the following specific aims: (1) Examine the effect of MYCN on [Ca2+] and [Mg2+] homeostasis in NB cells. NB cells with different MYCN status will be cultured in external media with different extracellular [Ca2+]/[Mg2+] ratios. The intracellular calcium and magnesium will be measured, and migration and invasion rates will be determined in these cells. (2) Elucidate the mechanism by which MYCN regulation of calcium and magnesium promotes NB migration and invasion. The effect of calcium and magnesium on the expression and phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase and integrin, focal adhesion turnover rate (assembly, disassembly and recycling of focal adhesion proteins), and actin cytoskeletal re-organization will be examined in NB cells that are actively migrating. (3) Identify the molecular components regulating NB migration and invasion. The calcium- permeable ORAI channels and the calcium- and magnesium-permeable TRPM7 channel protein will be modulated pharmacologically or using molecular methods (RNAi or transient over-expression), and the effect of these changes on cell migration and invasion, focal adhesion turnover (assembly, disassembly, and recycling of focal adhesion proteins), and intracellular [Ca2+] will be determined in NB cells. This study may identify new biomarkers for advanced stage NB, and reveal novel targets for the development of more effective chemotherapeutic drugs. In addition, this study may lead to a new model of the regulation of NB progression, which includes monitoring the status of the prognostic marker MYCN as well as the dietary intake, metabolism and cellular regulation of calcium and magnesium. This new model may apply to other cancers with MYC amplification (e.g. breast and prostate cancers, and lymphoma, etc). Neuroblastoma (NB) is a pediatric tumor. Calcium and magnesium ions regulate cell migration and invasion. I propose to elucidate the mechanisms by which calcium and magnesium regulate these processes in NB cells. This study will improve our current knowledge of NB progression, and reveal more innovative treatment strategies for NB.",MYCN-induced calcium and magnesium signaling regulates Neuroblastoma progression,9123532,K01CA154758,"['Factor IV ', ' Coagulation Factor IV ', ' Ca++ element ', ' Blood Coagulation Factor IV ', ' Calcium ', ' Voltage-Dependent Calcium Channels ', ' VDCC ', ' Calcium Ion Channels ', ' Calcium Channel Blocker Receptors ', ' Calcium Channel Antagonist Receptor ', ' Calcium Channel ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Motility ', ' Cellular Motility ', ' Cellular Migration ', ' Cell Movement ', ' Cell Migration ', ' Cell Locomotion ', ' cell motility ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cells ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Downregulation ', ' Down-Regulation ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' natural gene amplification ', ' Gene Amplification ', ' Goals ', ' Physiological Homeostasis ', ' Autoregulation ', ' Homeostasis ', ' Integrins Extracellular Matrix ', ' Integrins ', ' Membrane Channels ', ' Ionic Channels ', ' Ion Channel ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Literature ', ' Reticulolymphosarcoma ', ' Malignant Lymphoma ', ' Germinoblastoma ', ' Germinoblastic Sarcoma ', ' Lymphoma ', ' Mg element ', ' Magnesium ', ' Metabolic Processes ', ' Intermediary Metabolism ', ' Metabolism ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Neuroblastoma ', ' Patients ', ' Peer Review ', ' Protein Phosphorylation ', ' Phosphorylation ', ' Prognosis ', ' outcome forecast ', ' Proteins ', ' protooncogene ', ' c-onc Proteins ', ' c-ONC ', ' Proto-Oncogene Proteins ', ' Cellular Proto-Oncogene Proteins ', ' Cellular Proto-Oncogene Products ', ' Cellular Oncogene ', ' Proto-Oncogenes ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Publications ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Support ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Survival Rate ', ' Time ', ' Focal Adhesion Kinase 1 ', ' focal adhesion-associated protein tyrosine kinase pp125FAK ', ' focal adhesion protein tyrosine kinase ', ' focal adhesion kinase ', ' endogenous substrate pp120 ', ' PTK2 Protein Tyrosine Kinase 2 ', ' Measures ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Mediating ', ' Treatment Failure ', ' therapy failure ', ' neoplastic progression ', ' neoplasm progression ', ' cancer progression ', ' tumor progression ', ' improved ', ' Cranial ', ' Cephalic ', ' Malignant ', ' Malignant -

"Implementation of a Sickle Cell Enhanced Novel Care Network in South Carolina (iSCENSC) ABSTRACT Sickle cell disease (SCD) is recognized as a significant health disparity in the United States due to the number of patients affected, the paucity of available providers, disease stigmatization, and a lack of treatment options for affected individuals (4). In certain regions of the US, these issues are further worsened by a large percentage of affected patients living in rural regions with limited access to care, lower socioeconomic status, and fewer funding options (5, 6). South Carolina (SC) is a prime example of state that is tremendously under-resourced to treat individuals living with SCD. State-level engagement of pediatric hematologists, managed care organizations, patients, and community foundations resulted in formation of the South Carolina-Sickle Cell (SC2) statewide network designed to increase access to evidence-based care for all individuals living with SCD and to improve their clinical outcomes through access to a SCD medical home (Spoke) connected to a regional specialty care center (Hub). This approach harnesses the state’s resources to improve care for individuals with SCD, utilize the strengths of partnering hospital systems, and use a technology based approach to extend care to rural areas. This project, iSCENSC (Implementation of a Sickle Cell Enhanced Novel Care Network in South Carolina) is designed to evaluate intervention effectiveness for achieving full implementation of the SC2 network and to determine if the hub and spokes model of care increases access to quality care for individuals with SCD and produces findings sufficient to identify replicable methods for optimal care enrichment especially in rural populations. Specific Aims are: 1. Perform a systematic needs assessment in three target regions currently involved in SC2 (Midlands, Pee Dee and Lowcountry) to assess the gap between current and SCD best practices for adolescent and adult SCD patients and to identify care delivery issues associated with disease-specific care primary care, acute care management, and care coordination. 2: Engage all relevant stakeholders (patients/caregivers, providers, SC2 partners) to begin building capacity for the conduct and assessment of targeted interventions to increase implementation readiness within three SC regions and partnering health systems and to further inform Phase II implementation strategies. 3: Initiate comparative effectiveness study using an interrupted time series, multi-sector, multi-modal design including specific implementation intervention strategies. iSCENSC will be the first multilevel, multicenter implementation science study in adolescents and adults with SCD aiming to achieve the outcome of a statewide SCD network. We propose the first large study of barriers inhibiting adoption and use of NHLBI SCD Guideline and of effectiveness of dissemination and implementation strategies in closing existing guideline-to-practice gaps and reducing longstanding disparities in SCD treatment, policy, and funding support of SCD care delivery. PROJECT NARRATIVE Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a significant health disparity in the United States because a lot of individuals are affected by it, there are few healthcare providers to offer people adequate services to people with SCD, and treatment options are limited, especially for children with SCD as they move into adulthood. The goal of iSCENSC is to find out how we can best make changes in healthcare systems, our communities, and in our policies in support of SC2 (Sickle Cell-South Carolina) a statewide network in South Carolina (SC) designed to have more people receive care that works for SCD throughout their lifetime and to decrease their chances of being sick or dying too early as a result of having SCD.

"Sequence analysis of hematological traits in African Americans Circulating blood cell counts represent important intermediate phenotypes for a variety of cardiovascular, pulmonary, hematologic, and immunologic diseases. These traits differ by ethnicity and studying the genetics of these quantitative blood traits in African Americans (AAs) may reveal new biologic pathways that ultimately contribute to our understanding both of biology of blood cell production and of the relationship of blood counts with CVD and other chronic diseases that disproportionately impact AAs. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS), to date, performed mainly in European Americans, have implicated a number of genomic loci. Despite these successes, association signals for blood cell traits are often associated with uncertain effects on gene function or regulation, and therefore not readily translatable to clinical practice or treatment. Several recent advancements hold promise for translating genetic association findings for blood cell traits into mechanism-based therapeutic approaches for clinical disease. First, genome-wide mapping of blood cell type- and lineage-specific promoter and enhancer elements, transcription factor binding patterns and epigenetic profiling now provide a detailed picture of the cis- and trans- regulatory landscape during hematopoiesis. Second, experimental approaches utilizing genome engineering (RNA- guided CRISPR-Cas9) can characterize critical regulatory elements and functional variants of modest effect that are essential for stage-specific, lineage-restricted effects on gene expression. This proposal will utilize the wealth of newly available genetic data in multiple large AA cohorts, including high-coverage whole genome sequence (WGS) data available on ~3,500 JHS participants and exome array data on ~11,400 participants from the REasons for Geographical And Regional Differences in Stroke (REGARDS), the Jackson Heart (JHS) and Women's Health Initiative (WHI) studies to discover and functionally characterize novel genetic associations. These data will be combined with existing GWAS and exome array data on thousands of additional AAs with measured blood cell traits to form the largest and most comprehensive genetic study of blood cell traits ever conducted in AAs. Our study will use novel and established analytic and experimental approaches, consistent with the goals and directives of this initiative, to identify important genetic variants affecting these important blood-based biomarkers.     PROJECT NARRATIVE Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading killer of African Americans. The proposed work will identify novel genetic risk factors for various blood cell measures that influence CVD risk in African Americans and other populations.

"Gender Differences in Experimental Aortic Aneurysms DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Hypothesis: Our previous studies using elastase-perfusion and angiotensin II models of abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA) have shown that female rodents have a decreased incidence and size of aneurysm formation. We have also recently shown that human placental mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are protective in a mouse model of AAA. In the current proposal, we will investigate the role of dietary phytoestrogen as a preventive therapy, and its synergistic effects with MSCs as a treatment strategy to protect against AAA. Methods: We will use an elastase-perfusion and angiotensin II murine model of AAA using male and female wild-type, estrogen receptor knockout mice (ER-α--/- and ER-ß-/-) and ApoE-/- mice. Dietary phytoestrogen will be administered to male and female mice via estrogen-rich or estrogen-free chow. Various subsets of female MSCs (placenta-, bone marrow- or adipose-derived) primed with or without estrogen will be administered intravenously or by aortic implantation in mice models of AAA. Aortic diameter will be measured on day 3, 7 and 14 (elastase perfusion model) and day 28 (angiotensin II model). Aortic tissue will be harvested to analyze pro-inflammatory cytokine (IL-17, TNF-α-, MCP-1, IL-1-ß-, KC and RANTES) and HMGB1 (high mobility group box 1; a pro-inflammatory nuclear protein) production by ELISA, MMP2 and MMP9 activity by zymography, serine proteases (uPA, tPA and PAI-1) by western blots, paracrine factors (VEGF, HGF, PGE2) by ELISA, elastin and collagen degradation as well as aortic smooth muscle expression by histology, and immune cell (macrophages, CD4+ T cells, neutrophils) infiltration by flow cytometry. Results: Preliminary results demonstrate a significant upregulation of estrogen receptor (ER-α) expression in female mice on days 1, 3 and 14 after elastase-perfusion compared to males, as well as in aortic tissue from human females compared to males after AAA. Also, male mice fed a diet rich in estrogen display a significantly decreased aortic diameter, decreased cytokine production (IL-23, IL-1-ß-, IL-6 and IL-27), decreased MMP2 and 9 expression and decreased macrophage and neutrophil infiltration compared to male mice fed an estrogen free diet. Furthermore, treatment with human female MSCs attenuates aortic diameter, pro-inflammatory cytokine production and cell infiltration after AAA. Female MSCs inhibit HMGB1 and IL-17 production more significantly than male MSCs. Also, estradiol-priming of female MSCs offer significantly increased protection from vascular inflammation in aortic tissue from male AAA patients. Conclusions: Dietary estrogen therapy and mesenchymal stem cells can attenuate aneurysm formation and inflammation in the elastase-perfusion murine model of AAA and in human aortic tissue from AAA patients. We propose to delineate the phytoestrogen mediated anti-inflammatory effects, and its crosstalk with various subsets of gender-specific MSCs, on aortic aneurysm formation in the murine (elastase-perfusion and angiotensin II) models as well aortic tissue and cells from AAA patients. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Abdominal aortic aneurysms are a significant clinical problem with no known treatment and leads to increased mortality, especially in caucasian males. Our research proposal aims to identify specific cellular targets to help prevent aortic aneurysms with dietary estrogen therapy, and to treat them with human mesenchymal stem cells. This study involves experiments with mouse aneurysm models and aortic tissue from abdominal aortic aneurysm patients which will help us better understand the mechanisms of aneurysm formation and has high potential of being translated into a viable treatment strategy in patients of this deadly disease.",Gender Differences in Experimental Aortic Aneurysms,9107480,R01HL081629,"['yellow adipose

"Bi-directional interactions with tumor microenvironment enhance BRCA1-IRIS overexpressing TNBC tumor cells aggressiveness ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Bi-directional interactions with tumor microenvironment enhance BRCA1-IRIS overexpressing TNBC tumor cells aggressiveness. TNBC is an aggressive breast cancer lacks ER/PR expression and Her2 amplification, therefore lacks targeted therapy. TNBC is over-represented in African American women, the majority live in Mississippi. TNBC is an aggressive rapidly advanced disease that metastasizes to lung, liver, and brain. BRCA1-IRIS is upregulated in the majority of TNBC. BRCA1-IRIS overexpression (hereafter IRISOE) promotes formation and metastasis of TNBC tumors, and its silencing prevents both. The objective of this study is to identify the molecular mechanism(s) responsible for enhanced metastasis by IRISOE. Our central hypothesis is that due to massive proliferation triggered by IRISOE, IRISOE tumors become avascular and necrotic in their cores. Hypoxia developed in areas surrounding these necrotic cores (we refer to this necrotic/hypoxic core as the aggressiveness niche) aggravates IRISOE tumor cells metastatic ability. Our data show that in the niche, hypoxia triggers IRISOE/TNBC tumor cells to secrete IL-6 and that induces IL-6R expression on MSCs. This signaling loop attracts MSCs to the vicinity of IRISOE/TNBC tumor cells and activates them to secrete PGE2. PGE2 binds to IRISOE/TNBC tumor cells through EP2/4 re-activates IRISOE/TNBC tumor cells to secrete other cytokines, e.g., GM-CSF and VEGF. GM-CSF is a potent recruiter of monocytes and VEGF of endothelial cells (EC). GM-CSF binding to CSF-2R on tumor associated macrophages (TAMs) and VEGF binding to VEGFR on ECs recruit them to the vicinity of IRISOE/TNBC tumor cells and activates them to secret factors, such as TGF-1ß from TAMs and IL8 from ECs. TGF-1ß binding to TßRI/II and IL8 to CXCR1/2 on IRISOE/TNBC tumor cells, in addition to PGE2/EP2/4 enhance IRISOE/TNBC cells aggressiveness and their dissemination and metastatic potential. In Specific Aim One, we will validate the bidirectional interactions between IRISOE/TNBC tumor cells and MSCs promoting IRISOE/TNBC tumor cells aggressiveness. In Specific Aim Two, we will validate the bidirectional interactions between IRISOE/TNBC tumor cells and M2- TAMs promoting IRISOE/TNBC tumor cells aggressiveness. Finally in Specific Aim Three, we will validate the bidirectional interactions between IRISOE/TNBC tumor cells and ECs role promoting IRISOE/TNBC tumor cells aggressiveness. The proposed studies are in line with the aims of the NIH of generating better understanding of the mechanisms that drive breast cancer progression and produce validated biomarkers for early detection and therapeutic targets. We believe our grant fulfills all these criteria and provide a compelling therapeutic rationale for th development of anti-BRCA1-IRIS drug to specifically target TNBC tumor cells in patients with high risk of recurrence and poor prognosis. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Most early breast tumors are estrogen receptor positive, sensitive to chemo- endocrine treatment. The majority of these tumors progress to a more aggressive tumors that are chemo- endocrine resistance, and often develop into distant metastases.

"Hemoglobin Modifiers for Sickle Cell Disease Therapy DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our goal is to design and establish novel therapeutic agents for sickle cell disease (SCD), namely drugs that inhibit the initial sickle hemoglobin (HbS) polymerization and the subsequent pathophysiology. When deoxygenated, HbS polymerizes into long, rigid, and insoluble fibers causing red blood cells (RBCs) to sickle, a process worsened by the unusual low affinity of HbS for oxygen, resulting in premature release of oxygen. Based on several evidence--our preliminary data, studies by others, and the results of a recently completed phase I/II clinical testing of our lead compound, 5-HMF (an allosteric effector of Hb, AEH)-we hypothesize that AEHs, not only prevent HbS polymerization, but also mitigates several secondary sickling related pathological events that include inflammation, oxidative stress/damage, RBC hemolysis, and pain. We also have preliminary evidence that our next generation AEHs (INN- and TD-series) exhibit enhanced potency and improved in-vitro duration of action. These AEHs act via a novel mechanism of action, i.e., destabilize HbS polymer contacts, in addition to increasing Hb affinity for oxygen; providing positive synergistic effects. We propose to test our hypothesis by further investigating candidate drugs from the INN- and TD-series, as well as derivatives of 5-HMF and INN-312 for their pharmacologic properties, focusing on the secondary SCD pathways, as well as the underlying HbS polymerization problem using our model systems. The specific aims are: 1. Design and synthesis of novel allosteric effectors of hemoglobin (AEHs). We will modify our parent compounds and synthesize derivatives with enhanced efficacy and prolonged half-lives. We will also synthesize prod rugs to protect the active aldehyde functional moiety from aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH)- mediated metabolism as necessary. 2. Investigate in-vitro functional, ant sickling, and cytotoxicity activities of novel AEHs. We will investigate the AEHs for their in-vitro ant sickling/functional activities (RBC sickling tests, P50 analyses, HbS solubility, and Hb adduct formation), and carefully monitor for adverse effects. 3. Determine in-vivo/in-vitro PK/PD properties, binding and metabolism and evaluate preclinical efficacy of AEHs in SCD Berkeley mice. We will show that serum albumin binding and/or metabolism by ALDH in RBC or hepatic cytosol are not likely to adversely affect in-vivo pharmacologic activity. We will demonstrate using a Berkeley mouse model of SCD transgenic mice that AEHs show potent pharmacologic effects, increase short- and long-term survival rates of mice. We will also study their potential beneficial effects, e.g. amelioration of hemolysis, inflammation, endothelial damage, and overall reversal of the SCD pathophysiology observed in this model. 4. Determine the atomic interactions between AEHs and Hb. X-ray crystallography will be used to validate our hypothesis that AEH potency is directly dependent upon their abilities to bind Hb with their pyridyl substituents toward the surface of the Hb molecule. The structures would provide valuable insight to help guide rational modifications for better pharmacologic properties. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Sickle cell disease (SCD) is the most common inherited hematologic disorder, affecting over 80,000 people, primarily African-American in the US, exacerbating the disproportionate health disparity among this minority population. Most common therapeutic intervention includes blood transfusions and hydroxyurea therapies, however, these therapies are associated with some undesirable side effects and not all patients benefit from the treatment.

"Multi-Tensor Decompositions for Personalized Cancer Diagnostics and Prognostics ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Recurring DNA copy-number alterations (CNAs) have been recognized as a hallmark of cancer for >100 years, yet what these alterations imply about a tumor's pathogenesis and a patient's diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment remains poorly understood. This is despite the growing number of large-scale multidimensional datasets recording different aspects of a single disease, e.g., in the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), and due to a fundamental need for mathematical frameworks that can create one coherent model from such multiple datasets arranged in multiple tensors of matched columns, e.g., patients, platforms, and tissues, but independent rows, e.g., probes.  For example, our recent comparative modeling (by using a data-driven two-matrix spectral decomposition) of patient-matched glioblastoma (GBM) brain tumor and normal blood genomic profiles from TCGA (arranged in two matrices, of matched columns but independent rows) uncovered a previously unknown global pattern of tumor-exclusive CNAs that is correlated with, and possibly causally related to, GBM survival and response to chemotherapy. The data had been publicly available since 2008, but this signature remained unknown until we applied our comparative modeling in 2012. Survival analyses showed, and computationally validated, that the signature performs better than, and is statistically independent of, age, the best indicator of GBM survival for >50 years, and existing GBM pathology laboratory tests. A new test for GBM based upon this signature is pending an experimental re-validation at the Associated Regional and University Pathologists (ARUP) Laboratories, Inc., a nonprofit reference laboratory of the Department of Pathology at the University of Utah.  In this NCI U01 project, our multidisciplinary team of researchers from the Departments of Bioengineering, Mathematics, and Pathology, the Scientific Computing and Imaging (SCI) Institute, and the Huntsman Cancer Institute (HCI) at the University of Utah, aims to (i) define, and study the properties of data- driven multi-tensor spectral decompositions; (ii) use these to model patient-, platform-, and tissue-matched but probe-independent TCGA genomic profiles, and gain biological and medical insights into the genotype- phenotype relations in lower-grade astrocytoma (LGA) brain cancer, ovarian serous cystadenocarcinoma (OV), and lung squamous cell carcinoma; and (iii) enable translation of these insights into pathology laboratory tests, by experimentally testing the computational predictions of the existing GBM model, as well as the novel LGA and OV models by using Utah samples.  Ultimately, this project will bring physicians a step closer to one day being able to predict and control the progression of cell division and cancer as readily as NASA engineers plot the trajectories of spacecraft today.

"Pathogenic Role of IL-18 in Sickle Cell Cardiomyopathy and Inducible Ventricular Tachycardia ABSTRACT: Individuals with sickle cell disease exhibit cardiovascular manifestations and sudden death as the top causes of premature death. These factors, unfortunately, contribute to the plateauing of the average life expectancy of these patients (in the 4th decade) over the past two decades, yet another profound health disparity observed in African Americans (AAs). Despite expanded understanding of the defining features including systemic vaso-occlusive episodes and hemolysis, there is a paucity of information linking cardiac pathology to premature death. Using system biology approaches, we have generated highly novel information characterizing a previously unrecognized human sickle cardiomyopathy defined by myocardial fibrosis, diastolic dysfunction, prolonged repolarization, and inducible ventricular tachycardia (VT) in the “humanized” sickle mouse model. These studies further demonstrated significant upregulation of circulating IL18 gene expression, an established inflammasome and pro-fibrotic mediator upregulated by free heme, in sickle cardiomyopathy. Additionally, exposure to IL-18 was a key factor in inducing VT in sickle mice. Preliminary data further link decreased expression and activity of cardiac potassium channels (KCND2/KCND3) in sickle mice, which can prolong repolarization, to acute increases in IL-18-mediated NADPH oxidase 4 (Nox4) expression, the latter a key source of reactive oxygenation species (ROS) and induction of cardiac apoptosis. We have further shown that chronic IL-18 inhibition reduces cardiac apoptosis, fibrosis and improves diastolic function in sickle mice coupled with reduced cardiac IL-18 receptor (IL-18R) and Nox4 expression. Finally, our genomic studies have identified novel polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with enhanced IL18 expression and prolonged corrected QT (QTc) interval, an established risk factor for VT. Thus, via three specific aims (SAs), this R01 will interrogate the mechanistic basis for the hypothesis that IL-18/IL- 18R/Nox4 signaling critically downregulates KCND2 and KCND3 function acutely and promotes myocardial fibrosis with sustained activation, exacerbating sickle cardiomyopathy and VT development. SA #1 will functionally validate heme-mediated IL18 promoter regulation including SNPs in a monocyte cell line. SA #2 will define how IL-18/IL-18R/Nox4 signaling acutely downregulates KCND2/KCND3 function leading to prolonged repolarization and chronically, results in cardiac apoptosis and fibrosis. SA #3 will define the therapeutic efficacy of strategies to prevent sickle cell-associated inducible VT. The knowledge gained from this R01 will directly translate into future clinical biomarker studies evaluating risk of sudden cardiac death highlighting those patients with a higher hemolytic burden, pathogenic IL18 SNPs, and circulating IL-18 levels with theoretically higher VT risk. Additionally, the data will test for effective and novel personalized therapies in a poorly recognized and fatal manifestation of sickle cell disease. NARRATIVE: While individuals with sickle cell disease exhibit sudden death as the top causes of premature death, it is unclear whether patients experience fatal cardiac arrhythmias that contribute to these outcomes. Our preliminary data, for the first time, reveals inducible ventricular tachycardia (a fatal rhythm disturbance) in preclinical sickle animal models. We propose to study and therapeutically target inflammatory mechanisms as major contributors to the development of abnormal cardiac electrical properties and fibrosis (scar), both factors promoting a heart environment vulnerable to fatal arrhythmias.",Pathogenic Role of IL-18 in Sickle Cell Cardiomyopathy and Inducible Ventricular Tachycardia,9285581,R01HL136603,"['sicklemia ', ' sickle disease ',

We will demonstrate using a Berkeley mouse model of SCD transgenic mice that AEHs show potent pharmacologic effects, increase short- and long-term survival rates of mice. We will also study their potential beneficial effects, e.g. amelioration of hemolysis, inflammation, endothelial damage, and overall reversal of the SCD pathophysiology observed in this model. 4. Determine the atomic interactions between AEHs and Hb. X-ray crystallography will be used to validate our hypothesis that AEH potency is directly dependent upon their abilities to bind Hb with their pyridyl substituents toward the surface of the Hb molecule. The structures would provide valuable insight to help guide rational modifications for better pharmacologic properties. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Sickle cell disease (SCD) is the most common inherited hematologic disorder, affecting over 80,000 people, primarily African-American in the US, exacerbating the disproportionate health disparity among this minority population. Most common therapeutic intervention includes blood transfusions and hydroxyurea therapies, however, these therapies are associated with some undesirable side effects and not all patients benefit from the treatment. Thus, there is still a need to develop new, more effective and non-toxic therapeutic agents against this debilitating disease.",Hemoglobin Modifiers for Sickle Cell Disease Therapy,9250636,R01MD009124,"['Affect ', ' Aldehydes ', ' sicklemia ', ' sickle disease ', ' sickle cell disease ', ' Hemoglobin sickle cell disorder ', ' Hemoglobin sickle cell disease ', ' Hemoglobin S Disease ', ' HbSS disease ', ' Hb SS disease ', ' Sickle Cell Anemia ', ' Antisickling Drugs ', ' Antisickling Agents ', ' Ants ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Physiologic Availability ', ' Biologic Availability ', ' Bioavailability ', ' Biological Availability ', ' Blood Transfusion ', ' Cellular Adhesion ', ' Cell Adhesion ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cells ', ' Cytosol ', ' body water dehydration ', ' Dehydration ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Endothelium ', ' blood corpuscles ', ' Red blood corpuscule ', ' Red Cell ', ' Red Blood Cells ', ' Marrow erythrocyte ', ' Erythrocytic ', ' Erythrocytes Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Blood normocyte ', ' Blood erythrocyte ', ' Erythrocytes ', ' Exhibits ', ' Goals ', ' blood disorder ', ' Hematological Disorder ', ' Hematologic Diseases ', ' Blood Diseases ', ' Hematological Disease ', ' hemoglobin level ', ' Hemoglobin concentration result ', ' Hemoglobin S ', ' Sickle Hemoglobin ', ' Hemoglobin ', ' Hemolysis ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' hydroxy-urea ', ' Hydroxycarbamide ', ' Hydroxycarbamid ', ' hydroxyurea ', ' In Vitro ', ' Inflammation ', ' Kinetics ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Metabolism ', ' Metabolic Processes ', ' Intermediary Metabolism ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Transgenic Mice ', ' Biological Models ', ' Model System ', ' Biologic Models ', ' Mus ', ' Murine ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Mice ', ' Oxygen ', ' O2 element ', ' O element ', ' Pain ', ' Painful ', ' Parents ', ' Patients ', ' Pharmacology ', ' Polymers ', ' Prodrugs ', ' Pro-Drugs ', ' Drug Precursors ', ' Rattus ', ' Rats Mammals ', ' Rat ', ' Common Rat Strains ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Serum Albumin ', ' Solubility ', ' Survival Rate ', ' Testing ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Toxicology ', ' vanillaldehyde ', ' 4-hydroxy-3-methoxybenzaldehyde ', ' vanillin ', ' Generations ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' Mediating ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Hepatic ', ' Surface ', ' Acute ', ' prematurity ', ' premature ', ' Phase ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Biological ', ' Series ', ' Xray Crystallography ', ' X-Ray/Neutron Crystallography ', ' X-Ray Diffraction Crystallography ', ' X Ray Crystallographies ', ' Single Crystal Diffraction ', ' X-Ray Crystallography ', ' sickle red blood cell ', ' sickle erythrocyte ', ' sickle RBC ', ' drepanocyte ', ' Sickle Cell ', ' Blood flow ', ' insight ', ' Oxidative Stress ', ' Disease Progression ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Physiopathology ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Therapeutic Agents ', ' polymerization ', ' Inherited ', ' Hereditary ', ' Event ', ' Oral ', ' System ', ' adduct ', ' cytotoxicity ', ' Lytotoxicity ', ' experience ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' aldehyde dehydrogenases ', ' ALDH ', ' Therapeutic Intervention ', ' intervention therapy ', ' Modeling ', ' Property ', ' Adverse event ', ' Adverse Experience ', ' Adverse effects ', ' treatment adverse effect ', ' therapy adverse effect ', ' side effect ', ' Treatment Side Effects ', ' Binding ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Hydration status ', ' Hydration ', ' Dose ', ' Affinity ', ' Data ', ' Disease Pathway ', ' in vivo ', ' clinical test ', ' Clinical Testing ', ' Clinical Evaluation ', ' research clinical testing ', ' Pathologic ', ' Monitor ', ' cell morphology ', ' Cellular Morphology ', ' Process ', ' Modification ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' insoluble fiber ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' next generation ', ' Minority ', ' sickling ', ' Population ', ' Impairment ', ' novel therapeutics ', ' novel therapy ', ' novel drugs ', ' novel drug treatments ', ' next generation therapeutics ', ' new therapy ', ' new therapeutics ', ' new drugs ', ' new drug treatments ', ' mouse model ', ' murine model ', ' public health relevance ', ' Biological Markers ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' preclinical efficacy ', ' drug candidate ', ' Regimen ', ' atomic interactions ', ' health care disparity ', ' healthcare disparity ', ' disparity in healthcare ', ' disparity in care ', ' ']",NIMHD,VIRGINIA COMMONWEALTH UNIVERSITY,R01,2017,395862,0.08070170044325091
"Multi-Tensor Decompositions for Personalized Cancer Diagnostics and Prognostics ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Recurring DNA copy-number alterations (CNAs) have been recognized as a hallmark of cancer for >100 years, yet what these alterations imply about a tumor's pathogenesis and a patient's diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment remains poorly understood. This is despite the growing number of large-scale multidimensional datasets recording different aspects of a single disease, e.g., in the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), and due to a fundamental need for mathematical frameworks that can create one coherent model from such multiple datasets arranged in multiple tensors of matched columns, e.g., patients, platforms, and tissues, but independent rows, e.g., probes.  For example, our recent comparative modeling (by using a data-driven two-matrix spectral decomposition) of patient-matched glioblastoma (GBM) brain tumor and normal blood genomic profiles from TCGA (arranged in two matrices, of matched columns but independent rows) uncovered a previously unknown global pattern of tumor-exclusive CNAs that is correlated with, and possibly causally related to, GBM survival and response to chemotherapy. The data had been publicly available since 2008, but this signature remained unknown until we applied our comparative modeling in 2012. Survival analyses showed, and computationally validated, that the signature performs better than, and is statistically independent of, age, the best indicator of GBM survival for >50 years, and existing GBM pathology laboratory tests. A new test for GBM based upon this signature is pending an experimental re-validation at the Associated Regional and University Pathologists (ARUP) Laboratories, Inc., a nonprofit reference laboratory of the Department of Pathology at the University of Utah.  In this NCI U01 project, our multidisciplinary team of researchers from the Departments of Bioengineering, Mathematics, and Pathology, the Scientific Computing and Imaging (SCI) Institute, and the Huntsman Cancer Institute (HCI) at the University of Utah, aims to (i) define, and study the properties of data- driven multi-tensor spectral decompositions; (ii) use these to model patient-, platform-, and tissue-matched but probe-independent TCGA genomic profiles, and gain biological and medical insights into the genotype- phenotype relations in lower-grade astrocytoma (LGA) brain cancer, ovarian serous cystadenocarcinoma (OV), and lung squamous cell carcinoma; and (iii) enable translation of these insights into pathology laboratory tests, by experimentally testing the computational predictions of the existing GBM model, as well as the novel LGA and OV models by using Utah samples.  Ultimately, this project will bring physicians a step closer to one day being able to predict and control the progression of cell division and cancer as readily as NASA engineers plot the trajectories of spacecraft today.

"Prevalence and Progression of Monoclonal Gammopathies DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Multiple myeloma (MM) is a life-threatening plasma cell malignancy. MM has a prolonged clinically detectable premalignant phase called monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) that can be identified by detection of the secreted monoclonal immunoglobulin (M protein) and through the presence of an abnormal immunoglobulin kappa/lambda free light chain (FLC) ratio. Over the last 10 years we have extensively characterized the various precursor stages of MM, and conducted numerous studies establishing monoclonal elevations of FLC and abnormalities in the FLC ratio as biomarkers for diagnosis, prognosis, response assessment, and risk stratification across a spectrum of plasma cell disorders. One of the goals of this renewal is to determine why MGUS occurs, and whether polyclonal plasma cell proliferation in response to infection or inflammation plays a role in pathogenesis of MGUS, MM and related malignancies. We are also investigating the reasons for dramatic racial disparity in incidence of MM; young blacks for example have a 3-fold higher risk than whites. Our studies show that a major reason for the racial discrepancy is a marked excess in the incidence of the precursor MGUS phase in blacks. Similarly, we have uncovered a significant familial predisposition in MGUS and MM. Since MM consists of multiple unique entities from a cytogenetic standpoint, we need to determine the precise cytogenetic subtypes responsible for racial disparity and familial predisposition. Thus two fundamental questions are: 1) Can we identify biomarkers that predict risk of MM prior to the premalignant MGUS stage (precursor of the precursor stage)? 2) What are the specific cytogenetic subtypes that account for the increased risk of MM in blacks and in first degree-relatives? In Aim 1 we will determine if polyclonal elevations of serum immunoglobulin FLC are associated with an increased risk of MGUS, MM and related B cell malignancies in a large cohort of nearly 16,000 patients. In Aim 2 we will assemble and study a cohort of 800 blacks with MM to identify the specific cytogenetic subtype(s) of MM associated with increased risk of MM, and also identify predictors of response to therapy and survival. In Aim 3 we will conduct studies to identify the specific cytogenetic subtypes associated with familial predisposition in MGUS. We believe our studies are highly innovative, and will have a far-reaching impact on our understanding of the etiology of MGUS, and the cytogenetic basis for racial disparity and familial predisposition. Our studies will result in a promising biomarker to identify patients at high risk for MM and related malignancies in the general population. Aims 2 and 3 will have a major impact on the management of patients with MGUS and MM, especially African Americans and first-degree relatives or persons with MGUS. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Multiple myeloma (MM) is a life-threatening plasma cell malignancy that is always preceded by a prolonged premalignant phase called monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS).

"Uterine Leiomyoma Development in Mouse Models DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Uterine fibroids (leiomyomata uteri) are the most common tumors in the female reproductive tract. Some estimates indicate that more than 50% of American women have uterine fibroids. Additionally, there is a significant disparity in the incidence of fibroids since African-American women are 2-3 times more likely to develop fibroids. These tumors can be very painful and are a leading cause of infertility in women. Also, because these tumors can become very large, and although the uterus is indispensable for mammalian reproduction, they remain the main reason for hysterectomies in the US. Despite the healthcare burden caused by uterine fibroids, their etiology and pathophysiology are unknown. We have developed mutant mice in which nuclear ß-catenin signaling has been specifically induced in reproductive tract tissues. Normally, mice do not develop fibroids; however, these mutant mice develop smooth muscle tumors in their uteri with 100% penetrance by 8 weeks of age. These tumors exhibit characteristics of human fibroids by histological and immunohistochemical criteria. ß-Catenin, a well-known downstream effector of Wnt signaling, induces organ and tissue malformations and tumor development following dysregulation of its activity. The mice also express higher levels of mTor, as observed in the Tsc2-mutant Eker rat fibroid model and in approximately 50% of human fibroids, suggesting that mTor activation may be a common pathway in leiomyoma development. We will investigate this mouse model further, placing particular emphasis on the regulation of mTor gene expression and activity for comparison with other mutant mouse models lacking myometrial Lkb1, the gene mutated in patients with Peutz-Jeghers Syndrome, and Tsc1, both of which also induce mTor activity and induce uterine fibroids as shown in our preliminary results. We propose to investigate the intracellular mechanisms and pathways affected by dysregulated Wnt/ß-catenin in our unique mouse model that induce mTor activity for comparison with Lkb1- and Tsc2-deleted uteri. To better understand the etiology and pathogenesis of fibroids, we will study the molecular mechanisms controlling fibrosis in the mutant myometrial cells such as cell polarity, extracellular matrix deposition, and myometrial differentiation. We will determine which characteristics of the mouse models most closely resemble human leiomyomas and are best suited for preclinical studies. Lastly, we will determine whether disrupted Wnt/ß-catenin signaling contributes to human leiomyoma development. The results from the studies in this proposal will provide new insights into the etiology and progression of these tumors, as well as provide the rationale for investigating therapies targeting the mechanisms involved in leiomyoma development and progression. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Uterine fibroids affect approximately 50% of American women during their reproductive years and are a significant source of pelvic pain, abnormal uterine bleeding, and infertility. Despite the major health care burden posed by uterine fibroids, very little is known about their cause or the best treatment strategies. As a result, if the symptoms are severe enough, patients can be managed by surgical intervention. The overall aims of the proposed studies are to understand the underlying causes of uterine fibroid development and growth and to develop new therapeutic options that could offer a safer alternative

"Asymmetric Lymphocyte Division in the Immune Response DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): B lymphocytes and the antibodies they produce play a critical role in host defense. Cell fate diversification of activated lymphocytes is essential to achieve the regenerative state required for long-lived immunity. The mechanisms responsible for generating B cell fate diversity, however, are poorly understood. Substantial preliminary data suggest B cells can diversify the fates and functions of their daughter cells using an evolutionarily conserved strategy to allocate unequal amounts of key components. This project will test whether asymmetric cell division is a cardinal feature of the B cell- mediated immune response. The proposal develops novel methodologies to image the characteristics of dividing B cells during the course of an immune response. The aims of the project are to test the importance of unequal cellular inheritance of three different transcriptional regulators of B cells Bcl-6, Pax5, and T-bet, each of which is known to regulate critical cell fate decisions. The experiments will test the hypotheses that asymmetric division is iteratively used to meet the opposing demands of terminal differentiation and self-renewal, as well to refine and diversify the functional properties of antibodies by regulating germinal center entry and class switch choice. This project will also examine whether ancestral regulators of cell polarity are responsible for establishing asymmetric B cell division, and how asymmetrically inherited proteins could mediate fate disparity in daughter B cells. These studies should provide a framework for rational engineering of immune responses and vaccines against microbial agents.

"Targeting CRLF2 and Ikaros Alterations to Reduce Health Disparities in Childhood Leukemia SUMMARY  Hispanic children are more likely to develop acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL), and when this occurs they are 39% more likely to die than non-Hispanic Whites. This disparity is due, in part, to a subtype of B-cell precursor ALL (B-ALL) that occurs five times more frequently among Hispanic children than others and has a high relapse rate. This type of leukemia, called CRLF2 B-ALL, is characterized by two genetic alterations: a) overexpression of the cytokine receptor, CRLF2, and b) deletion or inactivation of one allele of the Ikaros (IKZF1) tumor suppressor which is strongly associated with relapse. Our overall hypothesis is that combination therapy that selectively targets the pathways that are deregulated in CRLF2 B-ALL (CRLF2 and Ikaros) will produce a superior therapeutic effect and decrease mortality to reduce the health disparity in survival for Hispanic children with ALL. When the CRLF2 receptor is activated by its ligand, TSLP, downstream pathways (JAK/STAT and PI3/AKT/mTOR) that promote leukemia cell survival, proliferation, and chemoresistance are induced through processes normally kept in check by the Ikaros tumor suppressor. Preliminary data from our team show that treatment with the CK2-specific inhibitor, CX-4945, restores Ikaros tumor suppressor function in high-risk B-ALL from Hispanic patients with deletion of one Ikaros allele, exerting a strong in vivo therapeutic effect. Preclinical studies of CRLF2 B-ALL typically use patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models, where primary leukemia cells from patients with CRLF2 B-ALL are injected into immune deficient mice. Our preliminary data show that mouse TSLP does not activate human CRLF2, making the current PDX models suboptimal for studies of CRLF2 B-ALL. To overcome this obstacle our team engineered immune deficient mice that provide normal human serum levels of human TSLP (+T mice) and generated PDX by injecting these mice with CRLF2 B-ALL cells from Hispanic pediatric patients (+T PDX). Analysis of +T PDX shows CRLF2 activation and gene expression that is more similar to original patient sample than standard PDX. Our preliminary data provide a rationale for novel therapy that targets pathways that are induced by CRLF2 (JAK-STAT5 and PI3K/AKT/mTOR) and by loss of Ikaros tumor suppressor activity using our newly- developed preclinical model for Hispanic CRLF2 B-ALL. To test our hypothesis we will: Aim 1: Establish the in vivo therapeutic efficacy of targeting CRLF2 downstream pathways and their role in CRLF2 B-ALL in Hispanic pediatric patients. Aim 2: Evaluate the in vivo efficacy and mechanisms of combination therapy that restores Ikaros tumor suppressor activity and inhibits the mTOR pathway in Hispanic pediatric CRLF2 B-ALL. The proposed studies use precision medicine approaches (targeting specific pathways and/or functional defects) in context of the health disparity background to develop a novel treatment for CRLF2 B-ALL and reduce childhood cancer health disparities. NARRATIVE   Hispanic children are more likely to develop acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) and when they do they have a 39% higher death rate than non-Hispanic Whites. A contributor to this disparity is a sub-type of high-risk ALL that occurs five times more frequently in Hispanic/Latino children than others. The proposed studies use precision medicine approaches to target the specific genetic alterations responsible for this high-risk sub-type of ALL in a novel in vivo preclinical model that allows therapies to be evaluated in context of the health disparity genetic background.",Targeting CRLF2 and Ikaros Alterations to Reduce Health Disparities in Childhood Leukemia,9302326,R01CA209829,"['Affect ', ' Allelomorphs ', ' Alleles ', ' inhibitor ', ' inhibitor/antagonist ', ' Bursa-Equivalent Lymphocyte ', ' Bursa-Dependent Lymphocytes ', ' B-cell ', ' B-Cells ', ' B cells ', ' B cell ', ' B blood cells ', ' B-Lymphocytes ', ' Cell Division Cycle ', ' Cell Cycle ', ' Cell Viability ', ' Cell Survival ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cells ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' multimodality therapy ', ' combined treatment ', ' combined modality treatment ', ' combination therapy ', ' Multimodality Treatment ', ' Multimodal Treatment ', ' Multimodal Therapy ', ' Combined Modality Therapy ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' drug treatment ', ' Drug Therapy ', ' Pharmacotherapy ', ' Engineering ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Genes ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' leukemia ', ' B-Cell Acute Leukemia ', ' Precursor B Lymphoblastic Leukemia ', ' Leukemia, Lymphoblastic, Burkitt-Type ', ' L3 Lymphocytic Leukemia ', ' L3 Acute Lymphoid Leukemia ', ' L3 Acute Lymphogenous Leukemia ', ' L3 Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia ', ' L3 Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia ', ' FAB L3 ', "" Burkitt's Cell Leukemia "", ' Burkitt Leukemia ', ' B-Cell Type Acute Leukemia ', ' B-Cell Precursor Type Acute Leukemia ', ' B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia ', ' B-Cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia ', ' B-Cell  Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia ', ' B-ALL ', ' Acute B-Lymphocytic Leukemia ', ' Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia ', ' acute lymphomatic leukemia ', ' acute lymphogenous leukemia ', ' acute lymphatic leukemia ', ' Precursor Lymphoblastic Leukemia ', ' Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia ', ' Acute Lymphoid Leukemia ', ' Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia ', ' ALL -

"The DARC side of Breast Cancer Project Summary TNBC is arguably the most deadly BrCa subtype with higher prevalence in pre-menopausal women and in women of African descent. We know that the combined TNBC prevalence and poor treatment options are a likely cause of persistently higher mortality rates in African Americans compared to European Americans in the US. However, we have shown that within African Americans, disparities in BrCa survival are more pronounced within the TNBC category compared to the ER positive groups. These data indicate that unique mechanisms are operating in either tumor biology or host response in women of African descent. The ancient and African- specific Fy- allele alters the regulation of DARC/ACKR1, an atypical chemokine receptor, in a tissue-specific fashion beyond the previously described RBC phenotype. This implicates DARC/ACKR1 in various altered phenotypes in these ancestry groups, specifically as it relates to chemokine regulation. This project will test the hypothesis that DARC expression in tumor cells alters tissue chemokine levels to modify the host immune response to tumorigenesis, and that absence of DARC expression on blood cells as a result of the African-specific Fy- allele alters circulating chemokine levels, altering the tumor microenvironment and enhancing tumor aggression. Specifically we will; 1- Determine if DARC tumor expression associates with ancestry and altered host immune responses in a pilot BrCa cohort of African Americans and European Americans and 2- Determine if loss of DARC on bone-marrow-derived (bmd) blood cells alters chemokine profiles and tumor immune response, using pre-existing transgenic C3- 1Tag BrCa and AckR1-/- mice. Project Narrative This proposal addresses the disparities of breast cancer mortality in African Americans compared to European Americans and will provide information that defines a genetic mechanism to account for these differences. The results from this study will be used to develop in future studies to a novel prognostic and therapeutic targets for personalized medicine in these populations.  ",The DARC side of Breast

"Implementation of Medical Homes for Evidence Based Care of Adolescents and Adults with Sickle Cell Disease PROJECT SUMMARY Life expectancy for patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) has increased from teens to late forties over the last 30 years. The increase in the number of adults with the disease has created new unmet needs, due to the heavy disease burden and organ damage which increase with age. This is confounded by the inability of the health care system to adequately meet the needs of this population, and thus has resulted in disparities and increase in health care costs. This project attempts to address these problems by creating medical homes and medical neighborhoods in four different settings throughout rural Georgia, which has the fourth largest population of patients with SCD in the country. This will be achieved by building on the GRU Sickle Cell Center's experience in taking care of SCD patients through its outreach clinics, and more recently through its partnership with primary care practices and Hematology/Oncology practices at different locations in the state. In the first two years of the project (Phase I) a needs assessment of patients, communities, and providers will be carried out and a Community Advisory Council will be established. The results of this needs assessment will be used to develop and implement interventions to establish medical homes and neighborhoods to improve evidence-based care for SCD patients in Phase II. PROJECT NARRATIVE Advances in the diagnosis and care of infants and children with sickle cell disease (SCD) has led to an increase in life expectancy of this population and an increase in the number of adults with the disease. Chronic organ damage associated with the natural history of the disease on one hand, and challenges imposed by the health care system (large number of uninsured/underinsured patients, stigmatization, paucity of adult providers with expertise in the care of SCD) on the other, have created unmet needs. This project, in response to RFA HL- 16010, builds on the 30-year experience of the GRU Sickle Cell Center in providing care to patients with SCD in rural Georgia through its extensive outreach clinics and proposes to address these unmet needs by the creation of patient-centered medical homes and neighborhoods in four diverse health care settings.",Implementation of Medical Homes for Evidence Based Care of Adolescents and Adults with Sickle Cell Disease,9327046,U01HL134004,"['Adoption ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' ages ', ' Age ', ' sicklemia ', ' sickle disease ', ' sickle cell disease ', ' Hemoglobin sickle cell disorder ', ' Hemoglobin sickle cell disease ', ' Hemoglobin S Disease ', ' HbSS disease ', ' Hb SS disease ', ' Sickle Cell Anemia ', ' Puericulture ', ' Child Care ', ' Communities ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Faculty ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Hematology ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' hydroxy-urea ', ' Hydroxycarbamide ', ' Hydroxycarbamid ', ' hydroxyurea ', ' Infant Care ', ' infant health care ', ' Interview ', ' Life Expectancy ', ' Modernization ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Neonatal Screening ', ' newborn screening ', ' Newborn Infant Screening ', ' Pain ', ' Painful ', ' Patients ', ' Penicillins ', ' Penicillin Antibiotics ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Primary Care ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' recruit ', ' active recruitment ', ' Registries ', ' Research ', ' Stigmatization ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Universities ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Underinsured ', ' Uninsured ', ' chronic painful condition ', ' chronic pain ', ' Caring ', ' Guidelines ', ' Practice Guidelines ', ' base ', ' Organ ', ' improved ', ' Acute Pain ', ' Site ', ' Acute ', ' Chronic ', ' Phase ', ' Medical ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Adolescent ', ' sickle red blood cell ', ' sickle erythrocyte ', ' sickle RBC ', ' drepanocyte ', ' Sickle Cell ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' Individual ', ' Rural ', ' Funding ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Oncology Cancer ', ' oncology ', ' Letters ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' Clinic ', ' prophylactic ', ' Location ', ' Country ', ' interest ', ' Needs Assessment ', ' Medical center ', ' experience ', ' cohort ', ' disease natural history ', ' Participant ', ' member ', ' outreach ', ' Benefits and Risks ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' disease registry ', ' education planning ', ' patient registry ', ' Provider ', ' Address ', ' Adherence ', ' Consent ', ' Data ', ' Clinical Management ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' teenage ', ' teen years ', ' Teen ', ' Teenagers ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' NHLBI ', ' National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute ', ' years of life lost to disease ', ' years of life lost to disability ', ' disease burden ', ' burden of disease ', ' burden of illness ', ' implementation research ', ' underserved people ', ' under served population ', ' Underserved Population ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' patient oriented ', ' patient centered ', ' eligible participant ', ' implementation science ', ' clinical care ', ' evidence base ', ' FDA approved ', ' patient population ', ' effective therapy ', ' effective treatment ', ' Emergency Department Physician ', ' Emergency room physician ', ' Emergency Physician ', ' ER physician ', ' ED Physician ', ' ']",NHLBI,AUGUSTA UNIVERSITY,U01,2017,624658,0.05937433704956774
"Genetic Studies of Blood Cell Traits in Multi-Ethnic Cohorts ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Blood cell traits, including hemoglobin level, red blood cell (RBC), white blood cell (WBC), and platelet counts, are important intermediate clinical phenotypes for a variety of cardiovascular, hematologic, oncologic, immunologic and infectious disease. The distributions of these traits differ considerably across ethnicities. For example, further insight into the genetic determinants of ""ethnic neutropenia"" in African Americans (AA) may have implications for health disparities in risk of HIV infection, sickle cell disease severity or mobilization of neutrophils or hematopoietic stem cells in cancer patients. Our preliminary data similarly suggest important differences in the distribution of blood cell traits in Hispanics compared to non-Hispanic whites. Therefore, the proposed studies are likely to have direct clinical impact by providing new avenues for treatment, particularly for minority patients with low blood counts (Personalized Medicine), and illuminating new mechanisms by which genetic factors related to ethnic differences in blood cell counts contribute to U.S. health disparities fo risk of chronic inflammatory and thrombotic diseases.  Despite the importance of genetic factors in explaining variation in blood cell traits, there remains a huge gap in our knowledge of the contribution of specific loci to these traits among U.S. minorities. Coincidentally, multiethnic GWAS has been recognized as more powerful for gene mapping by the genetics community. However, there are very few sequencing-aided GWAS for blood cell traits in ancestrally diverse populations, and none in Hispanics/Latinos (HLs). Consequently, innovative methods are needed to study blood cell traits in multiethnic cohorts, particularly those recently admixed such as AA and HL, which have been under- represented in prior GWAS. The first attempts to map genes for blood cell traits in AA did not incorporate sequence based African specific content into the imputation, were limited in sample size, and did not accounted for local ancestry, mainly due to the lack of available methods and resources. Importantly, no GWAS have been conducted in HL for blood cell traits. For the proposed studies, our team has now assembled a new, larger collection of AA (n~34K), HL (n~26K) and Europeans (EU) (n~30K), and will leverage our recent methodological advances in imputation, local ancestry inference, and association analysis to increase our knowledge of blood cell trait genetics.  We propose the following Aims. Aim 1. Map genes for blood cell traits in AA (n~34K) accounting for local ancestry. Aim 2. Conduct the first sequencing-aided GWAS of blood cell traits in HL (n~26K) accounting for 3- way local ancestry. Aim 3. Meta-analyze across multi-ethnic datasets, annotate and validate novel association signals.

"Molecular mechanisms of estrogen receptor alpha modulating the inflammatory response in systematic lupus erythematosus ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Ninety percent of those diagnosed with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) are women, with peak incidence between the ages of 15 and 45, when women are most hormonally active. Despite significant research effort, the mechanisms underlying this sex bias remain unclear. Our laboratory previously backcrossed estrogen receptor alpha knockout (ERαKO) mice onto the NZM2410 lupus prone background. We demonstrated that female NZM/ERαKO mice had significantly less renal disease and significantly prolonged survival compared to WT littermates despite similar serum autoantibodies and glomerular immune complex deposition. ERαKO mice are not ERα null, but rather express an N-terminally truncated ERα. They have physiologic deficiencies including infertility due to disruption of a critical activation domain (AF-1). We showed that dendritic cell (DCs) from NZM/ERαKO mice have a blunted inflammatory response to Toll-like receptor (TLR) ligands. When these mice were ovariectomized, the protective phenotype was lost. Upon estradiol-repletion, protection was restored. True ERα null mice are not protected, suggesting that estrogen in the presence of the AF-1 mutant confers protection, rather than the absence of the full-length ERα66. Interestingly, the truncated ERα expressed in the ERαKO animal is structurally similar to ERα46, an endogenous ERα splice variant that lacks the AF-1 domain, and is a negative regulator of gene transcription. ERα46 has an identical DNA binding domain to ERα66 and is a powerful inhibitor of ERα66. We hypothesize that ERα46 expression has a protective effect in lupus. The goal of this project is to determine the role of ERα46 in SLE and TLR-induced inflammation and to improve our understanding of ERα-mediated transcription in the setting of inflammation. In order to accomplish this, Dr. Cunningham will (1) Define the in vitro molecular mechanisms underlying ERα46- and ERα66-regulated transcriptional activity impacting the innate inflammatory response of murine DCs, (2) Determine ex vivo and in vivo the role of ERα46 in TLR-induced lupus utilizing a murine strain expressing an A/B truncation mutant of ERα (ERαAF10), and (3) Use human peripheral blood monocyte (PBMC)-derived DCs to define the role of ERα46 and ERα66 in regulation of the innate immune response in DCs from controls vs. lupus patients. Dr. Cunningham is a clinician-investigator with a long-term career goal of becoming an independent basic and translational researcher in the field of immunology with a focus on SLE. To facilitate her transition to independence, she seeks to further her training in dendritic cell biology, ChIPseq and bioinformatics, and the use of human cells from patient samples. Dr. Cunningham has a mentorship team with an outstanding mentoring track record and wide expertise to support her project. The studies proposed in this K08 mentored grant application will significantly advance the field by providing understanding of ERα-mediated transcription in the setting of TLR-induced inflammation, including ERα binding partners, gene targets, and modulation by ERα46, which represents a potential therapeutic agent.           PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project is highly relevant to public health because females have a higher prevalence and significantly increased risk of autoimmune diseases such as lupus. The reasons for this health disparity remain unclear. This study will elucidate the mechanisms of estrogen receptor alpha (ERα) in modulating inflammation, with specific attention to dendritic cells and Toll-like receptor-induced inflammation, which are dysregulated in lupus patients. Identifying inflammatory pathways regulated by nuclear hormone receptors such as ERα will greatly expand our knowledge of lupus pathogenesis and contribute to the development of interventions to reduce risk, and improve diagnosis and treatment.        ",Molecular mechanisms of estrogen receptor alpha modulating the inflammatory response in systematic lupus erythematosus,9254202,K08AR068471,"['Affect ', ' ages ', ' Age ', ' Lymphoblastoid Interferon ', ' Lymphoblast Interferon ', ' Leukocyte Interferon ', ' Interferon-α ', ' Interferon Alfa-n3 ', ' IFNα ', ' IFNa ', ' IFN-α ', ' IFN Alpha ', ' Ginterferon ', ' G-interferon ', ' Alferon ', ' Interferon-alpha ', ' inhibitor ', ' inhibitor/antagonist ', ' Immune Complex ', ' Antigen-Antibody Complex ', ' Attention ', ' self reactive antibody ', ' autoimmune antibody ', ' Autoantibodies ', ' autoimmune disorder ', ' auto-immune disorder ', ' auto-immune disease ', ' Autoimmune Diseases ', ' Autoimmune Status ', ' Autoimmunity ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cells ', ' Veiled Cells ', ' Dendritic Cells ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Environment ', ' Therapeutic Estradiol ', ' Progynon ', ' Ovocylin ', ' Ovocyclin ', ' Estraldine ', ' Estradiol-17beta ', ' Estradiol-17 beta ', ' Estrace ', ' Diogynets ', ' Diogyn ', ' Dimenformon ', ' Aquadiol ', ' Estradiol ', ' Therapeutic Estrogen ', ' Estrogens ', ' Female ', ' trans acting element ', ' regulatory gene ', ' Transcriptional Regulatory Elements ', ' Regulator Genes ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Hormone Receptor ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' In Vitro ', ' Incidence ', ' Infertility ', ' infertile ', ' fertility loss ', ' fertility cessation ', ' Difficulty conceiving ', ' Cannot achieve a pregnancy ', ' Inflammation ', ' Interleukin-1 beta ', ' Preinterleukin 1 Beta ', ' Interleukin-1β ', ' Interleukin 1beta ', ' IL1β ', ' IL1F2 ', ' IL1B Protein ', ' IL1-β ', ' IL1-Beta ', ' IL-1β ', ' IL-1-b ', ' IL-1 β ', ' IL-1 beta ', ' Beta Proprotein Interleukin 1 ', ' Interleukin-6 ', ' interferon beta 2 ', ' Plasmacytoma Growth Factor ', ' Myeloid Differentiation-Inducing Protein ', ' MGI-2 ', ' IL6 Protein ', ' IL-6 ', ' IFNB2 ', ' IFN-beta 2 ', ' Hybridoma Growth Factor ', ' Hepatocyte-Stimulating Factor ', ' HPGF ', ' BSF2 ', ' BSF-2 ', ' BCDF ', ' B-Cell Stimulatory Factor-2 ', ' B-Cell Differentiation Factor-2 ', ' B-Cell Differentiation Factor ', ' B cell stimulating factor 2 ', ' B cell differentiation factor ', ' Kidney Diseases ', ' renal disorder ', ' kidney disorder ', ' Renal Disease ', ' Nephropathy ', ' Laboratories ', ' Ligands ', ' Systemic Lupus Erythematosus ', ' systemic lupus erythematosis ', ' disseminated lupus erythematosus ', ' Systemic SLE -

"Point-of-care device to identify patients at risk for preeclampsia SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Preeclampsia is a complication of pregnancy characterized by elevated blood pressure, proteinuria, and endothelial dysfunction involving multiple organ systems. Worldwide, preeclampsia is the largest cause of fetal and maternal morbidity and mortality, and accounts for nearly 16% annually of maternal deaths in the United States alone. African American women are disproportionately affected by preeclampsia in the United States, with a 1.5 to 2 fold increase in incidence over white or Hispanic women. Strikingly, the mortality rate for preeclampsia-associated deaths is up to 4-fold higher in African American women. Several factors have been attributed to this disparity, including higher incidence of comorbidities, delayed detection of symptoms, misdiagnosis, and differences in socioeconomic and insurance status. Moreover, 60% of preeclampsia-related deaths were found to have been preventable. Currently, there is no approved diagnostic test to predict which patients will develop preeclampsia. Patients with preeclampsia require hospitalization and continuous monitoring of the mother and fetus, thus, there is an urgent and unmet need for a diagnostic test that can identify those patients at risk for preeclampsia.  Significant efforts are underway to detect preeclampsia prior to disease onset. Recently, it was demonstrated that glomerular visceral epithelial cells (i.e. podocytes) are shed into the urine of preeclamptic patients and can be detected in the second trimester, prior to preeclampsia diagnosis, with high sensitivity and specificity. Methods to detect podocytes currently rely on overnight culture and sedimentation of cells onto collagen-coated slides, which is time consuming and susceptible to contamination, or the Cytospin technique, which is prone to high false-positive rates due to contaminating red blood cells (RBCs) or casts (mucoprotein secretions). Inconsistencies in the method of podocyte detection, and lengthy overnight incubations followed by immunofluorescence weaken the utility of podocytes as a rapid diagnostic marker of preeclampsia. To this end, Affinergy is developing a point-of-care device that will capture, isolate, and allow rapid quantification of diagnostic podocytes. Such a technology will improve the quality of podocyte capture and lead to significant cost savings by minimizing time and need for expensive equipment. In this Phase I application, we will focus on developing optimal peptide-modified magnetic beads for isolating podocytes. PROJECT NARRATIVE Preeclampsia is a life-threatening condition that affects nearly 300,000 pregnant women in the United States, and disproportionately affects African American women. Recent research has shown that detection of podocytes shed in the urine in the second trimester is an accurate predictor of preeclampsia development later in pregnancy. Affinergy is developing a novel method to detect podocytes from urine to improve detection and treatment of preeclampsia.",Point-of-care device to identify patients at risk for preeclampsia,9312351,R43EB024288,"['Accounting ', ' Affect ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Peripheral Blood Cell ', ' Blood Cells ', ' Blood Pressure ', ' Buffers ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cells ', ' Chemistry ', ' Collagen ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Comorbidity ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Equipment ', ' blood corpuscles ', ' Red blood corpuscule ', ' Red Cell ', ' Red Blood Cells ', ' Marrow erythrocyte ', ' Erythrocytic ', ' Erythrocytes Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Blood normocyte ', ' Blood erythrocyte ', ' Erythrocytes ', ' Fetus ', ' flow cytophotometry ', ' Flow Microfluorometry ', ' Flow Microfluorimetry ', ' Flow Cytofluorometry ', ' Flow Cytofluorometries ', ' Flow Cytometry ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Health Personnel ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Incidence ', ' Insurance ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Maternal Mortality ', ' Methods ', ' Microspheres ', ' Microbeads ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Mothers ', ' Patients ', ' Peptides ', ' Pre-Eclampsia ', ' pregnancy toxemia/hypertension ', ' Proteinuria-Edema-Hypertension Gestosis ', ' Pregnancy Toxemias ', ' Preeclampsia ', ' EPH Gestosis ', ' Pregnancy ', ' Gestation ', ' Pregnancy Complications ', ' pregnancy-related complications ', ' complications during pregnancy ', ' Second Pregnancy Trimester ', ' Second Trimester ', ' Midtrimester ', ' Pregnant Women ', ' expecting mother ', ' expectant mother ', ' Proteinuria ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Sensitivity and Specificity ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Urine Urinary System ', ' Urine ', ' Woman ', ' Immunofluorescence ', ' Immunofluorescence Immunologic ', ' Measures ', ' Cost Savings ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' Diagnostic tests ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Hispanics ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' Caring ', ' Urinary Casts ', ' Urine Casts ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Ensure ', ' Epithelial ', ' Recovery ', ' disorder onset ', ' disease onset ', ' Onset of illness ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Specimen ', ' Research Specimen ', ' Life ', ' Insurance Coverage ', ' Insurance Status ', ' Adopted ', ' Visceral ', ' Slide ', ' cell type ', ' Techniques ', ' body system ', ' Organ System ', ' fetal ', ' Magnetism ', ' magnetic ', ' Performance ', ' success ', ' novel ', ' Devices ', ' NPHS2 protein ', ' podocin ', ' Binding ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' Alpha Cell ', ' α-cell ', ' Glucagon Secreting Cell ', ' Glucagon Cell ', ' podocyte ', ' glomerular visceral epithelial cell ', ' Visceral Epithelial Cell ', ' magnetic beads ', ' Sedimentation process ', ' sedimentation ', ' Symptoms ', ' Affinity ', ' Detection ', ' Phage Display ', ' Monitor ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socio-economically ', ' socio-economic ', ' socioeconomics ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' point of care ', ' high risk ', ' screening ', ' endothelial dysfunction ', ' maternal morbidity ', ' diagnostic biomarker ', ' diagnostic marker ', ' high risk population ', ' high risk group ', ' ']",NIBIB,"AFFINERGY, LLC",R43,2017,186916,0.02699699125119749
"Calcium Channels, Calmodulin and Nuclear CREB Signaling ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Excitation-transcription (E-T) coupling is a process that converts the electrical or chemical activation of a cell to a signal conveyed to the nucleus. n this way, the expression of genes can be modulated in an activity-dependent manner. The neuronal remodeling that results is recognized to be necessary and important for long-term adaptive changes during neuronal development, learning and memory and drug addiction. The most scrutinized example of E-T coupling is Ca2+ signaling to the transcription factor CREB (cAMP response element-binding) protein via phosphorylation at Ser133. As an important source of Ca2+ influx, voltage-gated Ca2+ channels have been well studied for their biophysical and biochemical properties. Interestingly, in E-T coupling it seems that Ca2+ influxes through different Ca2+ channels can engage different signaling pathways to the nucleus. For example, CaV1 (also called L-type) channels enjoy a big advantage over CaV2 channels, even though CaV1 channels contribute only a minority of the overall Ca2+ entry in neurons. Our recent Cell paper uncovered that this disparity in potency can be explained by differences in how the two classes of Ca2+ channels employ local and global Ca2+ signaling. However, the 'private line' for the nanodomain advantage of CaV1 channels is unclear. Now we are poised to provide a detailed characterization of the critical question: what carries the long-distance signal from CaV1-anchored signaling complex to the nucleus? We have an answer: Ca2+/CaM translocation to the nucleus depends on a co-transporter that we now identify as γCaMKII. This shuttle gathers cytoplasmic Ca2+/CaM, sequestering it at the CaV1 channel before traveling to the nucleus under control of a nuclear localization signal. This signaling mechanism relies on γCaMKII, βCaMKII and CaN, signaling molecules that operate in the CaV1 nanodomain and also have been implicated in multiple neuropsychiatric diseases. This proposal focuses on understanding the cellular machinery of γCaMKII/CaM translocation and three specific aims are proposed. (1) Define the dynamics of Ca2+ signaling mechanisms that link CaV1 activity to nuclear CREB phosphorylation and CRE-dependent transcription. We will track γCaMKII translocation in real time and assess the impact of Ca2+/CaM delivered to the nucleus via this shuttle mechanism. (2) We will manipulate the γCaMKII pathway using genetic constructs in order to nail down the molecular components required for CREB phosphorylation. We will alter binding interactions and enzymatic actions involving CaM, βCaMKII, CaN, and PP2A at critical steps along the pathway. (3) Understand CaV1-dependent CaM shuttling in neocortical neurons and define distinct roles of nanodomain Ca2+ signaling and voltage gated conformational signaling for E-T coupling. Gaining a clearer picture of the linkage between CaV1 channels and CREB signaling will have a favorable impact on understanding how changes in gene expression alter the function of neurons in neural networks. Thus, the research is relevant both to basic cell biology and to disease states as diverse as addiction, autism and other neuropsychiatric diseases. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The ability to regulate gene expression in response to stimuli from the outside world is critical for the function of nearly all cell types in the body and plays  crucial role in regulating the function of neurons and their assembly into functional networks. This project studies the process by which excitation of neurons by membrane depolarization couples via opening of specific types of calcium channel and activation of cell signaling machinery to transcription of genes in the cell nucleus. Research on basic excitable cell biology will advance our understanding of how cells remodel themselves in health and in diseases such as addiction and autism.","Calcium Channels, Calmodulin and

"Gender Differences in Experimental Aortic Aneurysms DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Hypothesis: Our previous studies using elastase-perfusion and angiotensin II models of abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA) have shown that female rodents have a decreased incidence and size of aneurysm formation. We have also recently shown that human placental mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are protective in a mouse model of AAA. In the current proposal, we will investigate the role of dietary phytoestrogen as a preventive therapy, and its synergistic effects with MSCs as a treatment strategy to protect against AAA. Methods: We will use an elastase-perfusion and angiotensin II murine model of AAA using male and female wild-type, estrogen receptor knockout mice (ER-α--/- and ER-ß-/-) and ApoE-/- mice. Dietary phytoestrogen will be administered to male and female mice via estrogen-rich or estrogen-free chow. Various subsets of female MSCs (placenta-, bone marrow- or adipose-derived) primed with or without estrogen will be administered intravenously or by aortic implantation in mice models of AAA. Aortic diameter will be measured on day 3, 7 and 14 (elastase perfusion model) and day 28 (angiotensin II model). Aortic tissue will be harvested to analyze pro-inflammatory cytokine (IL-17, TNF-α-, MCP-1, IL-1-ß-, KC and RANTES) and HMGB1 (high mobility group box 1; a pro-inflammatory nuclear protein) production by ELISA, MMP2 and MMP9 activity by zymography, serine proteases (uPA, tPA and PAI-1) by western blots, paracrine factors (VEGF, HGF, PGE2) by ELISA, elastin and collagen degradation as well as aortic smooth muscle expression by histology, and immune cell (macrophages, CD4+ T cells, neutrophils) infiltration by flow cytometry. Results: Preliminary results demonstrate a significant upregulation of estrogen receptor (ER-α) expression in female mice on days 1, 3 and 14 after elastase-perfusion compared to males, as well as in aortic tissue from human females compared to males after AAA. Also, male mice fed a diet rich in estrogen display a significantly decreased aortic diameter, decreased cytokine production (IL-23, IL-1-ß-, IL-6 and IL-27), decreased MMP2 and 9 expression and decreased macrophage and neutrophil infiltration compared to male mice fed an estrogen free diet. Furthermore, treatment with human female MSCs attenuates aortic diameter, pro-inflammatory cytokine production and cell infiltration after AAA. Female MSCs inhibit HMGB1 and IL-17 production more significantly than male MSCs. Also, estradiol-priming of female MSCs offer significantly increased protection from vascular inflammation in aortic tissue from male AAA patients. Conclusions: Dietary estrogen therapy and mesenchymal stem cells can attenuate aneurysm formation and inflammation in the elastase-perfusion murine model of AAA and in human aortic tissue from AAA patients. We propose to delineate the phytoestrogen mediated anti-inflammatory effects, and its crosstalk with various subsets of gender-specific MSCs, on aortic aneurysm formation in the murine (elastase-perfusion and angiotensin II) models as well aortic tissue and cells from AAA patients. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Abdominal aortic aneurysms are a significant clinical problem with no known treatment and leads to increased mortality, especially in caucasian males. Our research proposal aims to identify specific cellular targets to help prevent aortic aneurysms with dietary estrogen therapy, and to treat them with human mesenchymal stem cells. This study involves experiments with mouse aneurysm models and aortic tissue from abdominal aortic aneurysm patients which will help us better understand the mechanisms of aneurysm formation and has high potential of being translated into a viable treatment strategy in patients of this deadly disease.",Gender Differences in Experimental Aortic Aneurysms,9302520,R01HL081629,"['yellow adipose

"Pathogenesis of fungal infectious disease in the Hmong population PROJECT SUMMARY I will study the mechanisms that underlie a health disparity and vulnerability to systemic fungal disease in the Hmong population. People of Hmong descent are 10 to 100 times more likely than non-Asian peers to acquire blastomycosis (an infection due to Blastomcyes dermatitidis) despite having fewer behavioral risk factors or co- morbidities. Blastomycosis, like other invasive mycoses, produces severe illness in some racial and ethnic groups, prompting the idea that genetic polymorphisms govern susceptibility. None have been found and this represents a gap in knowledge. My lab sequenced the whole genomes of 5 Hmong blastomycosis patients involved in an epidemic in Wisconsin. We found 192 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) shared in the patients, rare in the European Super Population, and meeting additional criteria such as location in an annotated regulatory region. Notably, many of the SNPs are in or near the gene encoding IL-6 or other genes that nurture IL-17 immunity. IL-17 is important in controlling fungal infection, but also in development of autoimmunity.  I will test the hypothesis that SNPs in IL-6 and related genes underlie immune dysregulation in the Hmong patients. My first aim is to study how SNPs identified in the pilot cohort impact the regulation of IL-6. As pathology may arise from either weak or over-exuberant responses, any difference in the response between Hmong patients and controls may be significant. SNP(s) that account for the observed differences will be identified by genetically manipulating primary cells and reporter cells, then studying impact on function. Another goal of the first aim is to investigate the function of an unstudied long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) that overlaps the IL-6 gene; it is likely that this lncRNA regulates IL-6 production. I postulate that a SNP we identified in this lncRNA modifies its function and thus impacts IL-6 transcript and product. My second aim is to apply two unbiased, open-ended methods to probe the anti-fungal responses of circulating immune cells from Hmong blastomycosis patients and controls. In these studies, cells will be probed with defined ligands or yeast, and response will be measured by cytokine bead array and transcriptome analysis. These data will reveal if receptors or signaling pathways are functioning aberrantly. In addition to supporting mechanistic findings from Aim 1, these studies will help generate new hypotheses.  This proposal addresses a key gap in knowledge: the mechanism that underlies a documented health disparity. Similar work on tuberculosis has identified SNPs that predict response to treatment, which allows clinicians to tailor therapy to individual patients. My results will similarly facilitate precise medical decision-making. My findings may also have implications beyond the field of fungal immunology; other IL-17-mediated diseases include autoimmune disorders and cancer. I am excited to undertake this project, and know that the training I receive in pursuing my aims will prepare me for a fruitful career as a clinician-scientist in Infectious Disease. PROJECT NARRATIVE People of Asian, primarily Hmong, ancestry are known to have an in-born susceptibility to the dimorphic fungal disease blastomycosis. Our pilot data suggests that an aberration in the IL-6/IL-17 axis underlies this health disparity. I will characterize how variation in the immune response leads to pathology in the Hmong population. My findings may identify novel targets for precise medical treatment of disease related to dysregulation of the IL-17 response, which includes fungal infections, autoimmune diseases, and

"Early environmental and hormonal exposure influences on human myometrial cell population 7. Project Summary/Abstract  Uterine fibroids represents a major ethnic disparity in the United States, with African American women afflicted by fibroids four times more than their Caucasian counterparts. While the mechanism underlying fibroid development remains elusive, it is proposed that as a result of putative early-life exposure to toxic environmental agents, such as endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs), in African-American (AA) women, the uterine myometrial stem cell (MSC) population expands permanently, and irreversible reprogramming of key DNA repair-related genes occurs in early development. This early-life reprogramming of DNA repair mechanisms thus decreases their capacity to repair myometrial cell DNA damage. Without functional DNA repair-related genes, somatic mutations, such as MED12 (implicated in approximately 85% of spontaneously-emerging fibroid tumors), emerge in these stem cells and convert them into uterine leiomyoma-forming stem cells, ultimately leading to the development of uterine fibroids.  In addition, it is well-established that fibroid tumors, primary myometrial and fibroid cells, and these myometrial stem cells’ growth is stimulated by ovarian hormones (estrogen and progesterone), suggesting differences in physiological estrogen and progesterone levels (whether due to cyclical hormonal changes or metabolic differences in the body). Research has shown different expression and/or polymorphisms in genes relating to estrogen biosynthesis and/or metabolism, e.g. CYP17, COMT, suggesting the hormonal impact on myometrial stem cell (MSC) expansion is greater in women of African American ethnicity. Combining these observations, studying the effects race and hormones have on MSC expansion counterparts may reveal underlying mechanisms of uterine fibroid development. . 8. Project Narrative  The ultimate goal of this project is to better understand and identify the sources of issues barring complete optimization of women’s health that spans from social, racial and ethnic determinants of health disparities for women, and minority women in particular, including not only the impact of the environment as a driver of physiological and epigenetic changes in the individual and the community, but also the involvement of integrated physiological aspects of organs and systems and the molecular and genetic determinants of both disease and resilience.",Early

"MOLECULAR BASIS FOR THE IMPACT OF SEX ON BRAIN TUMORIGENESIS DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Primary and metastatic brain tumors occur more commonly in males than females. This is true regardless of age or region of the world. Thus, sex must affect fundamental mechanisms of neoplastic growth in the central nervous system. In preliminary studies we established conditions that result in the transformation of male but not female astrocytes. This experimental paradigm is an unprecedented opportunity to define the molecular basis for the effects of sex on tumorigenesis. We found that sex affects global gene expression, activation of the tumor suppressor p21cip1, induction of a stem cell phenotype, growth kinetics, cellular senescence and patterns of intracranial malignant growth. Moreover, we found sex differences in human GBM stem cells. In this proposal we will exploit these murine and human GBM models to define the molecular basis for the effect of sex on brain tumorigenesis. In Specific Aim 1 we build on preliminary findings that sexually dimorphic expression of the growth inhibitory molecule p202 results in differential induction of the tumor suppressor p21cip1 and thereby blocks transformation in female astrocytes. In Specific Aim 2 we will follow up on preliminary studies that indicate stem cells are more easily induced in male astrocytes and define how sex, multiple initiating oncogenic events, X chromosome reactivation and cell of origin interact to regulate transformation. In Specific Aim 3 we perform validation studies with human male and female GBM stem cell cultures and test the hypothesis that sex differences in GBM stem cells will impact on responses to therapeutic targeting of CXCR4. Together these studies will advance of fundamental knowledge of cancer biology and have the potential to impact on our approach to treating patients with malignant brain tumors. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Successful cancer therapy may require tailoring treatment approaches to the individual and their unique cancer.

"Molecular causes and mechanistic underpinning of breast cancer racial disparity ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): African American (AA) women are more likely to have aggressive breast cancer (BC) and experience greater mortality rates as compared to Caucasian (CA) women. Another upsetting fact is that this cancer outcome gap has continued to widen over past several years underscoring the immediate need to make progress in this area. It is being increasingly appreciated that tumor microenvironment (TME) may play an important role in BC racial disparity; however, underlying molecular and mechanistic basis is not clearly understood. This project is built upon our novel findings suggesting the existence of a TME-tumor cell interaction-driven regulatory loop, which is predominantly active in AA patients. We demonstrate that 1) serum levels of inflammatory cytokines, resistin and IL6, are significantly elevated in AA BC patients compared to their CA counterparts, 2) AA BCs have significantly greater expression and phosphorylation of STAT3 compared to CA BCs, 3) treatment of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cell lines from both AA and CA patients with resistin promotes expression of STAT3/pSTAT3 and enhances IL6 production, thus suggesting a dominant role of differential TME in overall disease outcome, 4) IL6 mediates the effect of resistin on STAT3 phosphorylation, 5) resistin promotes aggressive tumor phenotypes and therapy-resistance in BC cells through STAT3 induction, 6) resistin also upregulates LIN28A, a regulator of stemness, and downregulates let-7 miRNA, and 7) LIN28A silencing abrogates resistin-induced upregulation of IL6, pSTAT3 and STAT3. Based on these findings, we hypothesize that intrinsic differences in tumor biology contributes to BC racial disparity and resistin-LIN28A-(IL6)- STAT3/pSTAT3 serves as an important regulatory loop controlling the aggressive and therapy-resistant phenotypes of BC cells. This hypothesis will be tested in three specific aims. In aim 1, we will characterize the molecular mechanisms underlying resistin-LIN28A-(IL6)-STAT3/pSTAT3 regulatory loop by examining the pathways regulating resistin-induced LIN28A expression, and whether LIN28A mediates resistin-induced let-7 downregulation, which then leads to STAT3 and IL6 upregulation in BC cells. In aim 2, we will examine the functional significance of this regulatory by using luciferase-tagged, control or LIN28A-/STAT3-silenced BC cell lines and characterize the response of resistin and its downstream effectors on growth, metastasis and therapy-resistance in an orthotopic nude mice model. In aim 3, we will determine the clinical relevance of the components of resistin-LIN28A-(IL6)-STAT3/pSTAT3 regulatory loop in BC racial disparity by examining their expression in clinical samples and assessing their correlation (alone and in combination) with TME and tumor cell characteristics as well as with race and patient's survival. Together, these studies will provide novel insight into molecular causes and mechanistic underpinning of BC racial disparity and provide novel set of biomarkers and potential drug-targets to develop novel ways for reducing the widening gaps in clinical outcome of AA and CA BC patients. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Cancer health disparities represent a major public health concern in the United States and there is a clear perception that these disparities exist at the molecular level and tumor microenvironment (TME) plays an important role. The proposed research will characterize TME-tumor cell interaction-driven molecular cross-talk and confirm its functional and clinical relevance in racially-disparate clinical outcomes of breast cancer (aggressiveness and therapeutic-resistance) between Caucasian (CA) and American (AA) patients. Anticipated findings will be helpful in understanding the molecular and mechanistic basis of breast cancer racial disparity, reveal therapeutically-significant intervention points and identify a novel set of mechanistically-linked biomarkers to serve as risk-predictors and molecular sub-classifiers of disease and thus ultimately be helpful in reducing the observed cancer outcome gaps.",Molecular

"Innate Immunity and Gender Differences in Melanoma The rate of melanoma has continued to rise for over 30 years. Once distant metastasis occurs, the 5 year survival rate for melanoma is only 16%. Until the age of 45, incidence rates of malignant melanoma are higher in woman than in men, but by the age of 60, rates in men are more than double those in women and by the age of 80, they are almost triple, indicating a gender disparity for melanoma. It is estimated that there will be 75,000 new cases of melanoma and nearly 10,000 deaths in 2015, with two thirds of these deaths expected to be males. The role of Innate immunity and the continuously decreasing testosterone levels with age in males have not been explored and the reason for this gender disparity remains unknown. To investigate the role of androgens in this gender disparity we used a B16 colonization and metastasis mouse model. We observed that 8 week old female mice had a significantly greater tumor burden than male mice. While ovariectomy did not affect tumor burden, castrated male mice had an increased tumor burden in the lung, as well as reduced neutrophil infiltration and natural killer (NK) cell activation, suggesting that these two cell types play a protective role and that Innate Immunity play a key role. Neutrophil depletion resulted in increased tumor burden and reduced NK cell activation, indicating a crosstalk between these two cell types in this model. In addition to the B16 cells, we have now established working metastatic models using “YUMM” cell lines obtained from genetically engineered mice with human melanoma mutations. The impact that testosterone levels has on Innate immunity, on neutrophils, NK cells, and possibly other mononuclear cells in melanoma patients is unknown. Based on these preliminary data and the reported presence of Androgen Receptor (AR) on bone marrow cells, we hypothesize that testosterone may interact directly with neutrophils, which in turn impacts NK cell function, to elicit a protective immune response against melanoma colonization and metastasis in the lungs. We propose this as the mechanism for the increased lung metastasis in female mice compared to male mice. To test this hypothesis we propose the following two specific AIMs for this exploratory R21 application: Aim1) To Determine the mechanism by which testosterone modulates the innate immune system and melanoma tumor burden in the lung and Aim 2) To Investigate the efficacy of testosterone treatment in reducing melanoma tumor cell lung colonization/metastasis The successful completion of this proposal will elucidate the mechanism by which androgens mediate colonization and tumor burden in the lungs of B16 or YUMM melanoma injected mice through the interaction with immune cells. The ultimate goal is to identify a subset of patients that may be good candidates for testosterone replacement therapy to increase the ability of the immune system to prevent and fight the metastasis of melanoma. Further, the focus on gender disparity may lead to new diagnostic tools and therapeutic modalities for prevention and treatment of metastatic melanoma by identifying an unknown role for hormones in an immunogenic cancer. Patients diagnosed with a distant metastasis of melanoma have a 5 year survival rate of 16% and nearly 10,000 individuals are expected to die of the disease in 2015, with two thirds of those deaths expected to be males. Until the age of 45, incidence rates are higher in woman than in men, but by the age of 60, rates in men are more than double those in women and by the age of 80, they are almost triple.

"Gender Disparity in Bladder Cancer and Chemopreventive Intervention DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Bladder cancer (BC) is the 4th most common cancer in men, but BC incidence is nearly 4 fold higher in men than in women across race; the underlying cause is not understood. Lack of such knowledge impedes progress in BC prevention. On the basis of our published and unpublished data, we hypothesize that hepatic UDP-glucuronosyltransferase 1A3 (UGT1A3) is a key determinant of the gender disparity in human BC development through converting androgen signal to increased urinary delivery of arylamine carcinogens to bladder tissue. Arylamines, 4-aminobiphenyl (ABP) in particular, are the main cause of human BC. We also hypothesize that sulforaphane (SF), a common dietary phytochemical, can block UGT1A3 from promoting arylamine-induced bladder carcinogenesis by boosting cytoprotective defense in the bladder. These hypotheses will be examined in four specific aims using complementary approaches of cultured cells and transgenic mouse models. Aim 1 is to test our hypothesis that liver UGT1A3 is a key molecule that determines the gender disparity in BC development. Wild-type mice and UGT1A3 transgenic mice (liver- specific and androgen-independent expression) will be compared for ABP-induced bladder carcinogenesis. Comparison will also be made between mice with and without castration. Another carcinogen 2- acetylaminofluorene (2-AAF) will be used to rule out ABP-specific effects. Aim 2 is to assess the impact of UGT1A3 polymorphism on its catalytic activity toward ABP and 2-AAF and on the susceptibility of bladder cells and liver cells to DNA damage induced by ABP and 2-AAF. Six single nucleotide polymorphisms occur in UGT1A3 gene. All the polymorphic variants together with the wild-type gene will be evaluated. Aim 3 is to test our hypothesis that SF can block UGT1A3 from promoting bladder carcinogenesis by stimulating cytoprotective defense against arylamine carcinogens (ABP and 2-AAF) in the bladder, without modulating UGT1A3 in the liver. Non-interference of liver UGT1A3 may be desirable, since this enzyme may be physiologically important, such as metabolizing estrone. SF is a promising cancer-preventive agent and is selectively delivered to bladder tissue through urinary excretion. Two animal models will be used to test the hypothesis, including the UGT1A3 mouse model described above and the Tg-UGT1 mouse model (mice carry both the coding and the regulatory sequences of the human UGT1A3 gene). Aim 4 is to confirm that UGT1A3 is transcriptionally stimulated by androgen in vivo and to elucidate the molecular mechanism by which androgen stimulates UGT1A3. This will be accomplished by using both cell models and the Tg-UGT1 mouse model. Impact: The proposed studies are expected to lead to the elucidation of the molecular basis of the gender disparity in BC and the development of new strategy for effective prevention of this disease. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: It has been known for several decades that the incidence of bladder cancer is nearly 4 fold higher in men than in women across race, but the reason has remained poorly understood. Lack of such knowledge impedes progress in bladder cancer prevention, and no chemopreventive agent is currently available for prevention of bladder cancer. This application will examine the hypothesis that UGT1A3 is a key determinant of gender disparity in human bladder cancer development and also examine the hypothesis that sulforaphane, a common dietary phytochemical, can block the bladder cancer-promoting activity of UGT1A3 and inhibit bladder cancer development, and the project is expected to significantly advance the knowledge about bladder cancer and to lead to development of a new strategy for effective prevention of this disease.",Gender Disparity in Bladder Cancer and Chemopreventive Intervention,9198759,R01CA164574,"['N-9H-fluoren-2-yl-acetamide ', ' N-2-Fluorenylacetamide ', ' Fluoren-2-ylacetamide ', ' 2-Fluorenylacetamide ', ' 2-Acetamidofluorene ', ' 2-AAF ', ' 2-Acetylaminofluorene ', ' Therapeutic Androgen ', ' Androgenic Compounds ', ' Androgenic Agents ', ' Androgens ', ' urinary bladder ', ' Bladder Urinary System ', ' Bladder ', ' Urinary Bladder Malignant Tumor ', ' Urinary Bladder Cancer ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Bladder ', ' Malignant Bladder Neoplasm ', ' Bladder Cancer ', ' Malignant neoplasm of urinary bladder ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' oncogenic agent ', ' Oncogens ', ' Cancer Causing Agents ', ' Carcinogens ', ' Environmental Carcinogens ', ' Surgical Castration ', ' Castration ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cells ', ' Cultured Cells ', ' DNA Injury ', ' DNA Damage ', ' Enzyme Gene ', ' Enzymes ', ' Therapeutic Estrone ', ' Estrone ', ' Family ', ' Female ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Genes ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Incidence ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Liver ', ' hepatic organ system ', ' hepatic body system ', ' male ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Metabolic Activation ', ' Drug Metabolic Detoxication ', ' detoxification ', ' Metabolism of Toxic Agents ', ' Metabolic Drug Detoxications ', ' Drug Metabolic Detoxification ', ' Transgenic Mice ', ' Mus ', ' Murine ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Mice ', ' Parents ', ' Play ', ' Genetic Polymorphism ', ' polymorphism ', ' Pseudogenes ', ' Publishing ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Testing ', ' Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' UDP Glucuronyl Transferase ', ' UDP Glucuronosyltransferase ', ' Glucuronyltransferase ', ' Glucuronic Transferase ', ' Glucuronosyltransferase ', ' United States ', ' Urine Urinary System ', ' Urine ', ' Woman ', ' 4-aminodiphenyl ', ' 4-aminobiphenyl ', ' 4-biphenylamine ', ' Gender ', ' sulforophane ', ' sulforafan ', ' methylsulfoxybutylisothiocyanate ', ' Sulfaforaphane ', ' Sulforaphane ', ' Hepatic ', ' Chronic ', ' Phase ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Predisposition ', ' excretion ', ' Excretory function ', ' Liver Cells ', ' Hepatic Parenchymal Cell ', ' Hepatic Cells ', ' Hepatocyte ', ' Carcinogen-DNA Adducts ', ' DNA Adducts ', ' Exposure to ', ' Malignant neoplasm of liver ', ' malignant liver tumor ', ' liver cancer ', ' Hepatic Cancer ', ' Knowledge ', ' Tobacco smoke ', ' Source ', ' UGT1A1 gene ', ' UGT1A5 ', ' UGT1A1 ', ' UGT1A ', ' UGT1 ', ' UDP glycosyltransferase gene 1 ', ' UDP glycosyltransferase 1 family, polypeptide A1 Gene ', ' GNT1 ', ' carcinogenesis ', ' Cancer Induction ', ' chemical carcinogenesis ', ' Protein Isoforms ', ' Isoforms ', ' Animal Model ', ' model organism ', ' model of animal ', ' Animal Models and Related Studies ', ' expectation ', ' disorder prevention ', ' disease prevention ', ' Aromatic Amines ', ' Arylamines ', ' Single Nucleotide Polymorphism ', ' Single Base Polymorphism ', ' Glucuronides ', ' Glucuronic Acids ', ' bladder cancer prevention ', ' Code ', ' Coding System ', ' carcinogenicity ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Preventive ', ' Bladder Tissue ', ' Data ', ' in vivo ', ' anticarcinogenic ', ' Chemopreventive ', ' Chemopreventive Agent ', ' Wild Type Mouse ', ' Molecular ', ' urinary ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Dietary Phytochemical ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel approaches ', ' new approaches ', ' novel strategies ', ' Carcinogen exposure ', ' Cell model ', ' Cellular model ', ' mouse model ', ' murine model ', ' overexpression ', ' overexpress ', ' over-expression ', ' public health relevance ', ' gender disparity ', ' ']",NCI,ROSWELL PARK CANCER INSTITUTE CORP,R01,2017,325312,0.06879040337032251
"Social regulation of pro-inflammatory monocytes DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposed research seeks to determine how adverse social environments influence the risk of inflammation-related disease by up-regulating the expression of pro-inflammatory genes. These studies test the hypothesis that adverse social environments stimulate the hematopoietic production of immature pro-inflammatory monocytes (CD16- in humans, Ly-6c-high in mice) via threat-induced activation of beta-adrenergic receptors in bone marrow myelopoietic cells. Specific aims will: (Aim 1) Define the neural and endocrine pathways by which chronic threat up-regulates pro-inflammatory monocytes; (Aim 2) Define the specific beta-adrenergic receptors and target cell types mediating threat-induced expansion of pro- inflammatory monocytes; and (Aim 3) Define the myelopoietic molecules mediating beta-adrenergic expansion of pro-inflammatory monocytes (including GM-CSF, TGF-beta, and the CXCL12/CXCR4 chemokine signaling axis). When complete, these studies will provide an integrated mechanistic model of the neural / hematopoietic pathway by which chronic adversity can up-regulate inflammatory gene expression in circulating immune cells. The overarching goal of these studies is to develop a comprehensive theory that explains how common social risk factors can influence multiple inflammation-related diseases. In addition to clarifying the basic physiologic mechanisms involved in ""defensive programming"" of the immune system transcriptome, these studies will identify specific CNS mechanisms (e.g., Crf gene activation in central nucleus of the amygdala), pharmacologic intervention strategies (e.g., beta-2 and beta-3 adrenergic antagonists, and antagonists of GM-CSF, TGF-beta, and/or CXCR4), and mechanistic biomarkers (e.g., myelopoietic molecules and circulating monocyte phenotypes) that can be applied in future studies to clarify how stress-induced up- regulation of pro-inflammatory monocytes impacts specific inflammation-related diseases such as atherosclerosis, Type II diabetes, Alzheimer's disease, and cancer. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This research seeks to improve public health by clarifying the biological pathways through which adverse social environments such as social isolation or poverty influence the risk of inflammation-related diseases such as heart disease, Alzheimer's disease, and cancer. This research will establish new risk factors, neural mechanisms, pharmacologic intervention strategies, and cellular and molecular biomarkers of individual health status to help protect human health

"Identification of novel prognostic markers in triple-negative breast cancers in African American Women Project Summary Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) is characterized by lack of expression of the estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2). Available chemotherapy for TNBC results in limited efficacy and significant toxicity. The majority of patients with metastatic disease do not survive beyond 3 years. Currently, no targeted therapies are available for TNBC, in part because it is a highly heterogeneous disease and because the molecular drivers for TNBC are not known. TNBC more frequently affects younger patients (< 50 years) and is twice as prevalent in African American women as compared to Caucasians. There is a need to understand the biology of TNBC at the basic genetic and epigenetic levels to be able to develop targeted therapies for individual patients. We have identified a cohort of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) that may be specific to TNBC in African American women. The proposed research is focused on understanding the function of these lncRNAs in TNBCs. We hypothesize that disparities in TNBC in the African American population may be explained, in part, by expression of non-coding RNAs and epigenetic alterations that are specific to this population. We propose that lncRNAs may play an important role in the initiation and progression of TNBC in this population through regulation of gene expression. This proposal, consisting of two Specific Aims, will powerfully harness the complementary expertise of a team of investigators with considerable experience in signal transduction, cell cycle control, gene regulation, and clinical aspects of breast cancer. In Aim 1, we will test the hypothesis that down-regulation of selected ""driver lncRNAs"" will significantly affect TNBC cell proliferation, cell cycle progression, survival, migration, and invasion in TNBC using in vitro models of this disease. In Aim 2, we propose to characterize the most promising lncRNAs using an animal model, in an effort to understand how they initiate and maintain the TNBC phenotype and the associated gene expression signature. PROJECT NARRATIVE TNBC is more frequent in younger patients (< 50 years) and is twice as prevalent in African American women as compared to Caucasians.

"Deceased Donor Bone Marrow Salvage and Processing ABSTRACT  This program aims to develop a method for banking clinical-grade bone marrow from cadaveric donors that can be deployed nationally to ameliorate shortages, provide bone marrow stockpiles as medical countermeasures for nuclear threats, and support existing research approaches such as delayed immune tolerance induction and transfusion of HIV-resistant stem cells.  We will adapt a method designed by our research team for procurement, processing, and banking bone marrow from cadaveric vertebral bodies, which has been shown to produce high yields of hematopoietic stem cells and other bone marrow cells from heart-beating donors. We have successfully transplanted bone marrow from these sources in clinical trials, with no adverse patient reactions. Now we aim to make key modifications to our method for deployment on a large scale, creating a protocol whereby organ procurement organizations can routinely procure vertebral bodies from a large pool of donors and ship them successfully to a centralized facility for processing, banking, and post-cryopreservation preparation for infusion. This will create a large supply of bone marrow that can be used on-demand, off the shelf, complementing existing bone marrow donor registries and cord blood banks.  The technical objectives of this Phase 1 feasibility study are to (1) develop a streamlined procurement protocol allowing organ procurement organizations to ship recovered vertebral bodies to a centralized processing facility, (2) test this optimized protocol for procurement from donors after cardiac death (DCDs) and non-organ tissue donors, and (3) develop a protocol for washout of cryoprotectants at a centralized facility before shipment to clinics. In Aim 1, we will optimize and streamline the existing bone marrow collection and processing protocol for donors following brain death (DBDs), testing multiple preservation solutions for procurement and shipment of donor vertebral body bone marrow. In Aim 2, we will validate that the optimized protocol determined in Aim 1 to can be applied to donors following cardiac death (DCD) and non-organ tissue donors to determine the potential total donor pool. In Aim 3, we will optimize post-cryopreservation processing to allow potential shipment of thawed, large cell volume products to clinics after removal of all cryoprotective agents, testing a hollow fiber dialysis/filtration system that prevents loss of cell yield as cryoprotectants are removed. The outcome of these aims will determine the most effective system for procurement, processing and banking of cadaveric bone marrow for clinical use on a large scale. NARRATIVE Shortages of bone marrow lead to thousands of deaths each year while waiting times worsen post-transplant survival, burdens which disproportionately affect ethnic minorities. Additional sources of bone marrow and stem cell transplants are sorely needed to complement the existing living donor registry and cord blood banks. We propose a method to bank clinical-grade bone marrow from cadaveric donors, which will ameliorate shortages, provide bone marrow stockpiles as medical countermeasures for nuclear threats, and support existing research approaches such as delayed immune tolerance induction and transfusion of HIV-resistant stem cells.",Deceased Donor Bone Marrow Salvage and Processing,9348290,R43AI129444,"['Affect ', ' autoimmune disorder ', ' auto-immune disorder ', ' auto-immune disease ', ' Autoimmune Diseases ', ' Awareness ', ' Blood Banks ', ' bone ', ' Bone Marrow Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Bone Marrow ', ' Bone Marrow Blood-Forming Cell ', ' Bone Marrow Blood-Deriving Cell ', ' Bone Marrow Cells ', ' Marrow Transplantation ', ' Bone Marrow Transplant ', ' Bone Marrow Grafting ', ' Bone Marrow Transplantation ', ' cerebral death ', ' Coma Depasse ', ' Brain Dead ', ' Brain Death ', ' Cadaver ', ' Cell Viability ', ' Cell Survival ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cells ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Complement ', ' cold storage ', ' cold preservation ', ' Cryofixation ', ' Cryopreservation ', ' Cryoprotective Agents ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' dialysis therapy ', ' Dialysis ', ' Dialysis procedure ', ' Dromisol ', ' Domoso ', ' Dimethylsulphoxide ', ' Dimethylsulphinyl ', ' Demeso ', ' Demasorb ', ' DMSO ', ' Dimethyl Sulfoxide ', ' transplant donor ', ' Donor person ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Feasibility Studies ', ' Feedback ', ' Filtration Fractionation ', ' Filtration ', ' Future ', ' Health ', ' hematopoietic stem progenitor cell ', ' hematopoietic progenitor ', ' Hematopoietic Progenitor Cells ', ' Blood Precursor Cell ', ' Hematopoietic stem cells ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' Hospitals ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Immune Tolerance ', ' immunological paralysis ', ' immune unresponsiveness ', ' immune system tolerance ', ' Immunologic Tolerance ', ' Ischemia ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Methods ', ' Organ Donor ', ' Organ Procurements ', ' Patients ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Biological Preservation ', ' preservation ', ' Biologic Preservation ', ' Registries ', ' Research ', ' rib bone structure ', ' Ribs ', ' Savings ', ' Ships ', ' Standardization ', ' Stem cells ', ' Progenitor Cells ', ' Sternum ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Tissue Donors ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' transplant ', ' Transplantation ', ' Woman ', ' Measures ', ' fetal cord blood ', ' Cord Blood ', ' Umbilical Cord Blood ', ' base ', ' Organ ', ' improved ', ' TRNSF ', ' Transfusion ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Medical ', ' Cell Transplants ', ' long bone ', ' Vertebral Body ', ' vertebra body ', ' Fiber ', ' Recovery ', ' Logistics ', ' Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplant ', ' HSC transplantation ', ' Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation ', ' Funding ', ' Letters ', ' Living Donors ', ' Nature ', ' Marrow ', ' Cardiac Death ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Autologous ', ' Clinic ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' Reaction ', ' Source ', ' System ', ' Country ', ' Nuclear ', ' spine bone structure ', ' Vertebral ', ' Vertebrae ', ' Infusion procedures ', ' Infusion ', ' Cell Volumes ', ' novel ', ' Excision ', ' resection ', ' Surgical Removal ', ' Removal ', ' Extirpation ', ' Abscission ', ' cell bank ', ' heart cell ', ' Provider ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Bone Marrow Stem Cell ', ' Collection ', ' nonmalignant ', ' Non-Malignant ', ' Preparation ', ' Process ', ' Modification ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Minority ', ' Nuclear power plant accident ', ' bone quality ', ' Outcome ', ' prospective ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' allotransplant ', ' operation ', ' HIV resistance ', ' HIV resistant ', ' ']",NIAID,"OSSIUM HEALTH, INC.",R43,2017,254755,-0.01924844598626465
"Hemoglobin Modifiers for Sickle Cell Disease Therapy DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our goal is to design and establish novel therapeutic agents for sickle cell disease (SCD), namely drugs that inhibit the initial sickle hemoglobin (HbS) polymerization and the subsequent pathophysiology. When deoxygenated, HbS polymerizes into long, rigid, and insoluble fibers causing red blood cells (RBCs) to sickle, a process worsened by the unusual low affinity of HbS for oxygen, resulting in premature release of oxygen. Based on several evidence--our preliminary data, studies by others, and the results of a recently completed phase I/II clinical testing of our lead compound, 5-HMF (an allosteric effector of Hb, AEH)-we hypothesize that AEHs, not only prevent HbS polymerization, but also mitigates several secondary sickling related pathological events that include inflammation, oxidative stress/damage, RBC hemolysis, and pain. We also have preliminary evidence that our next generation AEHs (INN- and TD-series) exhibit enhanced potency and improved in-vitro duration of action. These AEHs act via a novel mechanism of action, i.e., destabilize HbS polymer contacts, in addition to increasing Hb affinity for oxygen; providing positive synergistic effects. We propose to test our hypothesis by further investigating candidate drugs from the INN- and TD-series, as well as derivatives of 5-HMF and INN-312 for their pharmacologic properties, focusing on the secondary SCD pathways, as well as the underlying HbS polymerization problem using our model systems. The specific aims are: 1. Design and synthesis of novel allosteric effectors of hemoglobin (AEHs). We will modify our parent compounds and synthesize derivatives with enhanced efficacy and prolonged half-lives. We will also synthesize prod rugs to protect the active aldehyde functional moiety from aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH)- mediated metabolism as necessary. 2. Investigate in-vitro functional, ant sickling, and cytotoxicity activities of novel AEHs. We will investigate the AEHs for their in-vitro ant sickling/functional activities (RBC sickling tests, P50 analyses, HbS solubility, and Hb adduct formation), and carefully monitor for adverse effects. 3. Determine in-vivo/in-vitro PK/PD properties, binding and metabolism and evaluate preclinical efficacy of AEHs in SCD Berkeley mice. We will show that serum albumin binding and/or metabolism by ALDH in RBC or hepatic cytosol are not likely to adversely affect in-vivo pharmacologic activity. We will demonstrate using a Berkeley mouse model of SCD transgenic mice that AEHs show potent pharmacologic effects, increase short- and long-term survival rates of mice. We will also study their potential beneficial effects, e.g. amelioration of hemolysis, inflammation, endothelial damage, and overall reversal of the SCD pathophysiology observed in this model. 4. Determine the atomic interactions between AEHs and Hb. X-ray crystallography will be used to validate our hypothesis that AEH potency is directly dependent upon their abilities to bind Hb with their pyridyl substituents toward the surface of the Hb molecule. The structures would provide valuable insight to help guide rational modifications for better pharmacologic properties. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Sickle cell disease (SCD) is the most common inherited hematologic disorder, affecting over 80,000 people, primarily African-American in the US, exacerbating the disproportionate health disparity among this minority population. Most common therapeutic intervention includes blood transfusions and hydroxyurea therapies, however, these therapies are associated with some undesirable side effects and not all patients benefit from the treatment.

"Combinatorial Actions of Genetic Variants and Gender Bias of Alzherimer's Disease PROJECT ABSTRACT Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is conventionally characterized by specific neuropathological features, including the appearance of extracellular amyloid deposits and the accumulation of intracellular neurofibrillary tangles. While several gene mutations are clearly associated with early onset Alzheimer’s disease, the large number of individuals exhibiting delayed onset, aging-associated AD, are likely to harbor many alterations in linked modifier genes that predispose to AD susceptibility. Genetic and genome wide association studies (GWAS) have identified numerous genes and risk alleles that indicate both cell autonomous and non-cell autonomous mechanisms contributing to loss of neurons and cognitive decline. In this regard, the majority of risk variants identified by GWAS reside in non-coding regions of the genome, implying that they act in part to alter gene expression. This proposal responds to the RFA indicating a particular need for approaches designed to delineate the transcriptional and cellular consequences of combinations of SNPs in the risk alleles by generating new cell line reagents to help unravel the question of the causative SNPs and their target genes in specific neurons derived from iPS cells of AD individuals. There are two features of sporadic AD that require molecular explanation- the potential role of aging in AD susceptibility, and the striking gender disparity, with the incidence of AD being exaggerated in females. These issues can only now be addressed based on new technologies and the availability of patient-derived samples. Our proposed research plan takes advantage of the invaluable samples stored at the brain bank of the Shiley-Marcos Alzheimer's Disease Research Center (ADRC) at UCSD, and the iPSC-derived neurons (Salk). This approach will interrogate the effects of different genetic variants with other risk factors (e.g. age, sex), and assess their effects on cell type-specific enhancer landscapes. By merging these data, we can begin to identify the potential causative SNPs that result in altered function of cell-type specific enhancers. We propose using a high throughput 4C screening approach (UMI-4C), and Hi-ChIP, to identify the most likely causative, enhancer-associated SNPs for functionally-implicated coding target genes. Exploiting the power of contemporary gene editing approaches in control or patient-derived iPS cells to specific neuronal cell types, and to astroglia, we can assess the transcriptional phenotypes and functional behaviors of neurons harboring different combinations of risk alleles, both in the isolated cell lines alone and in combination with coculture experiments with astroglia and microglia, as effects of these SNPs may be manifest only with astroglial:neuronal interactions. Together these studies will use powerful contemporary global genomic approaches to determine the coding transcriptional targets of several of the most significant SNPs in enhancers, and the link to roles of estrogen receptor in the gender disparity for AD.

"Sequence analysis of hemotological traits in African Americans ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Circulating blood cell counts represent important intermediate phenotypes for a variety of cardiovascular, pulmonary, hematologic, and immunologic diseases. These traits differ by ethnicity and studying the genetics of these quantitative blood traits in African Americans (AAs) may reveal new biologic pathways that ultimately contribute to our understanding both of biology of blood cell production and of the relationship of blood counts with CVD and other chronic diseases that disproportionately impact AAs. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS), to date, performed mainly in European Americans, have implicated a number of genomic loci. Despite these successes, association signals for blood cell traits are often associated with uncertain effects on gene function or regulation, and therefore not readily translatable to clinical practice or treatment. Several recen advancements hold promise for translating genetic association findings for blood cell traits into mechanism-based therapeutic approaches for clinical disease. First, genome-wide mapping of blood cell type- and lineage-specific promoter and enhancer elements, transcription factor binding patterns and epigenetic profiling now provide a detailed picture of the cis- and trans- regulatory landscape during hematopoiesis. Second, experimental approaches utilizing genome engineering (RNA- guided CRISPR-Cas9) can characterize critical regulatory elements and functional variants of modest effect that are essential for stage-specific, lineage-restricted effects on gene expression. This proposal will utilize the wealth of newly available genetic data in multiple large AA cohorts, including exome array data on ~11,400 participants from the REasons for Geographical And Regional Differences in Stroke (REGARDS), the Jackson Heart (JHS) and Women's Health Initiative (WHI) studies and high-coverage whole genome sequence (WGS) data available on ~3,500 JHS participants through a recent NHLBI-funded WGS initiative to discover and functionally characterize novel genetic associations. These data will be combined with existing GWAS and exome array data on thousands of additional AAs with measured blood cell traits to form the largest and most comprehensive genetic study of blood cell traits ever conducted in AAs. Our study will use novel and established analytic and experimental approaches, consistent with the goals and directives of this initiative, to identify important genetic variants affecting these important blood-based biomarkers. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading killer of African Americans. The proposed work will identify novel genetic risk factors for various blood cell measures that influence CVD risk in African Americans and other populations.

"Dissecting gastric cancer clonality with genomic analyses and patient xenografts Abstract Gastric cancer is the third leading cause of cancer mortality worldwide, with over 720,000 individuals succumbing to this disease each year. Survival to this malignancy remains dismal: only 4% of patients with metastatic gastric cancer are alive 5 years after diagnosis. Interestingly, recent gastric cancer genomic studies have shown that this malignancy is highly heterogeneous, with every tumor having hundreds of mutations. It is not known, however, how these mutations are organized into gastric tumor subclonal cell populations. Understanding the subclonal organization of gastric tumors is important as such information will be essential to design optimal molecular testing methods that guide precision medicine. In the present study, we will investigate regional and temporal changes in gastric cancer clonality to understand the levels of intra-tumor heterogeneity and subclonal architecture, and to identify tumor subclones carrying driver mutations that can be targeted for therapy. Although subclonal architecture studies have not yet been carried out in gastric cancer, recent studies in other cancer types, such as lung and renal tumors, have produced interesting, yet contrasting results. While driver mutations tend to be present in most lung tumor subclones, multiple and younger subclones carrying different drivers are characteristic of renal tumors. Thus, while both lung and renal cancer show extensive intra-tumor heterogeneity, these results suggest that limited sampling (i.e. a single biopsy) may be appropriate for molecularly-guided therapies in lung cancer but that more extensive multiregional sampling and analyses will be required for molecular diagnostics in renal cancer. Here we aim to improve our understanding of gastric cancer clonality and its relevance for molecular diagnostics by performing multi- regional sequencing of 30 gastric cancer tumors and by evaluating the levels of histological and genetic similarities of matching tumors when they are implanted into immunosuppressed NSG mice. Our guiding hypothesis is that extensive intra-tumor heterogeneity in gastric cancers leads to complex patters of tumor clonal architecture. Our aims in the study are as follows: (1) To investigate gastric cancer clonal diversity using multiregional sequencing and (2) To assess histological and genomic similarities between primary cancers and tumors derived from patient-derived xenograft models. These experiments will be crucial to elucidate the patterns of gastric cancer clonal evolution and their impact and relevance in precision medicine. In particular, we will uncover the distribution of driver mutations in gastric cancer subclones and will provide a very strong basis to design further preclinical studies and clinical trials that efficiently target such mutations, leading to much needed improvements in gastric cancer survival. Our findings will be also relevant to address cancer disparities in the country as gastric cancer disproportionally affects U.S. Hispanics. Narrative This proposal aims to investigate patterns of gastric cancer clonality in primary tumors and in patient-derived xenografts using single cell and bulk targeted sequencing of cancer driver genes. Gastric cancer is the third worldwide leading cause of cancer-related death and a highly heterogeneous malignancy with a very poor prognosis. The information gained from the study will lead to a better understanding of gastric cancer clonal architecture will aid in developing better molecular diagnostics that guide precision gastric cancer medicine.",Dissecting gastric cancer clonality with genomic analyses and patient xenografts,9304028,R21CA199631,"['Affect ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Architecture ', ' Biopsy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cells ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Genes ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Histology ', ' Incidence ', ' Kidney Neoplasms ', ' Renal Tumor ', ' Renal Neoplasms ', ' Kidney Tumor ', ' Lung Neoplasms ', ' Pulmonary Neoplasms ', ' Lung Tumor ', ' malignant stomach neoplasm ', ' stomach pylorus cancer ', ' stomach fundus cancer ', ' malignant stomach tumor ', ' Stomach Cancer ', ' Malignant Gastric Tumor ', ' Malignant Gastric Neoplasm ', ' Gastric Pylorus Cancer ', ' Gastric Fundus Cancer ', ' Gastric Cardia Cancer ', ' Gastric Cancer ', ' Gastric Body Cancer ', ' Medicine ', ' Methods ', ' mortality ', ' Multiregional Analyses ', ' Multiregional Analysis ', ' Mus ', ' Murine ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Mice ', ' Mutation ', ' genome mutation ', ' Genetic defect ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Neoplasm Metastasis ', ' tumor cell metastasis ', ' cancer metastasis ', ' Secondary Tumor ', ' Secondary Neoplasm ', ' Metastatic Tumor ', ' Metastatic Neoplasm ', ' Metastatic Mass ', ' Metastatic Lesion ', ' Metastasize ', ' Metastasis ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' outcome forecast ', ' Prognosis ', ' Relapse ', ' Research ', ' Stomach ', ' gastric ', ' Stomach Neoplasms ', ' Stomach Tumor ', ' Gastric Tumor ', ' Gastric Neoplasms ', ' Testing ', ' Work ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Hispanics ', ' therapy failure ', ' Treatment Failure ', ' improved ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Histologically ', ' Histologic ', ' Individual ', ' lung cancer ', ' Pulmonary malignant Neoplasm ', ' Pulmonary Cancer ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Lung ', ' Malignant neoplasm of lung ', ' Localized Disease ', ' Genetic ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Knowledge ', ' Frequencies ', ' Complex ', ' Pattern ', ' Country ', ' Xenograft procedure ', ' xeno-transplantation ', ' xeno-transplant ', ' Xenotransplantation ', ' Xenograft ', ' Heterologous Transplantation ', ' Heterograft ', ' neoplastic cell ', ' Tumor Cell ', ' Primary Neoplasm ', ' Primary Tumor ', ' novel ', ' Mutation Analysis ', ' Clonality ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Genomics ', ' Renal carcinoma ', ' Renal Cancer ', ' Kidney Carcinoma ', ' Kidney Cancer ', ' Address ', ' Cancer Diagnostics ', ' Molecular Diagnosis ', ' Cancer Cause ', ' Cancer Etiology ', ' Cancer Patient ', ' Clonal Evolution ', ' Phylogenetics ', ' Phylogenetic Analysis ', ' Tumor-Derived ', ' Xenograft Model ', ' Characteristics ', ' Molecular ', ' pre-clinical study ', ' preclinical study ', ' immunosuppressed ', ' treatment resistance ', ' therapeutic resistance ', ' resistant to therapy ', ' resistance to therapy ', ' therapy resistant ', ' oncogenomics ', ' cancer genomics ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Minority ', ' Population ', ' cancer type ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' disparity in cancer ', ' cancer disparity ', ' Implant ', ' tumor ', ' precision medicine ', ' targeted treatment ', ' targeted therapy ', ' targeted therapeutic agents ', ' targeted therapeutic ', ' targeted drug treatments ', ' targeted drug therapy ', ' single cell sequencing ', ' targeted sequencing ', ' tumor heterogeneity ', ' intratumor heterogeneity ', ' intra-tumoral heterogeneity ', ' heterogeneity in tumors ', ' Intratumoral heterogeneity ', ' molecular diagnostics ', ' actionable mutation ', ' driver mutation ', ' cancer survival ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT DAVIS,R21,2017,204885,0.013263877124802297
"MyD88-dependent mechanisms of Helicobacter pylori-induced gastric cancer progression Abstract Gastric cancer ranks high among the leading causes of cancer-related deaths worldwide, with 989,600 new cases and 738,000 deaths each year. The majority of human stomach tumors are associated with chronic infection with the bacterial pathogen Helicobacter pylori. It is therefore critical to understand mechanisms that regulate and facilitate malignant progression to efficiently identify potential targets for preventative therapies. In the USA, death rates from gastric cancer follow ethnic divisions with the highest mortality rates among African Americans, followed by Asian/Pacific Islanders, Native Americans, Hispanics, and Caucasians. The cause of this disparity is unknown. There is now considerable amount of confirmatory evidence that the host response to H. pylori is crucial in determining susceptibility to gastric cancer. Furthermore, it is well established that inappropriate activation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling has an important function in gastric cancer development. The central objective of our proposed project is to identify accelerating factors by investigating the interaction of MyD88 signaling and a known gastric oncogenic pathway, Wnt/β-catenin and to elucidate the biological significance of these interactions in cancer progression. We recently showed using a Helicobacter-induced mouse model of gastric cancer that a key immune signal transduction adaptor protein, myeloid differentiation primary response gene 88 (MyD88), regulates Helicobacter-induced gastric cancer progression. However, the mediators of this cancer progression are unknown. We hypothesize that MyD88 deficiency leads to increased Wnt/β-catenin signaling in response to Helicobacter infection, which promotes gastric cancer development. It is known that Wnt/β-catenin signaling regulates gastrointestinal epithelial cell proliferation. However, the extent to which interactions between MyD88 and Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathways impact H. pylori-associated gastric carcinogenesis is unknown and has not been investigated. Our overall hypothesis is that the dramatic -/- acceleration in progression to gastric cancer found in Myd88 mice is due to interactions with oncogenic pathways, such as Wnt/β-catenin. Herein using a novel ex vivo gastric organoid culture system and a well- established Helicobacter-induced model of gastric cancer we will pursue the following specific aims: Specific aim 1: Investigate the effect of MyD88 on Wnt/β-catenin activity in H. pylori-induced epithelial cell proliferation using a gastric organoid culture system; Specific aim 2: Examine the function of Wnt/β- catenin signaling during acute inflammatory response and chronic inflammation in the absence and presence of MyD88 in a gastric cancer mouse model. First, this work first seeks to show that deficiency in MyD88 results in increased Wnt/β-catenin signaling.

"Molecular Classification of High Grade Endometrial Cancers: Extending TCGA Findings to a Diverse Population ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Endometrial cancer is the most common gynecological cancer and incidence is increasing in the United States. It also has one of the largest survival disparities of all common cancers, with approximately 20% fewer African American women surviving 5 years after diagnosis compared to white women, and this disparity holds across stages and histologic subtypes. Here we seek to examine a particularly aggressive subtype of endometrial cancers, high grade tumors including endometrioid, serous, clear cell and mixed carcinomas. These cancers are responsible for a disproportionate number of deaths from endometrial cancer, and are also more frequently diagnosed in African Americans. Specifically, we aim to: 1. Assess progression free survival and endometrial cancer-related survival in 500 women (250 African American, 250 white) diagnosed with high grade endometrial cancers, as defined by current pathologic standards; 2. Molecularly characterize (through whole exome sequencing and gene expression analysis) tumors from these women who received surgical treatment at two large research hospitals in Detroit, Michigan. We will perform integrated analysis to classify the tumors into biologically and clinically relevant groups and 3. Analyze the performance of the molecular classifications with respect to progression free survival and endometrial cancer- related survival, adjusting for relevant demographic, clinical, co-morbidity and treatment information. Preliminary work in this area has been done by The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), but the tumors included were primarily from white women, with only 10 endometrioid and 11 serous tumors from African American women used to inform the molecular reclassification analysis. Thus, our project will address a large gap in current knowledge. Public Health Significance: The identification of novel somatic mutations and understanding of the spectrum of molecular variation, particularly among African Americans, will help us move further toward personalized medicine, with the potential to reduce the racial disparities in endometrial cancer survival and ultimately improve survival for all women with endometrial cancer. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This application seeks to examine genomic variation in high grade endometrial cancers from African American and white women. The racial disparity in survival is one of the greatest of all cancers, and persists after controlling for histology, stage and treatment. We hypothesize that the underlying tumor biology is one factor driving this disparity, but data are sparse for African American women.",Molecular Classification of High Grade Endometrial Cancers: Extending TCGA Findings to a Diverse Population,9269530,R01CA200864,"['Affect ', ' driving ', ' Automobile Driving ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' epithelial carcinoma ', ' Malignant Epithelial Tumors ', ' Malignant Epithelial Neoplasms ', ' Epithelial cancer ', ' Carcinoma ', ' Systematics ', ' Classification ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Comorbidity ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Neoplasm of the Endometrium ', ' Endometrium Tumor ', ' Endometrial Tumor ', ' Endometrial Neoplasms ', ' Therapeutic Estrogen ', ' Estrogens ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Female ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Histology ', ' Hospitals ', ' Hysterectomy ', ' Incidence ', ' Medical Records ', ' Michigan ', ' Mutation ', ' genome mutation ', ' Genetic defect ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Progestins ', ' Utrogestan ', ' Therapeutic Progestin ', ' Syngesterone ', ' Proluton ', ' Prolidon ', ' Progeston ', ' Progestol ', ' Progestogens ', ' Progestogel ', ' Progesterone Agents ', ' Progestational Hormones ', ' Progestational Compounds ', ' Progestational Agents ', ' Progestasert ', ' Progestagenic Agents ', ' Lutromone ', ' Lutogyl ', ' Lutocylin M ', ' Lutocyclin ', ' Luteohormone ', ' Lipo-Lutin ', ' Gestone ', ' Gestiron ', ' Gestagens ', ' Gestagenic Agents ', ' Cyclogest ', ' Corluvite ', ' Corlutina ', ' outcome forecast ', ' Prognosis ', ' Public Health ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Research ', ' Survival Analysis ', ' Survival Analyses ', ' United States ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' population diversity ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' diverse populations ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Biological ', ' Histologically ', ' Histologic ', ' Clear Cell ', ' Progression-Free Survivals ', ' Exposure to ', ' cancer cell ', ' Malignant Cell ', ' Knowledge ', ' Frequencies ', ' Serous ', ' System ', ' Hormonal ', ' Endometrioid Tumor ', ' Female Reproductive Endometrioid Tumor ', ' Female Reproductive Endometrioid Neoplasm ', ' Endometrioid Tumor of the Female Reproductive System ', ' Endometrioid Neoplasm of the Female Reproductive System ', ' Endometrioid Neoplasm ', ' Tumor Tissue ', ' Endometrial Carcinoma ', ' Endometrium Carcinoma ', ' Endometrium Cancer ', ' Endometrial Cancer ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' surgery ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Somatic Mutation ', ' Performance ', ' Adjuvant Therapy ', ' novel ', ' Malignant Female Reproductive System Neoplasm ', ' gynecological malignancy ', ' gynecologic malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Female Reproductive System ', ' Malignant Gynecologic Tumor ', ' Malignant Gynecologic Neoplasm ', ' Gynecological Cancer ', ' Gynecologic Cancer ', ' Female Reproductive Cancer ', ' Gene Expression Profiling ', ' gene expression assay ', ' gene expression analysis ', ' Transcript Expression Analysis ', ' Transcript Expression Analyses ', ' Gene Expression Pattern Analysis ', ' Gene Expression Monitoring ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Microsatellite Instability ', ' cancer diagnosis ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' Address ', ' DNA Sequence Alteration ', ' genomic alteration ', ' Sequence Alteration ', ' Genetic mutation ', ' DNA mutation ', ' DNA Alteration ', ' Data ', ' Molecular Analysis ', ' Molecular Profiling ', ' molecular signature ', ' molecular profile ', ' Molecular Fingerprinting ', ' Expression Profiling ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Tissue-Specific Differential Gene Expression ', ' Differential Gene Expression ', ' Tissue-Specific Gene Expression ', ' Tumor Biology ', ' Pathologic ', ' Molecular ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' aged ', ' hormone related cancer ', ' clinically relevant ', ' clinical relevance ', ' tumor ', ' high risk ', ' public health relevance ', ' The Cancer Genome Atlas ', ' TCGA ', ' transcriptome sequencing ', ' RNAseq ', ' RNA sequencing ', ' RNA Seq ', ' exome sequencing ', ' personalized medicine ', ' personalized treatment ', ' personalized therapy ', ' personalization of treatment ', ' genomic variation ', ' racial disparity ', ' race disparity ', ' disparities in race ', ' improved outcome ', ' study population ', ' cancer survival ', ' ']",NCI,WAYNE STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2017,618743,0.02883966017982795
"Role of SLC13A3 in Renal Cell Carcinoma ABSTRACT  Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is the most common type of kidney cancer. African Americans and males tend to have higher rates of RCC when compared to Whites and Hispanics. Due to the lack of diagnostic tests and the asymptomatic nature of RCC in early stages, about 30% of patients have advanced/metastatic RCC at initial presentation. Metastatic RCC is fatal, with median survival of less than 2 years. There still remains a great need for the discovery of molecular drivers of RCC, and biomarkers that associate with racial disparity and predict clinical outcome in RCC patients. Microarray analysis of normal kidney and RCC tissues revealed that SLC13A3 is downregulated in RCC tissues; more significantly in African American RCC patients, when compared to White and Hispanic patients. SLC13A3 is a transporter of Krebs cycle intermediates and glutathione. Decreased intracellular glutathione levels have been shown to induce reactive oxygen species (ROS) that promote oncogenic functions in cancer cells. Overexpression of SLC13A3 in RCC cell lines decreased cell growth and clonogenic survival. SLC13A3 expression was found to be epigenetically regulated by DNA methylation. This proposal will test the hypothesis that SLC13A3 downregulation is a molecular determinant of RCC growth and progression. Furthermore, SLC13A3 downregulation correlates with racial disparity and is a predictor of clinical outcome (metastasis, treatment response, survival) in RCC patients. SLC13A3 functions, associated mechanisms, and phenotypic readouts will be investigated by expressing SLC13A3 in RCC cells and by its downregulation in normal kidney epithelial cells. The effect of SLC13A3 expression on tumor growth and metastasis will be investigated in RCC xenograft models. SLC13A3 expression in normal kidney and RCC tissues will be correlated with clinical outcome and racial disparity. The proposed study will be the first investigation into the functional role of SLC13A3 in any disease type, including cancer. The study should reveal the molecular changes and phenotypic consequences that occur due to SLC13A3 loss in RCC. The study may lead to the establishment of SLC13A3 as functional biomarker for RCC and for the racial disparity observed in terms of disease severity. PROJECT NARRATIVE  Despite advancements in treatment modalities, and diagnosis, molecular causes of renal cell carcinoma development, growth and progression, as well as, of the racial disparity associated with this disease are largely unknown. Through the discovery of a novel potential negative regulator of RCC, this project will investigate how this negative regulator controls RCC growth and progression, and furthermore, whether it is a predictor of clinical outcome and a biomarker of racial disparity in RCC patients. This project may lead to the identification of a tumor suppressor that is a biomarker of RCC progression and a therapeutic target.",Role of SLC13A3 in Renal Cell Carcinoma,9325290,F31CA210612,"['ages ', ' Age ', ' anti-oxidant ', ' Antioxidants ', ' ladakamycin ', ' Azacytidine ', ' AZC ', ' 5-Azacytidine ', ' 5-Aza-cytidine ', ' 5-AC ', ' 5 AZC ', ' Azacitidine ', ' bone ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' kidney adenocarcinoma ', ' Renal Cell Cancer ', ' Renal Cell Adenocarcinoma ', ' Renal Adenocarcinoma ', ' Nephroid Carcinoma ', ' Hypernephroma ', ' Hypernephroid Carcinoma ', ' Grawitz Tumor ', ' Renal Cell Carcinoma ', ' Cellular Growth ', ' Cellular Expansion ', ' cell growth ', ' cultured cell line ', ' Strains Cell Lines ', ' CellLine ', ' Cell Line ', ' Motility ', ' Cellular Motility ', ' Cellular Migration ', ' Cell Movement ', ' Cell Migration ', ' Cell Locomotion ', ' cell motility ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cells ', ' Citrates ', ' Tricarboxylic Acid Cycle ', ' TCA cycle ', ' Krebs Cycle ', ' Citric Acid Cycle ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Downregulation ', ' Down-Regulation ', ' Epithelial Cells ', ' balance function ', ' balance ', ' Equilibrium ', ' Q.

"Cell-based Therapy in RA: Proof of Concept This application proposes a double blind placebo-controlled Phase I cell therapy clinical trial in sero-positive, new-onset RA patients (within 2 years of diagnosis) who have high disease activity despite an adequate trial of a methotrexate, a Disease Modifying Anti-Rheumatic Drug (DMARD). The trial will take place at CWRU with two clinical performanace sites [MetroHealth Medical Center (MHMC) and University Hospitals Case Medical Center]. Cell based therapy using mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) holds great promise. MSCs appear to be pericytes, poised to sense and repair damage arising from exogenous or endogenous threats, i.e. the “guardians of inflammation”. These cells home to sites of inflammation and/or injury and facilitate repair while selectively reducing inflammation. The driving hypothesis for this clinical trial is that MSCs will have therapeutic value in restoring immune tolerance. MSCs have potential to delay or abort onset of full blown RA by resetting the immune system, inducing immune tolerance and dampening the observed amplification of adaptive immune mechanisms that perpetuate joint inflammation. Multiple RA therapies are available but none specifically repair autoimmunity; rather most interfere with both autoimmunity and protective host immunity. Most affected require lifelong therapy, rendering RA patients susceptible to infection and malignancy beyond that which RA itself confers. This study will focus on the safety of IV delivery of adult, bone marrow-derived allogeneic MSCs collected from a normal donor and expanded ex vivo. Patients will be randomized to MSCs or placeo and treated with a single infusion of MSCs while remaining on concomitant methotrexate except in the interval immediately after MSC infusion (so as not to damage the infused MSCs). Three MSC dose-escalation levels and studies will be performed. The enrollment schedule of one subject per month is acceptable to regulatory agencies. Dose escalation rules and early stopping rules have been developed. Patient reported outcomes (legacy and PROMIS) will be collected. In addition, we have engaged the Center for Health Disparities at MHMC in conducting focus groups to understand what RA patients think about the potential and appropriate timing for MSCs as RA therapy. An IRB application has been submitted and an IND submission will be completed prior to review of this application. Presuming safety, this study will be followed by a Phase II randomized placebo-controlled trial adequately powered to detect primary clinical and translational endpoints validated in the Phase I investigation. While the primary endpoint for the Phase I proof of concept program is safety, this study will use sensitive approaches to detect MSC immunologic effects in new onset RA patients in whom 12 weeks of methotrexate therapy has resulted in incomplete response (DAS28-CRP ≥ 4.4 ). Immunologic measures to detect tolerance will include measuement of number and function of Tregs using a novel functional biomarker developed in the PI's laboratory. At study end, we should be able to demonstrate safety of infusing MSCs in RA, pick two dosages for a successor Phase II trial, and identify which biomarkers should be used that trial. RA affects adults in the prime of their life and their career with two peaks of onset, the first in the mid-life around the age of forty and the second in the sixties. RA affects women more frequently than men with up to 1% of the population affected. The burden to society includes but is not limited ot the potential loss of individuals who are at the peak of their careers themselves who may be affected by RA or who may be responsible for caring for a family member with RA. This Phase I clinical trial in which RA patients have had an incomplete response to methotrexate receive add on therapy with a single infusion of adult bone marrow stem cells (or placebo infusion) from a healthy donor to “quiet” the immune system will be perfomed at two academic Case Western Reserve University (CWRU) sites- MetroHealth Medical Center and University Hospitals/Case Medical Center. If successful, cell based therapy would represent a paradigm shift in the treatment of RA. Studies have demonstrated that early treatment of new onset RA improves outcomes but therapies are most often life long, expensive and have undesirable side effects. If immune tolerance can be induced and the immune system ""reset"" to its ""pre-RA"" condition, than environmental and other lifestyle changes (e.g quitting smoking) could be used to reduce the chance of recrudescence of RA and increase the interval to ""flare"".",Cell-based Therapy in RA: Proof of Concept,9340062,R21AR069226,"['Corticosteroids ', ' Corticoids ', ' Adrenal Cortex Hormones ', '

"Bi-directional interactions with tumor microenvironment enhance BRCA1-IRIS overexpressing TNBC tumor cells aggressiveness ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Bi-directional interactions with tumor microenvironment enhance BRCA1-IRIS overexpressing TNBC tumor cells aggressiveness. TNBC is an aggressive breast cancer lacks ER/PR expression and Her2 amplification, therefore lacks targeted therapy. TNBC is over-represented in African American women, the majority live in Mississippi. TNBC is an aggressive rapidly advanced disease that metastasizes to lung, liver, and brain. BRCA1-IRIS is upregulated in the majority of TNBC. BRCA1-IRIS overexpression (hereafter IRISOE) promotes formation and metastasis of TNBC tumors, and its silencing prevents both. The objective of this study is to identify the molecular mechanism(s) responsible for enhanced metastasis by IRISOE. Our central hypothesis is that due to massive proliferation triggered by IRISOE, IRISOE tumors become avascular and necrotic in their cores. Hypoxia developed in areas surrounding these necrotic cores (we refer to this necrotic/hypoxic core as the aggressiveness niche) aggravates IRISOE tumor cells metastatic ability. Our data show that in the niche, hypoxia triggers IRISOE/TNBC tumor cells to secrete IL-6 and that induces IL-6R expression on MSCs. This signaling loop attracts MSCs to the vicinity of IRISOE/TNBC tumor cells and activates them to secrete PGE2. PGE2 binds to IRISOE/TNBC tumor cells through EP2/4 re-activates IRISOE/TNBC tumor cells to secrete other cytokines, e.g., GM-CSF and VEGF. GM-CSF is a potent recruiter of monocytes and VEGF of endothelial cells (EC). GM-CSF binding to CSF-2R on tumor associated macrophages (TAMs) and VEGF binding to VEGFR on ECs recruit them to the vicinity of IRISOE/TNBC tumor cells and activates them to secret factors, such as TGF-1ß from TAMs and IL8 from ECs. TGF-1ß binding to TßRI/II and IL8 to CXCR1/2 on IRISOE/TNBC tumor cells, in addition to PGE2/EP2/4 enhance IRISOE/TNBC cells aggressiveness and their dissemination and metastatic potential. In Specific Aim One, we will validate the bidirectional interactions between IRISOE/TNBC tumor cells and MSCs promoting IRISOE/TNBC tumor cells aggressiveness. In Specific Aim Two, we will validate the bidirectional interactions between IRISOE/TNBC tumor cells and M2- TAMs promoting IRISOE/TNBC tumor cells aggressiveness. Finally in Specific Aim Three, we will validate the bidirectional interactions between IRISOE/TNBC tumor cells and ECs role promoting IRISOE/TNBC tumor cells aggressiveness. The proposed studies are in line with the aims of the NIH of generating better understanding of the mechanisms that drive breast cancer progression and produce validated biomarkers for early detection and therapeutic targets. We believe our grant fulfills all these criteria and provide a compelling therapeutic rationale for th development of anti-BRCA1-IRIS drug to specifically target TNBC tumor cells in patients with high risk of recurrence and poor prognosis. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Most early breast tumors are estrogen receptor positive, sensitive to chemo- endocrine treatment. The majority of these tumors progress to a more aggressive tumors that are chemo- endocrine resistance, and often develop into distant metastases. Both resistance to anticancer drugs and poor prognosis may result from the presence of reactive stromal cells within these tumors that reciprocally interact with tumor cells and promote their progress to metastatic cells.

"2017 (IPCC) International Pigment Cell Conference ABSTRACT The International Pigment Cell Conference (IPCC) attracts scientists and clinicians from many disciplines from around the world to share the latest scientific advances in pigment cell research. Pigment cells are the factories that produce biologic pigments that have many important roles in camouflage, attraction, decoration, and protection within the animal kingdom. The most important pigment cells in mammals are melanocytes which produce the pigment melanin which acts as the major natural sunscreen. However, there are many other functions of melanocytes in the skin, eyes, ear, meninges of the brain and in the heart. Uncovering how these cells work to impact pigmentation has led to fundamental advances in basic and translational biology. Evolution, genetics, genomics, cell biology, chemistry, immunology, epidemiology, oncology, dermatology, cancer risk and progression and systems biology are all specialty fields in which our IPCC members and attendees have made important contributions. Many human diseases are caused by variability or dysfunction in melanocytes. Melanoma is the major cancer involving pigment cells, and is a major killer worldwide. Susceptibility to melanoma is directly related to sun exposure and the genetic character of protective melanin in different individuals. The IPCC meeting in 2017 will have multiple sessions on pigment cell epidemiology, basic biology, ultraviolet light and melanin photo-protection, melanoma genetics and genomics, immune destruction, and exciting new treatments. Skin depigmentation commonly occurring in vitiligo and albinism is another important melanocyte dysfunction that has a global impact on human health. Hyperpigmentation of the skin due to melasma or post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation is a major cosmetic concern worldwide as well. In short, pigment cells perform critical roles in all mammals, and dysfunction of these cells produce significant mortality and morbidity. This IPCC brings together geneticists, immunologists, oncologists, molecular biologists, stem cell scientists, molecular chemists, dermatologists, pediatricians, and geriatricians to explore the complex biology and dysfunction of pigment cells. The meeting is a logical venue to interact with a wide variety of basic and translational scientists and clinicians. New treatments for melanoma, autoimmune diseases targeting pigment cells, photo-ageing of the skin, chemical and toxic dyspigmentation, and non-cutaneous pigment cell disorders will all be discussed and explored. This year's meeting will focus on Breakthroughs in Pigment Cell Research. A full day will be devoted to melanoma and substantial content will be presented on vitiligo and depigmentation. Historically, the International Pigment Cell Conference has performed a pivotal role in this diverse field to foster interaction, exchange and collaboration amongst some of the world's foremost scientists, clinicians and opinion leaders, while also providing important training opportunities for junior scientists and clinicians PROJECT NARRATIVE The 2017 IPCC Conference in Denver, Colorado will be organized by a local organizing committee of faculty members from the Department of Dermatology at the University of Colorado, Anschutz Medical Campus as well as a group of distinguished scientists from around the world (international organizing committee). The group of researchers and clinical researchers primarily study pigmentary disorders including pigmentary diseases disproportionately affecting persons of color, vitiligo, genetics pigmentation syndromes and melanoma and fundamental biological and biochemical processes underlying those disease states. The theme of the conference is Breakthroughs in Pigment Cell Research. (www.ipcc.com). This is relevant to public health as this important conference will disseminate the latest findings as they relate to the etiology, treatment and prevention of pigmentary disorders such as vitiligo and melanoma.

"Implementation of a Sickle Cell Enhanced Novel Care Network in South Carolina (iSCENSC) ABSTRACT Sickle cell disease (SCD) is recognized as a significant health disparity in the United States due to the number of patients affected, the paucity of available providers, disease stigmatization, and a lack of treatment options for affected individuals (4). In certain regions of the US, these issues are further worsened by a large percentage of affected patients living in rural regions with limited access to care, lower socioeconomic status, and fewer funding options (5, 6). South Carolina (SC) is a prime example of state that is tremendously under-resourced to treat individuals living with SCD. State-level engagement of pediatric hematologists, managed care organizations, patients, and community foundations resulted in formation of the South Carolina-Sickle Cell (SC2) statewide network designed to increase access to evidence-based care for all individuals living with SCD and to improve their clinical outcomes through access to a SCD medical home (Spoke) connected to a regional specialty care center (Hub). This approach harnesses the state’s resources to improve care for individuals with SCD, utilize the strengths of partnering hospital systems, and use a technology based approach to extend care to rural areas. This project, iSCENSC (Implementation of a Sickle Cell Enhanced Novel Care Network in South Carolina) is designed to evaluate intervention effectiveness for achieving full implementation of the SC2 network and to determine if the hub and spokes model of care increases access to quality care for individuals with SCD and produces findings sufficient to identify replicable methods for optimal care enrichment especially in rural populations. Specific Aims are: 1. Perform a systematic needs assessment in three target regions currently involved in SC2 (Midlands, Pee Dee and Lowcountry) to assess the gap between current and SCD best practices for adolescent and adult SCD patients and to identify care delivery issues associated with disease-specific care primary care, acute care management, and care coordination. 2: Engage all relevant stakeholders (patients/caregivers, providers, SC2 partners) to begin building capacity for the conduct and assessment of targeted interventions to increase implementation readiness within three SC regions and partnering health systems and to further inform Phase II implementation strategies. 3: Initiate comparative effectiveness study using an interrupted time series, multi-sector, multi-modal design including specific implementation intervention strategies. iSCENSC will be the first multilevel, multicenter implementation science study in adolescents and adults with SCD aiming to achieve the outcome of a statewide SCD network. We propose the first large study of barriers inhibiting adoption and use of NHLBI SCD Guideline and of effectiveness of dissemination and implementation strategies in closing existing guideline-to-practice gaps and reducing longstanding disparities in SCD treatment, policy, and funding support of SCD care delivery. PROJECT NARRATIVE Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a significant health disparity in the United States because a lot of individuals are affected by it, there are few healthcare providers to offer people adequate services to people with SCD, and treatment options are limited, especially for children with SCD as they move into adulthood. The goal of iSCENSC is to find out how we can best make changes in healthcare systems, our communities, and in our policies in support of SC2 (Sickle Cell-South Carolina) a statewide network in South Carolina (SC) designed to have more people receive care that works for SCD throughout their lifetime and to decrease their chances of being sick or dying too early as a result of having SCD. This project will evaluate educational, training, telemedicine, and enhanced treatment options to improve the system of care for people living with SCD in South Carolina.",Implementation of a Sickle Cell Enhanced Novel Care Network in South Carolina (iSCENSC),9327045,U01HL133990,"['Academy ', ' Adoption ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Affect ', ' sicklemia ', ' sickle disease ', ' sickle cell disease ', ' Hemoglobin sickle cell disorder ', ' Hemoglobin sickle cell disease ', ' Hemoglobin S Disease ', ' HbSS disease ', ' Hb SS disease ', ' Sickle Cell Anemia ', ' Award ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' Consultations ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Foundations ', ' Genotype ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Health Personnel ', ' treatment access ', ' health services availability ', ' health service access ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' accessibility to health services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Access to Care ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' Hospitals ', ' Institutes ', ' Interview ', ' Long-Term Care ', ' extended care ', ' Methods ', ' Patients ', ' Periodicity ', ' Rhythmicity ', ' Cyclicity ', ' Phonation ', ' Population Characteristics ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Primary Care ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Rural Population ', ' South Carolina ', ' medical specialties ', ' Specialty ', ' Stigmatization ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Technology ', ' Telephone ', ' Phone ', ' Time ', ' Transportation ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Care Givers ', ' Caregivers ', ' symposia ', ' summit ', ' convention ', ' conference ', ' symposium ', ' Managed Care ', ' Third-Party Payer ', ' Caring ', ' Custom ', ' Telemedicine ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' rural area ', ' improved ', ' Acute ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Medical ', ' Series ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Adolescent ', ' Ensure ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' sickle red blood cell ', ' sickle erythrocyte ', ' sickle RBC ', ' drepanocyte ', ' Sickle Cell ', ' Individual ', ' healthcare utilization ', ' healthcare service utilization ', ' healthcare service use ', ' health care service use ', ' Health Care Utilization ', ' health care service utilization ', ' Rural ', ' Policies ', ' Funding ', ' Collaborations ', ' Vitelliform macular dystrophy ', ' best macular dystrophy ', ' Vitelliform MD ', "" Best's Disease "", ' Best Disease ', ' programs ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' Location ', ' meetings ', ' Services ', ' Needs Assessment ', ' care delivery ', ' novel ', ' member ', ' Modality ', ' Code ', ' Coding System ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Quality of Care ', ' QOC ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' disease registry ', ' Provider ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Institution ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Readiness ', ' Preparedness ', ' low socioeconomic status ', ' low socioeconomic position ', ' low socio-economic status ', ' low socio-economic position ', ' low SES ', ' Health system ', ' Evidence based practice ', ' Data ', ' Effectiveness of Interventions ', ' Improve Access ', ' Interruption ', ' Clinical Sciences ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' translation research ', ' Translational Science ', ' Translational Research ', ' Update ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' informant ', ' NHLBI ', ' National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute ', ' website ', ' web site ', ' care systems ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' administrative database ', ' administrative data base ', ' comparative effectiveness ', ' demographics ', ' implementation science ', ' community based practice ', ' evidence base ', ' patient population ', ' standard of care ', ' Institutional Review Boards ', ' IRBs ', ' IRB ', ' Pediatric Hematologist ', ' Assessment tool ', ' Assessment instrument ', ' ']",NHLBI,MEDICAL UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA,U01,2017,649265,0.05605640321488857
"Point-of-care device to identify patients at risk for preeclampsia SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Preeclampsia is a complication of pregnancy characterized by elevated blood pressure, proteinuria, and endothelial dysfunction involving multiple organ systems. Worldwide, preeclampsia is the largest cause of fetal and maternal morbidity and mortality, and accounts for nearly 16% annually of maternal deaths in the United States alone. African American women are disproportionately affected by preeclampsia in the United States, with a 1.5 to 2 fold increase in incidence over white or Hispanic women. Strikingly, the mortality rate for preeclampsia-associated deaths is up to 4-fold higher in African American women. Several factors have been attributed to this disparity, including higher incidence of comorbidities, delayed detection of symptoms, misdiagnosis, and differences in socioeconomic and insurance status. Moreover, 60% of preeclampsia-related deaths were found to have been preventable. Currently, there is no approved diagnostic test to predict which patients will develop preeclampsia. Patients with preeclampsia require hospitalization and continuous monitoring of the mother and fetus, thus, there is an urgent and unmet need for a diagnostic test that can identify those patients at risk for preeclampsia.  Significant efforts are underway to detect preeclampsia prior to disease onset. Recently, it was demonstrated that glomerular visceral epithelial cells (i.e. podocytes) are shed into the urine of preeclamptic patients and can be detected in the second trimester, prior to preeclampsia diagnosis, with high sensitivity and specificity. Methods to detect podocytes currently rely on overnight culture and sedimentation of cells onto collagen-coated slides, which is time consuming and susceptible to contamination, or the Cytospin technique, which is prone to high false-positive rates due to contaminating red blood cells (RBCs) or casts (mucoprotein secretions). Inconsistencies in the method of podocyte detection, and lengthy overnight incubations followed by immunofluorescence weaken the utility of podocytes as a rapid diagnostic marker of preeclampsia. To this end, Affinergy is developing a point-of-care device that will capture, isolate, and allow rapid quantification of diagnostic podocytes. Such a technology will improve the quality of podocyte capture and lead to significant cost savings by minimizing time and need for expensive equipment. In this Phase I application, we will focus on developing optimal peptide-modified magnetic beads for isolating podocytes. PROJECT NARRATIVE Preeclampsia is a life-threatening condition that affects nearly 300,000 pregnant women in the United States, and disproportionately affects African American women. Recent research has shown that detection of podocytes shed in the urine in the second trimester is an accurate predictor of preeclampsia development later in pregnancy. Affinergy is developing a novel method to detect podocytes from urine to improve detection and treatment of preeclampsia.",Point-of-care device to identify patients at risk for preeclampsia,9540322,R43EB024288,"['Accounting ', ' Affect ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Peripheral Blood Cell ', ' Blood Cells ', ' Blood Pressure ', ' Buffers ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cells ', ' Chemistry ', ' Collagen ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Comorbidity ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Equipment ', ' blood corpuscles ', ' Red blood corpuscule ', ' Red Cell ', ' Red Blood Cells ', ' Marrow erythrocyte ', ' Erythrocytic ', ' Erythrocytes Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Blood normocyte ', ' Blood erythrocyte ', ' Erythrocytes ', ' Fetus ', ' flow cytophotometry ', ' Flow Microfluorometry ', ' Flow Microfluorimetry ', ' Flow Cytofluorometry ', ' Flow Cytofluorometries ', ' Flow Cytometry ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Health Personnel ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Incidence ', ' Insurance ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Maternal Mortality ', ' Methods ', ' Microspheres ', ' Microbeads ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Mothers ', ' Patients ', ' Peptides ', ' Pre-Eclampsia ', ' pregnancy toxemia/hypertension ', ' Proteinuria-Edema-Hypertension Gestosis ', ' Pregnancy Toxemias ', ' Preeclampsia ', ' EPH Gestosis ', ' Pregnancy ', ' Gestation ', ' Pregnancy Complications ', ' pregnancy-related complications ', ' complications during pregnancy ', ' Second Pregnancy Trimester ', ' Second Trimester ', ' Midtrimester ', ' Pregnant Women ', ' expecting mother ', ' expectant mother ', ' Proteinuria ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Sensitivity and Specificity ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Urine Urinary System ', ' Urine ', ' Woman ', ' Immunofluorescence ', ' Immunofluorescence Immunologic ', ' Measures ', ' Cost Savings ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' Diagnostic tests ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Hispanics ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' Caring ', ' Urinary Casts ', ' Urine Casts ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Ensure ', ' Epithelial ', ' Recovery ', ' disorder onset ', ' disease onset ', ' Onset of illness ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Specimen ', ' Research Specimen ', ' Life ', ' Insurance Coverage ', ' Insurance Status ', ' Adopted ', ' Visceral ', ' Slide ', ' cell type ', ' Techniques ', ' body system ', ' Organ System ', ' fetal ', ' Magnetism ', ' magnetic ', ' Performance ', ' success ', ' novel ', ' Devices ', ' NPHS2 protein ', ' podocin ', ' Binding ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' Alpha Cell ', ' α-cell ', ' Glucagon Secreting Cell ', ' Glucagon Cell ', ' podocyte ', ' glomerular visceral epithelial cell ', ' Visceral Epithelial Cell ', ' magnetic beads ', ' Sedimentation process ', ' sedimentation ', ' Symptoms ', ' Affinity ', ' Detection ', ' Phage Display ', ' Monitor ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socio-economically ', ' socio-economic ', ' socioeconomics ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' point of care ', ' high risk ', ' Institutional Review Boards ', ' IRBs ', ' IRB ', ' screening ', ' endothelial dysfunction ', ' maternal morbidity ', ' diagnostic biomarker ', ' diagnostic marker ', ' high risk population ', ' high risk group ', ' ']",NIBIB,"AFFINERGY, LLC",R43,2017,52200,0.02699699125119749

"Estrogen Negatively Modulates Proteoglycan-4 Expression in TMJ ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Temporomandibular joint disorders (TMDs) affect a significant portion of the population of the USA, with the majority of those seeking treatment being women of childbearing age. Owing to this striking sexual dimorphism it has been postulated that sex hormones play a role in the maintenance of normal temporomandibular joint (TMJ) function. Proteoglycan 4 (PRG4) is a secreted lubricating molecule essential for maintaining low frictional levels within articular joints; however, its role in the TMJ is not well characterized. We identified conserved estrogen response elements within the 5' flanking region of the PRG4 gene of human and baboon, and found that treatment of baboon TMJ disc cells with estrogen attenuated PRG4 promoter activity and expression of PRG4 mRNA in vitro. This discovery of negative regulation of PRG4 by estrogen is the basis for the hypothesis that a causative event in the development of TMD is estrogen-mediated down regulation of PRG4 transcription. Insufficient quantity of PRG4 in the TMJ is expected to lead to increased friction and over time, degradation of TMJ components affecting the articulation of the mandibular condyle with the glenoid fossa of the temporal bone and disc placement, which largely describes the human TMD phenotype. In this study we propose three specific aims; 1) to determine the extent that estrogen decreases PRG4 expression in female and male baboon TMJ cells and TMJ organotypic cultures. Immunoblots and qPCR will be used to quantify estrogen effects on PRG4 expression in synovial and cartilage cells and tissues that will be compared to PRG4 expression in TMJ disc cells and tissue. 2) To characterize by ChIP analysis estrogen alpha and beta receptors and estrogen response element binding in PRG4 gene regulation in femal and baboon TMJ cells. 3) To provide a highly mentored environment and rigorous biomedical research training opportunities for the development of underrepresented students in the life sciences. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Proteoglycan-4 (PRG4) is known to be crucial for the healthy lubrication of articular joints and failure of the temporomandibular joint (TMJ) lubrication mechanism has been proposed to lead to TMJ disorders (TMD), which are reported predominantly by young females. The proposed study follows through on the finding that estrogen inhibits PRG4 gene expression in cells of the TMJ, possibly explaining the gender disparity seen in TMD patients. Characterizing estrogen-mediated inhibition of PRG4 expression is expected to lead to innovative therapeutic treatments beneficial for TMD patients.",Estrogen Negatively Modulates Proteoglycan-4 Expression in TMJ,9323447,SC3GM105573,"['Accounting ', ' Affect ', ' Alternative RNA Splicing ', ' Alternate Splicing ', ' Alternative Splicing ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Life Sciences ', ' Bioscience ', ' Biologic Sciences ', ' Biological Sciences ', ' Biology ', ' Biomedical Research ', ' Parturition ', ' Birth ', ' Cartilaginous Tissue ', ' Cartilage ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cells ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Comorbidity ', ' Critiques ', ' Downregulation ', ' Down-Regulation ', ' Environment ', ' ELISA ', ' Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay ', ' Therapeutic Estradiol ', ' Progynon ', ' Ovocylin ', ' Ovocyclin ', ' Estraldine ', ' Estradiol-17beta ', ' Estradiol-17 beta ', ' Estrace ', ' Diogynets ', ' Diogyn ', ' Dimenformon ', ' Aquadiol ', ' Estradiol ', ' Therapeutic Estrogen ', ' Estrogens ', ' ECM ', ' Cell-Extracellular Matrix ', ' Extracellular Matrix ', ' Face Pain ', ' Facial Pain ', ' Female ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Gene Regulation Process ', ' Gene Regulation ', ' Gene Action Regulation ', ' Gene Expression Regulation ', ' Genes ', ' Goals ', ' Head ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' In Vitro ', ' Joints ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lubrication ', ' Maintenance ', ' male ', ' Mandibular Condyle ', ' Mentors ', ' Mutation ', ' genome mutation ', ' Genetic defect ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Papio ', ' Savanna Baboons ', ' Papios ', ' Baboons ', ' Pathology ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Play ', ' Promoter Regions ', ' genetic promoter element ', ' Promotor Regions ', ' Proteins ', ' Proteoglycan ', ' Publishing ', ' Research ', ' Messenger RNA ', ' mRNA ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Gonadal Steroid Hormones ', ' sex steroid ', ' gonadal steroids ', ' Sex Steroid Hormones ', ' Sex Hormones ', ' Employee Strikes ', ' Strikes ', ' Synovial Membrane ', ' Synovium ', ' Membrana Synovialis Capsulae Articularis ', ' Temporal bone structure ', ' Temporal Bone ', ' Temporomandibular Joint ', ' TMJ ', ' Mandibular joint ', ' Jaw Joint ', ' Temporomandibular Joint Disorders ', ' Temporomandibular joint disorder ', ' Temporomandibular Joint Diseases ', ' Temporomandibular Disorders ', ' Temporo-mandibular joint disorder ', ' TMJD ', ' TMJ Disorders ', ' TMJ Diseases ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' Translating ', ' Gender ', ' Mediating ', ' promotor ', ' promoter ', ' Conditioned Medium ', ' Conditioned Culture Media ', ' Friction ', ' base ', ' Reporter Genes ', ' Synovial Cell ', ' cartilage cell ', ' Failure ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Attenuated ', ' Structure of articular disc of temporomandibular joint ', ' Temporomandibular Joint Disk ', ' Temporomandibular Articular Disk ', ' TMJ Disc ', ' Knowledge ', ' Event ', ' In Situ ', ' System ', ' American ', ' molecular pathology ', ' Protein Isoforms ', ' Isoforms ', ' receptor ', ' Receptor Protein ', ' sexual dimorphism ', ' sex dimorphism ', ' knowledge base ', ' knowledgebase ', ' attenuation ', ' Response Elements ', ' Pathogenesis ', ' Reporting ', ' Regulation ', ' monolayer ', "" 5' Flanking Region "", "" 5' Flanking Sequence "", ' Binding ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' Glenoid structure ', ' Glenoid Fossa ', ' chromatin immunoprecipitation ', ' ChIP assay ', ' Data ', ' Molecular ', ' sex ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' joint function ', ' women of childbearing age ', ' women of child bearing age ', ' Female of childbearing age ', ' Female of child bearing age ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' public health relevance ', ' effective therapy ', ' effective treatment ', ' Dislocations ', ' Underrepresented Students ', ' under-represented student ', ' training opportunity ', ' gender disparity ', ' Articulation ', ' ']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS SAN ANTONIO,SC3,2017,110250,0.1214267583467226

"Combinatorial Actions of Genetic Variants and Gender Bias of Alzheimer's Disease Contact PD/PI: ROSENFELD, MICHAEL G PROJECT ABSTRACT Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is conventionally characterized by specific neuropathological features, including the appearance of extracellular amyloid deposits and the accumulation of intracellular neurofibrillary tangles. While several gene mutations are clearly associated with early onset Alzheimer’s disease, the large number of individuals exhibiting delayed onset, aging-associated AD, are likely to harbor many alterations in linked modifier genes that predispose to AD susceptibility. Genetic and genome wide association studies (GWAS) have identified numerous genes and risk alleles that indicate both cell autonomous and non-cell autonomous mechanisms contributing to loss of neurons and cognitive decline. In this regard, the majority of risk variants identified by GWAS reside in non-coding regions of the genome, implying that they act in part to alter gene expression. This proposal responds to the RFA indicating a particular need for approaches designed to delineate the transcriptional and cellular consequences of combinations of SNPs in the risk alleles by generating new cell line reagents to help unravel the question of the causative SNPs and their target genes in specific neurons derived from iPS cells of AD individuals. There are two features of sporadic AD that require molecular explanation- the potential role of aging in AD susceptibility, and the striking gender disparity, with the incidence of AD being exaggerated in females. These issues can only now be addressed based on new technologies and the availability of patient-derived samples. Our proposed research plan takes advantage of the invaluable samples stored at the brain bank of the Shiley-Marcos Alzheimer's Disease Research Center (ADRC) at UCSD, and the iPSC-derived neurons (Salk). This approach will interrogate the effects of different genetic variants with other risk factors (e.g. age, sex), and assess their effects on cell type-specific enhancer landscapes. By merging these data, we can begin to identify the potential causative SNPs that result in altered function of cell-type specific enhancers. We propose using a high throughput 4C screening approach (UMI-4C), and Hi-ChIP, to identify the most likely causative, enhancer-associated SNPs for functionally-implicated coding target genes. Exploiting the power of contemporary gene editing approaches in control or patient-derived iPS cells to specific neuronal cell types, and to astroglia, we can assess the transcriptional phenotypes and functional behaviors of neurons harboring different combinations of risk alleles, both in the isolated cell lines alone and in combination with coculture experiments with astroglia and microglia, as effects of these SNPs may be manifest only with astroglial:neuronal interactions. Together these studies will use powerful contemporary global genomic approaches to determine the coding transcriptional targets of several of the most significant SNPs in enhancers, and the link to roles of estrogen receptor in the gender disparity for AD.

"Sequence analysis of hemotological traits in African Americans ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Circulating blood cell counts represent important intermediate phenotypes for a variety of cardiovascular, pulmonary, hematologic, and immunologic diseases. These traits differ by ethnicity and studying the genetics of these quantitative blood traits in African Americans (AAs) may reveal new biologic pathways that ultimately contribute to our understanding both of biology of blood cell production and of the relationship of blood counts with CVD and other chronic diseases that disproportionately impact AAs. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS), to date, performed mainly in European Americans, have implicated a number of genomic loci. Despite these successes, association signals for blood cell traits are often associated with uncertain effects on gene function or regulation, and therefore not readily translatable to clinical practice or treatment. Several recen advancements hold promise for translating genetic association findings for blood cell traits into mechanism-based therapeutic approaches for clinical disease. First, genome-wide mapping of blood cell type- and lineage-specific promoter and enhancer elements, transcription factor binding patterns and epigenetic profiling now provide a detailed picture of the cis- and trans- regulatory landscape during hematopoiesis. Second, experimental approaches utilizing genome engineering (RNA- guided CRISPR-Cas9) can characterize critical regulatory elements and functional variants of modest effect that are essential for stage-specific, lineage-restricted effects on gene expression. This proposal will utilize the wealth of newly available genetic data in multiple large AA cohorts, including exome array data on ~11,400 participants from the REasons for Geographical And Regional Differences in Stroke (REGARDS), the Jackson Heart (JHS) and Women's Health Initiative (WHI) studies and high-coverage whole genome sequence (WGS) data available on ~3,500 JHS participants through a recent NHLBI-funded WGS initiative to discover and functionally characterize novel genetic associations. These data will be combined with existing GWAS and exome array data on thousands of additional AAs with measured blood cell traits to form the largest and most comprehensive genetic study of blood cell traits ever conducted in AAs. Our study will use novel and established analytic and experimental approaches, consistent with the goals and directives of this initiative, to identify important genetic variants affecting these important blood-based biomarkers. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading killer of African Americans. The proposed work will identify novel genetic risk factors for various blood cell measures that influence CVD risk in African Americans and other populations.

"Implementation of a Sickle Cell Enhanced Novel Care Network in South Carolina (iSCENSC) ABSTRACT Sickle cell disease (SCD) is recognized as a significant health disparity in the United States due to the number of patients affected, the paucity of available providers, disease stigmatization, and a lack of treatment options for affected individuals (4). In certain regions of the US, these issues are further worsened by a large percentage of affected patients living in rural regions with limited access to care, lower socioeconomic status, and fewer funding options (5, 6). South Carolina (SC) is a prime example of state that is tremendously under-resourced to treat individuals living with SCD. State-level engagement of pediatric hematologists, managed care organizations, patients, and community foundations resulted in formation of the South Carolina-Sickle Cell (SC2) statewide network designed to increase access to evidence-based care for all individuals living with SCD and to improve their clinical outcomes through access to a SCD medical home (Spoke) connected to a regional specialty care center (Hub). This approach harnesses the state’s resources to improve care for individuals with SCD, utilize the strengths of partnering hospital systems, and use a technology based approach to extend care to rural areas. This project, iSCENSC (Implementation of a Sickle Cell Enhanced Novel Care Network in South Carolina) is designed to evaluate intervention effectiveness for achieving full implementation of the SC2 network and to determine if the hub and spokes model of care increases access to quality care for individuals with SCD and produces findings sufficient to identify replicable methods for optimal care enrichment especially in rural populations. Specific Aims are: 1. Perform a systematic needs assessment in three target regions currently involved in SC2 (Midlands, Pee Dee and Lowcountry) to assess the gap between current and SCD best practices for adolescent and adult SCD patients and to identify care delivery issues associated with disease-specific care primary care, acute care management, and care coordination. 2: Engage all relevant stakeholders (patients/caregivers, providers, SC2 partners) to begin building capacity for the conduct and assessment of targeted interventions to increase implementation readiness within three SC regions and partnering health systems and to further inform Phase II implementation strategies. 3: Initiate comparative effectiveness study using an interrupted time series, multi-sector, multi-modal design including specific implementation intervention strategies. iSCENSC will be the first multilevel, multicenter implementation science study in adolescents and adults with SCD aiming to achieve the outcome of a statewide SCD network. We propose the first large study of barriers inhibiting adoption and use of NHLBI SCD Guideline and of effectiveness of dissemination and implementation strategies in closing existing guideline-to-practice gaps and reducing longstanding disparities in SCD treatment, policy, and funding support of SCD care delivery. PROJECT NARRATIVE Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a significant health disparity in the United States because a lot of individuals are affected by it, there are few healthcare providers to offer people adequate services to people with SCD, and treatment options are limited, especially for children with SCD as they move into adulthood. The goal of iSCENSC is to find out how we can best make changes in healthcare systems, our communities, and in our policies in support of SC2 (Sickle Cell-South Carolina) a statewide network in South Carolina (SC) designed to have more people receive care that works for SCD throughout their lifetime and to decrease their chances of being sick or dying too early as a result of having SCD. This project will evaluate educational, training, telemedicine, and enhanced treatment options to improve the system of care for people living with SCD in South Carolina.",Implementation of a Sickle Cell Enhanced Novel Care Network in South Carolina (iSCENSC),9509490,U01HL133990,"['Academy ', ' Adoption ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Affect ', ' Sickle Cell Anemia ', ' sicklemia ', ' sickle disease ', ' sickle cell disease ', ' Hemoglobin sickle cell disorder ', ' Hemoglobin sickle cell disease ', ' Hemoglobin S Disease ', ' HbSS disease ', ' Hb SS disease ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' Consultations ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Foundations ', ' Genotype ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Health Personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health workforce ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' treatment access ', ' health services availability ', ' health service access ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' accessibility to health services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Access to Care ', ' Hospitals ', ' Institutes ', ' Interview ', ' Long-Term Care ', ' longterm care ', ' extended care ', ' Methods ', ' Patients ', ' Periodicity ', ' Rhythmicity ', ' Cyclicity ', ' Population Characteristics ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Primary Care ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Rural Population ', ' South Carolina ', ' medical specialties ', ' Specialty ', ' Stigmatization ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Technology ', ' Telephone ', ' Phone ', ' Time ', ' Transportation ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Caregivers ', ' Care Givers ', ' symposium ', ' symposia ', ' summit ', ' convention ', ' conference ', ' Managed Care ', ' Third-Party Payer ', ' Caring ', ' Custom ', ' Telemedicine ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' rural area ', ' improved ', ' Acute ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Medical ', ' Series ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Adolescent ', ' Ensure ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' sickle red blood cell ', ' sickle erythrocyte ', ' sickle RBC ', ' drepanocyte ', ' Sickle Cell ', ' Individual ', ' healthcare utilization ', ' healthcare service utilization ', ' healthcare service use ', ' health care service use ', ' Health Care Utilization ', ' health care service utilization ', ' Rural ', ' Policies ', ' Funding ', ' Collaborations ', ' Vitelliform macular dystrophy ', ' best macular dystrophy ', ' Vitelliform MD ', "" Best's Disease "", ' Best Disease ', ' programs ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' Location ', ' meetings ', ' Services ', ' Needs Assessment ', ' care delivery ', ' novel ', ' member ', ' Modality ', ' Code ', ' Coding System ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Quality of Care ', ' QOC ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' disease registry ', ' Provider ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Institution ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Readiness ', ' Preparedness ', ' low socioeconomic status ', ' low socioeconomic position ', ' low socio-economic status ', ' low socio-economic position ', ' low SES ', ' Health system ', ' Evidence based practice ', ' Data ', ' Effectiveness of Interventions ', ' Improve Access ', ' Interruption ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Update ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' informant ', ' NHLBI ', ' National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute ', ' website ', ' web site ', ' care services ', ' care systems ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' administrative data base ', ' administrative database ', ' Clinical and Translational Science Awards ', ' comparative effectiveness ', ' demographics ', ' implementation science ', ' community based practice ', ' evidence base ', ' patient population ', ' standard of care ', ' IRBs ', ' IRB ', ' Institutional Review Boards ', ' Pediatric Hematologist ', ' Assessment instrument ', ' Assessment tool ', ' obstacle to healthcare ', ' obstacle to care ', ' barrier to treatment ', ' barrier to healthcare ', ' barrier to health care ', ' barrier to care ', ' coordinating care ', ' care coordination ', ' implementation strategy ', ' ']",NHLBI,MEDICAL UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA,U01,2018,754811,0.05605640321488857
"Immunotherapeutic Modalities for K-ras Mutant Lung Cancer: Sex- and Cell Type-Specific Roles of IL-6/STAT3 signaling Worldwide, lung cancer, particularly K-ras mutant lung cancer, is still the leading cause of cancer mortality because of a high incidence, and a low cure rate. Unfortunately, pharmacologic attempts directly targeting K- ras have thus far failed, clearly indicating that there is an urgent need for novel approaches to bring clinical benefits to patients with this undruggable molecular profile. We recently made an astonishing sex-specific discovery using a mouse model for K-ras-driven lung cancer (CC-LR). We found that deletion of STAT3 in K- ras mutant lung epithelial cells significantly inhibited lung cancer development in female mice but, surprisingly, caused a dramatic enhancement of lung tumorigenesis in male mice. This sex-dependent tumor disparity was accompanied by significant changes of NF-κB regulated target genes and inflammatory response in the lung tumor microenvironment which was regulated by estrogen receptor (ER) signaling. In humans, the risk and outcome of lung cancer are also vastly distinct between men and women, especially for smokers. However, the reason for this sex disparity is poorly understood and extremely underappreciated. It is known that estrogen could have anti-inflammatory effects. However, the interplay between estrogen/ER signaling, and STAT3/NF- κB mediated cytokine network in shaping the lung microenvironment and promotion of lung cancer is unknown. Our novel finding that the crosstalk between STAT3 and ER signaling is an essential regulator of NF-κB mediated cytokine response in K-ras mutant lung tumors provides us with a direct molecular insight into these sex differences. It will facilitate identification of the signaling pathways that lung cancer cells use to recruit and reprogram myeloid cells, thus providing new pathways to intercept for preventive and therapeutic purposes. Accordingly, our goals for this project are to determine the sex and cell type specific mechanistic roles of specific inflammatory signaling cues and functional preventive and therapeutic significance of targeting these inflammatory pathways in the pathogenesis of K-ras mutant lung cancer. Three specific aims are proposed to achieve these goals: (Aim 1) To dissect the sex-specific interplay between STAT3/NF-κB mediated cytokine network and estrogen receptor signaling in K-ras mutant lung tumorigenesis. (Aim 2) To investigate the chemopreventive and therapeutic effects of targeting the IL-6/STAT3 pathway in K-ras mutant lung cancer. (Aim 3) To analyze sex- and cell type-specific global expression programs downstream of mutant K-ras in lung cancer. We expect our study will elucidate sex- and cell-type specific mechanisms that will be fundamental in delineating targets for tailoring rationally directed sex-oriented personalized preventive and therapeutic strategies to overcome K-ras mutant lung tumors. It could also help us to improve the efficacy of currently available immunotherapy regimens, to develop a panel of unique and sex specific clinical predictive and prognostic biomarkers to identify responders and non-responders, and to explore mechanisms of susceptibility or resistance to therapy in these patients. This project will focus on dissecting the mechanisms responsible for lung cancer promotion by inflammatory signals in a sex-dependent manner. Unfortunately, despite being the leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide, our knowledge of the molecular mechanisms involved in lung cancer, especially in regards to sex differences and in the context of inflammation, is substantially deficient. By understanding the sex and cell-type specific molecular pathways through which inflammation promotes lung cancer, we aim to identify new and specific targets to tailor personalized preventive and

"Genetic Studies of Blood Cell Traits in Multi-Ethnic Cohorts ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Blood cell traits, including hemoglobin level, red blood cell (RBC), white blood cell (WBC), and platelet counts, are important intermediate clinical phenotypes for a variety of cardiovascular, hematologic, oncologic, immunologic and infectious disease. The distributions of these traits differ considerably across ethnicities. For example, further insight into the genetic determinants of ""ethnic neutropenia"" in African Americans (AA) may have implications for health disparities in risk of HIV infection, sickle cell disease severity or mobilization of neutrophils or hematopoietic stem cells in cancer patients. Our preliminary data similarly suggest important differences in the distribution of blood cell traits in Hispanics compared to non-Hispanic whites. Therefore, the proposed studies are likely to have direct clinical impact by providing new avenues for treatment, particularly for minority patients with low blood counts (Personalized Medicine), and illuminating new mechanisms by which genetic factors related to ethnic differences in blood cell counts contribute to U.S. health disparities fo risk of chronic inflammatory and thrombotic diseases.  Despite the importance of genetic factors in explaining variation in blood cell traits, there remains a huge gap in our knowledge of the contribution of specific loci to these traits among U.S. minorities. Coincidentally, multiethnic GWAS has been recognized as more powerful for gene mapping by the genetics community. However, there are very few sequencing-aided GWAS for blood cell traits in ancestrally diverse populations, and none in Hispanics/Latinos (HLs). Consequently, innovative methods are needed to study blood cell traits in multiethnic cohorts, particularly those recently admixed such as AA and HL, which have been under- represented in prior GWAS. The first attempts to map genes for blood cell traits in AA did not incorporate sequence based African specific content into the imputation, were limited in sample size, and did not accounted for local ancestry, mainly due to the lack of available methods and resources. Importantly, no GWAS have been conducted in HL for blood cell traits. For the proposed studies, our team has now assembled a new, larger collection of AA (n~34K), HL (n~26K) and Europeans (EU) (n~30K), and will leverage our recent methodological advances in imputation, local ancestry inference, and association analysis to increase our knowledge of blood cell trait genetics.  We propose the following Aims. Aim 1. Map genes for blood cell traits in AA (n~34K) accounting for local ancestry. Aim 2. Conduct the first sequencing-aided GWAS of blood cell traits in HL (n~26K) accounting for 3- way local ancestry. Aim 3. Meta-analyze across multi-ethnic datasets, annotate and validate novel association signals. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Blood cell traits, including red blood cell count (RBC), hemoglobin, white blood cell count (WBC) and platelet count, are important intermediate clinical phenotypes for a variety of cardiovascular, hematologic, oncogenic, immunologic and infectious diseases. However, there are very few sequencing-aided GWASs for blood cell traits in ancestrally diverse populations, and none in Hispanics/Latinos. We will study genetic mechanisms underlying blood cell traits in multi-ethnic cohorts, in particular admixed, under-represented U.S. minority populations such as African Americans and

"MyD88-dependent mechanisms of Helicobacter pylori-induced gastric cancer progression Abstract Gastric cancer ranks high among the leading causes of cancer-related deaths worldwide, with 989,600 new cases and 738,000 deaths each year. The majority of human stomach tumors are associated with chronic infection with the bacterial pathogen Helicobacter pylori. It is therefore critical to understand mechanisms that regulate and facilitate malignant progression to efficiently identify potential targets for preventative therapies. In the USA, death rates from gastric cancer follow ethnic divisions with the highest mortality rates among African Americans, followed by Asian/Pacific Islanders, Native Americans, Hispanics, and Caucasians. The cause of this disparity is unknown. There is now considerable amount of confirmatory evidence that the host response to H. pylori is crucial in determining susceptibility to gastric cancer. Furthermore, it is well established that inappropriate activation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling has an important function in gastric cancer development. The central objective of our proposed project is to identify accelerating factors by investigating the interaction of MyD88 signaling and a known gastric oncogenic pathway, Wnt/β-catenin and to elucidate the biological significance of these interactions in cancer progression. We recently showed using a Helicobacter-induced mouse model of gastric cancer that a key immune signal transduction adaptor protein, myeloid differentiation primary response gene 88 (MyD88), regulates Helicobacter-induced gastric cancer progression. However, the mediators of this cancer progression are unknown. We hypothesize that MyD88 deficiency leads to increased Wnt/β-catenin signaling in response to Helicobacter infection, which promotes gastric cancer development. It is known that Wnt/β-catenin signaling regulates gastrointestinal epithelial cell proliferation. However, the extent to which interactions between MyD88 and Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathways impact H. pylori-associated gastric carcinogenesis is unknown and has not been investigated. Our overall hypothesis is that the dramatic -/- acceleration in progression to gastric cancer found in Myd88 mice is due to interactions with oncogenic pathways, such as Wnt/β-catenin. Herein using a novel ex vivo gastric organoid culture system and a well- established Helicobacter-induced model of gastric cancer we will pursue the following specific aims: Specific aim 1: Investigate the effect of MyD88 on Wnt/β-catenin activity in H. pylori-induced epithelial cell proliferation using a gastric organoid culture system; Specific aim 2: Examine the function of Wnt/β- catenin signaling during acute inflammatory response and chronic inflammation in the absence and presence of MyD88 in a gastric cancer mouse model. First, this work first seeks to show that deficiency in MyD88 results in increased Wnt/β-catenin signaling. Second, this work will inform for the first time on the crosstalk between the MyD88 and Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathways and its significance in initiation and progression of gastric cancer. Project Narrative Gastric cancer, which is caused by H. pylori infection is one of the most common and lethal type of cancer. However, the mechanisms underlying disease progression are still unclear. We will investigate the interaction between innate immune response and an oncogenic pathway to identify factors that promote gastric cancer.",MyD88-dependent mechanisms of Helicobacter pylori-induced gastric cancer progression,9445421,R21CA210227,"['Acceleration ', ' Bacteria ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Carcinogens ', ' oncogenic agent ', ' Oncogens ', ' Cancer Causing Agents ', ' Cell Survival ', ' Cell Viability ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Epithelial Cells ', ' Exhibits ', ' Future ', ' Genes ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Infection ', ' Inflammation ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' malignant stomach neoplasm ', ' stomach pylorus cancer ', ' stomach fundus cancer ', ' malignant stomach tumor ', ' Stomach Cancer ', ' Malignant Gastric Tumor ', ' Malignant Gastric Neoplasm ', ' Gastric Pylorus Cancer ', ' Gastric Fundus Cancer ', ' Gastric Cardia Cancer ', ' Gastric Cancer ', ' Gastric Body Cancer ', ' mortality ', ' Mus ', ' Murine ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Mice ', ' Organoids ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Signal Pathway ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Stomach ', ' gastric ', ' Stomach Neoplasms ', ' Stomach Tumor ', ' Gastric Tumor ', ' Gastric Neoplasms ', ' Time ', ' Caucasians ', ' white race ', ' Occidental ', ' Caucasoid Race ', ' Caucasoid ', ' Caucasian Race ', ' Caucasian ', ' Work ', ' Asians ', ' oriental ', ' c-myc Genes ', ' v-myc Avian Myelocytomatosis Viral Oncogene Cellular Homolog ', ' cmyc ', ' c myc ', ' Helicobacter Infections ', ' Helicobacter Pylori Infection ', ' H.pylori infection ', ' H. pylori infection ', ' H pylori infection ', ' Helicobacter pylori ', ' H.pylori ', ' H. pylory ', ' H. pylori ', ' H pylory ', ' H pylori ', ' Campylobacter pylori ', ' C. pylori ', ' C pylori ', ' Measures ', ' NF-kappa B ', ' nuclear factor kappa beta ', ' kappa B Enhancer Binding Protein ', ' Transcription Factor NF-kB ', ' Nuclear Transcription Factor NF-kB ', ' Nuclear Factor kappa B ', ' NFKB ', ' NF-kappaB ', ' NF-kB ', ' Immunoglobulin Enhancer-Binding Protein ', ' Helicobacter ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Hispanics ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' beta catenin ', ' β-catenin ', ' PRO2286 ', ' CUL-2 ', ' Beta-1 Catenin ', ' Beta Cadherin-Associated Protein ', ' cyclin D ', ' c-bcl-1 Proteins ', ' bcl1 Proto-Oncogene Proteins ', ' bcl-1 Proto-Oncogene Proteins ', ' bcl-1 Proto-Oncogene Products ', ' Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-1 ', ' PRAD1 Protein ', ' G1/S-Specific Cyclin D1 ', ' CCND1 Protein ', ' Cyclin D1 ', ' neoplastic progression ', ' neoplasm progression ', ' cancer progression ', ' tumor progression ', ' Label ', ' Acute ', ' Chronic ', ' Malignant ', ' Malignant -

"The DARC side of Breast Cancer Project Summary TNBC is arguably the most deadly BrCa subtype with higher prevalence in pre-menopausal women and in women of African descent. We know that the combined TNBC prevalence and poor treatment options are a likely cause of persistently higher mortality rates in African Americans compared to European Americans in the US. However, we have shown that within African Americans, disparities in BrCa survival are more pronounced within the TNBC category compared to the ER positive groups. These data indicate that unique mechanisms are operating in either tumor biology or host response in women of African descent. The ancient and African- specific Fy- allele alters the regulation of DARC/ACKR1, an atypical chemokine receptor, in a tissue-specific fashion beyond the previously described RBC phenotype. This implicates DARC/ACKR1 in various altered phenotypes in these ancestry groups, specifically as it relates to chemokine regulation. This project will test the hypothesis that DARC expression in tumor cells alters tissue chemokine levels to modify the host immune response to tumorigenesis, and that absence of DARC expression on blood cells as a result of the African-specific Fy- allele alters circulating chemokine levels, altering the tumor microenvironment and enhancing tumor aggression. Specifically we will; 1- Determine if DARC tumor expression associates with ancestry and altered host immune responses in a pilot BrCa cohort of African Americans and European Americans and 2- Determine if loss of DARC on bone-marrow-derived (bmd) blood cells alters chemokine profiles and tumor immune response, using pre-existing transgenic C3- 1Tag BrCa and AckR1-/- mice.

"Targeting CRLF2 and Ikaros Alterations to Reduce Health Disparities in Childhood Leukemia SUMMARY  Hispanic children are more likely to develop acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL), and when this occurs they are 39% more likely to die than non-Hispanic Whites. This disparity is due, in part, to a subtype of B-cell precursor ALL (B-ALL) that occurs five times more frequently among Hispanic children than others and has a high relapse rate. This type of leukemia, called CRLF2 B-ALL, is characterized by two genetic alterations: a) overexpression of the cytokine receptor, CRLF2, and b) deletion or inactivation of one allele of the Ikaros (IKZF1) tumor suppressor which is strongly associated with relapse. Our overall hypothesis is that combination therapy that selectively targets the pathways that are deregulated in CRLF2 B-ALL (CRLF2 and Ikaros) will produce a superior therapeutic effect and decrease mortality to reduce the health disparity in survival for Hispanic children with ALL. When the CRLF2 receptor is activated by its ligand, TSLP, downstream pathways (JAK/STAT and PI3/AKT/mTOR) that promote leukemia cell survival, proliferation, and chemoresistance are induced through processes normally kept in check by the Ikaros tumor suppressor. Preliminary data from our team show that treatment with the CK2-specific inhibitor, CX-4945, restores Ikaros tumor suppressor function in high-risk B-ALL from Hispanic patients with deletion of one Ikaros allele, exerting a strong in vivo therapeutic effect. Preclinical studies of CRLF2 B-ALL typically use patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models, where primary leukemia cells from patients with CRLF2 B-ALL are injected into immune deficient mice. Our preliminary data show that mouse TSLP does not activate human CRLF2, making the current PDX models suboptimal for studies of CRLF2 B-ALL. To overcome this obstacle our team engineered immune deficient mice that provide normal human serum levels of human TSLP (+T mice) and generated PDX by injecting these mice with CRLF2 B-ALL cells from Hispanic pediatric patients (+T PDX). Analysis of +T PDX shows CRLF2 activation and gene expression that is more similar to original patient sample than standard PDX. Our preliminary data provide a rationale for novel therapy that targets pathways that are induced by CRLF2 (JAK-STAT5 and PI3K/AKT/mTOR) and by loss of Ikaros tumor suppressor activity using our newly- developed preclinical model for Hispanic CRLF2 B-ALL. To test our hypothesis we will: Aim 1: Establish the in vivo therapeutic efficacy of targeting CRLF2 downstream pathways and their role in CRLF2 B-ALL in Hispanic pediatric patients. Aim 2: Evaluate the in vivo efficacy and mechanisms of combination therapy that restores Ikaros tumor suppressor activity and inhibits the mTOR pathway in Hispanic pediatric CRLF2 B-ALL. The proposed studies use precision medicine approaches (targeting specific pathways and/or functional defects) in context of the health disparity background to develop a novel treatment for CRLF2 B-ALL and reduce childhood cancer health disparities. NARRATIVE   Hispanic children are more likely to develop acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) and when they do they have a 39% higher death rate than non-Hispanic Whites. A contributor to this disparity is a sub-type of high-risk ALL that occurs five times more frequently in Hispanic/Latino children than others. The proposed studies use precision medicine approaches to target the specific genetic alterations responsible for this high-risk sub-type of ALL in a novel in vivo preclinical model that allows therapies to be evaluated in context of the health disparity genetic background.",Targeting CRLF2 and Ikaros Alterations to Reduce Health Disparities in Childhood Leukemia,9513485,R01CA209829,"['Bursa-Dependent Lymphocytes ', ' B-cell ', ' B-Cells ', ' B cells ', ' B cell ', ' B blood cells ', ' Cell Cycle ', ' Cell Division Cycle ', ' Cell Survival ', ' Cell Viability ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Combined Modality Therapy ', ' multimodality therapy ', ' combined treatment ', ' combined modality treatment ', ' combination therapy ', ' Multimodality Treatment ', ' Multimodal Treatment ', ' Multimodal Therapy ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Pharmacotherapy ', ' drug treatment ', ' Drug Therapy ', ' Engineering ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Genes ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' leukemia ', ' B-Cell Acute Leukemia ', ' Precursor B Lymphoblastic Leukemia ', ' Leukemia, Lymphoblastic, Burkitt-Type ', ' L3 Lymphocytic Leukemia ', ' L3 Acute Lymphoid Leukemia ', ' L3 Acute Lymphogenous Leukemia ', ' L3 Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia ', ' L3 Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia ', ' FAB L3 ', "" Burkitt's Cell Leukemia "", ' Burkitt Leukemia ', ' B-Cell Type Acute Leukemia ', ' B-Cell Precursor Type Acute Leukemia ', ' B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia ', ' B-Cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia ', ' B-Cell  Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia ', ' B-ALL ', ' Acute B-Lymphocytic Leukemia ', ' Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia ', ' acute lymphomatic leukemia ', ' acute lymphogenous leukemia ', ' acute lymphatic leukemia ', ' Precursor Lymphoblastic Leukemia ', ' Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia ', ' Acute Lymphoid Leukemia ', ' Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia ', ' ALL -

"Multi-Tensor Decompositions for Personalized Cancer Diagnostics and Prognostics ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Recurring DNA copy-number alterations (CNAs) have been recognized as a hallmark of cancer for >100 years, yet what these alterations imply about a tumor's pathogenesis and a patient's diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment remains poorly understood. This is despite the growing number of large-scale multidimensional datasets recording different aspects of a single disease, e.g., in the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), and due to a fundamental need for mathematical frameworks that can create one coherent model from such multiple datasets arranged in multiple tensors of matched columns, e.g., patients, platforms, and tissues, but independent rows, e.g., probes.  For example, our recent comparative modeling (by using a data-driven two-matrix spectral decomposition) of patient-matched glioblastoma (GBM) brain tumor and normal blood genomic profiles from TCGA (arranged in two matrices, of matched columns but independent rows) uncovered a previously unknown global pattern of tumor-exclusive CNAs that is correlated with, and possibly causally related to, GBM survival and response to chemotherapy. The data had been publicly available since 2008, but this signature remained unknown until we applied our comparative modeling in 2012. Survival analyses showed, and computationally validated, that the signature performs better than, and is statistically independent of, age, the best indicator of GBM survival for >50 years, and existing GBM pathology laboratory tests. A new test for GBM based upon this signature is pending an experimental re-validation at the Associated Regional and University Pathologists (ARUP) Laboratories, Inc., a nonprofit reference laboratory of the Department of Pathology at the University of Utah.  In this NCI U01 project, our multidisciplinary team of researchers from the Departments of Bioengineering, Mathematics, and Pathology, the Scientific Computing and Imaging (SCI) Institute, and the Huntsman Cancer Institute (HCI) at the University of Utah, aims to (i) define, and study the properties of data- driven multi-tensor spectral decompositions; (ii) use these to model patient-, platform-, and tissue-matched but probe-independent TCGA genomic profiles, and gain biological and medical insights into the genotype- phenotype relations in lower-grade astrocytoma (LGA) brain cancer, ovarian serous cystadenocarcinoma (OV), and lung squamous cell carcinoma; and (iii) enable translation of these insights into pathology laboratory tests, by experimentally testing the computational predictions of the existing GBM model, as well as the novel LGA and OV models by using Utah samples.  Ultimately, this project will bring physicians a step closer to one day being able to predict and control the progression of cell division and cancer as readily as NASA engineers plot the trajectories of spacecraft today.

"Asymmetric Lymphocyte Division in the Immune Response DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): B lymphocytes and the antibodies they produce play a critical role in host defense. Cell fate diversification of activated lymphocytes is essential to achieve the regenerative state required for long-lived immunity. The mechanisms responsible for generating B cell fate diversity, however, are poorly understood. Substantial preliminary data suggest B cells can diversify the fates and functions of their daughter cells using an evolutionarily conserved strategy to allocate unequal amounts of key components. This project will test whether asymmetric cell division is a cardinal feature of the B cell- mediated immune response. The proposal develops novel methodologies to image the characteristics of dividing B cells during the course of an immune response. The aims of the project are to test the importance of unequal cellular inheritance of three different transcriptional regulators of B cells Bcl-6, Pax5, and T-bet, each of which is known to regulate critical cell fate decisions. The experiments will test the hypotheses that asymmetric division is iteratively used to meet the opposing demands of terminal differentiation and self-renewal, as well to refine and diversify the functional properties of antibodies by regulating germinal center entry and class switch choice. This project will also examine whether ancestral regulators of cell polarity are responsible for establishing asymmetric B cell division, and how asymmetrically inherited proteins could mediate fate disparity in daughter B cells. These studies should provide a framework for rational engineering of immune responses and vaccines against microbial agents. This project should also address fundamental uncertainties regarding the principle of clonal selection of lymphocytes in response to infectious diseases or during situations when our immune cells attack our own selves. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: B lymphocytes are specialized white blood cells that protect us against infection. These cells need to be able to replenish themselves for vaccines to work properly. This project will provide important information about how these cells provide long-term immunity after we are vaccinated.",Asymmetric Lymphocyte Division in the Immune Response,9413482,R01AI076458,"['Antibodies ', ' Autoimmunity ', ' Autoimmune Status ', ' B-Lymphocytes ', ' Bursa-Equivalent Lymphocyte ', ' Bursa-Dependent Lymphocytes ', ' B-cell ', ' B-Cells ', ' B cells ', ' B cell ', ' B blood cells ', ' Behavior ', ' Cell division ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Communicable Diseases ', ' Infectious Disorder ', ' Infectious Diseases ', ' Infectious Disease Pathway ', ' Daughter ', ' Engineering ', ' Equilibrium ', ' balance function ', ' balance ', ' Exhibits ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Immunoglobulin M ', ' IgM ', ' 19S Gamma Globulin ', ' Immunity ', ' Immunization ', ' Immunostimulation ', ' Immunological Stimulation ', ' Immunological Sensitization ', ' Immunologic Stimulation ', ' Immunologic Sensitization ', ' Immunoglobulins ', ' Immune Globulins ', ' Infection ', ' Leukocytes ', ' white blood corpuscle ', ' white blood cell ', ' White Cell ', ' White Blood Cells ', ' Marrow leukocyte ', ' Leukocytes Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Blood leukocyte ', ' Lymphocyte ', ' lymph cell ', ' Lymphocytic ', ' Maintenance ', ' Memory ', ' Methodology ', ' Mutant Strains Mice ', ' mouse mutant ', ' Mus ', ' Murine ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Mice ', ' Plasma Cells ', ' plasmocyte ', ' Plasmacytes ', ' Blood Plasma Cell ', ' Play ', ' Proteins ', ' Reagent ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Siblings ', ' Testing ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' Vaccines ', ' Work ', ' Cell Polarity ', ' cellular polarity ', ' Mediating ', ' Uncertainty ', ' doubt ', ' Fusion Protein ', ' Chimera Protein ', ' Chimeric Proteins ', ' Biological ', ' Isotype Switchings ', ' Isotype Switching ', ' Immunoglobulin Class Switchings ', ' Class Switchings ', ' Class Switching ', ' Immunoglobulin Class Switching ', ' Plasmablast ', ' Inequality ', ' Germinal Center ', ' Structure of germinal center of lymph node ', ' Immune response ', ' immunoresponse ', ' host response ', ' Immunological response ', ' Reporter ', ' Sister ', ' Adopted ', ' Inherited ', ' Hereditary ', ' Immune ', ' Immunes ', ' Reaction ', ' 3-Dimensional ', ' 3-D ', ' Host Defense ', ' microbial ', ' novel ', ' Memory B-Lymphocyte ', ' Memory B Cell ', ' atypical protein kinase C ', ' Property ', ' response ', ' T-bet protein ', ' T-bet transcription factor ', ' cell mediated immune response ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Resolution ', ' Retrieval ', ' in vitro Model ', ' in vivo ', ' Activated Lymphocyte ', ' Clonal Expansion ', ' Vaccinated ', ' Characteristics ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' cell imaging ', ' cellular imaging ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' plasma cell differentiation ', ' daughter cell ', ' self-renew ', ' self-renewal ', ' public health relevance ', ' regenerative ', ' four-dimensional imaging ', ' 4-D imaging ', ' 4D Imaging ', ' imaging in vivo ', ' in vivo imaging ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' experimental study ', ' stem-like cell ', ' ']",NIAID,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2018,400000,0.2243177958158113
"Developmental Exposures, Stem Cell Reprogramming, and Breast Cancer Disparties ABSTRACT The overall goal of this project is to define how interactions between breast stem cells and environmental stressors drive the biological basis of racial disparities in triple negative breast cancers (TNBCs). TNBC incidence in African American women is two to three-fold higher than in European Americans. The biological mechanisms underlying this striking disparity are not well understood. Our preliminary data identifies widespread racial disparities in exposure to a multitude of environmental toxicants including phthalates and parabens. The breast cancer windows of susceptibility hypothesis states that environmental exposures in utero, or during puberty and pregnancy, disproportionately increase breast cancer risk. Exposures during windows of susceptibility could modify risk by the increasing the number of stem cells, altering stem cell epigenetic reprogramming, or by otherwise changing stem cell biology. Using single cell RNA expression profiling, we have identified a rare breast stem cell population with hybrid epithelial/mesenchymal characteristics and an RNA expression pattern resembling TNBCs. What factors regulate these cells, including the influence of race/ethnicity or environmental exposures, are unknown. The objective of this proposal to dissect the role of stem cells and the environment in the biology of TNBC racial disparities. We will experimentally challenge normal human breast stem cells isolated from epidemiologically well characterized women ex vivo with prototypical toxicants and toxicants prioritized because of racial exposure disparities. Our central hypothesis is that differences in normal stem cell biology, attributable to either genetic or environmental factors (or a gene-environment interaction), underlie TNBC disparities. We will test this hypothesis with three Specific Aims: (1) Test for differences in normal breast stem cell biology in African American and European American women by single cell RNA sequencing, three-dimensional ex vivo culture, and epigenomic profiling. (2) Define the disparities in exposure to environmental toxicants between African American and European American women in a nationally representative dataset. (3) Test for differential effects of environmental toxicants on African American and European American breast stem cells. This interdisciplinary study will use state-of-the-art techniques which integrate basic breast stem cell biology with exposure assessment, environmental epidemiology, and toxicology. We expect that the findings from this study will provide significant impact for reduction of TNBC incidence and mortality by defining the factors that cause TNBC disparities, providing actionable targets for precision breast cancer prevention. PROJECT NARRATIVE African American women are two to three times more likely than European American women to get the most aggressive subtype of breast cancer, but the reasons for this disparity are not well understood. This project investigates how breast stem cells behave differently in African American and European American women when exposed to environmental chemicals.

"Implementation of Medical Homes for Evidence Based Care of Adolescents and Adults with Sickle Cell Disease PROJECT SUMMARY Life expectancy for patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) has increased from teens to late forties over the last 30 years. The increase in the number of adults with the disease has created new unmet needs, due to the heavy disease burden and organ damage which increase with age. This is confounded by the inability of the health care system to adequately meet the needs of this population, and thus has resulted in disparities and increase in health care costs. This project attempts to address these problems by creating medical homes and medical neighborhoods in four different settings throughout rural Georgia, which has the fourth largest population of patients with SCD in the country. This will be achieved by building on the GRU Sickle Cell Center's experience in taking care of SCD patients through its outreach clinics, and more recently through its partnership with primary care practices and Hematology/Oncology practices at different locations in the state. In the first two years of the project (Phase I) a needs assessment of patients, communities, and providers will be carried out and a Community Advisory Council will be established. The results of this needs assessment will be used to develop and implement interventions to establish medical homes and neighborhoods to improve evidence-based care for SCD patients in Phase II. PROJECT NARRATIVE Advances in the diagnosis and care of infants and children with sickle cell disease (SCD) has led to an increase in life expectancy of this population and an increase in the number of adults with the disease. Chronic organ damage associated with the natural history of the disease on one hand, and challenges imposed by the health care system (large number of uninsured/underinsured patients, stigmatization, paucity of adult providers with expertise in the care of SCD) on the other, have created unmet needs. This project, in response to RFA HL- 16010, builds on the 30-year experience of the GRU Sickle Cell Center in providing care to patients with SCD in rural Georgia through its extensive outreach clinics and proposes to address these unmet needs by the creation of patient-centered medical homes and neighborhoods in four diverse health care settings.",Implementation of Medical Homes for Evidence Based Care of Adolescents and Adults with Sickle Cell Disease,9509519,U01HL134004,"['Caring ', ' Guidelines ', ' Practice Guidelines ', ' base ', ' Organ ', ' improved ', ' Acute Pain ', ' Site ', ' Acute ', ' Chronic ', ' Phase ', ' Medical ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Adolescent ', ' sickle red blood cell ', ' sickle erythrocyte ', ' sickle RBC ', ' drepanocyte ', ' Sickle Cell ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' Individual ', ' Rural ', ' Funding ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Oncology Cancer ', ' oncology ', ' Letters ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' prophylactic ', ' Location ', ' Country ', ' interest ', ' Needs Assessment ', ' Medical center ', ' experience ', ' cohort ', ' disease natural history ', ' Participant ', ' member ', ' Benefits and Risks ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' disease registry ', ' education planning ', ' patient registry ', ' Provider ', ' Address ', ' Adherence ', ' Consent ', ' Data ', ' Clinical Management ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' teenage ', ' teen years ', ' Teen ', ' Teenagers ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' NHLBI ', ' National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute ', ' years of life lost to disease ', ' years of life lost to disability ', ' disease burden ', ' burden of disease ', ' burden of illness ', ' implementation research ', ' underserved people ', ' under served population ', ' Underserved Population ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' patient centered ', ' patient oriented ', ' eligible participant ', ' implementation science ', ' clinical care ', ' evidence base ', ' FDA approved ', ' patient population ', ' effective treatment ', ' effective therapy ', ' Emergency room physician ', ' Emergency Physician ', ' ER physician ', ' ED Physician ', ' Emergency Department Physician ', ' recruit ', ' primary care provider ', ' care providers ', ' healthcare settings ', ' health care settings ', ' outreach clinics ', ' practice setting ', ' treatment guidelines ', ' implementation strategy ', ' Adoption ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Sickle Cell Anemia ', ' sicklemia ', ' sickle disease ', ' sickle cell disease ', ' Hemoglobin sickle cell disorder ', ' Hemoglobin sickle cell disease ', ' Hemoglobin S Disease ', ' HbSS disease ', ' Hb SS disease ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Communities ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Faculty ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Hematology ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' hydroxyurea ', ' hydroxy-urea ', ' Hydroxycarbamide ', ' Hydroxycarbamid ', ' Infant Care ', ' newborn care ', ' infant health care ', ' baby care ', ' Interview ', ' Life Expectancy ', ' Modernization ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Neonatal Screening ', ' newborn screening ', ' Newborn Infant Screening ', ' Pain ', ' Painful ', ' Patients ', ' Penicillins ', ' Penicillin Antibiotics ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Primary Care ', ' Registries ', ' Research ', ' Stigmatization ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Universities ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Underinsured ', ' Uninsured ', ' chronic pain ', ' ']",NHLBI,AUGUSTA UNIVERSITY,U01,2018,923745,0.05937433704956774
"Innate Immunity and Gender Differences in Melanoma The rate of melanoma has continued to rise for over 30 years. Once distant metastasis occurs, the 5 year survival rate for melanoma is only 16%. Until the age of 45, incidence rates of malignant melanoma are higher in woman than in men, but by the age of 60, rates in men are more than double those in women and by the age of 80, they are almost triple, indicating a gender disparity for melanoma. It is estimated that there will be 75,000 new cases of melanoma and nearly 10,000 deaths in 2015, with two thirds of these deaths expected to be males. The role of Innate immunity and the continuously decreasing testosterone levels with age in males have not been explored and the reason for this gender disparity remains unknown. To investigate the role of androgens in this gender disparity we used a B16 colonization and metastasis mouse model. We observed that 8 week old female mice had a significantly greater tumor burden than male mice. While ovariectomy did not affect tumor burden, castrated male mice had an increased tumor burden in the lung, as well as reduced neutrophil infiltration and natural killer (NK) cell activation, suggesting that these two cell types play a protective role and that Innate Immunity play a key role. Neutrophil depletion resulted in increased tumor burden and reduced NK cell activation, indicating a crosstalk between these two cell types in this model. In addition to the B16 cells, we have now established working metastatic models using “YUMM” cell lines obtained from genetically engineered mice with human melanoma mutations. The impact that testosterone levels has on Innate immunity, on neutrophils, NK cells, and possibly other mononuclear cells in melanoma patients is unknown. Based on these preliminary data and the reported presence of Androgen Receptor (AR) on bone marrow cells, we hypothesize that testosterone may interact directly with neutrophils, which in turn impacts NK cell function, to elicit a protective immune response against melanoma colonization and metastasis in the lungs. We propose this as the mechanism for the increased lung metastasis in female mice compared to male mice. To test this hypothesis we propose the following two specific AIMs for this exploratory R21 application: Aim1) To Determine the mechanism by which testosterone modulates the innate immune system and melanoma tumor burden in the lung and Aim 2) To Investigate the efficacy of testosterone treatment in reducing melanoma tumor cell lung colonization/metastasis The successful completion of this proposal will elucidate the mechanism by which androgens mediate colonization and tumor burden in the lungs of B16 or YUMM melanoma injected mice through the interaction with immune cells. The ultimate goal is to identify a subset of patients that may be good candidates for testosterone replacement therapy to increase the ability of the immune system to prevent and fight the metastasis of melanoma. Further, the focus on gender disparity may lead to new diagnostic tools and therapeutic modalities for prevention and treatment of metastatic melanoma by identifying an unknown role for hormones in an immunogenic cancer. Patients diagnosed with a distant metastasis of melanoma have a 5 year survival rate of 16% and nearly 10,000 individuals are expected to die of the disease in 2015, with two thirds of those deaths expected to be males. Until the age of 45, incidence rates are higher in woman than in men, but by the age of 60, rates in men are more than double those in women and by the age of 80, they are almost triple. This project will investigate the role of age-related decreasing androgens and the impact they have on the innate immune system and its ability to prevent and fight melanoma metastasis.",Innate

"Role of SLC13A3 in Renal Cell Carcinoma ABSTRACT  Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is the most common type of kidney cancer. African Americans and males tend to have higher rates of RCC when compared to Whites and Hispanics. Due to the lack of diagnostic tests and the asymptomatic nature of RCC in early stages, about 30% of patients have advanced/metastatic RCC at initial presentation. Metastatic RCC is fatal, with median survival of less than 2 years. There still remains a great need for the discovery of molecular drivers of RCC, and biomarkers that associate with racial disparity and predict clinical outcome in RCC patients. Microarray analysis of normal kidney and RCC tissues revealed that SLC13A3 is downregulated in RCC tissues; more significantly in African American RCC patients, when compared to White and Hispanic patients. SLC13A3 is a transporter of Krebs cycle intermediates and glutathione. Decreased intracellular glutathione levels have been shown to induce reactive oxygen species (ROS) that promote oncogenic functions in cancer cells. Overexpression of SLC13A3 in RCC cell lines decreased cell growth and clonogenic survival. SLC13A3 expression was found to be epigenetically regulated by DNA methylation. This proposal will test the hypothesis that SLC13A3 downregulation is a molecular determinant of RCC growth and progression. Furthermore, SLC13A3 downregulation correlates with racial disparity and is a predictor of clinical outcome (metastasis, treatment response, survival) in RCC patients. SLC13A3 functions, associated mechanisms, and phenotypic readouts will be investigated by expressing SLC13A3 in RCC cells and by its downregulation in normal kidney epithelial cells. The effect of SLC13A3 expression on tumor growth and metastasis will be investigated in RCC xenograft models. SLC13A3 expression in normal kidney and RCC tissues will be correlated with clinical outcome and racial disparity. The proposed study will be the first investigation into the functional role of SLC13A3 in any disease type, including cancer. The study should reveal the molecular changes and phenotypic consequences that occur due to SLC13A3 loss in RCC. The study may lead to the establishment of SLC13A3 as functional biomarker for RCC and for the racial disparity observed in terms of disease severity. PROJECT NARRATIVE  Despite advancements in treatment modalities, and diagnosis, molecular causes of renal cell carcinoma development, growth and progression, as well as, of the racial disparity associated with this disease are largely unknown. Through the discovery of a novel potential negative regulator of RCC, this project will investigate how this negative regulator controls RCC growth and progression, and furthermore, whether it is a predictor of clinical outcome and a biomarker of racial disparity in RCC patients. This project may lead to the identification of a tumor suppressor that is a biomarker of RCC progression and a therapeutic target.",Role of SLC13A3 in Renal Cell Carcinoma,9523288,F31CA210612,"['Age ', ' ages ', ' Antioxidants ', ' anti-oxidant ', ' Azacitidine ', ' ladakamycin ', ' Azacytidine ', ' AZC ', ' 5-Azacytidine ', ' 5-Aza-cytidine ', ' 5-AC ', ' 5 AZC ', ' bone ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Renal Cell Carcinoma ', ' kidney adenocarcinoma ', ' Renal Cell Cancer ', ' Renal Cell Adenocarcinoma ', ' Renal Adenocarcinoma ', ' Nephroid Carcinoma ', ' Hypernephroma ', ' Hypernephroid Carcinoma ', ' Grawitz Tumor ', ' cell growth ', ' Cellular Growth ', ' Cellular Expansion ', ' Cell Line ', ' cultured cell line ', ' Strains Cell Lines ', ' CellLine ', ' cell motility ', ' Motility ', ' Cellular Motility ', ' Cellular Migration ', ' Cell Movement ', ' Cell Migration ', ' Cell Locomotion ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Citrates ', ' Citric Acid Cycle ', ' Tricarboxylic Acid Cycle ', ' TCA cycle ', ' Krebs Cycle ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Down-Regulation ', ' Downregulation ', ' Epithelial Cells ', ' Equilibrium ', ' balance function ', ' balance ', ' Glutamine ', ' Q.

"Bi-directional interactions with tumor microenvironment enhance BRCA1-IRIS overexpressing TNBC tumor cells aggressiveness ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Bi-directional interactions with tumor microenvironment enhance BRCA1-IRIS overexpressing TNBC tumor cells aggressiveness. TNBC is an aggressive breast cancer lacks ER/PR expression and Her2 amplification, therefore lacks targeted therapy. TNBC is over-represented in African American women, the majority live in Mississippi. TNBC is an aggressive rapidly advanced disease that metastasizes to lung, liver, and brain. BRCA1-IRIS is upregulated in the majority of TNBC. BRCA1-IRIS overexpression (hereafter IRISOE) promotes formation and metastasis of TNBC tumors, and its silencing prevents both. The objective of this study is to identify the molecular mechanism(s) responsible for enhanced metastasis by IRISOE. Our central hypothesis is that due to massive proliferation triggered by IRISOE, IRISOE tumors become avascular and necrotic in their cores. Hypoxia developed in areas surrounding these necrotic cores (we refer to this necrotic/hypoxic core as the aggressiveness niche) aggravates IRISOE tumor cells metastatic ability. Our data show that in the niche, hypoxia triggers IRISOE/TNBC tumor cells to secrete IL-6 and that induces IL-6R expression on MSCs. This signaling loop attracts MSCs to the vicinity of IRISOE/TNBC tumor cells and activates them to secrete PGE2. PGE2 binds to IRISOE/TNBC tumor cells through EP2/4 re-activates IRISOE/TNBC tumor cells to secrete other cytokines, e.g., GM-CSF and VEGF. GM-CSF is a potent recruiter of monocytes and VEGF of endothelial cells (EC). GM-CSF binding to CSF-2R on tumor associated macrophages (TAMs) and VEGF binding to VEGFR on ECs recruit them to the vicinity of IRISOE/TNBC tumor cells and activates them to secret factors, such as TGF-1ß from TAMs and IL8 from ECs. TGF-1ß binding to TßRI/II and IL8 to CXCR1/2 on IRISOE/TNBC tumor cells, in addition to PGE2/EP2/4 enhance IRISOE/TNBC cells aggressiveness and their dissemination and metastatic potential. In Specific Aim One, we will validate the bidirectional interactions between IRISOE/TNBC tumor cells and MSCs promoting IRISOE/TNBC tumor cells aggressiveness. In Specific Aim Two, we will validate the bidirectional interactions between IRISOE/TNBC tumor cells and M2- TAMs promoting IRISOE/TNBC tumor cells aggressiveness. Finally in Specific Aim Three, we will validate the bidirectional interactions between IRISOE/TNBC tumor cells and ECs role promoting IRISOE/TNBC tumor cells aggressiveness. The proposed studies are in line with the aims of the NIH of generating better understanding of the mechanisms that drive breast cancer progression and produce validated biomarkers for early detection and therapeutic targets. We believe our grant fulfills all these criteria and provide a compelling therapeutic rationale for th development of anti-BRCA1-IRIS drug to specifically target TNBC tumor cells in patients with high risk of recurrence and poor prognosis. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Most early breast tumors are estrogen receptor positive, sensitive to chemo- endocrine treatment. The majority of these tumors progress to a more aggressive tumors that are chemo- endocrine resistance, and often develop into distant metastases.

"Molecular causes and mechanistic underpinning of breast cancer racial disparity ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): African American (AA) women are more likely to have aggressive breast cancer (BC) and experience greater mortality rates as compared to Caucasian (CA) women. Another upsetting fact is that this cancer outcome gap has continued to widen over past several years underscoring the immediate need to make progress in this area. It is being increasingly appreciated that tumor microenvironment (TME) may play an important role in BC racial disparity; however, underlying molecular and mechanistic basis is not clearly understood. This project is built upon our novel findings suggesting the existence of a TME-tumor cell interaction-driven regulatory loop, which is predominantly active in AA patients. We demonstrate that 1) serum levels of inflammatory cytokines, resistin and IL6, are significantly elevated in AA BC patients compared to their CA counterparts, 2) AA BCs have significantly greater expression and phosphorylation of STAT3 compared to CA BCs, 3) treatment of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cell lines from both AA and CA patients with resistin promotes expression of STAT3/pSTAT3 and enhances IL6 production, thus suggesting a dominant role of differential TME in overall disease outcome, 4) IL6 mediates the effect of resistin on STAT3 phosphorylation, 5) resistin promotes aggressive tumor phenotypes and therapy-resistance in BC cells through STAT3 induction, 6) resistin also upregulates LIN28A, a regulator of stemness, and downregulates let-7 miRNA, and 7) LIN28A silencing abrogates resistin-induced upregulation of IL6, pSTAT3 and STAT3. Based on these findings, we hypothesize that intrinsic differences in tumor biology contributes to BC racial disparity and resistin-LIN28A-(IL6)- STAT3/pSTAT3 serves as an important regulatory loop controlling the aggressive and therapy-resistant phenotypes of BC cells. This hypothesis will be tested in three specific aims. In aim 1, we will characterize the molecular mechanisms underlying resistin-LIN28A-(IL6)-STAT3/pSTAT3 regulatory loop by examining the pathways regulating resistin-induced LIN28A expression, and whether LIN28A mediates resistin-induced let-7 downregulation, which then leads to STAT3 and IL6 upregulation in BC cells. In aim 2, we will examine the functional significance of this regulatory by using luciferase-tagged, control or LIN28A-/STAT3-silenced BC cell lines and characterize the response of resistin and its downstream effectors on growth, metastasis and therapy-resistance in an orthotopic nude mice model. In aim 3, we will determine the clinical relevance of the components of resistin-LIN28A-(IL6)-STAT3/pSTAT3 regulatory loop in BC racial disparity by examining their expression in clinical samples and assessing their correlation (alone and in combination) with TME and tumor cell characteristics as well as with race and patient's survival. Together, these studies will provide novel insight into molecular causes and mechanistic underpinning of BC racial disparity and provide novel set of biomarkers and potential drug-targets to develop novel ways for reducing the widening gaps in clinical outcome of AA and CA BC patients. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Cancer health disparities represent a major public health concern in the United States and there is a clear perception that these disparities exist at the molecular level and tumor microenvironment (TME) plays an important role. The proposed research will characterize TME-tumor cell interaction-driven molecular cross-talk and confirm its functional and clinical relevance in racially-disparate clinical outcomes of breast cancer (aggressiveness and therapeutic-resistance) between Caucasian (CA) and American (AA) patients. Anticipated findings will be helpful in understanding the molecular and mechanistic basis of breast cancer racial disparity, reveal therapeutically-significant intervention points and identify a novel set of mechanistically-linked biomarkers to serve as risk-predictors and molecular sub-classifiers of disease and thus ultimately be helpful in reducing the observed cancer outcome gaps.",Molecular

"Pathogenesis of fungal infectious disease in the Hmong population PROJECT SUMMARY I will study the mechanisms that underlie a health disparity and vulnerability to systemic fungal disease in the Hmong population. People of Hmong descent are 10 to 100 times more likely than non-Asian peers to acquire blastomycosis (an infection due to Blastomcyes dermatitidis) despite having fewer behavioral risk factors or co- morbidities. Blastomycosis, like other invasive mycoses, produces severe illness in some racial and ethnic groups, prompting the idea that genetic polymorphisms govern susceptibility. None have been found and this represents a gap in knowledge. My lab sequenced the whole genomes of 5 Hmong blastomycosis patients involved in an epidemic in Wisconsin. We found 192 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) shared in the patients, rare in the European Super Population, and meeting additional criteria such as location in an annotated regulatory region. Notably, many of the SNPs are in or near the gene encoding IL-6 or other genes that nurture IL-17 immunity. IL-17 is important in controlling fungal infection, but also in development of autoimmunity.  I will test the hypothesis that SNPs in IL-6 and related genes underlie immune dysregulation in the Hmong patients. My first aim is to study how SNPs identified in the pilot cohort impact the regulation of IL-6. As pathology may arise from either weak or over-exuberant responses, any difference in the response between Hmong patients and controls may be significant. SNP(s) that account for the observed differences will be identified by genetically manipulating primary cells and reporter cells, then studying impact on function. Another goal of the first aim is to investigate the function of an unstudied long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) that overlaps the IL-6 gene; it is likely that this lncRNA regulates IL-6 production. I postulate that a SNP we identified in this lncRNA modifies its function and thus impacts IL-6 transcript and product. My second aim is to apply two unbiased, open-ended methods to probe the anti-fungal responses of circulating immune cells from Hmong blastomycosis patients and controls. In these studies, cells will be probed with defined ligands or yeast, and response will be measured by cytokine bead array and transcriptome analysis. These data will reveal if receptors or signaling pathways are functioning aberrantly. In addition to supporting mechanistic findings from Aim 1, these studies will help generate new hypotheses.  This proposal addresses a key gap in knowledge: the mechanism that underlies a documented health disparity. Similar work on tuberculosis has identified SNPs that predict response to treatment, which allows clinicians to tailor therapy to individual patients. My results will similarly facilitate precise medical decision-making. My findings may also have implications beyond the field of fungal immunology; other IL-17-mediated diseases include autoimmune disorders and cancer. I am excited to undertake this project, and know that the training I receive in pursuing my aims will prepare me for a fruitful career as a clinician-scientist in Infectious Disease. PROJECT NARRATIVE People of Asian, primarily Hmong, ancestry are known to have an in-born susceptibility to the dimorphic fungal disease blastomycosis. Our pilot data suggests that an aberration in the IL-6/IL-17 axis underlies this health disparity. I will characterize how variation in the immune response leads to pathology in the Hmong population. My findings may identify novel targets for precise medical treatment of disease related to dysregulation of the IL-17 response, which includes fungal infections, autoimmune diseases, and

"Cell-based Therapy in RA: Proof of Concept This application proposes a double blind placebo-controlled Phase I cell therapy clinical trial in sero-positive, new-onset RA patients (within 2 years of diagnosis) who have high disease activity despite an adequate trial of a methotrexate, a Disease Modifying Anti-Rheumatic Drug (DMARD). The trial will take place at CWRU with two clinical performanace sites [MetroHealth Medical Center (MHMC) and University Hospitals Case Medical Center]. Cell based therapy using mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) holds great promise. MSCs appear to be pericytes, poised to sense and repair damage arising from exogenous or endogenous threats, i.e. the “guardians of inflammation”. These cells home to sites of inflammation and/or injury and facilitate repair while selectively reducing inflammation. The driving hypothesis for this clinical trial is that MSCs will have therapeutic value in restoring immune tolerance. MSCs have potential to delay or abort onset of full blown RA by resetting the immune system, inducing immune tolerance and dampening the observed amplification of adaptive immune mechanisms that perpetuate joint inflammation. Multiple RA therapies are available but none specifically repair autoimmunity; rather most interfere with both autoimmunity and protective host immunity. Most affected require lifelong therapy, rendering RA patients susceptible to infection and malignancy beyond that which RA itself confers. This study will focus on the safety of IV delivery of adult, bone marrow-derived allogeneic MSCs collected from a normal donor and expanded ex vivo. Patients will be randomized to MSCs or placeo and treated with a single infusion of MSCs while remaining on concomitant methotrexate except in the interval immediately after MSC infusion (so as not to damage the infused MSCs). Three MSC dose-escalation levels and studies will be performed. The enrollment schedule of one subject per month is acceptable to regulatory agencies. Dose escalation rules and early stopping rules have been developed. Patient reported outcomes (legacy and PROMIS) will be collected. In addition, we have engaged the Center for Health Disparities at MHMC in conducting focus groups to understand what RA patients think about the potential and appropriate timing for MSCs as RA therapy. An IRB application has been submitted and an IND submission will be completed prior to review of this application. Presuming safety, this study will be followed by a Phase II randomized placebo-controlled trial adequately powered to detect primary clinical and translational endpoints validated in the Phase I investigation. While the primary endpoint for the Phase I proof of concept program is safety, this study will use sensitive approaches to detect MSC immunologic effects in new onset RA patients in whom 12 weeks of methotrexate therapy has resulted in incomplete response (DAS28-CRP ≥ 4.4 ). Immunologic measures to detect tolerance will include measuement of number and function of Tregs using a novel functional biomarker developed in the PI's laboratory. At study end, we should be able to demonstrate safety of infusing MSCs in RA, pick two dosages for a successor Phase II trial, and identify which biomarkers should be used that trial. RA affects adults in the prime of their life and their career with two peaks of onset, the first in the mid-life around the age of forty and the second in the sixties. RA affects women more frequently than men with up to 1% of the population affected. The burden to society includes but is not limited ot the potential loss of individuals who are at the peak of their careers themselves who may be affected by RA or who may be responsible for caring for a family member with RA. This Phase I clinical trial in which RA patients have had an incomplete response to methotrexate receive add on therapy with a single infusion of adult bone marrow stem cells (or placebo infusion) from a healthy donor to “quiet” the immune system will be perfomed at two academic Case Western Reserve University (CWRU) sites- MetroHealth Medical Center and University Hospitals/Case Medical Center. If successful, cell based therapy would represent a paradigm shift in the treatment of RA. Studies have demonstrated that early treatment of new onset RA improves outcomes but therapies are most often life long, expensive and have undesirable side effects. If immune tolerance can be induced and the immune system ""reset"" to its ""pre-RA"" condition, than environmental and other lifestyle changes (e.g quitting smoking) could be used to reduce the chance of recrudescence of RA and increase the interval to ""flare"".",Cell-based Therapy in RA: Proof of Concept,9548976,R21AR069226,"['Adrenal Cortex Hormones ', ' Corticosteroids ', ' Corticoids ', '

"Identification of novel prognostic markers in triple-negative breast cancers in African American Women Project Summary Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) is characterized by lack of expression of the estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2). Available chemotherapy for TNBC results in limited efficacy and significant toxicity. The majority of patients with metastatic disease do not survive beyond 3 years. Currently, no targeted therapies are available for TNBC, in part because it is a highly heterogeneous disease and because the molecular drivers for TNBC are not known. TNBC more frequently affects younger patients (< 50 years) and is twice as prevalent in African American women as compared to Caucasians. There is a need to understand the biology of TNBC at the basic genetic and epigenetic levels to be able to develop targeted therapies for individual patients. We have identified a cohort of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) that may be specific to TNBC in African American women. The proposed research is focused on understanding the function of these lncRNAs in TNBCs. We hypothesize that disparities in TNBC in the African American population may be explained, in part, by expression of non-coding RNAs and epigenetic alterations that are specific to this population. We propose that lncRNAs may play an important role in the initiation and progression of TNBC in this population through regulation of gene expression. This proposal, consisting of two Specific Aims, will powerfully harness the complementary expertise of a team of investigators with considerable experience in signal transduction, cell cycle control, gene regulation, and clinical aspects of breast cancer. In Aim 1, we will test the hypothesis that down-regulation of selected ""driver lncRNAs"" will significantly affect TNBC cell proliferation, cell cycle progression, survival, migration, and invasion in TNBC using in vitro models of this disease. In Aim 2, we propose to characterize the most promising lncRNAs using an animal model, in an effort to understand how they initiate and maintain the TNBC phenotype and the associated gene expression signature. PROJECT NARRATIVE TNBC is more frequent in younger patients (< 50 years) and is twice as prevalent in African American women as compared to Caucasians. We propose that lncRNAs play an important role in the initiation and progression of TNBC in this population through regulation of gene expression and will test the role of these regulatory RNAs in vitro and in vivo.",Identification of novel prognostic markers in triple-negative breast cancers in African American Women,9571236,R21CA220518,"['Affect ', ' Biology ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Down-Regulation ', ' Downregulation ', ' Gene Expression Regulation ', ' Gene Regulation Process ', ' Gene Regulation ', ' Gene Action Regulation ', ' Genes ', ' Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Immunotherapy ', ' immuno therapy ', ' immune-based treatments ', ' immune-based therapies ', ' immune therapy ', ' immune therapeutic interventions ', ' Immunologically Directed Therapy ', ' In Vitro ', ' Incidence ', ' mortality ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Play ', ' Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor ', ' proto-oncogene protein c-erbB-1 ', ' erbBl ', ' erbB-1 Proto-Oncogene Protein ', ' erbB-1 ', ' c-erbB-1 Protein ', ' c-erbB-1 ', ' Urogastrone Receptor ', ' Transforming Growth Factor alpha Receptor ', ' TGF-alpha Receptor ', ' HER1 ', ' Epidermal Growth Factor-Urogastrone Receptors ', ' Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinase ', ' Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor Kinase ', ' ERBB Protein ', ' EGFR ', ' EGF Receptor ', ' Estrogen Receptors ', ' Progesterone Receptors ', ' Progestin Receptors ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Testing ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' Transplantation ', ' transplant ', ' Caucasians ', ' white race ', ' Occidental ', ' Caucasoid Race ', ' Caucasoid ', ' Caucasian Race ', ' Caucasian ', ' Woman ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Programmed Cell Death ', ' Apoptosis Pathway ', ' Apoptosis ', ' base ', ' Clinical ', ' insight ', ' neu Genes ', ' herstatin ', ' erbB-2 Genes ', ' c-erbB-2 Proto-Oncogenes ', ' c-erbB-2 Genes ', ' c-erbB-2 ', ' TKR1 ', ' Oncogene ErbB2 ', ' NEU protein ', ' NEU Oncogene ', ' HER2/neu ', ' HER2 Genes ', ' HER2 ', ' HER-2 ', ' HER -2 ', ' ERBB2 ', ' ERBB2 gene ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Genetic ', ' Investigation ', ' Xenograft procedure ', ' xeno-transplantation ', ' xeno-transplant ', ' Xenotransplantation ', ' Xenograft ', ' Heterologous Transplantation ', ' Heterograft ', ' Cell Proliferation ', ' Cellular Proliferation ', ' Cell Multiplication ', ' Cell Growth in Number ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' cohort ', ' Animal Model ', ' model organism ', ' model of animal ', ' Animal Models and Related Studies ', ' Toxic effect ', ' Toxicities ', ' Breast Carcinoma ', ' Mammary Carcinoma ', ' novel ', ' Disease model ', ' disorder model ', ' Modeling ', ' Untranslated RNA ', ' noncoding ', ' Nontranslated RNA ', ' Noncoding RNA ', ' Non-Coding RNA ', ' Non-Coding ', ' Functional RNA ', ' Cell Cycle Regulation ', ' Cell Cycle Control ', ' Breast Cancer Model ', ' mammary tumor model ', ' mammary cancer model ', ' Breast tumor model ', ' Breast Cancer Cell ', ' breast tumor cell ', ' Prognostic Marker ', ' prognostic indicator ', ' prognostic biomarker ', ' Prognosis Marker ', ' Molecular Marker of Prognosis ', ' in vitro Model ', ' in vivo ', ' Cell Cycle Progression ', ' Epigenetic Mechanism ', ' Epigenetic Change ', ' Epigenetic ', ' Epigenetic Process ', ' Xenograft Model ', ' Molecular ', ' transcriptional signature ', ' gene expression signature ', ' gene expression pattern ', ' Expression Signature ', ' Gene Expression Profile ', ' triple-negative breast cancer ', ' TNBC ', ' triple-negative invasive breast carcinoma ', ' knockdown ', ' knock-down ', ' Population ', ' migration ', ' short hairpin RNA ', ' shRNA ', ' small hairpin RNA ', ' chemotherapy ', ' tumor ', ' RNAseq ', ' RNA sequencing ', ' RNA Seq ', ' transcriptome sequencing ', ' targeted therapy ', ' targeted therapeutic agents ', ' targeted therapeutic ', ' targeted drug treatments ', ' targeted drug therapy ', ' targeted treatment ', ' transcriptional differences ', ' differentially expressed ', ' differential expression ', ' Breast tumor cell line ', ' Breast Cancer cell line ', ' Breast Tumor Patient ', ' Breast Cancer Patient ', ' individual patient ', ' molecular targeted treatment ', ' molecular targeted therapeutics ', ' molecular targeted therapies ', ' ']",NCI,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,R21,2018,184331,-0.03267808000144103
"Estrogen Negatively Modulates Proteoglycan-4 Expression in TMJ ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Temporomandibular joint disorders (TMDs) affect a significant portion of the population of the USA, with the majority of those seeking treatment being women of childbearing age. Owing to this striking sexual dimorphism it has been postulated that sex hormones play a role in the maintenance of normal temporomandibular joint (TMJ) function. Proteoglycan 4 (PRG4) is a secreted lubricating molecule essential for maintaining low frictional levels within articular joints; however, its role in the TMJ is not well characterized. We identified conserved estrogen response elements within the 5' flanking region of the PRG4 gene of human and baboon, and found that treatment of baboon TMJ disc cells with estrogen attenuated PRG4 promoter activity and expression of PRG4 mRNA in vitro. This discovery of negative regulation of PRG4 by estrogen is the basis for the hypothesis that a causative event in the development of TMD is estrogen-mediated down regulation of PRG4 transcription. Insufficient quantity of PRG4 in the TMJ is expected to lead to increased friction and over time, degradation of TMJ components affecting the articulation of the mandibular condyle with the glenoid fossa of the temporal bone and disc placement, which largely describes the human TMD phenotype. In this study we propose three specific aims; 1) to determine the extent that estrogen decreases PRG4 expression in female and male baboon TMJ cells and TMJ organotypic cultures. Immunoblots and qPCR will be used to quantify estrogen effects on PRG4 expression in synovial and cartilage cells and tissues that will be compared to PRG4 expression in TMJ disc cells and tissue. 2) To characterize by ChIP analysis estrogen alpha and beta receptors and estrogen response element binding in PRG4 gene regulation in femal and baboon TMJ cells. 3) To provide a highly mentored environment and rigorous biomedical research training opportunities for the development of underrepresented students in the life sciences. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Proteoglycan-4 (PRG4) is known to be crucial for the healthy lubrication of articular joints and failure of the temporomandibular joint (TMJ) lubrication mechanism has been proposed to lead to TMJ disorders (TMD), which are reported predominantly by young females. The proposed study follows through on the finding that estrogen inhibits PRG4 gene expression in cells of the TMJ, possibly explaining the gender disparity seen in TMD patients. Characterizing estrogen-mediated inhibition of PRG4 expression is expected to lead to innovative therapeutic treatments beneficial for TMD patients.",Estrogen Negatively Modulates Proteoglycan-4 Expression in TMJ,9545802,SC3GM105573,"['Accounting ', ' Affect ', ' Alternative Splicing ', ' Alternative RNA Splicing ', ' Alternate Splicing ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Biological Sciences ', ' Life Sciences ', ' Bioscience ', ' Biologic Sciences ', ' Biology ', ' Biomedical Research ', ' Birth ', ' Parturition ', ' Cartilage ', ' Cartilaginous Tissue ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Comorbidity ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Critiques ', ' Down-Regulation ', ' Downregulation ', ' Environment ', ' Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay ', ' ELISA ', ' Estradiol ', ' Therapeutic Estradiol ', ' Progynon ', ' Ovocylin ', ' Ovocyclin ', ' Estraldine ', ' Estradiol-17beta ', ' Estradiol-17 beta ', ' Estrace ', ' Diogynets ', ' Diogyn ', ' Dimenformon ', ' Aquadiol ', ' Estrogens ', ' Therapeutic Estrogen ', ' Extracellular Matrix ', ' ECM ', ' Cell-Extracellular Matrix ', ' Facial Pain ', ' Face Pain ', ' Female ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Gene Expression Regulation ', ' Gene Regulation Process ', ' Gene Regulation ', ' Gene Action Regulation ', ' Genes ', ' Goals ', ' Head ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' In Vitro ', ' Joints ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lubrication ', ' Maintenance ', ' male ', ' Mandibular Condyle ', ' Mentors ', ' Mutation ', ' genome mutation ', ' Genetic defect ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Papio ', ' Savanna Baboons ', ' Papios ', ' Baboons ', ' Pathology ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Play ', ' Promoter Regions ', ' genetic promoter element ', ' Promotor Regions ', ' Proteoglycan ', ' Publishing ', ' Research ', ' Messenger RNA ', ' mRNA ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Gonadal Steroid Hormones ', ' sex steroid ', ' gonadal steroids ', ' Sex Steroid Hormones ', ' Sex Hormones ', ' Synovial Membrane ', ' Synovium ', ' Membrana Synovialis Capsulae Articularis ', ' Temporal bone structure ', ' Temporal Bone ', ' Temporomandibular Joint ', ' TMJ ', ' Mandibular joint ', ' Jaw Joint ', ' Temporomandibular Joint Disorders ', ' Temporomandibular joint disorder ', ' Temporomandibular Joint Diseases ', ' Temporomandibular Disorders ', ' Temporo-mandibular joint disorder ', ' TMJD ', ' TMJ Disorders ', ' TMJ Diseases ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' Translating ', ' Gender ', ' Mediating ', ' promoter ', ' promotor ', ' Conditioned Medium ', ' Conditioned Culture Media ', ' Friction ', ' base ', ' Reporter Genes ', ' Synovial Cell ', ' cartilage cell ', ' Failure ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Attenuated ', ' Structure of articular disc of temporomandibular joint ', ' Temporomandibular Joint Disk ', ' Temporomandibular Articular Disk ', ' TMJ Disc ', ' Knowledge ', ' Event ', ' In Situ ', ' System ', ' American ', ' molecular pathology ', ' Protein Isoforms ', ' Isoforms ', ' receptor ', ' Receptor Protein ', ' sexual dimorphism ', ' sex dimorphism ', ' knowledge base ', ' knowledgebase ', ' attenuation ', ' Response Elements ', ' Pathogenesis ', ' Reporting ', ' Gene Proteins ', ' Protein Gene Products ', ' Regulation ', ' monolayer ', "" 5' Flanking Region "", "" 5' Flanking Sequence "", ' Binding ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' Glenoid structure ', ' Glenoid Fossa ', ' chromatin immunoprecipitation ', ' ChIP assay ', ' Data ', ' Molecular ', ' sex ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' joint function ', ' women of childbearing age ', ' women of child bearing age ', ' Female of childbearing age ', ' Female of child bearing age ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' public health relevance ', ' effective treatment ', ' effective therapy ', ' Dislocations ', ' under-represented student ', ' Underrepresented Students ', ' training opportunity ', ' gender disparity ', ' Articulation ', ' ']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS SAN ANTONIO,SC3,2018,110250,0.1214267583467226
"Social regulation of pro-inflammatory monocytes DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposed research seeks to determine how adverse social environments influence the risk of inflammation-related disease by up-regulating the expression of pro-inflammatory genes. These studies test the hypothesis that adverse social environments stimulate the hematopoietic production of immature pro-inflammatory monocytes (CD16- in humans, Ly-6c-high in mice) via threat-induced activation of beta-adrenergic receptors in bone marrow myelopoietic cells. Specific aims will: (Aim 1) Define the neural and endocrine pathways by which chronic threat up-regulates pro-inflammatory monocytes; (Aim 2) Define the specific beta-adrenergic receptors and target cell types mediating threat-induced expansion of pro- inflammatory monocytes; and (Aim 3) Define the myelopoietic molecules mediating beta-adrenergic expansion of pro-inflammatory monocytes (including GM-CSF, TGF-beta, and the CXCL12/CXCR4 chemokine signaling axis). When complete, these studies will provide an integrated mechanistic model of the neural / hematopoietic pathway by which chronic adversity can up-regulate inflammatory gene expression in circulating immune cells. The overarching goal of these studies is to develop a comprehensive theory that explains how common social risk factors can influence multiple inflammation-related diseases. In addition to clarifying the basic physiologic mechanisms involved in ""defensive programming"" of the immune system transcriptome, these studies will identify specific CNS mechanisms (e.g., Crf gene activation in central nucleus of the amygdala), pharmacologic intervention strategies (e.g., beta-2 and beta-3 adrenergic antagonists, and antagonists of GM-CSF, TGF-beta, and/or CXCR4), and mechanistic biomarkers (e.g., myelopoietic molecules and circulating monocyte phenotypes) that can be applied in future studies to clarify how stress-induced up- regulation of pro-inflammatory monocytes impacts specific inflammation-related diseases such as atherosclerosis, Type II diabetes, Alzheimer's disease, and cancer. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This research seeks to improve public health by clarifying the biological pathways through which adverse social environments such as social isolation or poverty influence the risk of inflammation-related diseases such as heart disease, Alzheimer's disease, and cancer. This research will establish new risk factors, neural mechanisms, pharmacologic intervention strategies, and cellular and molecular biomarkers of individual health status to help protect human health in the context of adverse social environments and thus reduce socially-related health disparities.",Social regulation of pro-inflammatory monocytes,9485206,R01AG043404,"['Adrenergic Agents ', '

"MOLECULAR BASIS FOR THE IMPACT OF SEX ON BRAIN TUMORIGENESIS DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Primary and metastatic brain tumors occur more commonly in males than females. This is true regardless of age or region of the world. Thus, sex must affect fundamental mechanisms of neoplastic growth in the central nervous system. In preliminary studies we established conditions that result in the transformation of male but not female astrocytes. This experimental paradigm is an unprecedented opportunity to define the molecular basis for the effects of sex on tumorigenesis. We found that sex affects global gene expression, activation of the tumor suppressor p21cip1, induction of a stem cell phenotype, growth kinetics, cellular senescence and patterns of intracranial malignant growth. Moreover, we found sex differences in human GBM stem cells. In this proposal we will exploit these murine and human GBM models to define the molecular basis for the effect of sex on brain tumorigenesis. In Specific Aim 1 we build on preliminary findings that sexually dimorphic expression of the growth inhibitory molecule p202 results in differential induction of the tumor suppressor p21cip1 and thereby blocks transformation in female astrocytes. In Specific Aim 2 we will follow up on preliminary studies that indicate stem cells are more easily induced in male astrocytes and define how sex, multiple initiating oncogenic events, X chromosome reactivation and cell of origin interact to regulate transformation. In Specific Aim 3 we perform validation studies with human male and female GBM stem cell cultures and test the hypothesis that sex differences in GBM stem cells will impact on responses to therapeutic targeting of CXCR4. Together these studies will advance of fundamental knowledge of cancer biology and have the potential to impact on our approach to treating patients with malignant brain tumors. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Successful cancer therapy may require tailoring treatment approaches to the individual and their unique cancer. We determined that sex exerts a profound effect on early events during the genesis of malignant brain tumors. These findings have significant implications for both basic cancer biology and clinical neuro-oncology.

"Hemoglobin Modifiers for Sickle Cell Disease Therapy DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our goal is to design and establish novel therapeutic agents for sickle cell disease (SCD), namely drugs that inhibit the initial sickle hemoglobin (HbS) polymerization and the subsequent pathophysiology. When deoxygenated, HbS polymerizes into long, rigid, and insoluble fibers causing red blood cells (RBCs) to sickle, a process worsened by the unusual low affinity of HbS for oxygen, resulting in premature release of oxygen. Based on several evidence--our preliminary data, studies by others, and the results of a recently completed phase I/II clinical testing of our lead compound, 5-HMF (an allosteric effector of Hb, AEH)-we hypothesize that AEHs, not only prevent HbS polymerization, but also mitigates several secondary sickling related pathological events that include inflammation, oxidative stress/damage, RBC hemolysis, and pain. We also have preliminary evidence that our next generation AEHs (INN- and TD-series) exhibit enhanced potency and improved in-vitro duration of action. These AEHs act via a novel mechanism of action, i.e., destabilize HbS polymer contacts, in addition to increasing Hb affinity for oxygen; providing positive synergistic effects. We propose to test our hypothesis by further investigating candidate drugs from the INN- and TD-series, as well as derivatives of 5-HMF and INN-312 for their pharmacologic properties, focusing on the secondary SCD pathways, as well as the underlying HbS polymerization problem using our model systems. The specific aims are: 1. Design and synthesis of novel allosteric effectors of hemoglobin (AEHs). We will modify our parent compounds and synthesize derivatives with enhanced efficacy and prolonged half-lives. We will also synthesize prod rugs to protect the active aldehyde functional moiety from aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH)- mediated metabolism as necessary. 2. Investigate in-vitro functional, ant sickling, and cytotoxicity activities of novel AEHs. We will investigate the AEHs for their in-vitro ant sickling/functional activities (RBC sickling tests, P50 analyses, HbS solubility, and Hb adduct formation), and carefully monitor for adverse effects. 3. Determine in-vivo/in-vitro PK/PD properties, binding and metabolism and evaluate preclinical efficacy of AEHs in SCD Berkeley mice. We will show that serum albumin binding and/or metabolism by ALDH in RBC or hepatic cytosol are not likely to adversely affect in-vivo pharmacologic activity. We will demonstrate using a Berkeley mouse model of SCD transgenic mice that AEHs show potent pharmacologic effects, increase short- and long-term survival rates of mice. We will also study their potential beneficial effects, e.g. amelioration of hemolysis, inflammation, endothelial damage, and overall reversal of the SCD pathophysiology observed in this model. 4. Determine the atomic interactions between AEHs and Hb. X-ray crystallography will be used to validate our hypothesis that AEH potency is directly dependent upon their abilities to bind Hb with their pyridyl substituents toward the surface of the Hb molecule. The structures would provide valuable insight to help guide rational modifications for better pharmacologic properties. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Sickle cell disease (SCD) is the most common inherited hematologic disorder, affecting over 80,000 people, primarily African-American in the US, exacerbating the disproportionate health disparity among this minority population. Most common therapeutic intervention includes blood transfusions and hydroxyurea therapies, however, these therapies are associated with some undesirable side effects and not all patients benefit from the treatment. Thus, there is still a need to develop new, more effective and non-toxic therapeutic agents against this debilitating disease.",Hemoglobin Modifiers for Sickle Cell Disease

"Pathogenic Role of IL-18 in Sickle Cell Cardiomyopathy and Inducible Ventricular Tachycardia ABSTRACT: Individuals with sickle cell disease exhibit cardiovascular manifestations and sudden death as the top causes of premature death. These factors, unfortunately, contribute to the plateauing of the average life expectancy of these patients (in the 4th decade) over the past two decades, yet another profound health disparity observed in African Americans (AAs). Despite expanded understanding of the defining features including systemic vaso-occlusive episodes and hemolysis, there is a paucity of information linking cardiac pathology to premature death. Using system biology approaches, we have generated highly novel information characterizing a previously unrecognized human sickle cardiomyopathy defined by myocardial fibrosis, diastolic dysfunction, prolonged repolarization, and inducible ventricular tachycardia (VT) in the “humanized” sickle mouse model. These studies further demonstrated significant upregulation of circulating IL18 gene expression, an established inflammasome and pro-fibrotic mediator upregulated by free heme, in sickle cardiomyopathy. Additionally, exposure to IL-18 was a key factor in inducing VT in sickle mice. Preliminary data further link decreased expression and activity of cardiac potassium channels (KCND2/KCND3) in sickle mice, which can prolong repolarization, to acute increases in IL-18-mediated NADPH oxidase 4 (Nox4) expression, the latter a key source of reactive oxygenation species (ROS) and induction of cardiac apoptosis. We have further shown that chronic IL-18 inhibition reduces cardiac apoptosis, fibrosis and improves diastolic function in sickle mice coupled with reduced cardiac IL-18 receptor (IL-18R) and Nox4 expression. Finally, our genomic studies have identified novel polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with enhanced IL18 expression and prolonged corrected QT (QTc) interval, an established risk factor for VT. Thus, via three specific aims (SAs), this R01 will interrogate the mechanistic basis for the hypothesis that IL-18/IL- 18R/Nox4 signaling critically downregulates KCND2 and KCND3 function acutely and promotes myocardial fibrosis with sustained activation, exacerbating sickle cardiomyopathy and VT development. SA #1 will functionally validate heme-mediated IL18 promoter regulation including SNPs in a monocyte cell line. SA #2 will define how IL-18/IL-18R/Nox4 signaling acutely downregulates KCND2/KCND3 function leading to prolonged repolarization and chronically, results in cardiac apoptosis and fibrosis. SA #3 will define the therapeutic efficacy of strategies to prevent sickle cell-associated inducible VT. The knowledge gained from this R01 will directly translate into future clinical biomarker studies evaluating risk of sudden cardiac death highlighting those patients with a higher hemolytic burden, pathogenic IL18 SNPs, and circulating IL-18 levels with theoretically higher VT risk. Additionally, the data will test for effective and novel personalized therapies in a poorly recognized and fatal manifestation of sickle cell disease. NARRATIVE: While individuals with sickle cell disease exhibit sudden death as the top causes of premature death, it is unclear whether patients experience fatal cardiac arrhythmias that contribute to these outcomes. Our preliminary data, for the first time, reveals inducible ventricular tachycardia (a fatal rhythm disturbance) in preclinical sickle animal models. We propose to study and therapeutically target inflammatory mechanisms as major contributors to the development of abnormal cardiac electrical properties and fibrosis (scar), both factors promoting a heart environment vulnerable to fatal arrhythmias.",Pathogenic Role of IL-18 in Sickle Cell Cardiomyopathy and Inducible Ventricular Tachycardia,9447193,R01HL136603,"['Sickle Cell Anemia ', '

"Molecular Classification of High Grade Endometrial Cancers: Extending TCGA Findings to a Diverse Population ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Endometrial cancer is the most common gynecological cancer and incidence is increasing in the United States. It also has one of the largest survival disparities of all common cancers, with approximately 20% fewer African American women surviving 5 years after diagnosis compared to white women, and this disparity holds across stages and histologic subtypes. Here we seek to examine a particularly aggressive subtype of endometrial cancers, high grade tumors including endometrioid, serous, clear cell and mixed carcinomas. These cancers are responsible for a disproportionate number of deaths from endometrial cancer, and are also more frequently diagnosed in African Americans. Specifically, we aim to: 1. Assess progression free survival and endometrial cancer-related survival in 500 women (250 African American, 250 white) diagnosed with high grade endometrial cancers, as defined by current pathologic standards; 2. Molecularly characterize (through whole exome sequencing and gene expression analysis) tumors from these women who received surgical treatment at two large research hospitals in Detroit, Michigan. We will perform integrated analysis to classify the tumors into biologically and clinically relevant groups and 3. Analyze the performance of the molecular classifications with respect to progression free survival and endometrial cancer- related survival, adjusting for relevant demographic, clinical, co-morbidity and treatment information. Preliminary work in this area has been done by The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), but the tumors included were primarily from white women, with only 10 endometrioid and 11 serous tumors from African American women used to inform the molecular reclassification analysis. Thus, our project will address a large gap in current knowledge. Public Health Significance: The identification of novel somatic mutations and understanding of the spectrum of molecular variation, particularly among African Americans, will help us move further toward personalized medicine, with the potential to reduce the racial disparities in endometrial cancer survival and ultimately improve survival for all women with endometrial cancer.

"Prevalence and Progression of Monoclonal Gammopathies DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Multiple myeloma (MM) is a life-threatening plasma cell malignancy. MM has a prolonged clinically detectable premalignant phase called monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) that can be identified by detection of the secreted monoclonal immunoglobulin (M protein) and through the presence of an abnormal immunoglobulin kappa/lambda free light chain (FLC) ratio. Over the last 10 years we have extensively characterized the various precursor stages of MM, and conducted numerous studies establishing monoclonal elevations of FLC and abnormalities in the FLC ratio as biomarkers for diagnosis, prognosis, response assessment, and risk stratification across a spectrum of plasma cell disorders. One of the goals of this renewal is to determine why MGUS occurs, and whether polyclonal plasma cell proliferation in response to infection or inflammation plays a role in pathogenesis of MGUS, MM and related malignancies. We are also investigating the reasons for dramatic racial disparity in incidence of MM; young blacks for example have a 3-fold higher risk than whites. Our studies show that a major reason for the racial discrepancy is a marked excess in the incidence of the precursor MGUS phase in blacks. Similarly, we have uncovered a significant familial predisposition in MGUS and MM. Since MM consists of multiple unique entities from a cytogenetic standpoint, we need to determine the precise cytogenetic subtypes responsible for racial disparity and familial predisposition. Thus two fundamental questions are: 1) Can we identify biomarkers that predict risk of MM prior to the premalignant MGUS stage (precursor of the precursor stage)? 2) What are the specific cytogenetic subtypes that account for the increased risk of MM in blacks and in first degree-relatives? In Aim 1 we will determine if polyclonal elevations of serum immunoglobulin FLC are associated with an increased risk of MGUS, MM and related B cell malignancies in a large cohort of nearly 16,000 patients. In Aim 2 we will assemble and study a cohort of 800 blacks with MM to identify the specific cytogenetic subtype(s) of MM associated with increased risk of MM, and also identify predictors of response to therapy and survival. In Aim 3 we will conduct studies to identify the specific cytogenetic subtypes associated with familial predisposition in MGUS. We believe our studies are highly innovative, and will have a far-reaching impact on our understanding of the etiology of MGUS, and the cytogenetic basis for racial disparity and familial predisposition. Our studies will result in a promising biomarker to identify patients at high risk for MM and related malignancies in the general population. Aims 2 and 3 will have a major impact on the management of patients with MGUS and MM, especially African Americans and first-degree relatives or persons with MGUS.

"Cell-based Therapy in RA: Proof of Concept This application proposes a double blind placebo-controlled Phase I cell therapy clinical trial in sero-positive, new-onset RA patients (within 2 years of diagnosis) who have high disease activity despite an adequate trial of a methotrexate, a Disease Modifying Anti-Rheumatic Drug (DMARD). The trial will take place at CWRU with two clinical performanace sites [MetroHealth Medical Center (MHMC) and University Hospitals Case Medical Center]. Cell based therapy using mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) holds great promise. MSCs appear to be pericytes, poised to sense and repair damage arising from exogenous or endogenous threats, i.e. the “guardians of inflammation”. These cells home to sites of inflammation and/or injury and facilitate repair while selectively reducing inflammation. The driving hypothesis for this clinical trial is that MSCs will have therapeutic value in restoring immune tolerance. MSCs have potential to delay or abort onset of full blown RA by resetting the immune system, inducing immune tolerance and dampening the observed amplification of adaptive immune mechanisms that perpetuate joint inflammation. Multiple RA therapies are available but none specifically repair autoimmunity; rather most interfere with both autoimmunity and protective host immunity. Most affected require lifelong therapy, rendering RA patients susceptible to infection and malignancy beyond that which RA itself confers. This study will focus on the safety of IV delivery of adult, bone marrow-derived allogeneic MSCs collected from a normal donor and expanded ex vivo. Patients will be randomized to MSCs or placeo and treated with a single infusion of MSCs while remaining on concomitant methotrexate except in the interval immediately after MSC infusion (so as not to damage the infused MSCs). Three MSC dose-escalation levels and studies will be performed. The enrollment schedule of one subject per month is acceptable to regulatory agencies. Dose escalation rules and early stopping rules have been developed. Patient reported outcomes (legacy and PROMIS) will be collected. In addition, we have engaged the Center for Health Disparities at MHMC in conducting focus groups to understand what RA patients think about the potential and appropriate timing for MSCs as RA therapy. An IRB application has been submitted and an IND submission will be completed prior to review of this application. Presuming safety, this study will be followed by a Phase II randomized placebo-controlled trial adequately powered to detect primary clinical and translational endpoints validated in the Phase I investigation. While the primary endpoint for the Phase I proof of concept program is safety, this study will use sensitive approaches to detect MSC immunologic effects in new onset RA patients in whom 12 weeks of methotrexate therapy has resulted in incomplete response (DAS28-CRP ≥ 4.4 ). Immunologic measures to detect tolerance will include measuement of number and function of Tregs using a novel functional biomarker developed in the PI's laboratory. At study end, we should be able to demonstrate safety of infusing MSCs in RA, pick two dosages for a successor Phase II trial, and identify which biomarkers should be used that trial. RA affects adults in the prime of their life and their career with two peaks of onset, the first in the mid-life around the age of forty and the second in the sixties. RA affects women more frequently than men with up to 1% of the population affected. The burden to society includes but is not limited ot the potential loss of individuals who are at the peak of their careers themselves who may be affected by RA or who may be responsible for caring for a family member with RA. This Phase I clinical trial in which RA patients have had an incomplete response to methotrexate receive add on therapy with a single infusion of adult bone marrow stem cells (or placebo infusion) from a healthy donor to “quiet” the immune system will be perfomed at two academic Case Western Reserve University (CWRU) sites- MetroHealth Medical Center and University Hospitals/Case Medical Center. If successful, cell based therapy would represent a paradigm shift in the treatment of RA. Studies have demonstrated that early treatment of new onset RA improves outcomes but therapies are most often life long, expensive and have undesirable side effects. If immune tolerance can be induced and the immune system ""reset"" to its ""pre-RA"" condition, than environmental and other lifestyle changes (e.g quitting smoking) could be used to reduce the chance of recrudescence of RA and increase the interval to ""flare"".",Cell-based Therapy in RA: Proof of Concept,9738246,R21AR069226,"['Adrenal Cortex Hormones ', ' Corticosteroids ', ' Corticoids ', '

"Early environmental and hormonal exposure influences on human myometrial cell population 7. Project Summary/Abstract  Uterine fibroids represents a major ethnic disparity in the United States, with African American women afflicted by fibroids four times more than their Caucasian counterparts. While the mechanism underlying fibroid development remains elusive, it is proposed that as a result of putative early-life exposure to toxic environmental agents, such as endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs), in African-American (AA) women, the uterine myometrial stem cell (MSC) population expands permanently, and irreversible reprogramming of key DNA repair-related genes occurs in early development. This early-life reprogramming of DNA repair mechanisms thus decreases their capacity to repair myometrial cell DNA damage. Without functional DNA repair-related genes, somatic mutations, such as MED12 (implicated in approximately 85% of spontaneously-emerging fibroid tumors), emerge in these stem cells and convert them into uterine leiomyoma-forming stem cells, ultimately leading to the development of uterine fibroids.  In addition, it is well-established that fibroid tumors, primary myometrial and fibroid cells, and these myometrial stem cells’ growth is stimulated by ovarian hormones (estrogen and progesterone), suggesting differences in physiological estrogen and progesterone levels (whether due to cyclical hormonal changes or metabolic differences in the body). Research has shown different expression and/or polymorphisms in genes relating to estrogen biosynthesis and/or metabolism, e.g. CYP17, COMT, suggesting the hormonal impact on myometrial stem cell (MSC) expansion is greater in women of African American ethnicity. Combining these observations, studying the effects race and hormones have on MSC expansion counterparts may reveal underlying mechanisms of uterine fibroid development. . 8. Project Narrative  The ultimate goal of this project is to better understand and identify the sources of issues barring complete optimization of women’s health that spans from social, racial and ethnic determinants of health disparities for women, and minority women in particular, including not only the impact of the environment as a driver of physiological and epigenetic changes in the individual and the community, but also the involvement of integrated physiological aspects of organs and systems and the molecular and genetic determinants of both disease and resilience.",Early

"Calcium Channels, Calmodulin and Nuclear CREB Signaling ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Excitation-transcription (E-T) coupling is a process that converts the electrical or chemical activation of a cell to a signal conveyed to the nucleus. n this way, the expression of genes can be modulated in an activity-dependent manner. The neuronal remodeling that results is recognized to be necessary and important for long-term adaptive changes during neuronal development, learning and memory and drug addiction. The most scrutinized example of E-T coupling is Ca2+ signaling to the transcription factor CREB (cAMP response element-binding) protein via phosphorylation at Ser133. As an important source of Ca2+ influx, voltage-gated Ca2+ channels have been well studied for their biophysical and biochemical properties. Interestingly, in E-T coupling it seems that Ca2+ influxes through different Ca2+ channels can engage different signaling pathways to the nucleus. For example, CaV1 (also called L-type) channels enjoy a big advantage over CaV2 channels, even though CaV1 channels contribute only a minority of the overall Ca2+ entry in neurons. Our recent Cell paper uncovered that this disparity in potency can be explained by differences in how the two classes of Ca2+ channels employ local and global Ca2+ signaling. However, the 'private line' for the nanodomain advantage of CaV1 channels is unclear. Now we are poised to provide a detailed characterization of the critical question: what carries the long-distance signal from CaV1-anchored signaling complex to the nucleus? We have an answer: Ca2+/CaM translocation to the nucleus depends on a co-transporter that we now identify as γCaMKII. This shuttle gathers cytoplasmic Ca2+/CaM, sequestering it at the CaV1 channel before traveling to the nucleus under control of a nuclear localization signal. This signaling mechanism relies on γCaMKII, βCaMKII and CaN, signaling molecules that operate in the CaV1 nanodomain and also have been implicated in multiple neuropsychiatric diseases. This proposal focuses on understanding the cellular machinery of γCaMKII/CaM translocation and three specific aims are proposed. (1) Define the dynamics of Ca2+ signaling mechanisms that link CaV1 activity to nuclear CREB phosphorylation and CRE-dependent transcription. We will track γCaMKII translocation in real time and assess the impact of Ca2+/CaM delivered to the nucleus via this shuttle mechanism. (2) We will manipulate the γCaMKII pathway using genetic constructs in order to nail down the molecular components required for CREB phosphorylation. We will alter binding interactions and enzymatic actions involving CaM, βCaMKII, CaN, and PP2A at critical steps along the pathway. (3) Understand CaV1-dependent CaM shuttling in neocortical neurons and define distinct roles of nanodomain Ca2+ signaling and voltage gated conformational signaling for E-T coupling. Gaining a clearer picture of the linkage between CaV1 channels and CREB signaling will have a favorable impact on understanding how changes in gene expression alter the function of neurons in neural networks. Thus, the research is relevant both to basic cell biology and to disease states as diverse as addiction, autism and other neuropsychiatric diseases. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The ability to regulate gene expression in response to stimuli from the outside world is critical for the function of nearly all cell types in the body and plays  crucial role in regulating the function of neurons and their assembly into functional networks. This project studies the process by which excitation of neurons by membrane depolarization couples via opening of specific types of calcium channel and activation of cell signaling machinery to transcription of genes in the cell nucleus. Research on basic excitable cell biology will advance our understanding of how cells remodel themselves in health and in diseases such as addiction and autism.","Calcium Channels, Calmodulin and

"Vaginal Adaptive Immunity Against Zika Virus PROJECT SUMMARY Case reports of Zika virus (ZIKV) sexual transmission are mounting. Early epidemiologic studies demonstrate a higher incidence of ZIKV in women and also appear to demonstrate regional disparities in the clinical severity of Zika disease. These latter findings combined with laboratory reports indicate that prior immunity to dengue virus (DENV) or other related viruses and vaccines may modulate subsequent ZIKV infection. ZIKV persists in semen for up to 6 months and the vagina for up to 14 days. The most devastating outcomes of human ZIKV infection result from transmission of the virus from women to their fetuses. Thus, vaginal immunity emerges as a critical barrier to both stop the ZIKV transmission cycle, and to prevent a step towards eventual transmission to the fetus. Yet little is known about which mechanisms contribute to vaginal anti-ZIKV immunity and the roles that preexisting immunity to ZIKV or DENV play against subsequent vaginal ZIKV infection (vagZIKV). Recent studies from our lab and others using mouse models demonstrated that ZIKV replicates in the mouse vagina and that even a wild-type vaginal antiviral response is initially incompetent in controlling vagZIKV. Because DENV and ZIKV are highly cross-reactive and vaginal immunity is mediated in part by antibodies, it seems reasonable to speculate that antibodies would mediate cross-protection in the vagina. However, our recent data demonstrate that DENV/ZIKV-cross-reactive CD8 T cells dominate during subsequent systemic ZIKV infection, and that DENV-immune CD8 T cells are both necessary and sufficient to provide cross-protection against systemic ZIKV infection. Therefore, the goals of this project are (i) to evaluate the role of the CD8 T cell response in protection against vagZIKV. (Specific Aim 1) and (ii) To investigate how changes in prior ZIKV/DENV infection route/dose affect subsequent anti-ZIKV CD8 T cell responses, including primary effectors and various memory subsets (effector, central, and resident memory), and protection against vagZIKV (Specific Aim 2). NARRATIVE The most recent studies indicate that current epidemiologic models underestimate the risk of ZIKV sexual transmission by at least one order of magnitude. The factors contributing to vaginal adaptive immunity need to be understood to aid in ZIKV vaccine or drug development. The proposed studies will investigate CD8 T cell responses to ZIKV in the female reproductive tract. Inducing a strong CD8 T cell response in addition to antibody response may prove to be a superior vaccination strategy, in contrast with ongoing ZIKV vaccine development efforts that are primarily focused on eliciting antibody responses alone.",Vaginal Adaptive Immunity Against Zika Virus,9587387,R21AI140063,"['Affect ', ' Antibodies ', ' Dengue Virus ', ' Breakbone Fever Virus ', ' Female ', ' Fetus ', ' Flow Cytometry ', ' flow cytophotometry ', ' Flow Microfluorometry ', ' Flow Microfluorimetry ', ' Flow Cytofluorometry ', ' Flow Cytofluorometries ', ' Goals ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Immunity ', ' Immunization ', ' Immunostimulation ', ' Immunological Stimulation ', ' Immunological Sensitization ', ' Immunologic Stimulation ', ' Immunologic Sensitization ', ' Immunohistochemistry ', ' Immunohistochemistry Staining Method ', ' Immunohistochemistry Cell/Tissue ', ' Incidence ', ' Infection ', ' Subcutaneous Injections ', ' Interferons ', ' IFN ', ' Laboratories ', ' Memory ', ' Mus ', ' Murine ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Mice ', ' Peptides ', ' Play ', ' Pregnant Women ', ' pregnant mothers ', ' expecting mother ', ' expectant mother ', ' Publishing ', ' Risk ', ' RNA Viruses ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Seminal fluid ', ' Semen ', ' Stains ', ' Staining method ', ' T-Lymphocyte ', ' thymus derived lymphocyte ', ' Thymus-Dependent Lymphocytes ', ' T-Cells ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Vaccines ', ' Vagina ', ' Vaginal ', ' Virus Diseases ', ' virus-induced disease ', ' virus infection ', ' viral infection ', ' Viral Diseases ', ' Virus ', ' General Viruses ', ' Woman ', ' cytokine ', ' Measures ', ' Case Study ', ' case report ', ' Mediating ', ' base ', ' Clinical ', ' T8 Lymphocytes ', ' T8 Cells ', ' CD8-Positive Lymphocytes ', ' CD8+ T-Lymphocyte ', ' CD8+ T cell ', ' CD8 lymphocyte ', ' CD8 T cells ', ' CD8 Cell ', ' CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes ', ' T-Cell Epitopes ', ' T-Lymphocyte Epitopes ', ' Immune response ', ' immunoresponse ', ' host response ', ' Immunological response ', ' Adoptive Transfer ', ' Knowledge ', ' Viral Load result ', ' Viral Load ', ' Viral Burden ', ' Immune ', ' Immunes ', ' Severities ', ' Route ', ' receptor ', ' Receptor Protein ', ' vaccine development ', ' vaccine formulation ', ' development of a vaccine ', ' develop a vaccine ', ' epidemiology study ', ' epidemiologic investigation ', ' Epidemiology Research ', ' Epidemiological Studies ', ' Epidemiologic Studies ', ' Epidemiologic Research ', ' Reporting ', ' response ', ' cross reactivity ', ' drug development ', ' Antiviral Response ', ' Anti-Viral Response ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' CD8B1 gene ', ' LYT3 ', ' CD8B1 ', ' CD8B ', ' CD8 ', ' Dose ', ' Data ', ' sexually transmitted ', ' Sexual Transmission ', ' C57BL/6 Mouse ', ' Transmission ', ' transmission process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' epidemiological model ', ' vaccination strategy ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' murine model ', ' mouse model ', ' loss of function ', ' gain of function ', ' T cell response ', ' adaptive immunity ', ' Antibody Response ', ' zikav ', ' ZIKV ', ' ZIKA ', ' Zika Virus ', ' dengue viral infection ', ' Dengue virus infection ', ' DENV infection ', ' Dengue Infection ', ' virus transmission ', ' viral transmission ', ' genital tract ', ' reproductive tract ', ' congenital zika syndrome ', ' adaptive immune response ', ' Zika vaccine ', ' Zika virus vaccine ', ' zika disease ', ' Zika virus disease ', ' ZIKV disease ', ' zika viral infection ', ' zika infection ', ' Zika virus infection ', ' ZIKV infection ', ' ']",NIAID,LA JOLLA INSTITUTE FOR IMMUNOLOGY,R21,2018,270000,0.0774532430254202

"Molecular mechanisms of estrogen receptor alpha modulating the inflammatory response in systematic lupus erythematosus ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Ninety percent of those diagnosed with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) are women, with peak incidence between the ages of 15 and 45, when women are most hormonally active. Despite significant research effort, the mechanisms underlying this sex bias remain unclear. Our laboratory previously backcrossed estrogen receptor alpha knockout (ERαKO) mice onto the NZM2410 lupus prone background. We demonstrated that female NZM/ERαKO mice had significantly less renal disease and significantly prolonged survival compared to WT littermates despite similar serum autoantibodies and glomerular immune complex deposition. ERαKO mice are not ERα null, but rather express an N-terminally truncated ERα. They have physiologic deficiencies including infertility due to disruption of a critical activation domain (AF-1). We showed that dendritic cell (DCs) from NZM/ERαKO mice have a blunted inflammatory response to Toll-like receptor (TLR) ligands. When these mice were ovariectomized, the protective phenotype was lost. Upon estradiol-repletion, protection was restored. True ERα null mice are not protected, suggesting that estrogen in the presence of the AF-1 mutant confers protection, rather than the absence of the full-length ERα66. Interestingly, the truncated ERα expressed in the ERαKO animal is structurally similar to ERα46, an endogenous ERα splice variant that lacks the AF-1 domain, and is a negative regulator of gene transcription. ERα46 has an identical DNA binding domain to ERα66 and is a powerful inhibitor of ERα66. We hypothesize that ERα46 expression has a protective effect in lupus. The goal of this project is to determine the role of ERα46 in SLE and TLR-induced inflammation and to improve our understanding of ERα-mediated transcription in the setting of inflammation. In order to accomplish this, Dr. Cunningham will (1) Define the in vitro molecular mechanisms underlying ERα46- and ERα66-regulated transcriptional activity impacting the innate inflammatory response of murine DCs, (2) Determine ex vivo and in vivo the role of ERα46 in TLR-induced lupus utilizing a murine strain expressing an A/B truncation mutant of ERα (ERαAF10), and (3) Use human peripheral blood monocyte (PBMC)-derived DCs to define the role of ERα46 and ERα66 in regulation of the innate immune response in DCs from controls vs. lupus patients. Dr. Cunningham is a clinician-investigator with a long-term career goal of becoming an independent basic and translational researcher in the field of immunology with a focus on SLE. To facilitate her transition to independence, she seeks to further her training in dendritic cell biology, ChIPseq and bioinformatics, and the use of human cells from patient samples. Dr. Cunningham has a mentorship team with an outstanding mentoring track record and wide expertise to support her project. The studies proposed in this K08 mentored grant application will significantly advance the field by providing understanding of ERα-mediated transcription in the setting of TLR-induced inflammation, including ERα binding partners, gene targets, and modulation by ERα46, which represents a potential therapeutic agent.           PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project is highly relevant to public health because females have a higher prevalence and significantly increased risk of autoimmune diseases such as lupus. The reasons for this health disparity remain unclear.

"Pregnancy-induced T cell exhaustion: an opportunity to reduce immunosuppression PROJECT SUMMARY (ABSTRACT) Pregnancy is a common alloimmunizing event that impacts transplant access and outcomes among women. Although T cells of the maternal immune system are routinely activated by fetal alloantigen, it is unclear whether T cells stimulated by fetal antigen differentiate into canonical memory cells during pregnancy. The long-term fate and recall potential of these antigen-experienced T cells in the maternal repertoire are of particular importance to female transplant recipients, whose T cells may be capable of rapid rejection of a donor organ that shares tissue antigens with a prior pregnancy. Unfortunately, our poor understanding of T cell fate in women with a history of pregnancy has contributed to significant gender disparity in transplantation. Preliminary data in our mouse model suggest that fetal antigen during pregnancy promotes the differentiation of CD8+ T cells that persist in the maternal repertoire but have restricted functionality. While these T cells can still mediate rapid allograft rejection, they appear to be distinct from memory T cells that differentiate during other types of alloimmunization. Different populations of antigen-experienced T cells in alloimmunized transplant recipients may have unique requirements for immunosuppression. In this proposal, we will investigate how populations of antigen-experienced T cells induced by either pregnancy or transplantation differ from one another (Aim 1) and determine whether these differences promote immunosuppression reduction strategies in women (Aim 2). We anticipate that the knowledge generated by these studies will alter current immunosuppression strategies to improve the care of alloimmunized transplant recipients. PROJECT NARRATIVE The maternal immune system senses and responds to the fetus during pregnancy but does not appear to generate immunologic memory that negatively affects subsequent pregnancy. However, these “experienced” T cells may pose a threat to female organ transplant recipients later in life when the donor organ shares tissue antigens with a prior pregnancy. We propose to study the evolution and fate of immune responses during pregnancy in order to improve our understanding of T cell memory and improve the care of female organ transplant recipients.",Pregnancy-induced T cell exhaustion: an opportunity to reduce immunosuppression,9598155,K08AI130365,"['Bursa-Dependent Lymphocytes ', ' B-cell ', ' B-Cells ', ' B cells ', ' B cell ', ' B blood cells ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Cell Nucleus ', ' Nucleus ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cyclosporine ', ' sandimmune ', ' neoral ', ' SangCya ', ' Sandimmun ', ' Cyclosporine A ', ' Cyclosporin A ', ' CsA ', ' Ciclosporin ', ' Cytoplasm ', ' Evolution ', ' Female ', ' Fetus ', ' Future ', ' Graft Survival ', ' Immune system ', ' allergic/immunologic organ system ', ' allergic/immunologic body system ', ' Immunologic Memory ', ' secondary immune response ', ' anamnestic reaction ', ' Immunological Memory ', ' Immune memory ', ' Therapeutic immunosuppression ', ' immunosuppression therapy ', ' artificial immunosuppression ', ' Immunosuppressive Therapy ', ' Antirejection Therapy ', ' Anti-Rejection Therapy ', ' Immunosuppression ', ' immune suppression ', ' Immunosuppressive Effect ', ' Immunosuppression Effect ', ' Kidney ', ' renal ', ' Kidney Urinary System ', ' Kidney Transplantation ', ' Renal Transplants ', ' Renal Transplantation ', ' Kidney Transplants ', ' Kidney Grafting ', ' Laboratories ', ' Memory ', ' Mus ', ' Murine ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Mice ', ' Organ Donor ', ' Organ Transplantation ', ' organ xenograft ', ' organ graft ', ' organ allograft ', ' Transplantation Surgery ', ' Organ Transplants ', ' Grafting Procedure ', ' Pregnancy ', ' Gestation ', ' Pregnancy Histories ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' T-Lymphocyte ', ' thymus derived lymphocyte ', ' Thymus-Dependent Lymphocytes ', ' T-Cells ', ' Testing ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' transcription factor ', ' Transcription factor genes ', ' Transcription Factor Proto-Oncogene ', ' General Transcription Factors ', ' General Transcription Factor Gene ', ' Basal transcription factor genes ', ' Basal Transcription Factor ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' Transplantation ', ' transplant ', ' Woman ', ' Calcineurin ', ' Protein Phosphatase-2B ', ' PP2B ', ' Experimental Models ', ' Mediating ', ' Caring ', ' exhaust ', ' improved ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Predisposition ', ' kidney function ', ' Renal function ', ' insight ', ' T8 Lymphocytes ', ' T8 Cells ', ' CD8-Positive Lymphocytes ', ' CD8+ T-Lymphocyte ', ' CD8+ T cell ', ' CD8 lymphocyte ', ' CD8 T cells ', ' CD8 Cell ', ' CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Physiopathology ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Immune response ', ' immunoresponse ', ' host response ', ' Immunological response ', ' embryo/fetus antigen ', ' fetal antigen ', ' Transplant Recipients ', ' transplant patient ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' exhaustion ', ' Adopted ', ' Immune ', ' Immunes ', ' Dependence ', ' Event ', ' Source ', ' fetal ', ' experience ', ' receptor ', ' Receptor Protein ', ' nephrotoxicity ', ' kidney toxicity ', ' Nephrotoxic ', ' T memory cell ', ' memory T lymphocyte ', ' response ', ' Alloimmunization ', ' T cell differentiation ', ' T-Cell Activation ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' CD28 gene ', ' T44 ', ' CD28 ', ' SLEB2 gene ', ' systemic lupus erythematosus susceptibility 2 ', ' sle2 ', ' programmed death 1 ', ' programmed cell death 1 ', ' PD1 gene ', ' PD-1 ', ' Dose ', ' Microchimerism ', ' Data ', ' Improve Access ', ' in vivo ', ' Nuclear Translocation ', ' Immunologically ', ' Immunological ', ' Immunologic ', ' Immunochemical Immunologic ', ' Immunologics ', ' Characteristics ', ' Calcineurin antagonist ', ' Calcineurin inhibitor ', ' preclinical ', ' pre-clinical ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Impairment ', ' murine model ', ' mouse model ', ' allograft rejection ', ' T cell response ', ' gender disparity ', ' negative affectivity ', ' negative affect ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' experimental study ', ' Adaptive Immune System ', ' Immunize ', ' persistent infection ', ' chronic infection ', ' Alloantigen ', ' Antigens ', ' immunogen ', ' ATGN ', ' Differentiation Antigens ', ' Marker Antigens ', ' Differentiation Markers ', ' Differentation Markers ', ' B-Lymphocytes ', ' Bursa-Equivalent Lymphocyte ', ' ']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,K08,2018,196236,0.11470994915191224
"Combinatorial Actions of Genetic Variants and Gender Bias of Alzherimer's Disease PROJECT ABSTRACT Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is conventionally characterized by specific neuropathological features, including the appearance of extracellular amyloid deposits and the accumulation of intracellular neurofibrillary tangles. While several gene mutations are clearly associated with early onset Alzheimer’s disease, the large number of individuals exhibiting delayed onset, aging-associated AD, are likely to harbor many alterations in linked modifier genes that predispose to AD susceptibility. Genetic and genome wide association studies (GWAS) have identified numerous genes and risk alleles that indicate both cell autonomous and non-cell autonomous mechanisms contributing to loss of neurons and cognitive decline. In this regard, the majority of risk variants identified by GWAS reside in non-coding regions of the genome, implying that they act in part to alter gene expression. This proposal responds to the RFA indicating a particular need for approaches designed to delineate the transcriptional and cellular consequences of combinations of SNPs in the risk alleles by generating new cell line reagents to help unravel the question of the causative SNPs and their target genes in specific neurons derived from iPS cells of AD individuals. There are two features of sporadic AD that require molecular explanation- the potential role of aging in AD susceptibility, and the striking gender disparity, with the incidence of AD being exaggerated in females. These issues can only now be addressed based on new technologies and the availability of patient-derived samples. Our proposed research plan takes advantage of the invaluable samples stored at the brain bank of the Shiley-Marcos Alzheimer's Disease Research Center (ADRC) at UCSD, and the iPSC-derived neurons (Salk). This approach will interrogate the effects of different genetic variants with other risk factors (e.g. age, sex), and assess their effects on cell type-specific enhancer landscapes. By merging these data, we can begin to identify the potential causative SNPs that result in altered function of cell-type specific enhancers. We propose using a high throughput 4C screening approach (UMI-4C), and Hi-ChIP, to identify the most likely causative, enhancer-associated SNPs for functionally-implicated coding target genes. Exploiting the power of contemporary gene editing approaches in control or patient-derived iPS cells to specific neuronal cell types, and to astroglia, we can assess the transcriptional phenotypes and functional behaviors of neurons harboring different combinations of risk alleles, both in the isolated cell lines alone and in combination with coculture experiments with astroglia and microglia, as effects of these SNPs may be manifest only with astroglial:neuronal interactions. Together these studies will use powerful contemporary global genomic approaches to determine the coding transcriptional targets of several of the most significant SNPs in enhancers, and the link to roles of estrogen receptor in the gender disparity for AD.

"Factors Predicting Transition Readiness in Youth with Sickle Cell Disease Project Summary / Abstract Transition from pediatric to adult healthcare settings poses significant risks to morbidity and mortality for adolescents and young adults with sickle cell disease. Transition readiness is the acquisition of disease- specific knowledge and self-management skills required for successfully transitioning adolescents and young adults (AYA) from pediatric to adult healthcare. To date, few studies have looked at factors that may influence transition readiness, a measure of disease-specific knowledge and self-management, in AYAs with sickle cell disease. This limits healthcare providers’ and researchers’ abilities to develop interventions specific to the unique needs of the population. The aim of this correlational, cross-sectional study is to examine the relationships between decision-making involvement, self-efficacy of sickle cell disease self-management, and transition readiness in AYAs with sickle cell disease prior to transition to adult healthcare settings. This research project is consistent with National Institute of Nursing Research’s mission to increase development of self-management. The specific aims of this project are to describe factors which influence the AYA’s level of transition readiness and ability to independently care for themselves as they enter the adult healthcare setting. This research project also aligns with the Healthy People 2020 goal to ensure the “development, health, safety, and well-being of adolescents and young adults”; this study will assess gaps in our understanding of factors influencing transition readiness which prevent us from effectively intervening to improve health outcomes after transition to the adult healthcare setting. This cross-sectional study is being guided by the Individual and Family Self-Management Theory framework that asserts development of self-management is influenced by a variety of factors within the family and the individual. A total of 50 family caregiver-child dyads will be utilized as participants for this study based upon the assertions of this theory and a power analysis. Recruitment will occur at an urban, academic children’s hospital in Washington, District of Columbia. One-time data collection will utilize three validated measurement tools, AYA self-report, caregiver self-report, and the electronic medical record. Analysis will be conducted using Statistical Package for Social Sciences Version 25 with the assistance of a statistician. Long-term benefits of this research include increased understanding of factors that can help to predict transition readiness in AYA with sickle cell disease. Results of this project will assist in designing future research, interventions, and evidence-based projects to improve the transitions of adolescents and young adults with sickle cell disease. Project Narrative Over 93% of adolescents and young adults with sickle cell disease require transition to the adult healthcare setting; however, the advancement of practices to safely and effectively prepare adolescents and young adults for transition lags behind resulting in higher rates of complications after entering the adult healthcare setting. Few studies have been conducted to understand factors related to the development of transition readiness. This research project will address knowledge gaps related to transition preparation for adolescents and young adults with sickle cell disease, which will increase researchers’ ability to develop interventions aimed at increasing the levels of transition readiness.",Factors Predicting Transition Readiness in Youth with Sickle Cell Disease,9906401,F31NR018574,"['Achievement ', ' Achievement Attainment ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Sickle Cell Anemia ', ' sicklemia ', ' sickle disease ', ' sickle cell disease ', ' Hemoglobin sickle cell disorder ', ' Hemoglobin sickle cell disease ', ' Hemoglobin S Disease ', ' HbSS disease ', ' Hb SS disease ', ' Attention ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Comorbidity ', ' Statistical Correlation ', ' Correlation Studies ', ' Disease Frequency Surveys ', ' Cross-Sectional Survey ', ' Cross-Sectional Analyses ', ' Cross Sectional Analysis ', ' Cross-Sectional Studies ', ' Data Collection ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Decision Making ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Discrimination ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' DC Washington ', ' D.C.

"Administrative Supplement to: Targeting CRLF2 and Ikaros Alterations to Reduce Health Disparities in Childhood Leukemia SUMMARY  Hispanic children are more likely to develop acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL), and when this occurs they are 39% more likely to die than non-Hispanic Whites. This disparity is due, in part, to a subtype of B-cell precursor ALL (B-ALL) that occurs five times more frequently among Hispanic children than others and has a high relapse rate. This type of leukemia, called CRLF2 B-ALL, is characterized by two genetic alterations: a) overexpression of the cytokine receptor, CRLF2, and b) deletion or inactivation of one allele of the Ikaros (IKZF1) tumor suppressor which is strongly associated with relapse. Our overall hypothesis is that combination therapy that selectively targets the pathways that are deregulated in CRLF2 B-ALL (CRLF2 and Ikaros) will produce a superior therapeutic effect and decrease mortality to reduce the health disparity in survival for Hispanic children with ALL. When the CRLF2 receptor is activated by its ligand, TSLP, downstream pathways (JAK/STAT and PI3/AKT/mTOR) that promote leukemia cell survival, proliferation, and chemoresistance are induced through processes normally kept in check by the Ikaros tumor suppressor. Preliminary data from our team show that treatment with the CK2-specific inhibitor, CX-4945, restores Ikaros tumor suppressor function in high-risk B-ALL from Hispanic patients with deletion of one Ikaros allele, exerting a strong in vivo therapeutic effect. Preclinical studies of CRLF2 B-ALL typically use patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models, where primary leukemia cells from patients with CRLF2 B-ALL are injected into immune deficient mice. Our preliminary data show that mouse TSLP does not activate human CRLF2, making the current PDX models suboptimal for studies of CRLF2 B-ALL. To overcome this obstacle our team engineered immune deficient mice that provide normal human serum levels of human TSLP (+T mice) and generated PDX by injecting these mice with CRLF2 B-ALL cells from Hispanic pediatric patients (+T PDX). Analysis of +T PDX shows CRLF2 activation and gene expression that is more similar to original patient sample than standard PDX. Our preliminary data provide a rationale for novel therapy that targets pathways that are induced by CRLF2 (JAK-STAT5 and PI3K/AKT/mTOR) and by loss of Ikaros tumor suppressor activity using our newly- developed preclinical model for Hispanic CRLF2 B-ALL. To test our hypothesis we will: Aim 1: Establish the in vivo therapeutic efficacy of targeting CRLF2 downstream pathways and their role in CRLF2 B-ALL in Hispanic pediatric patients. Aim 2: Evaluate the in vivo efficacy and mechanisms of combination therapy that restores Ikaros tumor suppressor activity and inhibits the mTOR pathway in Hispanic pediatric CRLF2 B-ALL. The proposed studies use precision medicine approaches (targeting specific pathways and/or functional defects) in context of the health disparity background to develop a novel treatment for CRLF2 B-ALL and reduce childhood cancer health disparities. NARRATIVE   Hispanic children are more likely to develop acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) and when they do they have a 39% higher death rate than non-Hispanic Whites. A contributor to this disparity is a sub-type of high-risk ALL that occurs five times more frequently in Hispanic/Latino children than others. The proposed studies use precision medicine approaches to target the specific genetic alterations responsible for this high-risk sub-type of ALL in a novel in vivo preclinical model that allows

"Molecular causes and mechanistic underpinning of breast cancer racial disparity ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): African American (AA) women are more likely to have aggressive breast cancer (BC) and experience greater mortality rates as compared to Caucasian (CA) women. Another upsetting fact is that this cancer outcome gap has continued to widen over past several years underscoring the immediate need to make progress in this area. It is being increasingly appreciated that tumor microenvironment (TME) may play an important role in BC racial disparity; however, underlying molecular and mechanistic basis is not clearly understood. This project is built upon our novel findings suggesting the existence of a TME-tumor cell interaction-driven regulatory loop, which is predominantly active in AA patients. We demonstrate that 1) serum levels of inflammatory cytokines, resistin and IL6, are significantly elevated in AA BC patients compared to their CA counterparts, 2) AA BCs have significantly greater expression and phosphorylation of STAT3 compared to CA BCs, 3) treatment of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cell lines from both AA and CA patients with resistin promotes expression of STAT3/pSTAT3 and enhances IL6 production, thus suggesting a dominant role of differential TME in overall disease outcome, 4) IL6 mediates the effect of resistin on STAT3 phosphorylation, 5) resistin promotes aggressive tumor phenotypes and therapy-resistance in BC cells through STAT3 induction, 6) resistin also upregulates LIN28A, a regulator of stemness, and downregulates let-7 miRNA, and 7) LIN28A silencing abrogates resistin-induced upregulation of IL6, pSTAT3 and STAT3. Based on these findings, we hypothesize that intrinsic differences in tumor biology contributes to BC racial disparity and resistin-LIN28A-(IL6)- STAT3/pSTAT3 serves as an important regulatory loop controlling the aggressive and therapy-resistant phenotypes of BC cells. This hypothesis will be tested in three specific aims. In aim 1, we will characterize the molecular mechanisms underlying resistin-LIN28A-(IL6)-STAT3/pSTAT3 regulatory loop by examining the pathways regulating resistin-induced LIN28A expression, and whether LIN28A mediates resistin-induced let-7 downregulation, which then leads to STAT3 and IL6 upregulation in BC cells. In aim 2, we will examine the functional significance of this regulatory by using luciferase-tagged, control or LIN28A-/STAT3-silenced BC cell lines and characterize the response of resistin and its downstream effectors on growth, metastasis and therapy-resistance in an orthotopic nude mice model. In aim 3, we will determine the clinical relevance of the components of resistin-LIN28A-(IL6)-STAT3/pSTAT3 regulatory loop in BC racial disparity by examining their expression in clinical samples and assessing their correlation (alone and in combination) with TME and tumor cell characteristics as well as with race and patient's survival. Together, these studies will provide novel insight into molecular causes and mechanistic underpinning of BC racial disparity and provide novel set of biomarkers and potential drug-targets to develop novel ways for reducing the widening gaps in clinical outcome of AA and CA BC patients. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Cancer health disparities represent a major public health concern in the United States and there is a clear perception that these disparities exist at the molecular level and tumor microenvironment (TME) plays an important role. The proposed research will characterize TME-tumor cell interaction-driven molecular cross-talk and confirm its functional and clinical relevance in racially-disparate clinical outcomes of breast cancer (aggressiveness and therapeutic-resistance) between Caucasian (CA) and American (AA) patients. Anticipated findings will be helpful in understanding the molecular and mechanistic basis of breast cancer racial disparity, reveal therapeutically-significant intervention points and identify a novel set of mechanistically-linked biomarkers to serve as risk-predictors and molecular sub-classifiers of disease and thus ultimately be helpful in reducing the observed cancer outcome gaps.",Molecular

"Implementation of a Sickle Cell Enhanced Novel Care Network in South Carolina (iSCENSC) ABSTRACT Sickle cell disease (SCD) is recognized as a significant health disparity in the United States due to the number of patients affected, the paucity of available providers, disease stigmatization, and a lack of treatment options for affected individuals (4). In certain regions of the US, these issues are further worsened by a large percentage of affected patients living in rural regions with limited access to care, lower socioeconomic status, and fewer funding options (5, 6). South Carolina (SC) is a prime example of state that is tremendously under-resourced to treat individuals living with SCD. State-level engagement of pediatric hematologists, managed care organizations, patients, and community foundations resulted in formation of the South Carolina-Sickle Cell (SC2) statewide network designed to increase access to evidence-based care for all individuals living with SCD and to improve their clinical outcomes through access to a SCD medical home (Spoke) connected to a regional specialty care center (Hub). This approach harnesses the state’s resources to improve care for individuals with SCD, utilize the strengths of partnering hospital systems, and use a technology based approach to extend care to rural areas. This project, iSCENSC (Implementation of a Sickle Cell Enhanced Novel Care Network in South Carolina) is designed to evaluate intervention effectiveness for achieving full implementation of the SC2 network and to determine if the hub and spokes model of care increases access to quality care for individuals with SCD and produces findings sufficient to identify replicable methods for optimal care enrichment especially in rural populations. Specific Aims are: 1. Perform a systematic needs assessment in three target regions currently involved in SC2 (Midlands, Pee Dee and Lowcountry) to assess the gap between current and SCD best practices for adolescent and adult SCD patients and to identify care delivery issues associated with disease-specific care primary care, acute care management, and care coordination. 2: Engage all relevant stakeholders (patients/caregivers, providers, SC2 partners) to begin building capacity for the conduct and assessment of targeted interventions to increase implementation readiness within three SC regions and partnering health systems and to further inform Phase II implementation strategies. 3: Initiate comparative effectiveness study using an interrupted time series, multi-sector, multi-modal design including specific implementation intervention strategies. iSCENSC will be the first multilevel, multicenter implementation science study in adolescents and adults with SCD aiming to achieve the outcome of a statewide SCD network. We propose the first large study of barriers inhibiting adoption and use of NHLBI SCD Guideline and of effectiveness of dissemination and implementation strategies in closing existing guideline-to-practice gaps and reducing longstanding disparities in SCD treatment, policy, and funding support of SCD care delivery. PROJECT NARRATIVE Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a significant health disparity in the United States because a lot of individuals are affected by it, there are few healthcare providers to offer people adequate services to people with SCD, and treatment options are limited, especially for children with SCD as they move into adulthood. The goal of iSCENSC is to find out how we can best make changes in healthcare systems, our communities, and in our policies in support of SC2 (Sickle Cell-South Carolina) a statewide network in South Carolina (SC) designed to have more people receive care that works for SCD throughout their lifetime and to decrease their chances of being sick or dying too early as a result of having SCD. This project will evaluate educational, training, telemedicine, and enhanced treatment options to improve the system of care for people living with SCD in South Carolina.",Implementation of a Sickle Cell Enhanced Novel Care Network in South Carolina (iSCENSC),9725777,U01HL133990,"['Academy ', ' Adoption ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Affect ', ' Sickle Cell Anemia ', ' sicklemia ', ' sickle disease ', ' sickle cell disease ', ' Hemoglobin sickle cell disorder ', ' Hemoglobin sickle cell disease ', ' Hemoglobin S Disease ', ' HbSS disease ', ' Hb SS disease ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' Consultations ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Foundations ', ' Genotype ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health workforce ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Health Personnel ', ' treatment access ', ' service availability ', ' health services availability ', ' health service access ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' accessibility to health services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Access to Care ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' Hospitals ', ' Institutes ', ' Interview ', ' longterm care ', ' extended care ', ' Long-Term Care ', ' Methods ', ' Patients ', ' Rhythmicity ', ' Cyclicity ', ' Periodicity ', ' Population Characteristics ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Primary Care ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Rural Population ', ' South Carolina ', ' Specialty ', ' medical specialties ', ' Stigmatization ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Technology ', ' Phone ', ' Telephone ', ' Time ', ' Transportation ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Care Givers ', ' Caregivers ', ' symposia ', ' summit ', ' convention ', ' conference ', ' symposium ', ' Managed Care ', ' Third-Party Payer ', ' Caring ', ' Custom ', ' Telemedicine ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' rural area ', ' rural region ', ' improved ', ' Acute ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Medical ', ' Series ', ' Adolescent ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Ensure ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Sickle Cell ', ' sickle red blood cell ', ' sickle erythrocyte ', ' sickle RBC ', ' Individual ', ' health care service utilization ', ' healthcare utilization ', ' healthcare service utilization ', ' healthcare service use ', ' health care service use ', ' Health Care Utilization ', ' Policies ', ' Funding ', ' Collaborations ', ' Vitelliform macular dystrophy ', ' best macular dystrophy ', ' Vitelliform MD ', "" Best's Disease "", ' Best Disease ', ' programs ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' Location ', ' meetings ', ' Services ', ' Needs Assessment ', ' care delivery ', ' novel ', ' member ', ' Code ', ' Coding System ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Quality of Care ', ' QOC ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' disease registry ', ' Provider ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Institution ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Preparedness ', ' Readiness ', ' low socioeconomic position ', ' low socio-economic status ', ' low socio-economic position ', ' low SES ', ' low socioeconomic status ', ' Health system ', ' Evidence based practice ', ' Data ', ' Effectiveness of Interventions ', ' Improve Access ', ' Interruption ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Update ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' informant ', ' National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute ', ' NHLBI ', ' web site ', ' website ', ' care systems ', ' care services ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' administrative database ', ' administrative data base ', ' Clinical and Translational Science Awards ', ' comparative effectiveness ', ' demographics ', ' implementation science ', ' multimodality ', ' multi-modality ', ' community based practice ', ' evidence base ', ' patient population ', ' standard of care ', ' Institutional Review Boards ', ' IRBs ', ' IRB ', ' Pediatric Hematologist ', ' Assessment tool ', ' Assessment instrument ', ' barrier to care ', ' obstacle to healthcare ', ' obstacle to care ', ' barrier to treatment ', ' barrier to healthcare ', ' barrier to health care ', ' care coordination ', ' coordinating care ', ' implementation strategy ', ' ']",NHLBI,MEDICAL UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA,U01,2019,715460,0.05605640321488857
"Implementation of Medical Homes for Evidence Based Care of Adolescents and Adults with Sickle Cell Disease PROJECT SUMMARY Life expectancy for patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) has increased from teens to late forties over the last 30 years. The increase in the number of adults with the disease has created new unmet needs, due to the heavy disease burden and organ damage which increase with age. This is confounded by the inability of the health care system to adequately meet the needs of this population, and thus has resulted in disparities and increase in health care costs. This project attempts to address these problems by creating medical homes and medical neighborhoods in four different settings throughout rural Georgia, which has the fourth largest population of patients with SCD in the country. This will be achieved by building on the GRU Sickle Cell Center's experience in taking care of SCD patients through its outreach clinics, and more recently through its partnership with primary care practices and Hematology/Oncology practices at different locations in the state. In the first two years of the project (Phase I) a needs assessment of patients, communities, and providers will be carried out and a Community Advisory Council will be established. The results of this needs assessment will be used to develop and implement interventions to establish medical homes and neighborhoods to improve evidence-based care for SCD patients in Phase II. PROJECT NARRATIVE Advances in the diagnosis and care of infants and children with sickle cell disease (SCD) has led to an increase in life expectancy of this population and an increase in the number of adults with the disease. Chronic organ damage associated with the natural history of the disease on one hand, and challenges imposed by the health care system (large number of uninsured/underinsured patients, stigmatization, paucity of adult providers with expertise in the care of SCD) on the other, have created unmet needs. This project, in response to RFA HL- 16010, builds on the 30-year experience of the GRU Sickle Cell Center in providing care to patients with SCD in rural Georgia through its extensive outreach clinics and proposes to address these unmet needs by the creation of patient-centered medical homes and neighborhoods in four diverse health care settings.",Implementation of Medical Homes for Evidence Based Care of Adolescents and Adults with Sickle Cell Disease,9725772,U01HL134004,"['Adoption ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Sickle Cell Anemia ', ' sicklemia ', ' sickle disease ', ' sickle cell disease ', ' Hemoglobin sickle cell disorder ', ' Hemoglobin sickle cell disease ', ' Hemoglobin S Disease ', ' HbSS disease ', ' Hb SS disease ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Communities ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Faculty ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Hematology ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' hydroxy-urea ', ' Hydroxycarbamide ', ' Hydroxycarbamid ', ' hydroxyurea ', ' newborn care ', ' infant healthcare ', ' infant health care ', ' baby care ', ' Infant Care ', ' Interview ', ' Life Expectancy ', ' Modernization ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' newborn screening ', ' Newborn Infant Screening ', ' Neonatal Screening ', ' Painful ', ' Pain ', ' Patients ', ' Penicillin Antibiotics ', ' Penicillins ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Primary Care ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Registries ', ' Research ', ' Stigmatization ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Universities ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' Underinsured ', ' Uninsured ', ' chronic pain ', ' Caring ', ' Guidelines ', ' Practice Guidelines ', ' base ', ' Organ ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Acute ', ' Chronic ', ' Phase ', ' Medical ', ' Adolescent ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Sickle Cell ', ' sickle red blood cell ', ' sickle erythrocyte ', ' sickle RBC ', ' Childhood ', ' pediatric ', ' Individual ', ' Rural ', ' Funding ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' oncology ', ' Oncology Cancer ', ' Letters ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' prophylactic ', ' Location ', ' Country ', ' interest ', ' Needs Assessment ', ' Medical center ', ' experience ', ' cohort ', ' disease natural history ', ' Participant ', ' member ', ' Benefits and Risks ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' disease registry ', ' education planning ', ' patient registry ', ' Provider ', ' Address ', ' Adherence ', ' Consent ', ' Data ', ' Clinical Management ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Teenagers ', ' teenage ', ' teen years ', ' Teen ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute ', ' NHLBI ', ' burden of illness ', ' years of life lost to disease ', ' years of life lost to disability ', ' disease burden ', ' burden of disease ', ' implementation research ', ' Underserved Population ', ' underserved people ', ' under served population ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' patient oriented ', ' patient centered ', ' eligible participant ', ' implementation science ', ' clinical care ', ' evidence base ', ' FDA approved ', ' patient population ', ' effective therapy ', ' effective treatment ', ' Emergency Department Physician ', ' Emergency room physician ', ' Emergency Physician ', ' ER physician ', ' ED Physician ', ' recruit ', ' care providers ', ' primary care provider ', ' health care settings ', ' healthcare settings ', ' outreach clinics ', ' practice setting ', ' treatment guidelines ', ' implementation strategy ', ' community involvement ', ' Acute pain management ', ' ']",NHLBI,AUGUSTA UNIVERSITY,U01,2019,923745,0.05937433704956774
"Northwestern Uterine Leiomyoma Research Center Uterine leiomyoma (LM, fibroids) are the most common tumor in women, disproportionately affect African- Americans, and cause irregular uterine bleeding and anemia, necessitating more than 200,000 hysterectomies annually in the US. Our long-term objective is to understand novel clinically relevant and medically targetable mechanisms responsible for the pathogenesis and growth of uterine LM in order to reduce associated morbidity. We propose and request funds to support the Northwestern Uterine Leiomyoma Research Center, comprising three highly coordinated and synergistic Research Projects, an Administrative Core and an Education and Outreach Core. Two mutually exclusive key driver somatic mutations (mut-) or rearrangements (-ra) affecting the MED12 and HMGA2 genes have been found in 85% of all LM, but the underlying mechanisms that cause tumorigenesis and tumor growth remain unknown. We propose to ascertain the effects of mut-MED12 and HMGA2-ra on epigenomic programming of LM cells, LM stem cell (LSC) function, development of heterogenic cell populations in these tumors, and genome-wide progesterone (P4) action. We will use cutting-edge in vivo models and high-throughput technologies to uncover novel mechanisms and identify genotype-specific therapeutic targets for developing precision medical treatments for LM. Project 1 (Bulun/Yin/Dai) will test the hypothesis that mut-MED12 alter genome-wide progesterone receptor (PR)- chromatin interaction signatures and associated histone modifications, thereby enhancing P4 action in the LM intermediate cell population (LICs), which provides a support niche for LSC survival and proliferation. Project 2 (Rajkovic) will test the hypothesis that distinct driver mutations affecting MED12 and HMGA2 determine cellular and molecular heterogeneity during LM tumorigenesis. Through cell fate tracing studies, we will determine whether mut-MED12 cells give rise to different cell populations in the myometrium that drive the formation of LM. Project 3 (Chakravarti/Wei) will test the hypothesis that overexpression of HMGA2 in LM alters 3D chromatin interactions and the epigenome to modify the development, progression, and therapeutic response of LM. As model systems, we will use LM tissues, antibody-sorted human LM cell populations and a human- equivalent mouse model of LM with mut-MED12 in uterine tissue. The Education and Outreach Core will support research activities performed within and across the Center by developing communication, outreach, and education strategies to promote health equity and eliminate disparities in LM, engaging the general public, students in the Chicago area, and the scientific and medical community. The Administrative Core will ensure that the Center achieves its aims and will synergize the individual Research Projects with the work of the Education-Outreach Core and other institutional cores; it will also solicit and coordinate the review of Pilot Projects. We anticipate that our synergistic approach will lead to the development of mutation- or epigenetic signature-selective therapeutic approaches to LM, moving the field into the realm of personalized medicine. PROJECT NARRATIVE Symptomatic uterine leiomyomas affect millions of US women and cause recurrent pregnancy loss, excessive and irregular uterine bleeding, and severe anemia leading to more than 200,000 hysterectomies per year.

"Multi-Tensor Decompositions for Personalized Cancer Diagnostics and Prognostics ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Recurring DNA copy-number alterations (CNAs) have been recognized as a hallmark of cancer for >100 years, yet what these alterations imply about a tumor's pathogenesis and a patient's diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment remains poorly understood. This is despite the growing number of large-scale multidimensional datasets recording different aspects of a single disease, e.g., in the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), and due to a fundamental need for mathematical frameworks that can create one coherent model from such multiple datasets arranged in multiple tensors of matched columns, e.g., patients, platforms, and tissues, but independent rows, e.g., probes.  For example, our recent comparative modeling (by using a data-driven two-matrix spectral decomposition) of patient-matched glioblastoma (GBM) brain tumor and normal blood genomic profiles from TCGA (arranged in two matrices, of matched columns but independent rows) uncovered a previously unknown global pattern of tumor-exclusive CNAs that is correlated with, and possibly causally related to, GBM survival and response to chemotherapy. The data had been publicly available since 2008, but this signature remained unknown until we applied our comparative modeling in 2012. Survival analyses showed, and computationally validated, that the signature performs better than, and is statistically independent of, age, the best indicator of GBM survival for >50 years, and existing GBM pathology laboratory tests. A new test for GBM based upon this signature is pending an experimental re-validation at the Associated Regional and University Pathologists (ARUP) Laboratories, Inc., a nonprofit reference laboratory of the Department of Pathology at the University of Utah.  In this NCI U01 project, our multidisciplinary team of researchers from the Departments of Bioengineering, Mathematics, and Pathology, the Scientific Computing and Imaging (SCI) Institute, and the Huntsman Cancer Institute (HCI) at the University of Utah, aims to (i) define, and study the properties of data- driven multi-tensor spectral decompositions; (ii) use these to model patient-, platform-, and tissue-matched but probe-independent TCGA genomic profiles, and gain biological and medical insights into the genotype- phenotype relations in lower-grade astrocytoma (LGA) brain cancer, ovarian serous cystadenocarcinoma (OV), and lung squamous cell carcinoma; and (iii) enable translation of these insights into pathology laboratory tests, by experimentally testing the computational predictions of the existing GBM model, as well as the novel LGA and OV models by using Utah samples.

"Combinatorial Actions of Genetic Variants and Gender Bias of Alzherimer's Disease PROJECT ABSTRACT Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is conventionally characterized by specific neuropathological features, including the appearance of extracellular amyloid deposits and the accumulation of intracellular neurofibrillary tangles. While several gene mutations are clearly associated with early onset Alzheimer’s disease, the large number of individuals exhibiting delayed onset, aging-associated AD, are likely to harbor many alterations in linked modifier genes that predispose to AD susceptibility. Genetic and genome wide association studies (GWAS) have identified numerous genes and risk alleles that indicate both cell autonomous and non-cell autonomous mechanisms contributing to loss of neurons and cognitive decline. In this regard, the majority of risk variants identified by GWAS reside in non-coding regions of the genome, implying that they act in part to alter gene expression. This proposal responds to the RFA indicating a particular need for approaches designed to delineate the transcriptional and cellular consequences of combinations of SNPs in the risk alleles by generating new cell line reagents to help unravel the question of the causative SNPs and their target genes in specific neurons derived from iPS cells of AD individuals. There are two features of sporadic AD that require molecular explanation- the potential role of aging in AD susceptibility, and the striking gender disparity, with the incidence of AD being exaggerated in females. These issues can only now be addressed based on new technologies and the availability of patient-derived samples. Our proposed research plan takes advantage of the invaluable samples stored at the brain bank of the Shiley-Marcos Alzheimer's Disease Research Center (ADRC) at UCSD, and the iPSC-derived neurons (Salk). This approach will interrogate the effects of different genetic variants with other risk factors (e.g. age, sex), and assess their effects on cell type-specific enhancer landscapes. By merging these data, we can begin to identify the potential causative SNPs that result in altered function of cell-type specific enhancers. We propose using a high throughput 4C screening approach (UMI-4C), and Hi-ChIP, to identify the most likely causative, enhancer-associated SNPs for functionally-implicated coding target genes. Exploiting the power of contemporary gene editing approaches in control or patient-derived iPS cells to specific neuronal cell types, and to astroglia, we can assess the transcriptional phenotypes and functional behaviors of neurons harboring different combinations of risk alleles, both in the isolated cell lines alone and in combination with coculture experiments with astroglia and microglia, as effects of these SNPs may be manifest only with astroglial:neuronal interactions. Together these studies will use powerful contemporary global genomic approaches to determine the coding transcriptional targets of several of the most significant SNPs in enhancers, and the link to roles of estrogen receptor in the gender disparity for AD.

"Calcium Channels, Calmodulin and Nuclear CREB Signaling ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Excitation-transcription (E-T) coupling is a process that converts the electrical or chemical activation of a cell to a signal conveyed to the nucleus. n this way, the expression of genes can be modulated in an activity-dependent manner. The neuronal remodeling that results is recognized to be necessary and important for long-term adaptive changes during neuronal development, learning and memory and drug addiction. The most scrutinized example of E-T coupling is Ca2+ signaling to the transcription factor CREB (cAMP response element-binding) protein via phosphorylation at Ser133. As an important source of Ca2+ influx, voltage-gated Ca2+ channels have been well studied for their biophysical and biochemical properties. Interestingly, in E-T coupling it seems that Ca2+ influxes through different Ca2+ channels can engage different signaling pathways to the nucleus. For example, CaV1 (also called L-type) channels enjoy a big advantage over CaV2 channels, even though CaV1 channels contribute only a minority of the overall Ca2+ entry in neurons. Our recent Cell paper uncovered that this disparity in potency can be explained by differences in how the two classes of Ca2+ channels employ local and global Ca2+ signaling. However, the 'private line' for the nanodomain advantage of CaV1 channels is unclear. Now we are poised to provide a detailed characterization of the critical question: what carries the long-distance signal from CaV1-anchored signaling complex to the nucleus? We have an answer: Ca2+/CaM translocation to the nucleus depends on a co-transporter that we now identify as γCaMKII. This shuttle gathers cytoplasmic Ca2+/CaM, sequestering it at the CaV1 channel before traveling to the nucleus under control of a nuclear localization signal. This signaling mechanism relies on γCaMKII, βCaMKII and CaN, signaling molecules that operate in the CaV1 nanodomain and also have been implicated in multiple neuropsychiatric diseases. This proposal focuses on understanding the cellular machinery of γCaMKII/CaM translocation and three specific aims are proposed. (1) Define the dynamics of Ca2+ signaling mechanisms that link CaV1 activity to nuclear CREB phosphorylation and CRE-dependent transcription. We will track γCaMKII translocation in real time and assess the impact of Ca2+/CaM delivered to the nucleus via this shuttle mechanism. (2) We will manipulate the γCaMKII pathway using genetic constructs in order to nail down the molecular components required for CREB phosphorylation. We will alter binding interactions and enzymatic actions involving CaM, βCaMKII, CaN, and PP2A at critical steps along the pathway. (3) Understand CaV1-dependent CaM shuttling in neocortical neurons and define distinct roles of nanodomain Ca2+ signaling and voltage gated conformational signaling for E-T coupling. Gaining a clearer picture of the linkage between CaV1 channels and CREB signaling will have a favorable impact on understanding how changes in gene expression alter the function of neurons in neural networks. Thus, the research is relevant both to basic cell biology and to disease states as diverse as addiction, autism and other neuropsychiatric diseases. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The ability to regulate gene expression in response to stimuli from the outside world is critical for the function of nearly all cell types in the body and plays  crucial role in regulating the function of neurons and their assembly into functional networks. This project studies the process by which excitation of neurons by membrane depolarization couples via opening of specific types of calcium channel and activation of cell signaling machinery to transcription of genes in the cell nucleus. Research on basic excitable cell biology will advance our understanding of how cells remodel themselves in health and in diseases such as addiction and autism.","Calcium Channels, Calmodulin and

"Pathogenesis of fungal infectious disease in the Hmong population PROJECT SUMMARY I will study the mechanisms that underlie a health disparity and vulnerability to systemic fungal disease in the Hmong population. People of Hmong descent are 10 to 100 times more likely than non-Asian peers to acquire blastomycosis (an infection due to Blastomcyes dermatitidis) despite having fewer behavioral risk factors or co- morbidities. Blastomycosis, like other invasive mycoses, produces severe illness in some racial and ethnic groups, prompting the idea that genetic polymorphisms govern susceptibility. None have been found and this represents a gap in knowledge. My lab sequenced the whole genomes of 5 Hmong blastomycosis patients involved in an epidemic in Wisconsin. We found 192 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) shared in the patients, rare in the European Super Population, and meeting additional criteria such as location in an annotated regulatory region. Notably, many of the SNPs are in or near the gene encoding IL-6 or other genes that nurture IL-17 immunity. IL-17 is important in controlling fungal infection, but also in development of autoimmunity.  I will test the hypothesis that SNPs in IL-6 and related genes underlie immune dysregulation in the Hmong patients. My first aim is to study how SNPs identified in the pilot cohort impact the regulation of IL-6. As pathology may arise from either weak or over-exuberant responses, any difference in the response between Hmong patients and controls may be significant. SNP(s) that account for the observed differences will be identified by genetically manipulating primary cells and reporter cells, then studying impact on function. Another goal of the first aim is to investigate the function of an unstudied long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) that overlaps the IL-6 gene; it is likely that this lncRNA regulates IL-6 production. I postulate that a SNP we identified in this lncRNA modifies its function and thus impacts IL-6 transcript and product. My second aim is to apply two unbiased, open-ended methods to probe the anti-fungal responses of circulating immune cells from Hmong blastomycosis patients and controls. In these studies, cells will be probed with defined ligands or yeast, and response will be measured by cytokine bead array and transcriptome analysis. These data will reveal if receptors or signaling pathways are functioning aberrantly. In addition to supporting mechanistic findings from Aim 1, these studies will help generate new hypotheses.  This proposal addresses a key gap in knowledge: the mechanism that underlies a documented health disparity. Similar work on tuberculosis has identified SNPs that predict response to treatment, which allows clinicians to tailor therapy to individual patients. My results will similarly facilitate precise medical decision-making. My findings may also have implications beyond the field of fungal immunology; other IL-17-mediated diseases include autoimmune disorders and cancer. I am excited to undertake this project, and know that the training I receive in pursuing my aims will prepare me for a fruitful career as a clinician-scientist in Infectious Disease. PROJECT NARRATIVE People of Asian, primarily Hmong, ancestry are known to have an in-born susceptibility to the dimorphic fungal disease blastomycosis. Our pilot data suggests that an aberration in the IL-6/IL-17 axis underlies this health disparity. I will characterize how variation in the immune response leads to pathology in the Hmong population. My findings may identify novel targets for precise medical treatment of disease related to dysregulation of the IL-17 response, which includes fungal infections, autoimmune diseases, and

"Targeting CRLF2 and Ikaros Alterations to Reduce Health Disparities in Childhood Leukemia SUMMARY  Hispanic children are more likely to develop acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL), and when this occurs they are 39% more likely to die than non-Hispanic Whites. This disparity is due, in part, to a subtype of B-cell precursor ALL (B-ALL) that occurs five times more frequently among Hispanic children than others and has a high relapse rate. This type of leukemia, called CRLF2 B-ALL, is characterized by two genetic alterations: a) overexpression of the cytokine receptor, CRLF2, and b) deletion or inactivation of one allele of the Ikaros (IKZF1) tumor suppressor which is strongly associated with relapse. Our overall hypothesis is that combination therapy that selectively targets the pathways that are deregulated in CRLF2 B-ALL (CRLF2 and Ikaros) will produce a superior therapeutic effect and decrease mortality to reduce the health disparity in survival for Hispanic children with ALL. When the CRLF2 receptor is activated by its ligand, TSLP, downstream pathways (JAK/STAT and PI3/AKT/mTOR) that promote leukemia cell survival, proliferation, and chemoresistance are induced through processes normally kept in check by the Ikaros tumor suppressor. Preliminary data from our team show that treatment with the CK2-specific inhibitor, CX-4945, restores Ikaros tumor suppressor function in high-risk B-ALL from Hispanic patients with deletion of one Ikaros allele, exerting a strong in vivo therapeutic effect. Preclinical studies of CRLF2 B-ALL typically use patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models, where primary leukemia cells from patients with CRLF2 B-ALL are injected into immune deficient mice. Our preliminary data show that mouse TSLP does not activate human CRLF2, making the current PDX models suboptimal for studies of CRLF2 B-ALL. To overcome this obstacle our team engineered immune deficient mice that provide normal human serum levels of human TSLP (+T mice) and generated PDX by injecting these mice with CRLF2 B-ALL cells from Hispanic pediatric patients (+T PDX). Analysis of +T PDX shows CRLF2 activation and gene expression that is more similar to original patient sample than standard PDX. Our preliminary data provide a rationale for novel therapy that targets pathways that are induced by CRLF2 (JAK-STAT5 and PI3K/AKT/mTOR) and by loss of Ikaros tumor suppressor activity using our newly- developed preclinical model for Hispanic CRLF2 B-ALL. To test our hypothesis we will: Aim 1: Establish the in vivo therapeutic efficacy of targeting CRLF2 downstream pathways and their role in CRLF2 B-ALL in Hispanic pediatric patients. Aim 2: Evaluate the in vivo efficacy and mechanisms of combination therapy that restores Ikaros tumor suppressor activity and inhibits the mTOR pathway in Hispanic pediatric CRLF2 B-ALL. The proposed studies use precision medicine approaches (targeting specific pathways and/or functional defects) in context of the health disparity background to develop a novel treatment for CRLF2 B-ALL and reduce childhood cancer health disparities. NARRATIVE   Hispanic children are more likely to develop acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) and when they do they have a 39% higher death rate than non-Hispanic Whites. A contributor to this disparity is a sub-type of high-risk ALL that occurs five times more frequently in Hispanic/Latino children than others.

"Pregnancy-induced T cell exhaustion: an opportunity to reduce immunosuppression PROJECT SUMMARY (ABSTRACT) Pregnancy is a common alloimmunizing event that impacts transplant access and outcomes among women. Although T cells of the maternal immune system are routinely activated by fetal alloantigen, it is unclear whether T cells stimulated by fetal antigen differentiate into canonical memory cells during pregnancy. The long-term fate and recall potential of these antigen-experienced T cells in the maternal repertoire are of particular importance to female transplant recipients, whose T cells may be capable of rapid rejection of a donor organ that shares tissue antigens with a prior pregnancy. Unfortunately, our poor understanding of T cell fate in women with a history of pregnancy has contributed to significant gender disparity in transplantation. Preliminary data in our mouse model suggest that fetal antigen during pregnancy promotes the differentiation of CD8+ T cells that persist in the maternal repertoire but have restricted functionality. While these T cells can still mediate rapid allograft rejection, they appear to be distinct from memory T cells that differentiate during other types of alloimmunization. Different populations of antigen-experienced T cells in alloimmunized transplant recipients may have unique requirements for immunosuppression. In this proposal, we will investigate how populations of antigen-experienced T cells induced by either pregnancy or transplantation differ from one another (Aim 1) and determine whether these differences promote immunosuppression reduction strategies in women (Aim 2). We anticipate that the knowledge generated by these studies will alter current immunosuppression strategies to improve the care of alloimmunized transplant recipients. PROJECT NARRATIVE The maternal immune system senses and responds to the fetus during pregnancy but does not appear to generate immunologic memory that negatively affects subsequent pregnancy. However, these “experienced” T cells may pose a threat to female organ transplant recipients later in life when the donor organ shares tissue antigens with a prior pregnancy. We propose to study the evolution and fate of immune responses during pregnancy in order to improve our understanding of T cell memory and improve the care of female organ transplant recipients.",Pregnancy-induced T cell exhaustion: an opportunity to reduce immunosuppression,9703883,K08AI130365,"['Alloantigen ', ' Antigens ', ' immunogen ', ' ATGN ', ' Differentiation Antigens ', ' Marker Antigens ', ' Differentiation Markers ', ' Differentation Markers ', ' B-Lymphocytes ', ' B-cell ', ' B-Cells ', ' B cells ', ' B cell ', ' B blood cells ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Nucleus ', ' Cell Nucleus ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cells ', ' sandimmune ', ' neoral ', ' SangCya ', ' Sandimmun ', ' Cyclosporine A ', ' Cyclosporin A ', ' CsA ', ' Ciclosporin ', ' Cyclosporine ', ' Cytoplasm ', ' Evolution ', ' Female ', ' Fetus ', ' Future ', ' Graft Survival ', ' allergic/immunologic organ system ', ' allergic/immunologic body system ', ' Immune system ', ' secondary immune response ', ' anamnestic reaction ', ' Immunological Memory ', ' Immune memory ', ' Immunologic Memory ', ' immunosuppression therapy ', ' artificial immunosuppression ', ' Immunosuppressive Therapy ', ' Antirejection Therapy ', ' Anti-Rejection Therapy ', ' Therapeutic immunosuppression ', ' immune suppression ', ' Immunosuppressive Effect ', ' Immunosuppression Effect ', ' Immunosuppression ', ' renal ', ' Kidney Urinary System ', ' Kidney ', ' kidney tx ', ' Renal Transplants ', ' Renal Transplantation ', ' Kidney Transplants ', ' Kidney Grafting ', ' Kidney Transplantation ', ' Laboratories ', ' Memory ', ' Murine ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Mice ', ' Mus ', ' Organ Donor ', ' organ xenograft ', ' organ graft ', ' organ allograft ', ' Organ Transplants ', ' Grafting Procedure ', ' Organ Transplantation ', ' Gestation ', ' Pregnancy ', ' Pregnancy Histories ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' thymus derived lymphocyte ', ' T-Cells ', ' T-Lymphocyte ', ' Testing ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Tissues ', ' Transcription factor genes ', ' Transcription Factor Proto-Oncogene ', ' General Transcription Factors ', ' General Transcription Factor Gene ', ' Basal transcription factor genes ', ' Basal Transcription Factor ', ' transcription factor ', ' Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' transplant ', ' Transplantation ', ' Woman ', ' Protein Phosphatase-2B ', ' PP2B ', ' Calcineurin ', ' Experimental Models ', ' Mediating ', ' Caring ', ' exhaust ', ' improved ', ' Predisposition ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Renal function ', ' kidney function ', ' insight ', ' CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes ', ' T8 Lymphocytes ', ' T8 Cells ', ' CD8-Positive Lymphocytes ', ' CD8+ T-Lymphocyte ', ' CD8+ T cell ', ' CD8 lymphocyte ', ' CD8 T cells ', ' CD8 Cell ', ' Functional disorder ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Physiopathology ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Immune response ', ' immunoresponse ', ' host response ', ' Immunological response ', ' embryo/fetus antigen ', ' fetal antigen ', ' Transplant Recipients ', ' transplant patient ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' exhaustion ', ' Adopted ', ' Immune ', ' Immunes ', ' Dependence ', ' Event ', ' Source ', ' fetal ', ' experience ', ' receptor ', ' Receptor Protein ', ' nephrotoxicity ', ' kidney toxicity ', ' Nephrotoxic ', ' T memory cell ', ' memory T lymphocyte ', ' response ', ' Alloimmunization ', ' T cell differentiation ', ' T-Cell Activation ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' CD28 gene ', ' T44 ', ' CD28 ', ' SLEB2 gene ', ' systemic lupus erythematosus susceptibility 2 ', ' sle2 ', ' programmed death 1 ', ' programmed cell death protein 1 ', ' programmed cell death 1 ', ' PD1 gene ', ' PD1 ', ' PD-1 ', ' PD 1 ', ' Dose ', ' Microchimerism ', ' Data ', ' Improve Access ', ' in vivo ', ' Nuclear Translocation ', ' Immunologics ', ' Immunologically ', ' Immunological ', ' Immunologic ', ' Immunochemical Immunologic ', ' Characteristics ', ' Calcineurin inhibitor ', ' Calcineurin antagonist ', ' pre-clinical ', ' preclinical ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Impairment ', ' mouse model ', ' murine model ', ' allograft rejection ', ' T cell response ', ' gender disparity ', ' negative affect ', ' negative affectivity ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' Adaptive Immune System ', ' Immunize ', ' chronic infection ', ' persistent infection ', ' ']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,K08,2019,196236,0.11470994915191224
"Immunotherapeutic Modalities for K-ras Mutant Lung Cancer: Sex- and Cell Type-Specific Roles of IL-6/STAT3 signaling Worldwide, lung cancer, particularly K-ras mutant lung cancer, is still the leading cause of cancer mortality because of a high incidence, and a low cure rate. Unfortunately, pharmacologic attempts directly targeting K- ras have thus far failed, clearly indicating that there is an urgent need for novel approaches to bring clinical benefits to patients with this undruggable molecular profile. We recently made an astonishing sex-specific discovery using a mouse model for K-ras-driven lung cancer (CC-LR). We found that deletion of STAT3 in K- ras mutant lung epithelial cells significantly inhibited lung cancer development in female mice but, surprisingly, caused a dramatic enhancement of lung tumorigenesis in male mice. This sex-dependent tumor disparity was accompanied by significant changes of NF-κB regulated target genes and inflammatory response in the lung tumor microenvironment which was regulated by estrogen receptor (ER) signaling. In humans, the risk and outcome of lung cancer are also vastly distinct between men and women, especially for smokers. However, the reason for this sex disparity is poorly understood and extremely underappreciated. It is known that estrogen could have anti-inflammatory effects. However, the interplay between estrogen/ER signaling, and STAT3/NF- κB mediated cytokine network in shaping the lung microenvironment and promotion of lung cancer is unknown. Our novel finding that the crosstalk between STAT3 and ER signaling is an essential regulator of NF-κB mediated cytokine response in K-ras mutant lung tumors provides us with a direct molecular insight into these sex differences. It will facilitate identification of the signaling pathways that lung cancer cells use to recruit and reprogram myeloid cells, thus providing new pathways to intercept for preventive and therapeutic purposes. Accordingly, our goals for this project are to determine the sex and cell type specific mechanistic roles of specific inflammatory signaling cues and functional preventive and therapeutic significance of targeting these inflammatory pathways in the pathogenesis of K-ras mutant lung cancer. Three specific aims are proposed to achieve these goals: (Aim 1) To dissect the sex-specific interplay between STAT3/NF-κB mediated cytokine network and estrogen receptor signaling in K-ras mutant lung tumorigenesis. (Aim 2) To investigate the chemopreventive and therapeutic effects of targeting the IL-6/STAT3 pathway in K-ras mutant lung cancer. (Aim 3) To analyze sex- and cell type-specific global expression programs downstream of mutant K-ras in lung cancer. We expect our study will elucidate sex- and cell-type specific mechanisms that will be fundamental in delineating targets for tailoring rationally directed sex-oriented personalized preventive and therapeutic strategies to overcome K-ras mutant lung tumors. It could also help us to improve the efficacy of currently available immunotherapy regimens, to develop a panel of unique and sex specific clinical predictive and prognostic biomarkers to identify responders and non-responders, and to explore mechanisms of susceptibility or resistance to therapy in these patients. This project will focus on dissecting the mechanisms responsible for lung cancer promotion by inflammatory signals in a sex-dependent manner. Unfortunately, despite being the leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide, our knowledge of the molecular mechanisms involved in lung cancer, especially in regards to sex differences and in the context of inflammation, is substantially deficient. By understanding the sex and cell-type specific molecular pathways through which inflammation promotes lung cancer, we aim to identify new and specific targets to tailor personalized preventive and therapeutic intervention.",Immunotherapeutic Modalities for K-ras Mutant Lung Cancer: Sex- and Cell Type-Specific Roles of IL-6/STAT3 signaling,9647432,R01CA225977,"['inhibitor ', '

"Cost effective nutritional therapy for managing sickle cell disease complications Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a group of widespread single-gene disorders and represents a significant public health burden worldwide. In the United States, most individuals with SCD are of African or Hispanic ancestry, groups often affected by healthcare disparities. Increased hemolysis of the fragile “sickle” shaped erythrocytes (red blood cells), is characteristic of SCD. These red cells are destroyed and continuously removed from the circulation. Associated with a resultant increase of red blood cell production are two energy consuming events, 1. faster protein synthesis and 2. increased protein catabolism. The increased protein metabolism results in abnormally high resting energy expenditure (REE). This evidence suggests that patients with SCD require more dietary protein and energy than individuals without the disease. However, to date the use of nutritional supplementation for addressing these complications, is not adequately researched, and there are no recommended dietary allowances for SCD. We have successfully conducted a pilot randomized placebo- controlled supplementation trial in children with sickle cell anemia (SCA, who inherit two S alleles), aged 6 to 12 years. We used a nutritional formula designed to replace established nutrient shortages (including calorie consumption and essential amino acids with anti-inflammatory effects). The results show that plasma amino acid levels increased (e.g., L-Arginine by ~38%), lean body mass improved by 11%, bone mineral content by 14% and bone mineral density by 6%. REE was reduced by 18%. Based on these findings, we hypothesize that dietary protein and energy supplements will provide the extra nutrients known to be deficient in individuals with SCA. These supplements will promote tissue repair and lean body mass accretion, and improve the clinical condition of individuals with SCA. The aims of this proposal are to 1a) conduct a larger clinical trial to validate the effect of the nutritional supplement and its use for normalizing body mass, REE, protein metabolism and inflammation, over six months, in children with SCD and 1b) Conduct a robust compliance assessment intervention as a vital part of the study. New innovative therapies are needed to treat SCD. A cost-effective self-administered non-toxic nutritional treatment should be made available. This dietary approach could complement the standard patient care and therefore address both nutritional and hematological issues in tandem. Nutritional intervention (food supplementation) is virtually non-toxic and, early implementation could prevent characteristic under-nutrition in individuals with SCD, who can be at risk even prenatally. Sickle cell anemia (SCA) affects more than 100,000 people in the United States and represents a significant public health burden worldwide. Sickle cell patients have nutritional complications such as growth delay, short height and extremely reduced muscle mass, which are not being adequately treated. This application proposes to use a targeted dietary supplement, which, if successful, will reduce the nutritional issues that contribute to frequent ill health and substantial hospitalization costs in this patient population.",Cost effective nutritional therapy for managing sickle cell disease complications,9846147,R43HL149489,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Alleles ', ' Allelomorphs ', ' Amino Acids ', ' aminoacid ', ' Essential Amino Acids ', ' essential aminoacid ', ' Sickle Cell Anemia ', ' sicklemia ', ' sickle disease ', ' sickle cell disease ', ' Hemoglobin sickle cell disorder ', ' Hemoglobin sickle cell disease ', ' Hemoglobin S Disease ', ' HbSS disease ', ' Hb SS disease ', ' Arginine ', ' L-Arginine ', ' Blood Circulation ', ' Circulation ', ' Bloodstream ', ' Bone Density ', ' Bone Mineral Density ', ' Bone Mineral Contents ', ' C-reactive protein ', ' Proteins, specific or class, C-reactive ', ' Energy Intake ', ' caloric dietary content ', ' Caloric Intake ', ' Carrying Capacities ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Complement ', ' Controlled Clinical Trials ', ' dietary ', ' Diet ', ' Dietary Proteins ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Energy Expenditure ', ' Energy Metabolism ', ' blood corpuscles ', ' Red Cell ', ' Red Blood Cells ', ' Marrow erythrocyte ', ' Erythrocytic ', ' Blood erythrocyte ', ' Erythrocytes ', ' erythroid development ', ' Erythropoiesis ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Patient Care ', ' Q.

"Enhancing the Immune System by Targeting the RAS Signaling Pathway in Cancer: Immunotherapeutic Potential of a Novel RAS Inhibitor for lung cancer treatment. ABSTRACT  The Diversity Research Supplement Program to Promote Diversity in Health-Related Research from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Center to Reduce Cancer Health Disparities (CRCHD) provides a great career development opportunity to Dr. Antonio Bartholomew Ward, an African-American cancer researcher holding a full-time faculty position as a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at the University of South Alabama Mitchell Cancer Institute (USA-MCI) to continue his academic career and develop his pathway as an independent investigator. He is applying for this supplement based on the parent grant entitled “Phosphodiesterase 10A, a Novel Target for Lung Cancer Chemoprevention (1R01CA197147)”, awarded to Dr. Gary Piazza, Professor of Oncologic Sciences and Chief of the Drug Discovery Research Center at MCI.  The parent grant proposes studies to chemically modify sulindac to block cyclooxygenase (COX) binding to eliminate related gastrointestinal, renal and cardiovascular side-effects, while increasing potency and selectivity to inhibit lung tumor cell growth by inhibiting cyclic guanosine monophosphate phosphodiesterases (cGMP PDEs) enzymes. Specifically, the PDE 10 isozyme was found to be elevated in lung tumor cells and essential for lung tumor cell growth and survival. His team has also explored the molecular mechanism driving the apoptosis of lung tumor cells induced by sulindac derivatives that involves the activation of cGMP-dependent protein kinase G signaling and suppression of oncogenic β-catenin/Tcf- mediated transcriptional activity to inhibit cell cycle regulatory proteins, such as cyclin D1, c-myc, and survivin.  For this supplement application Dr. Ward proposes a recently discovered mechanism responsible for the anti-cancer activity of sulindac derivatives, specifically with compound MCI-062, based on his preliminary data showing compound selectivity for inhibiting the growth of colon and lung cancer cells harboring the oncogenic mutant form of the rat sarcoma viral oncogene (RAS), specifically KRAS, and on recent literature linking mutant KRAS to an increased expression of the immune checkpoint inhibitor protein programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1) on the surface of cancer cells thereby promoting increased cancer cell immunity. He hypothesizes that by inhibiting RAS-RAS effector binding and RAS cell signaling, PD-L1 protein levels will also be decreased, thereby increasing anti-cancer immunity. Dr. Ward will investigate if MCI-062 effects are mediated by RAS inhibition and a decrease in PD-L1 protein levels, leading to an increase in T-lymphocyte (T- cell) tumor infiltration, proliferation, and activation, and determine the mechanism of action responsible for anti- cancer immunity effects using 2D and 3D RAS-driven non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) models.  In conclusion, this research will validate a novel RAS inhibitor, MCI-062, for targeted therapeutic use in NSCLC by its effect on RAS regulated cancer cell immunity and increase the need for small molecule targeted immunotherapeutic approaches for difficult to treat RAS-driven cancers. PROJECT NARRATIVE  This research proposal for a supplement application to the parent grant, 1R01CA197147 (P.I. Gary Piazza, Ph.D.) will study a novel molecular mechanism for non-cyclooxygenase inhibitory derivatives of sulindac to exert their anti-tumor and anti-cancer cell immunity activity by inhibiting RAS and decreasing PD-L1 protein levels thereby increasing T-cell proliferation, activation, and infiltration to tumor sites in lung tumor cells harboring oncogenic mutations in the KRAS gene. NSCLCs that harbor RAS mutations are associated with poor prognosis and survival in humans, therefore applying small molecule targeted therapy against cancer oncogenes such as RAS in order to weaken cancer cell immunity and enhance the body’s own natural immune response to combat cancer is indeed a novel approach worth investigating. This supplement will expand Dr. Ward’s career development in cancer research and will establish his path to become an independent investigator towards a tenure-track faculty position.",Enhancing the

"Genetic Studies of Blood Cell Traits in Multi-Ethnic Cohorts ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Blood cell traits, including hemoglobin level, red blood cell (RBC), white blood cell (WBC), and platelet counts, are important intermediate clinical phenotypes for a variety of cardiovascular, hematologic, oncologic, immunologic and infectious disease. The distributions of these traits differ considerably across ethnicities. For example, further insight into the genetic determinants of ""ethnic neutropenia"" in African Americans (AA) may have implications for health disparities in risk of HIV infection, sickle cell disease severity or mobilization of neutrophils or hematopoietic stem cells in cancer patients. Our preliminary data similarly suggest important differences in the distribution of blood cell traits in Hispanics compared to non-Hispanic whites. Therefore, the proposed studies are likely to have direct clinical impact by providing new avenues for treatment, particularly for minority patients with low blood counts (Personalized Medicine), and illuminating new mechanisms by which genetic factors related to ethnic differences in blood cell counts contribute to U.S. health disparities fo risk of chronic inflammatory and thrombotic diseases.  Despite the importance of genetic factors in explaining variation in blood cell traits, there remains a huge gap in our knowledge of the contribution of specific loci to these traits among U.S. minorities. Coincidentally, multiethnic GWAS has been recognized as more powerful for gene mapping by the genetics community. However, there are very few sequencing-aided GWAS for blood cell traits in ancestrally diverse populations, and none in Hispanics/Latinos (HLs). Consequently, innovative methods are needed to study blood cell traits in multiethnic cohorts, particularly those recently admixed such as AA and HL, which have been under- represented in prior GWAS. The first attempts to map genes for blood cell traits in AA did not incorporate sequence based African specific content into the imputation, were limited in sample size, and did not accounted for local ancestry, mainly due to the lack of available methods and resources. Importantly, no GWAS have been conducted in HL for blood cell traits. For the proposed studies, our team has now assembled a new, larger collection of AA (n~34K), HL (n~26K) and Europeans (EU) (n~30K), and will leverage our recent methodological advances in imputation, local ancestry inference, and association analysis to increase our knowledge of blood cell trait genetics.  We propose the following Aims. Aim 1. Map genes for blood cell traits in AA (n~34K) accounting for local ancestry. Aim 2. Conduct the first sequencing-aided GWAS of blood cell traits in HL (n~26K) accounting for 3- way local ancestry. Aim 3. Meta-analyze across multi-ethnic datasets, annotate and validate novel association signals. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Blood cell traits, including red blood cell count (RBC), hemoglobin, white blood cell count (WBC) and platelet count, are important intermediate clinical phenotypes for a variety of cardiovascular, hematologic, oncogenic, immunologic and infectious diseases. However, there are very few sequencing-aided GWASs for blood cell traits in ancestrally diverse populations, and none in Hispanics/Latinos. We will study genetic mechanisms underlying blood cell traits in multi-ethnic cohorts, in particular admixed, under-represented U.S. minority populations such as African Americans and

"Bi-directional interactions with tumor microenvironment enhance BRCA1-IRIS overexpressing TNBC tumor cells aggressiveness ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Bi-directional interactions with tumor microenvironment enhance BRCA1-IRIS overexpressing TNBC tumor cells aggressiveness. TNBC is an aggressive breast cancer lacks ER/PR expression and Her2 amplification, therefore lacks targeted therapy. TNBC is over-represented in African American women, the majority live in Mississippi. TNBC is an aggressive rapidly advanced disease that metastasizes to lung, liver, and brain. BRCA1-IRIS is upregulated in the majority of TNBC. BRCA1-IRIS overexpression (hereafter IRISOE) promotes formation and metastasis of TNBC tumors, and its silencing prevents both. The objective of this study is to identify the molecular mechanism(s) responsible for enhanced metastasis by IRISOE. Our central hypothesis is that due to massive proliferation triggered by IRISOE, IRISOE tumors become avascular and necrotic in their cores. Hypoxia developed in areas surrounding these necrotic cores (we refer to this necrotic/hypoxic core as the aggressiveness niche) aggravates IRISOE tumor cells metastatic ability. Our data show that in the niche, hypoxia triggers IRISOE/TNBC tumor cells to secrete IL-6 and that induces IL-6R expression on MSCs. This signaling loop attracts MSCs to the vicinity of IRISOE/TNBC tumor cells and activates them to secrete PGE2. PGE2 binds to IRISOE/TNBC tumor cells through EP2/4 re-activates IRISOE/TNBC tumor cells to secrete other cytokines, e.g., GM-CSF and VEGF. GM-CSF is a potent recruiter of monocytes and VEGF of endothelial cells (EC). GM-CSF binding to CSF-2R on tumor associated macrophages (TAMs) and VEGF binding to VEGFR on ECs recruit them to the vicinity of IRISOE/TNBC tumor cells and activates them to secret factors, such as TGF-1ß from TAMs and IL8 from ECs. TGF-1ß binding to TßRI/II and IL8 to CXCR1/2 on IRISOE/TNBC tumor cells, in addition to PGE2/EP2/4 enhance IRISOE/TNBC cells aggressiveness and their dissemination and metastatic potential. In Specific Aim One, we will validate the bidirectional interactions between IRISOE/TNBC tumor cells and MSCs promoting IRISOE/TNBC tumor cells aggressiveness. In Specific Aim Two, we will validate the bidirectional interactions between IRISOE/TNBC tumor cells and M2- TAMs promoting IRISOE/TNBC tumor cells aggressiveness. Finally in Specific Aim Three, we will validate the bidirectional interactions between IRISOE/TNBC tumor cells and ECs role promoting IRISOE/TNBC tumor cells aggressiveness. The proposed studies are in line with the aims of the NIH of generating better understanding of the mechanisms that drive breast cancer progression and produce validated biomarkers for early detection and therapeutic targets. We believe our grant fulfills all these criteria and provide a compelling therapeutic rationale for th development of anti-BRCA1-IRIS drug to specifically target TNBC tumor cells in patients with high risk of recurrence and poor prognosis. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Most early breast tumors are estrogen receptor positive, sensitive to chemo- endocrine treatment. The majority of these tumors progress to a more aggressive tumors that are chemo- endocrine resistance, and often develop into distant metastases. Both resistance to anticancer drugs and poor prognosis may result from the presence of reactive stromal cells within these tumors that reciprocally interact with tumor cells and promote their progress to metastatic cells.

"Onset and biomarkers for progression of monoclonal gammopathies PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Multiple myeloma (MM) is a life-threatening plasma cell malignancy. It is 2-3 times more common in blacks compared with whites. MM has a prolonged clinically detectable premalignant phase called monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) that can be identified by detection of the secreted monoclonal immunoglobulin (commonly referred to as a monoclonal protein). MM is a serious incurable malignancy, and the best approach for treatment is to prevent end organ damage by early intervention. This is best done by targeting patients with an intermediate asymptomatic stage referred to as smoldering multiple myeloma (SMM) that resides between MGUS and MM. Over the last 5 years of this grant we have extensively investigated the reasons why MM is more common in blacks compared with whites, demonstrated that first- degree relatives of patients with MM have a high risk of having the precursor MGUS lesion, and identified several biomarkers that predict risk of imminent progression in SMM. Our studies show that a principal reason for high risk of MM in African Americans is that they have a high risk of the precursor MGUS condition, which we also found is present at a much earlier in age in blacks compared with whites. More recently we made an important discovery using DNA sequencing based ancestry analysis that 3 specific cytogenetic abnormalities in MM account for most of the racial disparity. Our research has assumed greater urgency with recent findings that early intervention (in high-risk SMM stage) can prevent end-organ damage and prolong overall survival. The goals of this renewal are to further determine the mechanisms behind the racial disparity in incidence of MM, to identify new biomarkers for high risk SMM needing therapy, and to develop a feasible screening strategy to identify patients with SMM. In Aim 1 we will determine the age at onset of MGUS using sensitive, mass spectrometry (MS)-based detection of monoclonal protein in >12,000 NHANES samples, and identify new cytogenetic abnormalities that are associated with predisposition to MM in blacks. In Aim 2 we will identify new biomarkers that are associated with high risk of progression from SMM to symptomatic MM, specifically utilizing mass spectroscopic characterization of the monoclonal protein, measurement of circulating clonal plasma cells, and by studying clonal diversity and immune profile. In Aim 3, we will institute and determine the feasibility and impact of a screening approach for identification of SMM eligible for early intervention, by targeting high risk populations, specifically African Americans, first-degree relatives, and persons with high total protein levels. Our grant will have a major impact on the management of patients with SMM and MM, especially African Americans and first-degree relatives or persons with MM. PROJECT NARRATIVE Multiple myeloma (MM) is a life-threatening plasma cell malignancy that is 2-3 times more common in African Americans, and is preceded by an asymptomatic stage called smoldering multiple myeloma (SMM) amenable to early therapy.

"Understanding Sex Disparities in Gliomas Through Sex Differences in Mitochondrial Activity Program Director/Principal Investigator (Last, First, Middle): Ippolito, Joseph Edward PROJECT SUMMARY  There is a sex disparity seen in cancers throughout the body where males have both a higher incidence and a higher mortality than females. This is not only true for adults, but is also seen in children as well, suggesting that factors other than the effects of sex hormones may be playing a role in this phenomenon. This is especially true for glioblastomas (GBM) that comprise over 50% of brain tumors and are characterized by resistance to therapies and a dismal prognosis (median survival - 15 months). Because enhanced nutrient consumption and metabolism are critical to enhanced tumorigenesis and its effect on poor patient outcomes, our group investigates the presence of sex differences in cancer metabolism that may be driving the sex disparities that are observed in many cancers. We have uncovered laboratory and clinical evidence demonstrating that male brain tumors have enhanced nutrient uptake and metabolism (specifically sugars and amino acids) compared to female tumors. We have further identified that the largest sex differences in cancer metabolism come from the mitochondria, the part of the cell that is the critical for generating energy and biosynthetic building blocks for the cell for growth. Because metabolism is not only restricted to the tumor, but involves the entire patient, we have investigated the effects of sex differences in nutrition and obesity in cancer patient survival. We have discovered that women with “male-pattern” increased visceral abdominal obesity selectively do much worse compared to all other patients in multiple cancers. These findings suggest that the sex differences that we see in cancers may not only be related to tumor mitochondria, but nutrition and its overall metabolic health of the individual. In this proposal, we will develop new animal models to test the hypothesis that sex differences in mitochondrial activity underlie sex differences in tumor development. Our long term goal is to understand the metabolic basis of sex disparities in cancer patients through a combination of tumor and host metabolism. In the first aim of this proposal, we will use an established model (Nf1-/-/DNp53) for sex differences in GBM and deplete mitochondria in the cancer cells to test for sex differences in cancer cell phenotype and metabolism. In the second aim, we will determine the effects of obesogenic diets on sex differences in brain tumor mitochondrial activity and growth. This research proposal is innovative because it opens up a new paradigm in the oncology field that investigates sex-specific differences in cancer and host metabolism. This proposal will generate new insights into the mechanism behind sex differences in mitochondrial activity and the impact of nutrition on sex differences in the malignant phenotype. We are beginning to develop a platform for novel readily-translatable imaging methods and therapeutic approaches that treat not only brain tumors, but multiple malignancies.

"Vascular cell sexual dimorphism in complex mechanical microenvironments The sex disparity in the incidence and progression of cardiovascular disease (CVD), including peripheral arterial disease (PAD), is a troubling clinical observation. It is well known that CVD manifests differently in men and women, with more women than men suffering from the disease. Further, within the vascular network, there are mechanical microenvironments that favor CVD development, for example, atherosclerotic plaques preferentially form at regions of disturbed flow and low fluid shear stresses such as, vasculature bifurcations. Yet, no reports have correlated these two separate observations at the cellular level, specifically, the sex differences in CVD and local vascular mechanics. This project aims to 1) assess the functional changes in male and female human umbilical vein endothelial cells in response to combined physiological fluid shear stresses and substrate stiffness by morphometric, secretory, and genetic analyses, 2) assess the functional changes in male and female human aortic smooth muscle cells in response to combined physiological cyclic stretching and substrate stiffness by morphometric, mechanical, and genetic analyses, and 3) correlate the disparate functional response of male and female vascular cells using statistical methods. Upon completion of these aims, a foundational understanding of vascular cell functionality in vitro as it pertains to sexual dimorphism in complex mechanical microenvironments will be gained. A factorial design of experiments will be used to systematically assess the influence of cell sex, laminar fluid shear stress or cyclic stretch, and the underlying substrate stiffness. The effects of the mechanical microenvironment will be assessed using well-defined flow and stretch bioreactors with RGD-conjugated polyacrylamide gel substrates. Cell morphology will be quantified by immunofluorescence microscopy methods. Glycocalyx, vasoregulatory, and estradiol secretory products will be quantified by commercial assays. Cellular mechanical properties will be measured by atomic force microscopy. The regulation of a large set of vascular cell genes including a subset related to CVD will be measured by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. Statistical analyses will be performed to relate gene expression results to morphological, secretory, and mechanical responses and then to correlate them to a given sex and mechanical force combination. This work follows the 2015 NIH mandate to consider sex as a biological variable by investigating the clinical observations of the sex disparity in cardiovascular disease at the cellular level. The significance for this work is that future imaging modalities that quantify vascular forces such as with 4D MRI, will be able to indicate areas within the vasculature that are susceptible to localized cellular dysfunction using correlative statistical models and ultimately predict a patient's location-specific vulnerability for disease. This proposal is part of a predoctoral training fellowship at the University of Florida. The trainee will learn to conduct the experiments proposed and to grow professionally from the guidance of a comprehensive mentoring team of clinicians, cell and molecular biologists, computational theorists, and material scientists. Our research aims to uncover why men and women develop different symptoms and outcomes of cardiovascular disease. Specifically, we want to understand the role sex plays in how blood flow and blood vessel properties influence vascular cellular function. Using specialized bioreactor devices, we will expose both male and female vascular cells to varying combinations of fluid shear stresses, stretching, and substrate stiffness and observe the changes

"Molecular mechanisms of estrogen receptor alpha modulating the inflammatory response in systematic lupus erythematosus ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Ninety percent of those diagnosed with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) are women, with peak incidence between the ages of 15 and 45, when women are most hormonally active. Despite significant research effort, the mechanisms underlying this sex bias remain unclear. Our laboratory previously backcrossed estrogen receptor alpha knockout (ERαKO) mice onto the NZM2410 lupus prone background. We demonstrated that female NZM/ERαKO mice had significantly less renal disease and significantly prolonged survival compared to WT littermates despite similar serum autoantibodies and glomerular immune complex deposition. ERαKO mice are not ERα null, but rather express an N-terminally truncated ERα. They have physiologic deficiencies including infertility due to disruption of a critical activation domain (AF-1). We showed that dendritic cell (DCs) from NZM/ERαKO mice have a blunted inflammatory response to Toll-like receptor (TLR) ligands. When these mice were ovariectomized, the protective phenotype was lost. Upon estradiol-repletion, protection was restored. True ERα null mice are not protected, suggesting that estrogen in the presence of the AF-1 mutant confers protection, rather than the absence of the full-length ERα66. Interestingly, the truncated ERα expressed in the ERαKO animal is structurally similar to ERα46, an endogenous ERα splice variant that lacks the AF-1 domain, and is a negative regulator of gene transcription. ERα46 has an identical DNA binding domain to ERα66 and is a powerful inhibitor of ERα66. We hypothesize that ERα46 expression has a protective effect in lupus. The goal of this project is to determine the role of ERα46 in SLE and TLR-induced inflammation and to improve our understanding of ERα-mediated transcription in the setting of inflammation. In order to accomplish this, Dr. Cunningham will (1) Define the in vitro molecular mechanisms underlying ERα46- and ERα66-regulated transcriptional activity impacting the innate inflammatory response of murine DCs, (2) Determine ex vivo and in vivo the role of ERα46 in TLR-induced lupus utilizing a murine strain expressing an A/B truncation mutant of ERα (ERαAF10), and (3) Use human peripheral blood monocyte (PBMC)-derived DCs to define the role of ERα46 and ERα66 in regulation of the innate immune response in DCs from controls vs. lupus patients. Dr. Cunningham is a clinician-investigator with a long-term career goal of becoming an independent basic and translational researcher in the field of immunology with a focus on SLE. To facilitate her transition to independence, she seeks to further her training in dendritic cell biology, ChIPseq and bioinformatics, and the use of human cells from patient samples. Dr. Cunningham has a mentorship team with an outstanding mentoring track record and wide expertise to support her project. The studies proposed in this K08 mentored grant application will significantly advance the field by providing understanding of ERα-mediated transcription in the setting of TLR-induced inflammation, including ERα binding partners, gene targets, and modulation by ERα46, which represents a potential therapeutic agent.           PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project is highly relevant to public health because females have a higher prevalence and significantly increased risk of autoimmune diseases such as lupus.

"Novel pro-drug pharmacotherapy to prevent neuronal and cell degeneration in AMD PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Degeneration or acute damage of retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) and nerve cells in the retina due to Age-related Macular Degeneration (AMD) is a major cause of visual loss and blindness in the United States and worldwide. The proposed multidisciplinary research project will focus on the characterization of a novel signaling pathway for and the development of a novel pharmacological intervention to control degeneration of RPE cells and neurons in AMD. To this end, preclinical testing of the new therapeutic strategy will be performed, along with ocular biotransformation, transport and distribution studies, in established models of human AMD. These experiments will determine efficacy of treatment in terminating and/or preventing AMD associated neuronal loss and preservation of visual function, and to generate data to support feasibility for and move positive findings to phase 1 and 2 clinical trials. Specifically, we will test the two-pronged hypothesis that treatment based on the ocular targeting of a novel chemical antioxidant strategy protects RPE cells and neurons from apoptosis by topical delivery in established models of human AMD and, therefore, leads to prevention or improvement of visual impairment and functional deficits associated with AMD. The determination of neuronal viability and the acquired knowledge on associated biopharmaceutical and pharmacological parameters will indicate the potential of the method to remedy AMD as the overall goal of the project. This novel approach for therapy development in AMD focuses on complementary and alternative cellular protection and neuroprotection. The innovative strategy has the potential to generate a first-in-class pharmacotherapy approach for dry AMD using a topical rather than a systemic or invasive route of drug delivery. The strategy’s potentially high impact lies in its capacity to be both preventative and therapeutic in nature and to complement existing treatment designs and rationales addressing other aspects of AMD treatment such as those targeting neovascularization. Project Narrative Degeneration or acute damage of retinal pigment epithelial cells and nerve cells in the retina due to Age-related Macular Degeneration (AMD) is a major cause of visual loss and blindness in the United States and worldwide. The determination of the function and effectiveness of new drugs as proposed in the present application has the potential to produce a therapy approach for AMD that focuses on the retinal pigment epithelial cells and nerve cells of the retina and that has the potential to be both preventative and therapeutic in nature for the dry form of the disease and to complement existing treatment designs and rationales addressing other aspects of AMD such as the wet form of the disease. As AMD affects significant and increasing portions of the U.S. population including minorities affected by disparities in health care delivery, determining causes, mechanisms of action and subsequently potential treatment strategies will contribute to improving health care, health and performance requiring visual tasks.",Novel pro-drug pharmacotherapy to prevent neuronal and cell

"Molecular mechanisms of estrogen receptor alpha modulating the inflammatory response in systematic lupus erythematosus ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Ninety percent of those diagnosed with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) are women, with peak incidence between the ages of 15 and 45, when women are most hormonally active. Despite significant research effort, the mechanisms underlying this sex bias remain unclear. Our laboratory previously backcrossed estrogen receptor alpha knockout (ERαKO) mice onto the NZM2410 lupus prone background. We demonstrated that female NZM/ERαKO mice had significantly less renal disease and significantly prolonged survival compared to WT littermates despite similar serum autoantibodies and glomerular immune complex deposition. ERαKO mice are not ERα null, but rather express an N-terminally truncated ERα. They have physiologic deficiencies including infertility due to disruption of a critical activation domain (AF-1). We showed that dendritic cell (DCs) from NZM/ERαKO mice have a blunted inflammatory response to Toll-like receptor (TLR) ligands. When these mice were ovariectomized, the protective phenotype was lost. Upon estradiol-repletion, protection was restored. True ERα null mice are not protected, suggesting that estrogen in the presence of the AF-1 mutant confers protection, rather than the absence of the full-length ERα66. Interestingly, the truncated ERα expressed in the ERαKO animal is structurally similar to ERα46, an endogenous ERα splice variant that lacks the AF-1 domain, and is a negative regulator of gene transcription. ERα46 has an identical DNA binding domain to ERα66 and is a powerful inhibitor of ERα66. We hypothesize that ERα46 expression has a protective effect in lupus. The goal of this project is to determine the role of ERα46 in SLE and TLR-induced inflammation and to improve our understanding of ERα-mediated transcription in the setting of inflammation. In order to accomplish this, Dr. Cunningham will (1) Define the in vitro molecular mechanisms underlying ERα46- and ERα66-regulated transcriptional activity impacting the innate inflammatory response of murine DCs, (2) Determine ex vivo and in vivo the role of ERα46 in TLR-induced lupus utilizing a murine strain expressing an A/B truncation mutant of ERα (ERαAF10), and (3) Use human peripheral blood monocyte (PBMC)-derived DCs to define the role of ERα46 and ERα66 in regulation of the innate immune response in DCs from controls vs. lupus patients. Dr. Cunningham is a clinician-investigator with a long-term career goal of becoming an independent basic and translational researcher in the field of immunology with a focus on SLE. To facilitate her transition to independence, she seeks to further her training in dendritic cell biology, ChIPseq and bioinformatics, and the use of human cells from patient samples. Dr. Cunningham has a mentorship team with an outstanding mentoring track record and wide expertise to support her project. The studies proposed in this K08 mentored grant application will significantly advance the field by providing understanding of ERα-mediated transcription in the setting of TLR-induced inflammation, including ERα binding partners, gene targets, and modulation by ERα46, which represents a potential therapeutic agent. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project is highly relevant to public health because females have a higher prevalence and significantly increased risk of autoimmune diseases such as lupus. The reasons for this health disparity remain unclear. This study will elucidate the mechanisms of estrogen receptor alpha (ERα) in modulating inflammation, with specific attention to dendritic cells and Toll-like receptor-induced inflammation, which are dysregulated in lupus patients.

"Asymmetric Lymphocyte Division in the Immune Response DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): B lymphocytes and the antibodies they produce play a critical role in host defense. Cell fate diversification of activated lymphocytes is essential to achieve the regenerative state required for long-lived immunity. The mechanisms responsible for generating B cell fate diversity, however, are poorly understood. Substantial preliminary data suggest B cells can diversify the fates and functions of their daughter cells using an evolutionarily conserved strategy to allocate unequal amounts of key components. This project will test whether asymmetric cell division is a cardinal feature of the B cell- mediated immune response. The proposal develops novel methodologies to image the characteristics of dividing B cells during the course of an immune response. The aims of the project are to test the importance of unequal cellular inheritance of three different transcriptional regulators of B cells Bcl-6, Pax5, and T-bet, each of which is known to regulate critical cell fate decisions. The experiments will test the hypotheses that asymmetric division is iteratively used to meet the opposing demands of terminal differentiation and self-renewal, as well to refine and diversify the functional properties of antibodies by regulating germinal center entry and class switch choice. This project will also examine whether ancestral regulators of cell polarity are responsible for establishing asymmetric B cell division, and how asymmetrically inherited proteins could mediate fate disparity in daughter B cells. These studies should provide a framework for rational engineering of immune responses and vaccines against microbial agents. This project should also address fundamental uncertainties regarding the principle of clonal selection of lymphocytes in response to infectious diseases or during situations when our immune cells attack our own selves. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: B lymphocytes are specialized white blood cells that protect us against infection. These cells need to be able to replenish themselves for vaccines to work properly.

"Vaginal Adaptive Immunity Against Zika Virus PROJECT SUMMARY Case reports of Zika virus (ZIKV) sexual transmission are mounting. Early epidemiologic studies demonstrate a higher incidence of ZIKV in women and also appear to demonstrate regional disparities in the clinical severity of Zika disease. These latter findings combined with laboratory reports indicate that prior immunity to dengue virus (DENV) or other related viruses and vaccines may modulate subsequent ZIKV infection. ZIKV persists in semen for up to 6 months and the vagina for up to 14 days. The most devastating outcomes of human ZIKV infection result from transmission of the virus from women to their fetuses. Thus, vaginal immunity emerges as a critical barrier to both stop the ZIKV transmission cycle, and to prevent a step towards eventual transmission to the fetus. Yet little is known about which mechanisms contribute to vaginal anti-ZIKV immunity and the roles that preexisting immunity to ZIKV or DENV play against subsequent vaginal ZIKV infection (vagZIKV). Recent studies from our lab and others using mouse models demonstrated that ZIKV replicates in the mouse vagina and that even a wild-type vaginal antiviral response is initially incompetent in controlling vagZIKV. Because DENV and ZIKV are highly cross-reactive and vaginal immunity is mediated in part by antibodies, it seems reasonable to speculate that antibodies would mediate cross-protection in the vagina. However, our recent data demonstrate that DENV/ZIKV-cross-reactive CD8 T cells dominate during subsequent systemic ZIKV infection, and that DENV-immune CD8 T cells are both necessary and sufficient to provide cross-protection against systemic ZIKV infection. Therefore, the goals of this project are (i) to evaluate the role of the CD8 T cell response in protection against vagZIKV. (Specific Aim 1) and (ii) To investigate how changes in prior ZIKV/DENV infection route/dose affect subsequent anti-ZIKV CD8 T cell responses, including primary effectors and various memory subsets (effector, central, and resident memory), and protection against vagZIKV (Specific Aim 2). NARRATIVE The most recent studies indicate that current epidemiologic models underestimate the risk of ZIKV sexual transmission by at least one order of magnitude.

"Sequence analysis of hemotological traits in African Americans ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Circulating blood cell counts represent important intermediate phenotypes for a variety of cardiovascular, pulmonary, hematologic, and immunologic diseases. These traits differ by ethnicity and studying the genetics of these quantitative blood traits in African Americans (AAs) may reveal new biologic pathways that ultimately contribute to our understanding both of biology of blood cell production and of the relationship of blood counts with CVD and other chronic diseases that disproportionately impact AAs. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS), to date, performed mainly in European Americans, have implicated a number of genomic loci. Despite these successes, association signals for blood cell traits are often associated with uncertain effects on gene function or regulation, and therefore not readily translatable to clinical practice or treatment. Several recen advancements hold promise for translating genetic association findings for blood cell traits into mechanism-based therapeutic approaches for clinical disease. First, genome-wide mapping of blood cell type- and lineage-specific promoter and enhancer elements, transcription factor binding patterns and epigenetic profiling now provide a detailed picture of the cis- and trans- regulatory landscape during hematopoiesis. Second, experimental approaches utilizing genome engineering (RNA- guided CRISPR-Cas9) can characterize critical regulatory elements and functional variants of modest effect that are essential for stage-specific, lineage-restricted effects on gene expression. This proposal will utilize the wealth of newly available genetic data in multiple large AA cohorts, including exome array data on ~11,400 participants from the REasons for Geographical And Regional Differences in Stroke (REGARDS), the Jackson Heart (JHS) and Women's Health Initiative (WHI) studies and high-coverage whole genome sequence (WGS) data available on ~3,500 JHS participants through a recent NHLBI-funded WGS initiative to discover and functionally characterize novel genetic associations. These data will be combined with existing GWAS and exome array data on thousands of additional AAs with measured blood cell traits to form the largest and most comprehensive genetic study of blood cell traits ever conducted in AAs. Our study will use novel and established analytic and experimental approaches, consistent with the goals and directives of this initiative, to identify important genetic variants affecting these important blood-based biomarkers. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading killer of African Americans. The proposed work will identify novel genetic risk factors for various blood cell measures that influence CVD risk in African Americans and other populations.

"Developmental Exposures, Stem Cell Reprogramming, and Breast Cancer Disparties ABSTRACT The overall goal of this project is to define how interactions between breast stem cells and environmental stressors drive the biological basis of racial disparities in triple negative breast cancers (TNBCs). TNBC incidence in African American women is two to three-fold higher than in European Americans. The biological mechanisms underlying this striking disparity are not well understood. Our preliminary data identifies widespread racial disparities in exposure to a multitude of environmental toxicants including phthalates and parabens. The breast cancer windows of susceptibility hypothesis states that environmental exposures in utero, or during puberty and pregnancy, disproportionately increase breast cancer risk. Exposures during windows of susceptibility could modify risk by the increasing the number of stem cells, altering stem cell epigenetic reprogramming, or by otherwise changing stem cell biology. Using single cell RNA expression profiling, we have identified a rare breast stem cell population with hybrid epithelial/mesenchymal characteristics and an RNA expression pattern resembling TNBCs. What factors regulate these cells, including the influence of race/ethnicity or environmental exposures, are unknown. The objective of this proposal to dissect the role of stem cells and the environment in the biology of TNBC racial disparities. We will experimentally challenge normal human breast stem cells isolated from epidemiologically well characterized women ex vivo with prototypical toxicants and toxicants prioritized because of racial exposure disparities. Our central hypothesis is that differences in normal stem cell biology, attributable to either genetic or environmental factors (or a gene-environment interaction), underlie TNBC disparities. We will test this hypothesis with three Specific Aims: (1) Test for differences in normal breast stem cell biology in African American and European American women by single cell RNA sequencing, three-dimensional ex vivo culture, and epigenomic profiling. (2) Define the disparities in exposure to environmental toxicants between African American and European American women in a nationally representative dataset. (3) Test for differential effects of environmental toxicants on African American and European American breast stem cells. This interdisciplinary study will use state-of-the-art techniques which integrate basic breast stem cell biology with exposure assessment, environmental epidemiology, and toxicology. We expect that the findings from this study will provide significant impact for reduction of TNBC incidence and mortality by defining the factors that cause TNBC disparities, providing actionable targets for precision breast cancer prevention. PROJECT NARRATIVE African American women are two to three times more likely than European American women to get the most aggressive subtype of breast cancer, but the reasons for this disparity are not well understood. This project investigates how breast stem cells behave differently in African American and European American women when exposed to environmental chemicals. Results from this study could identify new methods of cancer prevention to eliminate these breast cancer disparities.","Developmental Exposures, Stem Cell Reprogramming, and Breast Cancer Disparties",9616864,R01ES028802,"['Biology ', ' Breast ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' Subcellular Process ', ' Cellular Process ', ' Cellular Physiology ', ' Cellular Function ', ' Cell Process ', ' Cell Function ', ' Cell physiology ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cells ', ' Environment ', ' Environmental Exposure ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' Goals ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Growth ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Hybrids ', ' Incidence ', ' Methods ', ' mortality ', ' Parabens ', ' Gestation ', ' Pregnancy ', ' Puberty ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Risk ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Progenitor Cells ', ' Stem cells ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' tissue culture ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Tissues ', ' environmental toxicant ', ' Toxic Environmental Agents ', ' Environmental Toxin ', ' Toxic Environmental Substances ', ' Toxicology ', ' Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' phthalates ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' base ', ' Area ', ' Biological ', ' Link ', ' Chemicals ', ' Predisposition ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Epithelial ', ' African ', ' European ', ' Interdisciplinary Study ', ' Multidisciplinary Research ', ' Multidisciplinary Collaboration ', ' Interdisciplinary Research ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Breast Cancer Prevention ', ' prevent breast cancer ', ' mammary tumor prevention ', ' mammary cancer prevention ', ' cancer prevention ', ' Genetic ', ' Exposure to ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Cellular biology ', ' cell biology ', ' Dimensions ', ' Complex ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' American ', ' cancer risk ', ' environmental stressor ', ' gene environment interaction ', ' environment effect on gene ', ' GxE interaction ', ' Gene x Environment Interaction ', ' metropolitan ', ' toxicant ', ' Prevention strategy ', ' Preventive strategy ', ' Preventative strategy ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' prenatal exposure ', ' prenatally exposed ', ' intrauterine environmental exposure ', ' intra-uterine environmental exposure ', ' in utero exposure ', ' fetal exposure ', ' exposed in utero ', ' Mammary gland ', ' mammary ', ' Advocate ', ' Breast Cancer Risk Factor ', ' breast cancer risk ', ' Data ', ' Mesenchymal ', ' Cancer Etiology ', ' Cancer Cause ', ' Environmental Epidemiology ', ' Epigenetic Process ', ' Epigenetic Mechanism ', ' Epigenetic Change ', ' Epigenetic ', ' Characteristics ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' in utero ', ' Gene Expression Profile ', ' transcriptional signature ', ' gene expression signature ', ' gene expression pattern ', ' Expression Signature ', ' triple-negative invasive breast carcinoma ', ' triple-negative breast cancer ', ' TNBC ', ' epigenomics ', ' Outcome ', ' Carcinogen exposure ', ' Toxicant exposure ', ' toxic exposure ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' disparity in cancer ', ' cancer disparity ', ' stem ', ' environmental chemical ', ' stem cell biology ', ' stem cell population ', ' individualized prevention ', ' precision prevention ', ' personalized prevention ', ' targeted treatment ', ' targeted therapy ', ' targeted therapeutic agents ', ' targeted therapeutic ', ' targeted drug treatments ', ' targeted drug therapy ', ' racial disparity ', ' race disparity ', ' disparities in race ', ' Breast Cancer Patient ', ' Breast Tumor Patient ', ' exposure route ', ' personal care products ', ' stem-like cell ', ' Expression Profiling ', ' single-cell RNA sequencing ', ' single cell RNA-seq ', ' scRNA-seq ', ' ']",NIEHS,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2019,532421,-0.03773629175666115
"Pathogenic Role of IL-18 in Sickle Cell Cardiomyopathy and Inducible Ventricular Tachycardia ABSTRACT: Individuals with sickle cell disease exhibit cardiovascular manifestations and sudden death as the top causes of premature death. These factors, unfortunately, contribute to the plateauing of the average life expectancy of these patients (in the 4th decade) over the past two decades, yet another profound health disparity observed in African Americans (AAs). Despite expanded understanding of the defining features including systemic vaso-occlusive episodes and hemolysis, there is a paucity of information linking cardiac pathology to premature death. Using system biology approaches, we have generated highly novel information characterizing a previously unrecognized human sickle cardiomyopathy defined by myocardial fibrosis, diastolic dysfunction, prolonged repolarization, and inducible ventricular tachycardia (VT) in the “humanized” sickle mouse model. These studies further demonstrated significant upregulation of circulating IL18 gene expression, an established inflammasome and pro-fibrotic mediator upregulated by free heme, in sickle cardiomyopathy. Additionally, exposure to IL-18 was a key factor in inducing VT in sickle mice. Preliminary data further link decreased expression and activity of cardiac potassium channels (KCND2/KCND3) in sickle mice, which can prolong repolarization, to acute increases in IL-18-mediated NADPH oxidase 4 (Nox4) expression, the latter a key source of reactive oxygenation species (ROS) and induction of cardiac apoptosis. We have further shown that chronic IL-18 inhibition reduces cardiac apoptosis, fibrosis and improves diastolic function in sickle mice coupled with reduced cardiac IL-18 receptor (IL-18R) and Nox4 expression. Finally, our genomic studies have identified novel polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with enhanced IL18 expression and prolonged corrected QT (QTc) interval, an established risk factor for VT. Thus, via three specific aims (SAs), this R01 will interrogate the mechanistic basis for the hypothesis that IL-18/IL- 18R/Nox4 signaling critically downregulates KCND2 and KCND3 function acutely and promotes myocardial fibrosis with sustained activation, exacerbating sickle cardiomyopathy and VT development. SA #1 will functionally validate heme-mediated IL18 promoter regulation including SNPs in a monocyte cell line. SA #2 will define how IL-18/IL-18R/Nox4 signaling acutely downregulates KCND2/KCND3 function leading to prolonged repolarization and chronically, results in cardiac apoptosis and fibrosis. SA #3 will define the therapeutic efficacy of strategies to prevent sickle cell-associated inducible VT. The knowledge gained from this R01 will directly translate into future clinical biomarker studies evaluating risk of sudden cardiac death highlighting those patients with a higher hemolytic burden, pathogenic IL18 SNPs, and circulating IL-18 levels with theoretically higher VT risk. Additionally, the data will test for effective and novel personalized therapies in a poorly recognized and fatal manifestation of sickle cell disease. NARRATIVE: While individuals with sickle cell disease exhibit sudden death as the top causes of premature death, it is unclear whether patients experience fatal cardiac arrhythmias that contribute to these outcomes. Our preliminary data, for the first time, reveals inducible ventricular tachycardia (a fatal rhythm disturbance) in preclinical sickle animal models. We propose to study and therapeutically target inflammatory mechanisms as major contributors to the development of abnormal cardiac electrical properties and fibrosis (scar), both factors promoting a heart environment vulnerable to fatal arrhythmias.",Pathogenic Role of IL-18 in Sickle Cell Cardiomyopathy and Inducible Ventricular Tachycardia,9685211,R01HL136603,"['Sickle Cell Anemia ', '

"The Role of Tumor-Infiltrating Immune Cells and Estrogen Receptor Expression in Racial Disparities in Breast Cancer Biology. ABSTRACT: African-American (AA) women are more likely to have aggressive tumors and poorer survival than European-American (EA) women. Understanding the biological mechanisms underlying this disparity is a critical unmet need with major public health implications. The tumor immune milieu may play a pivotal role in breast cancer disparities, specifically tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) that have roles in oncogenesis and disease progression. Using H&E stained slides from a large epidemiological case-control study, we have discovered that AA women have significantly higher levels of TILs than EA women – especially in the estrogen receptor (ER) negative subgroups. This indicates a distinct biological difference in the tumor immune response related to race and ER status, and also presents a conundrum in which TILs that are often associated with better outcome are higher in AA women, who typically fare worse with breast cancer. These findings indicate that the specific composition of immune cell populations and their spatial arrangement within the tumor environment are likely to be important mitigating factors for the role of TILs in breast cancer progression, and tumor differences between AA and EA women. Our preliminary data from the NanoString PanCancer Immune Panel support this idea by revealing that AA women have gene expression signatures indicative of higher levels of exhausted T cells than EA women, which have a diminished capacity to destroy tumor cells, consistent with the poorer survival observed in AA women. Here, immune gene expression profiles also varied by ER status, pointing to a potential immunoregulatory role of ER in breast cancer.  To date, most studies that examine TILs do so in cohorts of predominantly EA women and in-depth immune profiling studies in large cohorts of AA women are lacking. To address this shortcoming, we will employ multispectral staining and imaging with the Vectra® Quantitative Pathology System to delineate immune cell populations and ER expression in 996 breast cancer samples from the Women's Circle of Health Study. Building on our preliminary data, we propose to evaluate two immunofluorescence panels, each with multiple biomarkers in their spatio-morphological context. While both panels will include ER and a differentiating cytokeratin marker, panel 1 will include four common T cell markers (CD3, CD4, CD8, FOXP3), and panel 2 will include markers of T cell exhaustion (TIGIT, LAG3, PD-1) that may play a key role in the differential immune response between AA and EA women. Our proposal involves the full implementation of a new generation of biomarker assessment techniques – multiplexed staining, multispectral imaging, automated scoring, and digital spatial analyses. A thorough comparison of the immune landscape in breast tumors in regards to race and ER expression will inform our understanding of immune escape mechanisms, and how these processes differ by ancestry. This will be critical for designing immunotherapy strategies that will equally benefit AA women, serving to reduce racial disparities in breast cancer. PROJECT NARRATIVE African-American women are more likely to have aggressive tumors and poorer survival than European- American women and this may be due to biological differences in their tumor immune cells. We will use a sophisticated tumor tissue staining and imaging approach to evaluate the immune cells in breast cancer samples from a large group of predominantly African-American women. Our findings will inform on the abundance and types of immune cells present in breast tumors and may improve cancer immunotherapy strategies for African-American women.",The Role of Tumor-Infiltrating

"Developmental Exposures, Stem Cell Reprogramming, and Breast Cancer Disparties ABSTRACT The overall goal of this project is to define how interactions between breast stem cells and environmental stressors drive the biological basis of racial disparities in triple negative breast cancers (TNBCs). TNBC incidence in African American women is two to three-fold higher than in European Americans. The biological mechanisms underlying this striking disparity are not well understood. Our preliminary data identifies widespread racial disparities in exposure to a multitude of environmental toxicants including phthalates and parabens. The breast cancer windows of susceptibility hypothesis states that environmental exposures in utero, or during puberty and pregnancy, disproportionately increase breast cancer risk. Exposures during windows of susceptibility could modify risk by the increasing the number of stem cells, altering stem cell epigenetic reprogramming, or by otherwise changing stem cell biology. Using single cell RNA expression profiling, we have identified a rare breast stem cell population with hybrid epithelial/mesenchymal characteristics and an RNA expression pattern resembling TNBCs. What factors regulate these cells, including the influence of race/ethnicity or environmental exposures, are unknown. The objective of this proposal to dissect the role of stem cells and the environment in the biology of TNBC racial disparities. We will experimentally challenge normal human breast stem cells isolated from epidemiologically well characterized women ex vivo with prototypical toxicants and toxicants prioritized because of racial exposure disparities. Our central hypothesis is that differences in normal stem cell biology, attributable to either genetic or environmental factors (or a gene-environment interaction), underlie TNBC disparities. We will test this hypothesis with three Specific Aims: (1) Test for differences in normal breast stem cell biology in African American and European American women by single cell RNA sequencing, three-dimensional ex vivo culture, and epigenomic profiling. (2) Define the disparities in exposure to environmental toxicants between African American and European American women in a nationally representative dataset. (3) Test for differential effects of environmental toxicants on African American and European American breast stem cells. This interdisciplinary study will use state-of-the-art techniques which integrate basic breast stem cell biology with exposure assessment, environmental epidemiology, and toxicology. We expect that the findings from this study will provide significant impact for reduction of TNBC incidence and mortality by defining the factors that cause TNBC disparities, providing actionable targets for precision breast cancer prevention. PROJECT NARRATIVE African American women are two to three times more likely than European American women to get the most aggressive subtype of breast cancer, but the reasons for this disparity are not well understood. This project investigates how breast stem cells behave differently in African American and European American women when exposed to environmental chemicals. Results from this study could identify new methods of cancer prevention to eliminate these breast cancer disparities.","Developmental Exposures, Stem Cell Reprogramming, and Breast Cancer Disparties",9833521,R01ES028802,"['Biology ', ' Breast ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Cell physiology ', ' Cell Function ', ' Cell Process ', ' Cellular Function ', ' Cellular Physiology ', ' Cellular Process ', ' Subcellular Process ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Environment ', ' Environmental Exposure ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiologic ', ' epidemiological ', ' Epithelium ', ' Epithelium Part ', ' Goals ', ' Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Hybrids ', ' Incidence ', ' Methods ', ' mortality ', ' Parabens ', ' Pregnancy ', ' Gestation ', ' Puberty ', ' Race ', ' Racial Group ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' stem cells ', ' Progenitor Cells ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' tissue culture ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Toxic Environmental Substances ', ' Environmental Toxin ', ' Toxic Environmental Agents ', ' environmental toxicant ', ' Toxicology ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Transcription ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Afro American ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Black Populations ', ' black American ', ' African American ', ' phthalates ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' base ', ' Area ', ' Biological ', ' Link ', ' Chemicals ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Predisposition ', ' Epithelial ', ' African ', ' European ', ' Interdisciplinary Research ', ' Multidisciplinary Collaboration ', ' Multidisciplinary Research ', ' Interdisciplinary Study ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' mammary cancer prevention ', ' mammary tumor prevention ', ' prevent breast cancer ', ' Breast Cancer Prevention ', ' cancer prevention ', ' Genetic ', ' Exposure to ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' cell biology ', ' Cellular biology ', ' Complex ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' 3-D ', ' 3D ', ' three dimensional ', ' 3-Dimensional ', ' American ', ' cancer risk ', ' environmental stressor ', ' Gene x Environment Interaction ', ' GxE interaction ', ' environment effect on gene ', ' gene environment interaction ', ' metropolitan ', ' toxicant ', ' Preventative strategy ', ' Preventive strategy ', ' Prevention strategy ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' exposed in utero ', ' fetal exposure ', ' in utero exposure ', ' intra-uterine environmental exposure ', ' intrauterine environmental exposure ', ' prenatally exposed ', ' prenatal exposure ', ' mammary ', ' Mammary gland ', ' Advocate ', ' breast cancer risk ', ' Breast Cancer Risk Factor ', ' Data ', ' Mesenchymal ', ' Cancer Cause ', ' Cancer Etiology ', ' Environmental Epidemiology ', ' Epigenetic ', ' Epigenetic Change ', ' Epigenetic Mechanism ', ' Epigenetic Process ', ' Characteristics ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' in utero ', ' Expression Signature ', ' gene expression pattern ', ' gene expression signature ', ' transcriptional signature ', ' Gene Expression Profile ', ' TNBC ', ' triple-negative breast cancer ', ' triple-negative invasive breast carcinoma ', ' epigenomics ', ' Outcome ', ' Carcinogen exposure ', ' toxic exposure ', ' Toxicant exposure ', ' cancer disparity ', ' disparity in cancer ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' stem ', ' environmental chemical ', ' stem cell biology ', ' stem cell population ', ' personalized prevention ', ' precision prevention ', ' individualized prevention ', ' targeted drug therapy ', ' targeted drug treatments ', ' targeted therapeutic ', ' targeted therapeutic agents ', ' targeted therapy ', ' targeted treatment ', ' disparities in race ', ' race disparity ', ' racial disparity ', ' Breast Tumor Patient ', ' Breast Cancer Patient ', ' exposure route ', ' personal care products ', ' stem-like cell ', ' Expression Profiling ', ' scRNA-seq ', ' single cell RNA-seq ', ' single cell RNAseq ', ' single-cell RNA sequencing ', ' ']",NIEHS,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2020,385543,-0.03773629175666115
"The impact of coding region variants on mutant p53 biology Project Summary  It is now well accepted that tumor-­derived mutant forms of p53 are potently oncogenic.  Silencing mutant  p53,  or  inducing  the  degradation  of  this  protein,  can  markedly  impair  tumor  growth  in  vitro  and  tumor  progression in vivo.  The ability of mutant p53 to drive tumor progression is frequently mediated by protein-­ protein interaction, and this is often referred to as the “gain of function” (GOF) activity of mutant p53.  One  of  our  gaps  in  knowledge  has  been  the  identification  of  key  GOF  activities  of  mutant p53.    Another  has  been  investigation  into how  coding  region  SNPs  (single nucleotide polymorphisms)  in p53  influence  the  mutant p53 GOF.  One of the Holy Grails of cancer biology has been the identification of compounds that  can reactivate the p53 pathway in tumors containing mutant p53, by refolding mutant forms of p53 into wild  type  conformation  and  activity.   Several groups  have  reported  the  identification of  compounds that act  in  these  ways.    Another  key  gap  in  our  knowledge  has  been  how  coding  region  SNPs  (single  nucleotide  polymorphisms) in p53 impact the folding of mutant p53, and the efficacy of compounds that refold mutant  p53.    In this application, we take aim at two coding region SNPs in p53: Pro72Arg and Tyr107His.  We recently  published that the codon 72 variation is a potent intragenic modifier of mutant p53 GOF.  Specifically, the  Arg  (R72)  variant of  mutant p53  is  a superior  mediator  of tumor  cell  invasiveness  and  is associated  with  poor  prognosis  in  women  with  breast  cancer.      We  will  delve  into an  investigation of  the  influence  of  this  SNP  on  mutant  p53  GOF,  using novel  mouse  models  for  the  R175H  mutation,  containing either  P72  or  R72.  We will learn their impact on p53 structure using NMR, and on their influence on the efficacy of p53-­ refolding  compounds.    This  aim  constitutes  a  structural,  molecular  and  in  vivo  analysis  of  the  codon  72  SNP of mutant p53.  We have obtained data that the Y017H variant of p53 alters the structure and activity of this protein.  We  will  explore  the  effect  of  this  African-­specific  SNP  on  p53  function  in  a  novel  mouse  model.    We  have  identified  genes  with  impaired  transactivation by Y107H,  including  the chromatin  modifier  PADI4;; we  will  explore its impact on p53 function and tumor suppression.  In sum, for both aims we employ a combination  of gene expression, protein-­protein interaction, cytotoxicity and novel mouse models.  We have recruited  expert  collaborators  like  Donna  George  (Penn),  John  Karanicolas  (Fox  Chase  Cancer  Center)  and  Darren  Carpizo  (Rutgers-­Cancer  Institute  of  New  Jersey).    These  Investigators  bring  to  bear  their  complimentary  expertise  to  address  an  important  and  clinically-­relevant  question:  how  can  we  better  harness p53 to eradicate cancer.      Project Narrative  The  proposed  research  will  conduct  the  first  comprehensive  analysis  designed  to  definitively  assess  the  influence of the codon 72 SNP on mutant p53 GOF, and on the efficacy of p53-­refolding compounds.  It  will also define the impact of the Y107H African-­specific SNP within the p53 DNA binding domain on p53  structure and function using NMR and a novel mouse model.  This research has important implications for  understanding  cancer  risk  in  under-­represented  populations,  and  for  informing  personalized  medicine  approaches. ",The impact of coding region variants on mutant p53 biology,9914543,R01CA238611,"['Alleles ', ' Allelomorphs ', ' Arginine ', ' L-Arginine ', ' Ursidae Family ', '

"Genomic Analysis of Perianal Fistulizing Crohn's Disease across Ancestries Project Summary Perianal fistulizing Crohn’s disease is a debilitating phenotype of Crohn’s disease (CD) involving the rectum. It is often refractory to treatment and is associated with severe disability and poor quality of life. Fistulizing CD disproportionately affects African Americans (AA), presenting with much higher prevalence, and more severe with destructive pathology. Besides fistulizing CD often requires a more aggressive combination of medical and surgical intervention than does luminal disease. Several lines of evidence suggest that interactions between the rectal epithelium, the microbiome, and the immune system, drive patent-specific pathogenesis of perianal fistula, but there is very little known about these at the molecular and cellular level, particularly with ancestral differences. The complexity of perianal fistula involving communication between microbes and multiple immune and non- immune cell types provides a strong rationale for a need for deep molecular characterization of the disease. One hypothesis is that different biological mechanisms due in part to divergent genomic architecture between African- and European-ancestry patients contributes to the disparity in health outcomes. Consequently, integrative genomic comparisons utilizing state-of-the-art single cell gene expression profiling of rectal biopsies and of peripheral blood immune cells, will be used to investigate the nature of pathological mechanisms of perianal fistulizing CD including specific comparison of African and European ancestry patient groups. Building on preliminary transcriptome profiling of the whole mucosa between these ancestry groups that implicates differences in metabolic and inflammatory signaling, and taking advantage of the emerging Gut Cell Atlas, our profiling of 120 cases will establish which cellular and gene expression features associate with remission, stabilization, or progression of disease. Aim 1 is to biopsy rectum and take blood samples from 120 patients at presentation, and again at follow-up, also with microbiome sampling (rectal wash as well as stool), supported by deep clinical phenotyping. Two ancestral populations (European and AA) are equally powered for comparison studies. Aim 2 is to use single cell RNA sequencing to profile changes in the relative abundance of each of dozens of key cell types, and to identify key genes that are consistent biomarkers of the three therapeutic response states within each cell type. Advanced bioinformatics approaches will be used to characterize the network of cellular interactions, and to link the genetic regulation of gene expression to genome-wide association studies of CD by identifying cell-type specific eQTL. Subsequently, in Aim 3, mechanistic dissection of specific pathways will be pursued with in vitro cultures of patient-derived intestinal organoids to assess patient specific responses when stimulated by relevant molecules. The findings will both illuminate cellular and molecular mechanisms that contribute to a major source of health disparity in fistulizing CD, and support the transition to personalized genomic medical profiling in support of therapeutic intervention. Narrative: Perianal fistulizing disease is a severe phenotype of Crohn’s disease (CD) which disproportionately affects African Americans (AA) making this a major cause of health disparity. We show that the ileal transcriptomic (mucosa) profile in AA is distinct compared with European Americans (EA), suggesting that these differences are due in part to biological mechanisms being driven by their unique genomic architecture. We will use single cell transcriptomics to profile each cell type at enrollment and follow up in an equal number of AA and EA, which will be followed by mechanistic studies with patient-derived intestinal organoids. This state-of-the-art hypothesis driven mechanistic study is designed to establish biological differences that might influence disease severity and outcome in 2 ancestral populations.",Genomic

"Vascular cell sexual dimorphism in complex mechanical microenvironments The sex disparity in the incidence and progression of cardiovascular disease (CVD), including peripheral arterial disease (PAD), is a troubling clinical observation. It is well known that CVD manifests differently in men and women, with more women than men suffering from the disease. Further, within the vascular network, there are mechanical microenvironments that favor CVD development, for example, atherosclerotic plaques preferentially form at regions of disturbed flow and low fluid shear stresses such as, vasculature bifurcations. Yet, no reports have correlated these two separate observations at the cellular level, specifically, the sex differences in CVD and local vascular mechanics. This project aims to 1) assess the functional changes in male and female human umbilical vein endothelial cells in response to combined physiological fluid shear stresses and substrate stiffness by morphometric, secretory, and genetic analyses, 2) assess the functional changes in male and female human aortic smooth muscle cells in response to combined physiological cyclic stretching and substrate stiffness by morphometric, mechanical, and genetic analyses, and 3) correlate the disparate functional response of male and female vascular cells using statistical methods. Upon completion of these aims, a foundational understanding of vascular cell functionality in vitro as it pertains to sexual dimorphism in complex mechanical microenvironments will be gained. A factorial design of experiments will be used to systematically assess the influence of cell sex, laminar fluid shear stress or cyclic stretch, and the underlying substrate stiffness. The effects of the mechanical microenvironment will be assessed using well-defined flow and stretch bioreactors with RGD-conjugated polyacrylamide gel substrates. Cell morphology will be quantified by immunofluorescence microscopy methods. Glycocalyx, vasoregulatory, and estradiol secretory products will be quantified by commercial assays. Cellular mechanical properties will be measured by atomic force microscopy. The regulation of a large set of vascular cell genes including a subset related to CVD will be measured by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. Statistical analyses will be performed to relate gene expression results to morphological, secretory, and mechanical responses and then to correlate them to a given sex and mechanical force combination. This work follows the 2015 NIH mandate to consider sex as a biological variable by investigating the clinical observations of the sex disparity in cardiovascular disease at the cellular level. The significance for this work is that future imaging modalities that quantify vascular forces such as with 4D MRI, will be able to indicate areas within the vasculature that are susceptible to localized cellular dysfunction using correlative statistical models and ultimately predict a patient's location-specific vulnerability for disease. This proposal is part of a predoctoral training fellowship at the University of Florida. The trainee will learn to conduct the experiments proposed and to grow professionally from the guidance of a comprehensive mentoring team of clinicians, cell and molecular biologists, computational theorists, and material scientists. Our research aims to uncover why men and women develop different symptoms and outcomes of cardiovascular disease. Specifically, we want to understand the role sex plays in how blood flow and blood vessel properties influence vascular cellular function. Using specialized bioreactor devices, we will expose both male and female vascular cells to varying combinations of fluid shear stresses, stretching, and substrate stiffness and observe the changes they undergo.",Vascular cell sexual dimorphism in complex mechanical microenvironments,10026024,F31HL147445,"['Architecture ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Atherosclerosis ', ' Atheroscleroses ',

"Targeting TMPRSS2 expression as a therapy for coronavirus infection and replication Coronaviruses employ two key host proteins to gain entry and replicate within cells, angiotensinconverting enzyme 2 (ACE2), an essential receptor of entry, and cell surface transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2), a serine protease that cleaves coronavirus spike proteins following receptor binding to promote viral fusion and entry into cells. Chemical inhibitors and RNA interference of TMPRSS2 have been shown to markedly slow coronavirus entry and replication in human lung epithelial cell lines. In vivo studies with TMPRSS2 transgenic knockout mice have further shown that loss of TMPRSS2 can reduce coronavirus replication in lungs, elicit a weaker proinflammatory response, and result in milder lung pathology. Importantly, initial data stemming from studies on the novel coronavirus responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic, SARS-CoV-2, show that viral entry mechanisms appear similar to other coronavirus family members, as SARS-CoV-2 entry into cells is decreased upon TMPRSS2 inhibition. Altogether, these data strongly suggest that modulation of TMPRSS2 levels may be an effective treatment strategy for patients infected with SARS-CoV-2. The Chinnaiyan lab discovered TMPRSS2 as the androgen-regulated 5’ partner of the TMPRSS2- ERG and TMPRSS2-ETS family of prostate cancer gene fusions. TMPRSS2 expression is directly regulated by the androgen receptor (AR), which has been extensively studied and targeted through various therapeutic interventions for the treatment of prostate cancer. Preliminary data from our lab suggests that lung TMPRSS2 is also androgen-regulated. Notably, several FDA-approved agents targeting AR activity in prostate cancer, such as enzalutamide, can markedly inhibit TMPRSS2 expression through antagonism of AR. We, therefore, hypothesize that FDA-approved drugs that markedly inhibit TMPRSS2 expression, like enzalutamide, may be effective in inhibiting coronavirus replication and possibly infection. Recent data from Italy (and other countries) suggests that males, who implicitly have higher levels of androgen than females, die of coronavirus by a factor of two-to-one, providing orthogonal evidence that AR activity may indeed be a player in COVID-19 progression. Thus, we would like to quickly generate pre-clinical data to support the idea that agents that suppress AR/TMPRSS2 may be repurposed to treat or prevent coronavirus infection. Based on this pre-clinical data, we would quickly assemble a clinical team to initiate a clinical trial investigating FDAapproved AR antagonists in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2. Critically, most samples for these studies are already banked in our lab to support an accelerated timeline, and since agents like enzalutamide are FDA-approved, this project could have immediate clinical impact for COVID-19 patients. NARRATIVE (OVERALL) The University of Michigan Comprehensive Cancer Center (UMCCC) is committed to reducing cancer burden and improving cancer outcomes through research, innovation, transdisciplinary collaboration, education, and outreach. The UMCCC vision is that through its focus on team science and excellence, the UMCCC will be a national leader in prevention, early diagnosis, optimal treatment, and survivorship care for those at

"Sickle Cell Disease and Sickle Cell Trait Protection Against HIV-1-infection in Africans and African Americans Sickle cell disease (SCD) is an inherited hemoglobinopathy that leads to sickling of red blood cells and the development of chronic hemolytic anemia. SCD patients have lower risk for HIV-1 infection, but its underlying molecular mechanisms are not well understood. We recently showed that changes in iron metabolism leads to upregulation of innate immune response and prevent ex vivo HIV-1 infection of PBMCs obtained from SCD patients. Our working hypothesis is that hemolysis-mediated upregulation of ferroportin expression and iron export in SCD leads to the inhibition of HIV-1 replication. We further hypothesize that macrophage processing of abnormal sickle hemoglobin leads to interferon-β production and stimulation of antiviral response. What is yet unclear is whether SCD or sickle cell trait triggers an overall antiviral state or whether HIV-1 is controlled at post infection stage. To answer these questions, we will investigate HIV-1+ SCD patients and cohort of HIV-1+ sickle cell trait individuals to include males and Africans. We will also utilize mouse model of SCD to analyze EcoHIV-1 infection in vivo. In Specific Aim 1, we will analyze HIV-1 restriction in HIV-1+ SCD individuals. We will analyze the effect of SCD on HIV-1 infection in SCD HIV-1+ patients recruited from Howard University and Montefiore clinics. We will analyze their hematological and virological parameters and test host genes expression using RNA-Seq analysis. We will analyze their HIV-1 phylogeny, HLA-B alleles and inflammation markers. In Specific Aim 2, we will determine the effect of sickle cell trait on HIV-1 infection in African Americans and Africans and viral load in African Americans from WIHS, Multicenter Cohort AIDS Study (MACS), and a Nigerian cohort. We will conduct multivariable analysis to determine the effect of the trait on viral load, relationship to CD4/CD8 counts and levels of proteins involved in iron metabolism and HIV-1 restriction. We will also conduct a case control study to analyze HIV-1phylogeny and the effect of iron and inflammation markers on HIV-1 progression. In Specific Aim 3, we will analyze molecular mechanisms of HIV-1 inhibition in SCD and sickle cell trait. We will analyze expression of host HIV-1 restriction factors in monocyte- derived macrophages treated with HbSS and HbAS hemoglobin and test selected factors in ex vivo HIV-1 infection of PBMCs derived from SCD patients and HIV-1+ sickle cell trait participants from WIHS and MACS cohorts. We will also test HIV-1 infection in SCD and trait mouse models using EcoHIV virus that infects mice and leads to the latent HIV-1 infection in T cells and macrophages.The proposed research will elucidate the molecular mechanisms of HIV-1 inhibition in the settings of SCD and sickle cell trait, which could lead to novel anti-HIV-1 therapeutics based on the concept of HIV-1 restriction mediated by hemolysis and interferon induction by sickle cell hemoglobin. The proposed research is relevant to public health and specifically minority health and health disparities because it is aimed at understanding the molecular mechanism of HIV-1 infection in patients with Sickle Cell Disease. The proposed research is relevant to the NIH mission that pertains to a reduced disparities and vulnerability of the minority population to chronic diseases that include HIV-1 infection.",Sickle Cell

"Novel mechanism controlling calcium signaling to treat and prevent neurodegeneration in early stage glaucoma Project Summary/Abstract The proposal is in response to NEI's strategic plan, described recently by NEI in “Vision Research: Needs, Gaps, and Opportunities”, and focuses on our most recent discoveries of a novel neuronal mechanism rooted at the intersection of aging and the biological mechanisms of eye disease identified as a high programmatic priority. The proposed research targets a novel mechanism of neuroprotection utilizing intracellular calcium channels as drug targets to treat neurodegeneration in glaucoma. Specifically, we plan to determine mechanisms of action and to measure preservation of neuronal viability and function in model systems of glaucoma. The proposed research will allow us to generate preclinical data needed for the development of novel neuroprotectants to complement existing therapies targeting intraocular pressure: The intracellular free Ca2+ concentration of retinal ganglion cells like in other neurons of the CNS is highly regulated and subject to dysregulation during aging. For the development of acute and chronic degenerative diseases including glaucoma reducing the viability and function of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) several studies indicate that both changes in intracellular second messenger concentration and pathological increases in the intracellular Ca2+ concentration promote pathogenesis. The present application will test the hypothesis that Ca2+ signaling of RGCs is functionally regulated by an immediate early gene product upregulated in RGCs after a neurodegenerative insult to generate a cellular defense mechanism. This hypothesis is based on strong preliminary evidence that normal aging of the retina is mechanistically similar to glaucoma disease processes and can be exploited to devise novel treatments for glaucoma. The proposed experiments designed to test this hypothesis will investigate the molecular, cellular and functional mechanisms underlying this interaction under experimentally induced disease conditions in models of glaucoma. The overall goal of the proposed study is to identify a novel mechanism of RGC neuroprotection and determine its potential as a strategy for neuroprotective therapies targeting RGCs. This therapy approach will have the potential to be both preventative and therapeutic in nature and to complement existing treatment designs and rationales. Project Narrative Degeneration or acute damage of nerve cells in the retina as seen in glaucoma is a major cause of visual loss and blindness in the United States and worldwide. As these diseases affect significant and increasing portions of the U.S. population including minorities affected by disparities in health care delivery, determining causes, mechanisms of action and subsequently potential treatment strategies will contribute to improving health care, health and performance requiring visual tasks. The present application uses a novel mechanism underlying a self-defense mechanism of the retina to develop such new treatment strategies and is in response to the NEI's strategic plan, described recently by NEI in “Vision Research: Needs, Gaps, and Opportunities”.",Novel mechanism controlling calcium signaling to treat and prevent neurodegeneration in early stage

"Novel pro-drug pharmacotherapy to prevent neuronal and cell degeneration in AMD PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Degeneration or acute damage of retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) and nerve cells in the retina due to Age-related Macular Degeneration (AMD) is a major cause of visual loss and blindness in the United States and worldwide. The proposed multidisciplinary research project will focus on the characterization of a novel signaling pathway for and the development of a novel pharmacological intervention to control degeneration of RPE cells and neurons in AMD. To this end, preclinical testing of the new therapeutic strategy will be performed, along with ocular biotransformation, transport and distribution studies, in established models of human AMD. These experiments will determine efficacy of treatment in terminating and/or preventing AMD associated neuronal loss and preservation of visual function, and to generate data to support feasibility for and move positive findings to phase 1 and 2 clinical trials. Specifically, we will test the two-pronged hypothesis that treatment based on the ocular targeting of a novel chemical antioxidant strategy protects RPE cells and neurons from apoptosis by topical delivery in established models of human AMD and, therefore, leads to prevention or improvement of visual impairment and functional deficits associated with AMD. The determination of neuronal viability and the acquired knowledge on associated biopharmaceutical and pharmacological parameters will indicate the potential of the method to remedy AMD as the overall goal of the project. This novel approach for therapy development in AMD focuses on complementary and alternative cellular protection and neuroprotection. The innovative strategy has the potential to generate a first-in-class pharmacotherapy approach for dry AMD using a topical rather than a systemic or invasive route of drug delivery. The strategy’s potentially high impact lies in its capacity to be both preventative and therapeutic in nature and to complement existing treatment designs and rationales addressing other aspects of AMD treatment such as those targeting neovascularization. Project Narrative Degeneration or acute damage of retinal pigment epithelial cells and nerve cells in the retina due to Age-related Macular Degeneration (AMD) is a major cause of visual loss and blindness in the United States and worldwide. The determination of the function and effectiveness of new drugs as proposed in the present application has the potential to produce a therapy approach for AMD that focuses on the retinal pigment epithelial cells and nerve cells of the retina and that has the potential to be both preventative and therapeutic in nature for the dry form of the disease and to complement existing treatment designs and rationales addressing other aspects of AMD such as the wet form of the disease. As AMD affects significant and increasing portions of the U.S. population including minorities affected by disparities in health care delivery, determining causes, mechanisms of action and subsequently potential treatment strategies will contribute to improving health care, health and performance requiring visual tasks.",Novel pro-drug pharmacotherapy to prevent neuronal and cell

"Understanding Sex Disparities in Gliomas Through Sex Differences in Mitochondrial Activity Program Director/Principal Investigator (Last, First, Middle): Ippolito, Joseph Edward PROJECT SUMMARY  There is a sex disparity seen in cancers throughout the body where males have both a higher incidence and a higher mortality than females. This is not only true for adults, but is also seen in children as well, suggesting that factors other than the effects of sex hormones may be playing a role in this phenomenon. This is especially true for glioblastomas (GBM) that comprise over 50% of brain tumors and are characterized by resistance to therapies and a dismal prognosis (median survival - 15 months). Because enhanced nutrient consumption and metabolism are critical to enhanced tumorigenesis and its effect on poor patient outcomes, our group investigates the presence of sex differences in cancer metabolism that may be driving the sex disparities that are observed in many cancers. We have uncovered laboratory and clinical evidence demonstrating that male brain tumors have enhanced nutrient uptake and metabolism (specifically sugars and amino acids) compared to female tumors. We have further identified that the largest sex differences in cancer metabolism come from the mitochondria, the part of the cell that is the critical for generating energy and biosynthetic building blocks for the cell for growth. Because metabolism is not only restricted to the tumor, but involves the entire patient, we have investigated the effects of sex differences in nutrition and obesity in cancer patient survival. We have discovered that women with “male-pattern” increased visceral abdominal obesity selectively do much worse compared to all other patients in multiple cancers. These findings suggest that the sex differences that we see in cancers may not only be related to tumor mitochondria, but nutrition and its overall metabolic health of the individual. In this proposal, we will develop new animal models to test the hypothesis that sex differences in mitochondrial activity underlie sex differences in tumor development. Our long term goal is to understand the metabolic basis of sex disparities in cancer patients through a combination of tumor and host metabolism. In the first aim of this proposal, we will use an established model (Nf1-/-/DNp53) for sex differences in GBM and deplete mitochondria in the cancer cells to test for sex differences in cancer cell phenotype and metabolism. In the second aim, we will determine the effects of obesogenic diets on sex differences in brain tumor mitochondrial activity and growth. This research proposal is innovative because it opens up a new paradigm in the oncology field that investigates sex-specific differences in cancer and host metabolism. This proposal will generate new insights into the mechanism behind sex differences in mitochondrial activity and the impact of nutrition on sex differences in the malignant phenotype. We are beginning to develop a platform for novel readily-translatable imaging methods and therapeutic approaches that treat not only brain tumors, but multiple malignancies.

"ACKR3 and CXCR4 Contributions to the Tumor Microenvironment in Breast Cancer Racial Disparities PROJECT SUMMARY Breast cancer (BrCa) disparities are startling and the levels of racial disparity in metastasis and survival remain unacceptable despite advancements in BrCa screening and treatment that have led to a significant decline in BrCa related deaths. This project addresses BrCa disparities with the goal of identifying cellular and molecular characteristics that certain chemokine receptors contribute to the tumor composition, or microenvironment, across different racial groups. Chemokines and their receptors are critical in determining the metastatic destination of tumor cells by supporting tumor angiogenesis and immune cell recruitment. The chemokine receptors CXCR4 and ACKR3 are co-receptors for the chemokine CXCL12, which is critical in BrCa metastasis. CXCR4 is overexpressed in BrCa tumors and ACKR3 in the tumor vasculature. Our preliminary data indicates ACKR3 and CXCR4 are differentially expressed in opposing directions in bulk breast cancer tumor tissues from different racial groups. We also identified ACKR3 and CXCR4 to be differentially expressed in a sub-set of tumor cells, the tumor endothelial cells. The goal of this project is to elucidate the patterns of ACKR3 and CXCR4 expression in distinct tumor cell subsets and how these receptors contribute to altering the tumor’s composition and eventual dissemination in women from different racial groups. We propose two specific aims to accomplish this goal. Aim 1: Determine the ACKR3 and CXCR4 signaling pathways in BrCa from samples of different racial groups. Identifying gene regulatory networks that control expression of ACKR3 and CXCR4 in BrCa across different racial groups will indicate the contribution of these receptors to BrCa disparities. Aim 2. Identify CR expression on a single-cell level in breast tumor cell subsets from racially diverse patient tissue samples. Distinct cell population functions will be modeled, quantitatively analyzed using BrCa human tissues from different race groups, and validated by testing whether factors that enhance ACKR3 and CXCR4 activity can be reversed by blocking receptor-microenvironment interactions. These findings will reveal the cellular and molecular contributions that drive ACKR3 and CXCR4 to alter the tumor landscape in BrCa disparities, including the tumor vasculature in situ and potentially at metastatic sites. Knowing these molecular features will have far-reaching implications for therapeutic development, better clinical trial development, and ultimately alleviate cancer disparities. In addition, it will enable the PI to develop her research program, gather preliminary data to seek mainstream funding and allow her to offer and engage the ethnically diverse student population at San Francisco State University, including 43% under-represented students, in exciting opportunities to conduct cancer biology research and prepare them to face the challenges of combatting cancer disparities. PROJECT NARRATIVE The focus of this project is on breast cancer disparities, with the goal of identifying cellular and molecular characteristics that contribute to the tumor microenvironment across different racial groups. We hypothesize that the chemokine receptors ACKR3 and CXCR4 significantly contribute to the tumor microenvironment differences that lead to worse clinical outcomes for black women compared to women of other races. The data we generate from these studies will elucidate molecular interactions and regulation dynamics of tumor cell subsets, set the foundation for testing novel therapeutic-target combinations and ultimately lead to improved design of patient clinical trials that address breast cancer disparities.",ACKR3 and CXCR4 Contributions to the Tumor Microenvironment in Breast Cancer Racial

"Novel Prostate Cancer Cell Lines to Address Prostate Cancer Disparity in Black Men This work is based on the hypothesis that to fully exploit the benefit of cell line-based drug screening, a representative cell line panel recapitulating the varied types of prostate cancer (PCa) and the contribution of differences in ancestry is necessary. PCa is the leading cause of cancer mortality in men worldwide. Current advances in patient diagnoses and therapy have led to a decline in PCa incidence and mortality rates. However, this is not the case for men of African ancestry (MAA) from Africa and the Caribbean where both PCa incidence and mortality rates are on the rise. PCa cell lines are used to understand the biology of PCa and to advance the development of PCa theranostics. However, more than 97% of the PCa cell lines that are readily available to researchers are from men of European ancestry (MEA). There continues to be limited representation of PCa materials from MAA when compared to MEA, and there are almost no cell models available derived from MAA. This makes it difficult to assess the efficacy of potential treatments in MAA versus MEA, contributing to a problem in health disparities. To address this problem, this project will first develop and characterize cell lines that recapitulate the most prevalent molecular abnormalities associated with PCa in MAA (Aim 1). Second, it will comparatively screen chemotherapy drugs and Jamaican natural lead molecules on the novel MAA PCa cell lines to standardly employed PCa cell lines derived from MEA (Aim 2). The lack of representation of samples from men of African ancestry (MAA) at preclinical and clinical research is believed to contribute to the higher incidence and mortality rates of prostate cancer among MAA. As cell lines are tools used to understand the biology of tumours from which they are derived as well as to develop theranostics, the under-representation of these need urgent rectifying. This project seeks to develop novel MAA cell lines that will aid in developing novel therapies from Jamaican natural products for MAA with PCa, a patient population with the highest incidence and worst mortality rates for PCa.",Novel Prostate Cancer Cell Lines to Address Prostate Cancer Disparity in Black Men,10049160,K43TW011387,"['Africa ', ' Americas ', ' Androgens ', ' Androgenic Agents ', ' Androgenic Compounds ', ' Therapeutic Androgen ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Assay ', ' Bioassay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Biology ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Cell Culture Techniques ', ' cell culture ', ' Cell Death ', ' necrocytosis ', ' Cell Line ', ' CellLine ', ' Strains Cell Lines ', ' cultured cell line ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Chemotactic Factors ', ' Chemoattractants ', ' Chemotaxins ', ' complement chemotactic factor ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay ', ' ELISA ', ' Exhibits ', ' Flow Cytometry ', ' Flow Cytofluorometries ', ' Flow Cytofluorometry ', ' Flow Microfluorimetry ', ' Flow Microfluorometry ', ' flow cytophotometry ', ' formamide ', ' Future ', ' Genotype ', ' Goals ', ' Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Immunohistochemistry ', ' Immunohistochemistry Cell/Tissue ', ' Immunohistochemistry Staining Method ', ' Incidence ', ' Jamaica ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' mortality ', ' Persons ', ' Patients ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Starvation ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Universities ', ' Vendor ', ' Caucasians ', ' Caucasian ', ' Caucasian Race ', ' Caucasoid ', ' Caucasoid Race ', ' Occidental ', ' white race ', ' Work ', ' cytokine ', ' base ', ' Microscope ', ' Grana ', ' Death Rate ', ' Caribbean ', ' Caribbean Sea Region ', ' West Indies Region ', ' Caribbean region ', ' Training ', ' Blood Serum ', ' Serum ', ' Failure ', ' African ', ' European ', ' Chromosomal, Gene, or Protein Abnormality ', ' Cytogenetic or Molecular Genetic Abnormality ', ' Genetic Abnormality ', ' molecular aberrations ', ' Molecular Abnormality ', ' Oncology Cancer ', ' Oncology ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Therapeutic Agents ', ' Morphology ', ' tool ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Prostate ', ' Malignant prostatic tumor ', ' Prostate CA ', ' Prostate Cancer ', ' Prostatic Cancer ', ' Malignant neoplasm of prostate ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' System ', ' Country ', ' Viral ', ' Best Practice Analysis ', ' Benchmarking ', ' American ', ' Lytotoxicity ', ' cytotoxicity ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' cell immortalization ', ' novel ', ' Reporting ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' deprivation ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Address ', ' Luminescence Measurements ', ' Luminescent Assays ', ' Luminescent Techniques ', ' Luminescent Measurements ', ' Molecular Biology Techniques ', ' Preclinical Models ', ' Pre-Clinical Model ', ' Cancer Cause ', ' Cancer Etiology ', ' Cancer Patient ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Fox Chase Cancer Center ', ' Tumor Biology ', ' Tumor Subtype ', ' Molecular ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' preclinical ', ' pre-clinical ', ' PC-3 ', ' PC-3 cell line ', ' PC3 ', ' PC3 cell line ', ' anti-cancer research ', ' cancer research ', ' anticancer research ', ' Advanced Development ', ' DU-145 ', ' DU145 ', ' LNCaP ', ' Outcome ', ' Cancer cell line ', ' Population ', ' migration ', ' cancer disparity ', ' disparity in cancer ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' Cellular model ', ' Cell model ', ' preclinical research ', ' pre-clinical research ', ' chemotherapy ', ' new drug treatments ', ' new drugs ', ' new therapeutics ', ' new therapy ', ' next generation therapeutics ', ' novel drug treatments ', ' novel drugs ', ' novel therapy ', ' novel therapeutics ', ' comparative ', ' tumor ', ' patient population ', ' standard of care ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' compare efficacy ', ' comparative efficacy ', ' theranostics ', ' prostate tumor cell ', ' prostate cancer cell ', ' prostate tumor model ', ' prostate cancer model ', ' prostate cancer cell line ', ' Natural Products ', ' Jamaican ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' experimental study ', ' Drug Screening ', ' ']",FIC,UNIVERSITY OF THE WEST INDIES,K43,2020,111236,-0.04148207875183968
"Novel mechanism controlling calcium signaling to treat and prevent neurodegeneration in early stage glaucoma Project Summary/Abstract The proposal is in response to NEI's strategic plan, described recently by NEI in “Vision Research: Needs, Gaps, and Opportunities”, and focuses on our most recent discoveries of a novel neuronal mechanism rooted at the intersection of aging and the biological mechanisms of eye disease identified as a high programmatic priority. The proposed research targets a novel mechanism of neuroprotection utilizing intracellular calcium channels as drug targets to treat neurodegeneration in glaucoma. Specifically, we plan to determine mechanisms of action and to measure preservation of neuronal viability and function in model systems of glaucoma. The proposed research will allow us to generate preclinical data needed for the development of novel neuroprotectants to complement existing therapies targeting intraocular pressure: The intracellular free Ca2+ concentration of retinal ganglion cells like in other neurons of the CNS is highly regulated and subject to dysregulation during aging. For the development of acute and chronic degenerative diseases including glaucoma reducing the viability and function of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) several studies indicate that both changes in intracellular second messenger concentration and pathological increases in the intracellular Ca2+ concentration promote pathogenesis. The present application will test the hypothesis that Ca2+ signaling of RGCs is functionally regulated by an immediate early gene product upregulated in RGCs after a neurodegenerative insult to generate a cellular defense mechanism. This hypothesis is based on strong preliminary evidence that normal aging of the retina is mechanistically similar to glaucoma disease processes and can be exploited to devise novel treatments for glaucoma. The proposed experiments designed to test this hypothesis will investigate the molecular, cellular and functional mechanisms underlying this interaction under experimentally induced disease conditions in models of glaucoma. The overall goal of the proposed study is to identify a novel mechanism of RGC neuroprotection and determine its potential as a strategy for neuroprotective therapies targeting RGCs. This therapy approach will have the potential to be both preventative and therapeutic in nature and to complement existing treatment designs and rationales. Project Narrative Degeneration or acute damage of nerve cells in the retina as seen in glaucoma is a major cause of visual loss and blindness in the United States and worldwide. As these diseases affect significant and increasing portions of the U.S. population including minorities affected by disparities in health care delivery, determining causes, mechanisms of action and subsequently potential treatment strategies will contribute to improving health care, health and performance requiring visual tasks. The present application uses a novel mechanism underlying a self-defense mechanism of the retina to develop such new treatment strategies and is in response to the NEI's strategic plan, described recently by NEI in “Vision Research: Needs, Gaps, and Opportunities”.",Novel mechanism controlling calcium signaling to treat and prevent neurodegeneration in early stage

"Molecular causes and mechanistic underpinning of breast cancer racial disparity ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): African American (AA) women are more likely to have aggressive breast cancer (BC) and experience greater mortality rates as compared to Caucasian (CA) women. Another upsetting fact is that this cancer outcome gap has continued to widen over past several years underscoring the immediate need to make progress in this area. It is being increasingly appreciated that tumor microenvironment (TME) may play an important role in BC racial disparity; however, underlying molecular and mechanistic basis is not clearly understood. This project is built upon our novel findings suggesting the existence of a TME-tumor cell interaction-driven regulatory loop, which is predominantly active in AA patients. We demonstrate that 1) serum levels of inflammatory cytokines, resistin and IL6, are significantly elevated in AA BC patients compared to their CA counterparts, 2) AA BCs have significantly greater expression and phosphorylation of STAT3 compared to CA BCs, 3) treatment of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cell lines from both AA and CA patients with resistin promotes expression of STAT3/pSTAT3 and enhances IL6 production, thus suggesting a dominant role of differential TME in overall disease outcome, 4) IL6 mediates the effect of resistin on STAT3 phosphorylation, 5) resistin promotes aggressive tumor phenotypes and therapy-resistance in BC cells through STAT3 induction, 6) resistin also upregulates LIN28A, a regulator of stemness, and downregulates let-7 miRNA, and 7) LIN28A silencing abrogates resistin-induced upregulation of IL6, pSTAT3 and STAT3. Based on these findings, we hypothesize that intrinsic differences in tumor biology contributes to BC racial disparity and resistin-LIN28A-(IL6)- STAT3/pSTAT3 serves as an important regulatory loop controlling the aggressive and therapy-resistant phenotypes of BC cells. This hypothesis will be tested in three specific aims. In aim 1, we will characterize the molecular mechanisms underlying resistin-LIN28A-(IL6)-STAT3/pSTAT3 regulatory loop by examining the pathways regulating resistin-induced LIN28A expression, and whether LIN28A mediates resistin-induced let-7 downregulation, which then leads to STAT3 and IL6 upregulation in BC cells. In aim 2, we will examine the functional significance of this regulatory by using luciferase-tagged, control or LIN28A-/STAT3-silenced BC cell lines and characterize the response of resistin and its downstream effectors on growth, metastasis and therapy-resistance in an orthotopic nude mice model. In aim 3, we will determine the clinical relevance of the components of resistin-LIN28A-(IL6)-STAT3/pSTAT3 regulatory loop in BC racial disparity by examining their expression in clinical samples and assessing their correlation (alone and in combination) with TME and tumor cell characteristics as well as with race and patient's survival. Together, these studies will provide novel insight into molecular causes and mechanistic underpinning of BC racial disparity and provide novel set of biomarkers and potential drug-targets to develop novel ways for reducing the widening gaps in clinical outcome of AA and CA BC patients. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Cancer health disparities represent a major public health concern in the United States and there is a clear perception that these disparities exist at the molecular level and tumor microenvironment (TME) plays an important role. The proposed research will characterize TME-tumor cell interaction-driven molecular cross-talk and confirm its functional and clinical relevance in racially-disparate clinical outcomes of breast cancer (aggressiveness and therapeutic-resistance) between Caucasian (CA) and American (AA) patients. Anticipated findings will be helpful in understanding the molecular and mechanistic basis of breast cancer racial disparity, reveal therapeutically-significant intervention points and identify a novel set of mechanistically-linked biomarkers to serve as risk-predictors and molecular sub-classifiers of disease and thus ultimately be helpful in reducing the observed cancer outcome gaps.",Molecular

"Targeting CRLF2 and Ikaros Alterations to Reduce Health Disparities in Childhood Leukemia SUMMARY  Hispanic children are more likely to develop acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL), and when this occurs they are 39% more likely to die than non-Hispanic Whites. This disparity is due, in part, to a subtype of B-cell precursor ALL (B-ALL) that occurs five times more frequently among Hispanic children than others and has a high relapse rate. This type of leukemia, called CRLF2 B-ALL, is characterized by two genetic alterations: a) overexpression of the cytokine receptor, CRLF2, and b) deletion or inactivation of one allele of the Ikaros (IKZF1) tumor suppressor which is strongly associated with relapse. Our overall hypothesis is that combination therapy that selectively targets the pathways that are deregulated in CRLF2 B-ALL (CRLF2 and Ikaros) will produce a superior therapeutic effect and decrease mortality to reduce the health disparity in survival for Hispanic children with ALL. When the CRLF2 receptor is activated by its ligand, TSLP, downstream pathways (JAK/STAT and PI3/AKT/mTOR) that promote leukemia cell survival, proliferation, and chemoresistance are induced through processes normally kept in check by the Ikaros tumor suppressor. Preliminary data from our team show that treatment with the CK2-specific inhibitor, CX-4945, restores Ikaros tumor suppressor function in high-risk B-ALL from Hispanic patients with deletion of one Ikaros allele, exerting a strong in vivo therapeutic effect. Preclinical studies of CRLF2 B-ALL typically use patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models, where primary leukemia cells from patients with CRLF2 B-ALL are injected into immune deficient mice. Our preliminary data show that mouse TSLP does not activate human CRLF2, making the current PDX models suboptimal for studies of CRLF2 B-ALL. To overcome this obstacle our team engineered immune deficient mice that provide normal human serum levels of human TSLP (+T mice) and generated PDX by injecting these mice with CRLF2 B-ALL cells from Hispanic pediatric patients (+T PDX). Analysis of +T PDX shows CRLF2 activation and gene expression that is more similar to original patient sample than standard PDX. Our preliminary data provide a rationale for novel therapy that targets pathways that are induced by CRLF2 (JAK-STAT5 and PI3K/AKT/mTOR) and by loss of Ikaros tumor suppressor activity using our newly- developed preclinical model for Hispanic CRLF2 B-ALL. To test our hypothesis we will: Aim 1: Establish the in vivo therapeutic efficacy of targeting CRLF2 downstream pathways and their role in CRLF2 B-ALL in Hispanic pediatric patients. Aim 2: Evaluate the in vivo efficacy and mechanisms of combination therapy that restores Ikaros tumor suppressor activity and inhibits the mTOR pathway in Hispanic pediatric CRLF2 B-ALL. The proposed studies use precision medicine approaches (targeting specific pathways and/or functional defects) in context of the health disparity background to develop a novel treatment for CRLF2 B-ALL and reduce childhood cancer health disparities. NARRATIVE   Hispanic children are more likely to develop acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) and when they do they have a 39% higher death rate than non-Hispanic Whites. A contributor to this disparity is a sub-type of high-risk ALL that occurs five times more frequently in Hispanic/Latino children than others. The proposed studies use precision medicine approaches to target the specific genetic alterations responsible for this high-risk sub-type of ALL in a novel in vivo preclinical model that allows therapies to be evaluated in context of the health disparity genetic background.",Targeting CRLF2 and Ikaros Alterations to Reduce Health Disparities in Childhood Leukemia,9969052,R01CA209829,"['novel

"Determining Enhanced Inflammatory B cell Function in African Americans with MS Why African American and Latin Americans present with greater multiple sclerosis (MS) disease severity has not been investigated beyond retrospective clinical chart review, and risk association studies. B cells inform MS diagnostic, severity and prognostic assessments through their immunobiological activity. Thanks to the dramatic efficacy of B cell depletion therapy, we now know that B cells are principal drivers of MS clinical activity. We propose that B cell-based, ancestry-dependent functional difference in MS holds clinically valuable mechanistic insight. Such insight would be supportive of an emergent pattern where ancestry-mediated immunobiological differences underlie ancestry-disparate clinical severity, heterogeneity and prevalence. In this study, we test our hypothesis that MS patients of African ancestry possess greater T- dependent inflammatory B cell function relative to those of Caucasian ancestry. Our preliminary findings support this hypothesis. At steady-state ex vivo (directly from subject peripheral blood) circulating antibody secreting cell (ASC) subset frequencies are increased in BA/LAwMS relative to CAwMS. Further, isolated B cells more readily differentiate into ASCs compared to CAwMS upon in vitro T-dependent stimulation. These differences are absent amongst healthy donors. Our preliminary findings imply that underlying ancestry-mediated differences drive B cell differentiation toward ASC fate. We will specify mechanisms associated with these findings, ultimately applying fine-resolution SNP-based ancestral analysis to ex vivo and in vitro assay readouts. Specifically, we will conduct longitudinal ex vivo assessment of ASC as well as antigen presenting function-associated proteins on memory B cells. We will also delineate in vitro T-dependent and T-independent ASC differentiation, expression of class- switched memory B cell inflammatory products and enhanced STAT3 signaling amongst this population. This project (1) directly investigates inflammatory B-cell function comparing BA/LAwMS and CAwMS for the first time, and (2) builds upon a nascent paradigm (to our knowledge) initially demonstrated in limited fashion within systemic lupus erythematosus. Our project thus fits key criteria of the R21 mechanism by nuancing the emergent idea of B cell-driven ancestry- dependent disease disparity. As for impacting clinical research, our project is in-line with current and future precision medicine initiatives geared towards identifying and responding to biological variation across formerly subsumed or otherwise underrepresented ethnic groups. Individuals of Black African or Latin American ancestry are more likely than Caucasians to experience aggressive forms of various diseases; including the cancer multiple myeloma, and autoimmune diseases such as multiple sclerosis (MS) and lupus (SLE). The inflammatory function of B cells, potent white blood cells in our immune systems, are centrally important to each of these diseases. In this proposal, we test the hypothesis that individuals of African ancestry with MS possess B cells with greater T-dependent inflammatory B cell function compared to Caucasian Americans with

"Combinatorial Actions of Genetic Variants and Gender Bias of Alzherimer's Disease PROJECT ABSTRACT Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is conventionally characterized by specific neuropathological features, including the appearance of extracellular amyloid deposits and the accumulation of intracellular neurofibrillary tangles. While several gene mutations are clearly associated with early onset Alzheimer’s disease, the large number of individuals exhibiting delayed onset, aging-associated AD, are likely to harbor many alterations in linked modifier genes that predispose to AD susceptibility. Genetic and genome wide association studies (GWAS) have identified numerous genes and risk alleles that indicate both cell autonomous and non-cell autonomous mechanisms contributing to loss of neurons and cognitive decline. In this regard, the majority of risk variants identified by GWAS reside in non-coding regions of the genome, implying that they act in part to alter gene expression. This proposal responds to the RFA indicating a particular need for approaches designed to delineate the transcriptional and cellular consequences of combinations of SNPs in the risk alleles by generating new cell line reagents to help unravel the question of the causative SNPs and their target genes in specific neurons derived from iPS cells of AD individuals. There are two features of sporadic AD that require molecular explanation- the potential role of aging in AD susceptibility, and the striking gender disparity, with the incidence of AD being exaggerated in females. These issues can only now be addressed based on new technologies and the availability of patient-derived samples. Our proposed research plan takes advantage of the invaluable samples stored at the brain bank of the Shiley-Marcos Alzheimer's Disease Research Center (ADRC) at UCSD, and the iPSC-derived neurons (Salk). This approach will interrogate the effects of different genetic variants with other risk factors (e.g. age, sex), and assess their effects on cell type-specific enhancer landscapes. By merging these data, we can begin to identify the potential causative SNPs that result in altered function of cell-type specific enhancers. We propose using a high throughput 4C screening approach (UMI-4C), and Hi-ChIP, to identify the most likely causative, enhancer-associated SNPs for functionally-implicated coding target genes. Exploiting the power of contemporary gene editing approaches in control or patient-derived iPS cells to specific neuronal cell types, and to astroglia, we can assess the transcriptional phenotypes and functional behaviors of neurons harboring different combinations of risk alleles, both in the isolated cell lines alone and in combination with coculture experiments with astroglia and microglia, as effects of these SNPs may be manifest only with astroglial:neuronal interactions. Together these studies will use powerful contemporary global genomic approaches to determine the coding transcriptional targets of several of the most significant SNPs in enhancers, and the link to roles of estrogen receptor in the gender disparity for AD.

"Pregnancy-induced T cell exhaustion: an opportunity to reduce immunosuppression PROJECT SUMMARY (ABSTRACT) Pregnancy is a common alloimmunizing event that impacts transplant access and outcomes among women. Although T cells of the maternal immune system are routinely activated by fetal alloantigen, it is unclear whether T cells stimulated by fetal antigen differentiate into canonical memory cells during pregnancy. The long-term fate and recall potential of these antigen-experienced T cells in the maternal repertoire are of particular importance to female transplant recipients, whose T cells may be capable of rapid rejection of a donor organ that shares tissue antigens with a prior pregnancy. Unfortunately, our poor understanding of T cell fate in women with a history of pregnancy has contributed to significant gender disparity in transplantation. Preliminary data in our mouse model suggest that fetal antigen during pregnancy promotes the differentiation of CD8+ T cells that persist in the maternal repertoire but have restricted functionality. While these T cells can still mediate rapid allograft rejection, they appear to be distinct from memory T cells that differentiate during other types of alloimmunization. Different populations of antigen-experienced T cells in alloimmunized transplant recipients may have unique requirements for immunosuppression. In this proposal, we will investigate how populations of antigen-experienced T cells induced by either pregnancy or transplantation differ from one another (Aim 1) and determine whether these differences promote immunosuppression reduction strategies in women (Aim 2). We anticipate that the knowledge generated by these studies will alter current immunosuppression strategies to improve the care of alloimmunized transplant recipients.

"Novel strategies for storage and recovery of cadaveric bone marrow stem cells ABSTRACT Bone marrow represents a rich source of diverse stem, progenitor and other cells of clinical and research interest including hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) and mesenchymal stem cells (MSC), dendritic cells, T-cells, natural killer (NK) cells, B-cells and others. Currently, these cells are only recovered from living donors through bone marrow aspiration or peripheral blood mobilization. Ossium Health is developing the first clinical and research bank of bone marrow derived cells from deceased organ and tissue donors. While the concept of utilizing this resource for bone marrow cells was first described over 60 years ago, the ability to recover viable material efficiently and the infrastructure necessary to achieve this at even a modest scale simply has not existed. Ossium Health has overcome this by establishing a robust ecosystem comprised of a world-class tissue processor (and Phase III partner), major organ procurement agencies and innovation to, for the first time, allow recovery and banking of this plentiful source of potentially life-saving cells. However, for this bank to reach its full potential, further efficiencies must be advanced and implemented. This Phase II study aims to develop “smart baking” innovations by optimizing methods of cryopreserving intact marrow in situ within whole bones to allow time for infectious disease, sterility and HLA testing prior to investing in fully processing donor bones to isolate cellular components. This innovative work will also provide early guidance towards cryopreservation of more complex tissues such as vascular composite allografts (VCA). The resulting technology from this study may increase efficiency by as much as 80% - drastically reducing cost and allowing more readily available and less expensive clinical grade and high-quality research material to be available to meet the growing demands of gene therapy, tissue engineering and basic science investigation. NARRATIVE Bone marrow is a rich source of many cell types with the potential to address numerous currently intractable diseases. Many studies have demonstrated the need for a large and genetically diverse source of these cells as well as the therapeutic benefits of minimally manipulating the cells before treating patients. Ossium Health has developed a robust system for obtaining living bone marrow cells from the 60,000 donors each year who gift organs and tissues following their death. Ossium is proposing to develop innovative methods that will reduce the costs of deceased donor bone marrow cell isolation, resulting in <1/3 the cost and <1/5 the time to process each specimen. These life-saving and life-enhancing cells will be banked and made available to physicians and biomedical researchers for treating seriously ill patients and discovering new cures.",Novel strategies for storage and recovery of cadaveric bone marrow stem cells,9910145,R44HL142418,"['Adoption ', ' B-Lymphocytes ', ' B blood cells ', ' B cell ', ' B cells ', ' B-Cells ', ' B-cell ', ' Blood Banks ', ' Blood Vessels ', ' vascular ', ' bone ', ' Bone Marrow ', ' Bone Marrow Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Bone Marrow Cells ', ' Bone Marrow Blood-Deriving Cell ', ' Bone Marrow Blood-Forming Cell ', ' Bone Marrow Transplantation ', ' Bone Marrow Grafting ', ' Bone Marrow Transplant ', ' Marrow Transplantation ', ' Cadaver ', ' Cell Separation ', ' Cell Isolation ', ' Cell Segregation ', ' Cell Separation Technology ', ' cell sorting ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' children ', "" childrens' "", ' youngster ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Communicable Diseases ', ' Infectious Disease Pathway ', ' Infectious Diseases ', ' Infectious Disorder ', ' Complement ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Cryopreservation ', ' Cryofixation ', ' cold preservation ', ' cold storage ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Dendritic Cells ', ' Veiled Cells ', ' Dimethyl Sulfoxide ', ' DMSO ', ' Demasorb ', ' Demeso ', ' Dimethylsulphinyl ', ' Dimethylsulphoxide ', ' Domoso ', ' Dromisol ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' gene therapy ', ' DNA Therapy ', ' Gene Transfer Clinical ', ' Genetic Intervention ', ' gene-based therapy ', ' genetic therapy ', ' genomic therapy ', ' Health ', ' Hematopoietic stem cells ', ' Blood Precursor Cell ', ' Hematopoietic Progenitor Cells ', ' blood stem cell ', ' hematopoietic progenitor ', ' hematopoietic stem progenitor cell ', ' hemopoietic progenitor ', ' hemopoietic stem cell ', ' HLA Antigens ', ' HL-A Antigens ', ' Human Leukocyte Antigens ', ' Leukocyte Antigens ', ' Hospitals ', ' Industrialization ', ' Natural Killer Cells ', ' Cytotoxic cell ', ' K lymphocyte ', ' NK Cells ', ' Manuals ', ' Methods ', ' Mus ', ' Mice ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Murine ', ' Organ Donor ', ' Organ Procurements ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Production ', ' Ramp ', ' Registries ', ' Reproducibility of Results ', ' Reproducibility of Findings ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Savings ', ' stem cells ', ' Progenitor Cells ', ' T-Lymphocyte ', ' T-Cells ', ' thymus derived lymphocyte ', ' Technology ', ' Time ', ' Tissue Donors ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' United States Health Resources and Services Administration ', ' HRSA ', ' Health Resources and Services Administration ', ' Vacuum ', ' Genetic Variation ', ' Genetic Diversity ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Generations ', ' Cost Savings ', ' Ecologic Systems ', ' Ecological Systems ', ' Ecosystem ', ' Cord Blood ', ' fetal cord blood ', ' Umbilical Cord Blood ', ' injuries ', ' Injury ', ' Organ ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Biological Substance Banks ', ' biological specimen repository ', ' biosample repository ', ' biospecimen repository ', ' specimen bank ', ' specimen repository ', ' Biological Specimen Banks ', ' Vertebral Body ', ' vertebra body ', ' hemopoietic ', ' Hematopoietic ', ' peripheral blood ', ' Recovery ', ' HSC transplantation ', ' Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplant ', ' Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation ', ' Bone Banks ', ' Therapeutic Research ', ' Therapeutic Human Experimentation ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Living Donors ', ' Research Specimen ', ' Specimen ', ' Aspirate ', ' Aspirate substance ', ' Marrow ', ' Life ', ' BMCELLTY ', ' Bone Marrow Cellularity ', ' Bone Marrow Aspiration ', ' Investigation ', ' Complex ', ' In Situ ', ' Source ', ' cell type ', ' System ', ' Allografting ', ' interest ', ' bioengineered tissue ', ' engineered tissue ', ' Tissue Engineering ', ' sterile ', ' Sterility ', ' novel ', ' Basic Research ', ' Basic Science ', ' Modeling ', ' Gifts ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Mesenchymal Progenitor Cell ', ' Mesenchymal Stem Cells ', ' Address ', ' Bone Marrow Stem Cell ', ' Cryopreserved Cell ', ' Process ', ' cost ', ' Minority ', ' new approaches ', ' novel approaches ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel strategies ', ' protective effect ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' trial comparing ', ' progenitor ', ' stem ', ' phase II study ', ' phase 2 study ', ' HLA testing ', ' HLA typing ', ' human leukocyte antigen typing ', ' human leukocyte antigen testing ', ' Infrastructure ', ' ']",NHLBI,"OSSIUM HEALTH, INC.",R44,2020,727721,0.1717387726791897
"Diversity Supplement ABSTRACT The overall goal of this project is to define how interactions between breast stem cells and environmental stressors drive the biological basis of racial disparities in triple negative breast cancers (TNBCs). TNBC incidence in African American women is two to three-fold higher than in European Americans. The biological mechanisms underlying this striking disparity are not well understood. Our preliminary data identifies widespread racial disparities in exposure to a multitude of environmental toxicants including phthalates and parabens. The breast cancer windows of susceptibility hypothesis states that environmental exposures in utero, or during puberty and pregnancy, disproportionately increase breast cancer risk. Exposures during windows of susceptibility could modify risk by the increasing the number of stem cells, altering stem cell epigenetic reprogramming, or by otherwise changing stem cell biology. Using single cell RNA expression profiling, we have identified a rare breast stem cell population with hybrid epithelial/mesenchymal characteristics and an RNA expression pattern resembling TNBCs. What factors regulate these cells, including the influence of race/ethnicity or environmental exposures, are unknown. The objective of this proposal to dissect the role of stem cells and the environment in the biology of TNBC racial disparities. We will experimentally challenge normal human breast stem cells isolated from epidemiologically well characterized women ex vivo with prototypical toxicants and toxicants prioritized because of racial exposure disparities. Our central hypothesis is that differences in normal stem cell biology, attributable to either genetic or environmental factors (or a gene-environment interaction), underlie TNBC disparities. We will test this hypothesis with three Specific Aims: (1) Test for differences in normal breast stem cell biology in African American and European American women by single cell RNA sequencing, three-dimensional ex vivo culture, and epigenomic profiling. (2) Define the disparities in exposure to environmental toxicants between African American and European American women in a nationally representative dataset. (3) Test for differential effects of environmental toxicants on African American and European American breast stem cells. This interdisciplinary study will use state-of-the-art techniques which integrate basic breast stem cell biology with exposure assessment, environmental epidemiology, and toxicology. We expect that the findings from this study will provide significant impact for reduction of TNBC incidence and mortality by defining the factors that cause TNBC disparities, providing actionable targets for precision breast cancer prevention. PROJECT NARRATIVE African American women are two to three times more likely than European American women to get the most aggressive subtype of breast cancer, but the reasons for this disparity are not well understood. This project investigates how breast stem cells behave differently in African American and European American women when exposed to environmental chemicals. Results from this study could identify new methods of cancer prevention to eliminate these breast cancer disparities.",Diversity Supplement,9943383,R01ES028802,"['malignant breast neoplasm ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Environment ', ' Environmental Exposure ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiologic ', ' epidemiological ', ' Epithelium ', ' Epithelium Part ', ' Goals ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Hybrids ', ' Incidence ', ' Methods ', ' mortality ', ' Parabens ', ' Pregnancy ', ' Gestation ', ' Puberty ', ' Race ', ' Racial Group ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' stem cells ', ' Progenitor Cells ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Toxic Environmental Substances ', ' Environmental Toxin ', ' Toxic Environmental Agents ', ' environmental toxicant ', ' Toxicology ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Transcription ', ' Woman ', ' Afro American ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Black Populations ', ' black American ', ' African American ', ' phthalates ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Biological ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Predisposition ', ' Epithelial ', ' European ', ' Interdisciplinary Research ', ' Multidisciplinary Collaboration ', ' Multidisciplinary Research ', ' Interdisciplinary Study ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' mammary cancer prevention ', ' mammary tumor prevention ', ' prevent breast cancer ', ' Breast Cancer Prevention ', ' cancer prevention ', ' Genetic ', ' Exposure to ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' 3-D ', ' 3D ', ' three dimensional ', ' 3-Dimensional ', ' American ', ' environmental stressor ', ' Gene x Environment Interaction ', ' GxE interaction ', ' environment effect on gene ', ' gene environment interaction ', ' toxicant ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' exposed in utero ', ' fetal exposure ', ' in utero exposure ', ' intra-uterine environmental exposure ', ' intrauterine environmental exposure ', ' prenatally exposed ', ' prenatal exposure ', ' breast cancer risk ', ' Breast Cancer Risk Factor ', ' Data ', ' Mesenchymal ', ' Environmental Epidemiology ', ' Epigenetic ', ' Epigenetic Change ', ' Epigenetic Mechanism ', ' Epigenetic Process ', ' Characteristics ', ' TNBC ', ' triple-negative breast cancer ', ' triple-negative invasive breast carcinoma ', ' epigenomics ', ' cancer disparity ', ' disparity in cancer ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' environmental chemical ', ' stem cell biology ', ' stem cell population ', ' disparities in race ', ' race disparity ', ' racial disparity ', ' Expression Profiling ', ' scRNA-seq ', ' single cell RNA-seq ', ' single cell RNAseq ', ' single-cell RNA sequencing ', ' Biology ', ' Breast ', ' ']",NIEHS,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2020,37968,-0.029601230102716567
"The Role of the Mutant p53-PARP-MCM Pathway in Triple Negative Breast Cancer Project Summary: The Role of the Mutant p53-PARP-MCM Pathway in Triple Negative Breast Cancer Mutant p53 (mtp53) is found in 80% of triple negative breast cancers (TNBCs). There is a need to increase understanding of mtp53 signaling in TNBC in order to determine strategies to detect and treat the disease. TNBCs are more common in African American women than in white women and therefore the proposed work will benefit all women with TNBC including the AA over-represented population. This application proposes to determine the biological role of TNBC-associated gain-of-function oncogenic mtp53 R273H that is associated with PARP1 (herein referred to as PARP) protein, MCM2-7 helicases and replicating DNA. The p53 Arg 273 substituted with His, and other hotspot p53 missense mutant proteins, are well known to function as oncogenic proteins in TNBCs, but their functions outside of acting as aberrant transcription co-factors are not clearly understood. The R273H mtp53 is present in high levels on chromatin in many TNBCs and works as a co-factor to activate the transcription of sterol biosynthesis genes and chromatin remodeling factors, but incredibly R273H also co-associates with PARP and MCMs on replicating DNA. Our studies have uncovered this novel replication- associated pathway and we call it the mtp53-PARP-MCM chromatin axis. Our preliminary and published data reports that knockdown of mtp53 R273H reduces chromatin associated MCM2-7 and PARP. Knockdown of mtp53 in this setting decreases combined PARP inhibitor (PARPi) talazoparib plus DNA damaging agent temozolomide-mediated cell death, demonstrating that mtp53 expression influences the sensitivity of cancer cells to synergistic PARPi plus DNA damage mediated cell killing. Our preliminary and published data showed nuclear mtp53 R273H co-associates with PARP and MCMs and mtp53 R273H directly associates with EdU at nascent replication forks. Furthermore, we detected high mtp53 R273H, high PARP protein, and high PARP enzymatic activity in patient derived xenograft tissue expressing R273H mtp53. We also detected high co-association of mtp53 and PARP in TNBC in a preliminary tumor microarray screen as well as through analysis of The Cancer Genome Atlas reverse phase protein data sets. As a result, we consider understanding the biology of chromatin-associated mtp53-PARP-MCM complexes on replicating DNA to be an area of inquiry that will have a sustained long-term influence on our understanding, detection, and treatment choices for TNBC in diverse populations of women. The mtp53-PARP-MCM axis in TNBC is an innovative pathway and elucidating the mechanistic relationship of the proteins working together in replication-associated activities will help us to better understand the disease. Our hypothesis is that stable mtp53 interacts with replicating DNA during replication stress using amino acids from its carboxy-terminal regions. As a consequence, the mtp53-PARP-MCM axis is engaged allowing increased recruitment of protein complexes and sensitivity to PARP inhibitors combined with DNA damaging agents. We will test this hypothesis by the following three aims. Aim 1: Elucidate the role and mechanism of the TNBC-associated oncogenic mtp53- PARP-MCM axis. Aim 2: Increase our understanding of co-expression of mtp53 and PARP using novel imaging platforms in xenograft mouse models and screening of multiethnic human breast tissue microarrays to benefit all women with TNBC. Aim 3: Validate the driver role of the mtp53-PARP-MCM axis influencing PARPi outcomes in orthotopic mouse models. Completing this work will provide mechanistic insights on how mtp53 cross-talks with PARP and MCM proteins on chromatin in cell culture and xenograft models, and will inform the potential of using novel imaging agents to detect nuclear co-expression of mtp53 and PARP as informative biomarkers for TNBC. Approximately 80 % of triple negative breast cancers have mutations in the gene for the tumor suppressor p53 (TP53) and these cancers are aggressive and disproportionately affect the African American (AA) community. The proposed work will benefit all women with TNBC which would include the AA over-represented population. We discovered a set of interactions in human Triple Negative Breast Cancer (TNBC) cells between mutant p53 (mtp53), PARP, and MCM proteins which exists as a mtp53-PARP-MCM chromatin axis on replicating DNA. Understanding the mechanisms involved in mtp53 engaging more PARP and MCM proteins on chromatin during DNA damage, and testing for detection of mtp53 and PARP in TNBC, offer opportunities to expand TNBC knowledge. Completing this work will provide mechanistic insights on how mtp53 cross-talks with PARP and MCM proteins on chromatin in cell culture, xenograft models, and patient tissue. These studies will inform the potential of using the mtp53-PARP-MCM chromatin axis as a diagnostic and therapeutic (theranostic) hub, to detect and target nuclear co- expression of the biomarkers

"Onset and biomarkers for progression of monoclonal gammopathies PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Multiple myeloma (MM) is a life-threatening plasma cell malignancy. It is 2-3 times more common in blacks compared with whites. MM has a prolonged clinically detectable premalignant phase called monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) that can be identified by detection of the secreted monoclonal immunoglobulin (commonly referred to as a monoclonal protein). MM is a serious incurable malignancy, and the best approach for treatment is to prevent end organ damage by early intervention. This is best done by targeting patients with an intermediate asymptomatic stage referred to as smoldering multiple myeloma (SMM) that resides between MGUS and MM. Over the last 5 years of this grant we have extensively investigated the reasons why MM is more common in blacks compared with whites, demonstrated that first- degree relatives of patients with MM have a high risk of having the precursor MGUS lesion, and identified several biomarkers that predict risk of imminent progression in SMM. Our studies show that a principal reason for high risk of MM in African Americans is that they have a high risk of the precursor MGUS condition, which we also found is present at a much earlier in age in blacks compared with whites. More recently we made an important discovery using DNA sequencing based ancestry analysis that 3 specific cytogenetic abnormalities in MM account for most of the racial disparity. Our research has assumed greater urgency with recent findings that early intervention (in high-risk SMM stage) can prevent end-organ damage and prolong overall survival. The goals of this renewal are to further determine the mechanisms behind the racial disparity in incidence of MM, to identify new biomarkers for high risk SMM needing therapy, and to develop a feasible screening strategy to identify patients with SMM. In Aim 1 we will determine the age at onset of MGUS using sensitive, mass spectrometry (MS)-based detection of monoclonal protein in >12,000 NHANES samples, and identify new cytogenetic abnormalities that are associated with predisposition to MM in blacks. In Aim 2 we will identify new biomarkers that are associated with high risk of progression from SMM to symptomatic MM, specifically utilizing mass spectroscopic characterization of the monoclonal protein, measurement of circulating clonal plasma cells, and by studying clonal diversity and immune profile. In Aim 3, we will institute and determine the feasibility and impact of a screening approach for identification of SMM eligible for early intervention, by targeting high risk populations, specifically African Americans, first-degree relatives, and persons with high total protein levels. Our grant will have a major impact on the management of patients with SMM and MM, especially African Americans and first-degree relatives or persons with MM. PROJECT NARRATIVE Multiple myeloma (MM) is a life-threatening plasma cell malignancy that is 2-3 times more common in African Americans, and is preceded by an asymptomatic stage called smoldering multiple myeloma (SMM) amenable to early therapy.

In Aim 1, we will apply state-of-the-art statistical genomic and computational tools to extremely large human multi-ethnic population-based datasets containing hundreds of thousands of individuals with red blood cell traits (hemoglobin, hematocrit, RBC count, MCV, MCH, MCHC, red cell distribution width or RDW) and whole genome sequence (WGS) data (the NHLBI TOPMed WGS project) or GWAS data (Blood Cell Consortium or BCX and UK Biobank) to provide updated analysis, discovery, and interpretation of results for common, low-frequency, and rare genetic variants associated with red blood cell counts and indices. In Aim 2, validation of new red blood cell phenotype-associated genomic loci and genetic variants will occur through a combination of imputation and replication in independent data sets (using TOPMed WGS as imputation reference panel), and/or de novo genotyping or sequence analysis of selected phenotypic samples or pedigrees. We will also provide functional annotation, fine-mapping, and prioritization for new and existing red blood cell trait-associated variants and genes, with an emphasis on new blood cell lineage-specific epigenomic, transcriptomic, and 3D genomic resources, including those becoming available through TOPMed and BLUEPRINT projects. In Aim 3, we will perform functional, cell-based analyses of selected non-coding genomic loci/ variants (~50 per year) identified in Aims 1 and 2 (particularly those that alter canonical transcription factor motifs and demonstrate clinical impact through PheWAS or co-segregation with phenotypic extremes in pedigrees) utilizing a combination of massively parallel reporter assays (MPRA) and CRISPR/Cas9 genomic perturbation to interrogate non-coding genetic variation and thereby provide comprehensive and predictive assessments of regulatory non-coding variation and function. We will disseminate all genomic, annotation, and functional information derived from Aims 1, 2, and 3 to ensure knowledge dissemination to the clinical and scientific community, for discovery, fine-mapping, and investigation of causal genes that underlie red blood cell traits and hematological disorders. PROJECT NARRATIVE This project will lead to improved insight into the genetic basis of hematologic traits and red blood cell disorders. Finding the risk factors and causes of these disorders or traits will lead to new insights into why they occur, and, potentially, how they can be treated.

"Quantifying gene expression and network regulation in single cells to reveal the consequences of stress on the immune response PROJECT SUMMARY  Human health is profoundly affected by genetics and the environment. The social environment mediates changes in physiology, gene regulation, and immune signaling, resulting in significant differences in disease susceptibility and mortality. Chronic social stress and social inequity are major drivers of disease, in part due to effects on the immune response to infectious pathogens. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying these effects are poorly understood. In order to address this gap, robust experimental models for uncovering social environmental effects on the immune system are needed.  Rhesus macaques are primates closely related to humans. In social groups, they maintain stable hierarchies of social dominance, and these hierarchies can be experimentally manipulated through social group rearrangement. Thus, they provide a unique resource to study causal social rank effects on disease. Although significant and substantial gene expression changes in peripheral blood have been found to be associated with social rank, the cell types underlying these signatures are not well-characterized. Single-cell RNA-sequencing enables the discovery of effects of the social environment on individual cells of many kinds, which can help with the targeting of clinically-relevant cell types that are responsible for immune dysregulation. Therefore, this work proposes to study rank effects on gene regulation in individual peripheral blood cells, at baseline and after immune stimulation, to uncover cell-type-specific social stress effects on immunity.  The basic research question driving this proposal is: How does the social environment affect gene expression across diverse peripheral blood immune cells? To answer this question, the approach of this proposal is to use a well-established model of social adversity in captive female rhesus macaques, and to apply next- generation single-cell RNA-seq technology to deeply characterize cells isolated from 50 individuals across a social gradient. From this data, effects of social rank will be examined for: (1) immune composition and LPS- induced polarization, (2) gene expression robustness across cell types, and (3) gene regulatory networks and co-expression modules. Through this work, clinically-relevant genes and pathways will be identified that are rewired by social environment effects, in order to design targeted therapeutics to improve immune responses relevant to cancer and infectious disease. PROJECT NARRATIVE Individuals that experience a high burden of chronic social stress are often at increased risk of immune-related diseases and mortality, some of which is thought to be caused by dysregulation of the immune response to pathogens. In this project, we will use genomic molecular profiling of individual immune cells from rhesus macaques in stable social hierarchies to model human chronic social stress effects on immunity. The results of this work will help us understand significant genome-wide and cell-type-specific effects of stress on homeostatic immunity, immune regulatory networks, and the immune response to stimulation, improving our understanding of how the social environment causally affects health outcomes.",Quantifying gene expression and network regulation in single cells to reveal the consequences

"Stem cell epigenetics in uterine fibroids Project Summary Uterine fibroids (also known as leiomyomas) are the most common tumors in the female reproductive tract. Some estimates indicate that up to 75% of American women have uterine fibroids, depending on race and ethnicity. There is a significant disparity in the incidence of fibroids since African-American women are 2-3 times more likely to develop fibroids, often with earlier onset and greater severity of symptoms. These tumors can be very painful and are the leading cause of hysterectomies in the US. Despite the healthcare burden caused by uterine fibroids, their etiology and pathophysiology are unknown. The vast majority of fibroids either have mutations in Mediator Complex protein 12 (MED12) gene or over-express high mobility group AT hooks (HMGA)1/2 transcription factors, but the molecular mechanism that are disrupted and lead to tumor development or growth are unknown. Another well known characteristic of fibroids is that they are mostly clonal, indicating a single cell of origin for each tumor. Our overarching hypothesis is that the vast majority of uterine fibroids develop from myometrial stem/progenitor cells that have become dysregulated by either MED12 mutation or HMGA1/2 over-expression. Using SUSD2 as a marker, we have enriched for a population of perivascular myometrial cells with all the characteristics of mesenchymal stem cells from both human myometrial and fibroid specimens. The perivascular niche is the most common site for mesenchymal stem cells in many tissues. We have compelling evidence that chromatin compartmentalization is changed in uterine fibroids compared to normal myometrium, which leads to homeotic transformation of the stem cell into a more cervical phenotype. We propose to determine how the epigenetic landscape of the myometrial and fibroid stem cells affects compartmentalization in the stem cells. Once these mechanisms are understood, we will have a better understanding of how disruption of key pathways affect their behavior, with the ultimate goal of identifying targets for therapeutic intervention. Project Narrative Uterine fibroids affect approximately 75% of American women during their reproductive years and are a significant source of pelvic pain, abnormal uterine bleeding, and infertility. Hysterectomy is the only option for relief from these debilitating symptoms for many women. The goals of the proposed studies are to understand the underlying causes of uterine fibroid development and growth so that safe and effective, non-surgical therapeutic options can be developed that will allow women to keep their uterus.",Stem cell epigenetics in uterine fibroids,10051557,R21HD102907,"['Affect ', ' Automobile Driving ', ' driving ', ' Behavior ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Assay ', ' Bioassay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Chromatin ', ' Daughter ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Dysmenorrhea ', ' Menstrual Pain ', ' Painful Menstruation ', ' Endometrium ', ' Female ', ' Fibroblasts ', ' Genes ', ' Goals ', ' Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Growth and Development function ', ' Growth and Development ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Hysterectomy ', ' Incidence ', ' Infertility ', ' Cannot achieve a pregnancy ', ' Difficulty conceiving ', ' fertility cessation ', ' fertility loss ', ' infertile ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Fibroid Tumor ', ' Fibroid ', ' Fibroid Neoplasm ', ' Fibromyoma ', ' Leiomyomatous Neoplasm ', ' Leiomyomatous Tumor ', ' Menstruation ', ' Menses ', ' menstrual period ', ' monthly period ', ' Methylation ', ' Biological Models ', ' Biologic Models ', ' Model System ', ' Morbidity -

"Molecular Classification of High Grade Endometrial Cancers: Extending TCGA Findings to a Diverse Population ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Endometrial cancer is the most common gynecological cancer and incidence is increasing in the United States. It also has one of the largest survival disparities of all common cancers, with approximately 20% fewer African American women surviving 5 years after diagnosis compared to white women, and this disparity holds across stages and histologic subtypes. Here we seek to examine a particularly aggressive subtype of endometrial cancers, high grade tumors including endometrioid, serous, clear cell and mixed carcinomas. These cancers are responsible for a disproportionate number of deaths from endometrial cancer, and are also more frequently diagnosed in African Americans. Specifically, we aim to: 1. Assess progression free survival and endometrial cancer-related survival in 500 women (250 African American, 250 white) diagnosed with high grade endometrial cancers, as defined by current pathologic standards; 2. Molecularly characterize (through whole exome sequencing and gene expression analysis) tumors from these women who received surgical treatment at two large research hospitals in Detroit, Michigan. We will perform integrated analysis to classify the tumors into biologically and clinically relevant groups and 3. Analyze the performance of the molecular classifications with respect to progression free survival and endometrial cancer- related survival, adjusting for relevant demographic, clinical, co-morbidity and treatment information. Preliminary work in this area has been done by The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), but the tumors included were primarily from white women, with only 10 endometrioid and 11 serous tumors from African American women used to inform the molecular reclassification analysis. Thus, our project will address a large gap in current knowledge. Public Health Significance: The identification of novel somatic mutations and understanding of the spectrum of molecular variation, particularly among African Americans, will help us move further toward personalized medicine, with the potential to reduce the racial disparities in endometrial cancer survival and ultimately improve survival for all women with endometrial cancer. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This application seeks to examine genomic variation in high grade endometrial cancers from African American and white women. The racial disparity in survival is one of the greatest of all cancers, and persists after controlling for histology, stage and treatment.

"Novel pro-drug pharmacotherapy to prevent neuronal and cell degeneration in AMD PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Degeneration or acute damage of retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) and nerve cells in the retina due to Age-related Macular Degeneration (AMD) is a major cause of visual loss and blindness in the United States and worldwide. The proposed multidisciplinary research project will focus on the characterization of a novel signaling pathway for and the development of a novel pharmacological intervention to control degeneration of RPE cells and neurons in AMD. To this end, preclinical testing of the new therapeutic strategy will be performed, along with ocular biotransformation, transport and distribution studies, in established models of human AMD. These experiments will determine efficacy of treatment in terminating and/or preventing AMD associated neuronal loss and preservation of visual function, and to generate data to support feasibility for and move positive findings to phase 1 and 2 clinical trials. Specifically, we will test the two-pronged hypothesis that treatment based on the ocular targeting of a novel chemical antioxidant strategy protects RPE cells and neurons from apoptosis by topical delivery in established models of human AMD and, therefore, leads to prevention or improvement of visual impairment and functional deficits associated with AMD. The determination of neuronal viability and the acquired knowledge on associated biopharmaceutical and pharmacological parameters will indicate the potential of the method to remedy AMD as the overall goal of the project. This novel approach for therapy development in AMD focuses on complementary and alternative cellular protection and neuroprotection. The innovative strategy has the potential to generate a first-in-class pharmacotherapy approach for dry AMD using a topical rather than a systemic or invasive route of drug delivery. The strategy’s potentially high impact lies in its capacity to be both preventative and therapeutic in nature and to complement existing treatment designs and rationales addressing other aspects of AMD treatment such as those targeting neovascularization. Project Narrative Degeneration or acute damage of retinal pigment epithelial cells and nerve cells in the retina due to Age-related Macular Degeneration (AMD) is a major cause of visual loss and blindness in the United States and worldwide. The determination of the function and effectiveness of new drugs as proposed in the present application has the potential to produce a therapy approach for AMD that focuses on the retinal pigment epithelial cells and nerve cells of the retina and that has the potential to be both preventative and therapeutic in nature for the dry form of the disease and to complement existing treatment designs and rationales addressing other aspects of AMD such as the wet form of the disease. As AMD affects significant and increasing portions of the U.S. population including minorities affected by disparities in health care delivery, determining causes, mechanisms of action and subsequently potential treatment strategies will contribute to improving health care, health and performance requiring visual tasks.",Novel pro-drug pharmacotherapy to prevent neuronal and cell

"CELL POPULATION HETEROGENEITY IN TRIPLE NEGATIVE BREAST CANCER DISPARITIES PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT: Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) is an aggressive and difficult to manage disease that disproportionately afflicts underrepresented minority populations. Tumor cellular heterogeneity is a major source of treatment resistance and resilience, but is poorly understood. Thus, better understanding of tumor heterogeneity will lead to development of therapeutic strategies to treat underrepresented minority TNBC patients. The objective of this proposal is to identify and characterize biomarkers of cell subsets that drive tumor resilience in African- American (AA) patients. The central hypothesis is that differential cell population heterogeneity contributes to disparate TNBC prevalence and treatment outcomes in AA and other underrepresented patient groups. The rationale for the proposed research is that better understanding of tumor cellular heterogeneity will result in new and innovative approaches to TNBC treatment for underrepresented minority TNBC patients. Therefore, the hypothesis will be tested by pursuing the following specific aims: Aim 1) Identification of phenotypic states in AA TNBC with single cell RNA-seq; Aim 2) Associations of candidate biomarker sets with AA TNBC, clinical variables, immune phenotypes, genomic information, and outcomes in a TNBC neoadjuvant trial. The proposed research is innovative, because of the novel approach to use single cell profiling to define and understand novel tumor cell lineages and microenvironment for AA TNBC tumors. The proposed research is significant, because it is expected to advance and expand our understanding of tumor heterogeneity and drug resistance in AA TNBC patients. Such knowledge is a critical foundation for the development of cancer therapies targeting vulnerabilities of tumor heterogeneity in AA TNBC patients. The Triple Negative subset of breast cancer (TNBC; lacking expression of estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, and with normal HER2 levels) is more aggressive and has poorer prognosis than other forms of breast cancer, and has a significantly higher relative prevalence in African-American, non-white Hispanic, and some other underrepresented minority populations. We hypothesize that this form of breast cancer in African-American populations is biologically different from the most common forms of TNBC in European-American populations. We will use information derived from single cell RNA-sequencing to determine whether cellular subpopulations differ, whether such differences are associated with outcome in a neoadjuvant TNBC trial, with the long-term goal of identifying specific therapeutic vulnerabilities.",CELL POPULATION HETEROGENEITY IN TRIPLE NEGATIVE BREAST CANCER DISPARITIES,9959642,R21CA238066,"['Affect ', '

"Pathogenesis of fungal infectious disease in the Hmong population PROJECT SUMMARY I will study the mechanisms that underlie a health disparity and vulnerability to systemic fungal disease in the Hmong population. People of Hmong descent are 10 to 100 times more likely than non-Asian peers to acquire blastomycosis (an infection due to Blastomcyes dermatitidis) despite having fewer behavioral risk factors or co- morbidities. Blastomycosis, like other invasive mycoses, produces severe illness in some racial and ethnic groups, prompting the idea that genetic polymorphisms govern susceptibility. None have been found and this represents a gap in knowledge. My lab sequenced the whole genomes of 5 Hmong blastomycosis patients involved in an epidemic in Wisconsin. We found 192 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) shared in the patients, rare in the European Super Population, and meeting additional criteria such as location in an annotated regulatory region. Notably, many of the SNPs are in or near the gene encoding IL-6 or other genes that nurture IL-17 immunity. IL-17 is important in controlling fungal infection, but also in development of autoimmunity.  I will test the hypothesis that SNPs in IL-6 and related genes underlie immune dysregulation in the Hmong patients. My first aim is to study how SNPs identified in the pilot cohort impact the regulation of IL-6. As pathology may arise from either weak or over-exuberant responses, any difference in the response between Hmong patients and controls may be significant. SNP(s) that account for the observed differences will be identified by genetically manipulating primary cells and reporter cells, then studying impact on function. Another goal of the first aim is to investigate the function of an unstudied long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) that overlaps the IL-6 gene; it is likely that this lncRNA regulates IL-6 production. I postulate that a SNP we identified in this lncRNA modifies its function and thus impacts IL-6 transcript and product. My second aim is to apply two unbiased, open-ended methods to probe the anti-fungal responses of circulating immune cells from Hmong blastomycosis patients and controls. In these studies, cells will be probed with defined ligands or yeast, and response will be measured by cytokine bead array and transcriptome analysis. These data will reveal if receptors or signaling pathways are functioning aberrantly. In addition to supporting mechanistic findings from Aim 1, these studies will help generate new hypotheses.  This proposal addresses a key gap in knowledge: the mechanism that underlies a documented health disparity. Similar work on tuberculosis has identified SNPs that predict response to treatment, which allows clinicians to tailor therapy to individual patients. My results will similarly facilitate precise medical decision-making. My findings may also have implications beyond the field of fungal immunology; other IL-17-mediated diseases include autoimmune disorders and cancer. I am excited to undertake this project, and know that the training I receive in pursuing my aims will prepare me for a fruitful career as a clinician-scientist in Infectious Disease. PROJECT NARRATIVE People of Asian, primarily Hmong, ancestry are known to have an in-born susceptibility to the dimorphic fungal disease blastomycosis. Our pilot data suggests that an aberration in the IL-6/IL-17 axis underlies this health disparity. I will characterize how variation in the immune response leads to pathology in the Hmong population. My findings may identify novel targets for precise medical treatment of disease related to dysregulation of the IL-17 response, which includes fungal infections, autoimmune diseases, and

"Next generation functional genomics of hematology traits PROJECT SUMMARY The over-arching goal of this project is to address several major challenges to biologic interpretation, functional validation, and clinical translation of genetic association findings for quantitative red blood cell traits and non- malignant blood cell disorders in the post-genomic era. In Aim 1, we will apply state-of-the-art statistical genomic and computational tools to extremely large human multi-ethnic population-based datasets containing hundreds of thousands of individuals with red blood cell traits (hemoglobin, hematocrit, RBC count, MCV, MCH, MCHC, red cell distribution width or RDW) and whole genome sequence (WGS) data (the NHLBI TOPMed WGS project) or GWAS data (Blood Cell Consortium or BCX and UK Biobank) to provide updated analysis, discovery, and interpretation of results for common, low-frequency, and rare genetic variants associated with red blood cell counts and indices. In Aim 2, validation of new red blood cell phenotype-associated genomic loci and genetic variants will occur through a combination of imputation and replication in independent data sets (using TOPMed WGS as imputation reference panel), and/or de novo genotyping or sequence analysis of selected phenotypic samples or pedigrees. We will also provide functional annotation, fine-mapping, and prioritization for new and existing red blood cell trait-associated variants and genes, with an emphasis on new blood cell lineage-specific epigenomic, transcriptomic, and 3D genomic resources, including those becoming available through TOPMed and BLUEPRINT projects. In Aim 3, we will perform functional, cell-based analyses of selected non-coding genomic loci/ variants (~50 per year) identified in Aims 1 and 2 (particularly those that alter canonical transcription factor motifs and demonstrate clinical impact through PheWAS or co-segregation with phenotypic extremes in pedigrees) utilizing a combination of massively parallel reporter assays (MPRA) and CRISPR/Cas9 genomic perturbation to interrogate non-coding genetic variation and thereby provide comprehensive and predictive assessments of regulatory non-coding variation and function. We will disseminate all genomic, annotation, and functional information derived from Aims 1, 2, and 3 to ensure knowledge dissemination to the clinical and scientific community, for discovery, fine-mapping, and investigation of causal genes that underlie red blood cell traits and hematological disorders. PROJECT NARRATIVE This project will lead to improved insight into the genetic basis of hematologic traits and red blood cell disorders.

"A novel metabolic reprograming strategy for the treatment of diabetes-associated breast cancer PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Diabetes increases the risk of breast cancer (BC) in women and mortality in patients with cancer. African- American (AA) women are disproportionately affected by diabetes and its complications. Concurrently, these women have worst outcome from BC. In addition, many women gain weight after BC treatment and end up with diabetes. AA and Hispanic/Latina women are even more affected by this. There exist some important distinctions between the BC patients with and without diabetes in the regimen selection and outcomes of cancer therapy. Currently there are no specific treatments to target diabetes-associated BC. Our long-term goals are to understand the fundamental mechanisms of diabetes-induced BC progression, and to develop personalized treatments for diabetes-associated BC. Based on the metabolic differences between normal and cancer cells, we for the first time propose this safe and effective therapeutic strategy targeting cancer metabolism to “poison” BC cells, with relatively non-toxicity to normal cells. The present project focuses on targeting lactate metabolism and transport to induce BC cell death. The central hypothesis of this strategy is that pharmaceutical induction of glucose import and glycolysis to even higher levels while blocking the products of glycolysis from entering the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, results in production of high amounts of lactate. Meanwhile, blocking the export of excessive lactate by inhibiting monocarboxylate transporter 4 (MCT4) leads to a metabolic crisis and acidification within the cancer cells, causing their death. Our preliminary in vitro results indicate that this metabolic reprogramming strategy (MRS) can successfully block cancer cells proliferation. Moreover, we have identified CB-2 as a novel small molecule MCT4 inhibitor (Patent Application Number: 62/662,637). CB-2 has shown a significantly inhibitory effect on lactate secretion and striking cytotoxic activity against triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells, which have a high glycolytic rate/MCT4 expression. Guided by strong preliminary data, we propose to pursue three Specific Aims to test this hypothesis: (1) To investigate the effect of MRS on energy metabolic pathways of different BC cell lines and the possible reasons for sensitivity or resistance to this approach. (2) To confirm the mechanism of action and anticancer activity of CB-2. (3) To test the effectiveness, safety, and potential side effects of this MRS in diabetic mouse models bearing human BC xenografts. Collectively, these studies will allow us to gain a more in-depth understanding of cancer cell metabolism and may in the long term reveal an effective therapeutic strategy for diabetes-associated BC and TNBCs. The complex biology that contributes to the unequal cancer burdens needs to be investigated to increase our basic understanding of cancer health disparities. Hence, investigating glucose metabolism features in tumor cells would be a significant step in shedding light on this health disparity. Moreover, searching new drug targets and developing new treatment methods in diabetes-associated BC contribute to decreasing cancer health disparities. PROJECT NARRATIVE Diabetes mellitus may dramatically increase risk of breast cancer (BC) and mortality in patients with cancer. Our proposed studies aim to understand the fundamental mechanisms of diabetes-induced BC progression, and to develop personalized treatments for diabetes-associated BC.

"Molecular basis for the impact of sex on brain tumorigenesis Abstract In the next year, approximately 22,000 Americans will develop glioblastoma (GBM) and nearly the same number will die from it. Further, we can reliably predict that of the 22,000 new cases, 8,500 will be in females while the remaining 13,500 cases will be in males. Moreover, while the median survival for female GBM patients next year is expected to be between 17 and 22 months, for males it will be closer to 16 months. The molecular bases for these consistent and significant sex differences in incidence and survival are unexplained. In the absence of an explanation, it is impossible to fully know what the implications of sex differences are for modeling GBM in the laboratory and for treating GBM in the clinic. Identifying targetable mechanisms underlying sex differences in survival are the focus of this project, and our goal is to improve outcomes for all GBM patients. Building on our published and preliminary studies supported during the prior funding period of this RO1, we now hypothesize that sex differences in cellular senescence contribute to the sex disparity in glioblastoma (GBM) incidence and survival. As radiation or chemotherapy induced senescence is a mechanism of stopping tumor growth, we will focus on the mechanisms that endow female cells with greater ability to undergo senescence than their male counterparts in response to DNA damage. While cellular senescence has been extensively studied in normal and pathological states, studies in cancer have focused almost exclusively on fibroblast and bone marrow stromal cell senescence in breast and prostate cancer models. There has been little to no investigation of the role that cellular senescence plays in brain tumor promotion or treatment response, or any focus on sex differences in cellular senescence. We have two Specific Aims in which we will build on our prior success and utilize the extensively validated model systems for studying sex differences in GBM that we developed. We will apply innovative genomic technologies to define the contributions of sex differences in p21 and Rb functions to the induction of senescence, and will determine whether Brd4 and sex-specific epigenetics are required for sex differences in astrocyte and GBM cell senescence and the senescence-associated secretory phenotype. Project Narrative Significant sex differences exist in glioblastoma incidence and survival have been repeatedly documented.

"Molecular mechanisms of estrogen receptor alpha modulating the inflammatory response in systematic lupus erythematosus ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Ninety percent of those diagnosed with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) are women, with peak incidence between the ages of 15 and 45, when women are most hormonally active. Despite significant research effort, the mechanisms underlying this sex bias remain unclear. Our laboratory previously backcrossed estrogen receptor alpha knockout (ERαKO) mice onto the NZM2410 lupus prone background. We demonstrated that female NZM/ERαKO mice had significantly less renal disease and significantly prolonged survival compared to WT littermates despite similar serum autoantibodies and glomerular immune complex deposition. ERαKO mice are not ERα null, but rather express an N-terminally truncated ERα. They have physiologic deficiencies including infertility due to disruption of a critical activation domain (AF-1). We showed that dendritic cell (DCs) from NZM/ERαKO mice have a blunted inflammatory response to Toll-like receptor (TLR) ligands. When these mice were ovariectomized, the protective phenotype was lost. Upon estradiol-repletion, protection was restored. True ERα null mice are not protected, suggesting that estrogen in the presence of the AF-1 mutant confers protection, rather than the absence of the full-length ERα66. Interestingly, the truncated ERα expressed in the ERαKO animal is structurally similar to ERα46, an endogenous ERα splice variant that lacks the AF-1 domain, and is a negative regulator of gene transcription. ERα46 has an identical DNA binding domain to ERα66 and is a powerful inhibitor of ERα66. We hypothesize that ERα46 expression has a protective effect in lupus. The goal of this project is to determine the role of ERα46 in SLE and TLR-induced inflammation and to improve our understanding of ERα-mediated transcription in the setting of inflammation. In order to accomplish this, Dr. Cunningham will (1) Define the in vitro molecular mechanisms underlying ERα46- and ERα66-regulated transcriptional activity impacting the innate inflammatory response of murine DCs, (2) Determine ex vivo and in vivo the role of ERα46 in TLR-induced lupus utilizing a murine strain expressing an A/B truncation mutant of ERα (ERαAF10), and (3) Use human peripheral blood monocyte (PBMC)-derived DCs to define the role of ERα46 and ERα66 in regulation of the innate immune response in DCs from controls vs. lupus patients. Dr. Cunningham is a clinician-investigator with a long-term career goal of becoming an independent basic and translational researcher in the field of immunology with a focus on SLE. To facilitate her transition to independence, she seeks to further her training in dendritic cell biology, ChIPseq and bioinformatics, and the use of human cells from patient samples. Dr. Cunningham has a mentorship team with an outstanding mentoring track record and wide expertise to support her project. The studies proposed in this K08 mentored grant application will significantly advance the field by providing understanding of ERα-mediated transcription in the setting of TLR-induced inflammation, including ERα binding partners, gene targets, and modulation by ERα46, which represents a potential therapeutic agent. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project is highly relevant to public health because females have a higher prevalence and significantly increased risk of autoimmune diseases such as lupus. The reasons for this health disparity remain unclear. This study will elucidate the mechanisms of estrogen receptor alpha (ERα) in modulating inflammation, with specific attention to dendritic cells and Toll-like receptor-induced inflammation, which are dysregulated in lupus patients. Identifying inflammatory pathways regulated by nuclear hormone receptors such as ERα will greatly expand our knowledge of lupus pathogenesis and contribute to the development of interventions to reduce risk, and improve diagnosis and treatment.",Molecular mechanisms of estrogen receptor alpha modulating the inflammatory response in systematic lupus erythematosus,9901448,K08AR068471,"['Affect

"Pathogenic Role of IL-18 in Sickle Cell Cardiomyopathy and Inducible Ventricular Tachycardia ABSTRACT: Individuals with sickle cell disease exhibit cardiovascular manifestations and sudden death as the top causes of premature death. These factors, unfortunately, contribute to the plateauing of the average life expectancy of these patients (in the 4th decade) over the past two decades, yet another profound health disparity observed in African Americans (AAs). Despite expanded understanding of the defining features including systemic vaso-occlusive episodes and hemolysis, there is a paucity of information linking cardiac pathology to premature death. Using system biology approaches, we have generated highly novel information characterizing a previously unrecognized human sickle cardiomyopathy defined by myocardial fibrosis, diastolic dysfunction, prolonged repolarization, and inducible ventricular tachycardia (VT) in the “humanized” sickle mouse model. These studies further demonstrated significant upregulation of circulating IL18 gene expression, an established inflammasome and pro-fibrotic mediator upregulated by free heme, in sickle cardiomyopathy. Additionally, exposure to IL-18 was a key factor in inducing VT in sickle mice. Preliminary data further link decreased expression and activity of cardiac potassium channels (KCND2/KCND3) in sickle mice, which can prolong repolarization, to acute increases in IL-18-mediated NADPH oxidase 4 (Nox4) expression, the latter a key source of reactive oxygenation species (ROS) and induction of cardiac apoptosis. We have further shown that chronic IL-18 inhibition reduces cardiac apoptosis, fibrosis and improves diastolic function in sickle mice coupled with reduced cardiac IL-18 receptor (IL-18R) and Nox4 expression. Finally, our genomic studies have identified novel polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with enhanced IL18 expression and prolonged corrected QT (QTc) interval, an established risk factor for VT. Thus, via three specific aims (SAs), this R01 will interrogate the mechanistic basis for the hypothesis that IL-18/IL- 18R/Nox4 signaling critically downregulates KCND2 and KCND3 function acutely and promotes myocardial fibrosis with sustained activation, exacerbating sickle cardiomyopathy and VT development. SA #1 will functionally validate heme-mediated IL18 promoter regulation including SNPs in a monocyte cell line. SA #2 will define how IL-18/IL-18R/Nox4 signaling acutely downregulates KCND2/KCND3 function leading to prolonged repolarization and chronically, results in cardiac apoptosis and fibrosis. SA #3 will define the therapeutic efficacy of strategies to prevent sickle cell-associated inducible VT. The knowledge gained from this R01 will directly translate into future clinical biomarker studies evaluating risk of sudden cardiac death highlighting those patients with a higher hemolytic burden, pathogenic IL18 SNPs, and circulating IL-18 levels with theoretically higher VT risk. Additionally, the data will test for effective and novel personalized therapies in a poorly recognized and fatal manifestation of sickle cell disease. NARRATIVE: While individuals with sickle cell disease exhibit sudden death as the top causes of premature death, it is unclear whether patients experience fatal cardiac arrhythmias that contribute to these outcomes. Our preliminary data, for the first time, reveals inducible ventricular tachycardia (a fatal rhythm disturbance) in preclinical sickle animal models. We propose to study and therapeutically target inflammatory mechanisms as major contributors to the development of abnormal cardiac electrical properties and fibrosis (scar), both factors promoting a heart environment vulnerable to fatal arrhythmias.",Pathogenic Role of IL-18 in Sickle Cell Cardiomyopathy and Inducible Ventricular Tachycardia,9897593,R01HL136603,"['Sickle Cell Anemia ', ' Hb SS

"Immunotherapeutic Modalities for K-ras Mutant Lung Cancer: Sex- and Cell Type-Specific Roles of IL-6/STAT3 signaling Worldwide, lung cancer, particularly K-ras mutant lung cancer, is still the leading cause of cancer mortality because of a high incidence, and a low cure rate. Unfortunately, pharmacologic attempts directly targeting K- ras have thus far failed, clearly indicating that there is an urgent need for novel approaches to bring clinical benefits to patients with this undruggable molecular profile. We recently made an astonishing sex-specific discovery using a mouse model for K-ras-driven lung cancer (CC-LR). We found that deletion of STAT3 in K- ras mutant lung epithelial cells significantly inhibited lung cancer development in female mice but, surprisingly, caused a dramatic enhancement of lung tumorigenesis in male mice. This sex-dependent tumor disparity was accompanied by significant changes of NF-κB regulated target genes and inflammatory response in the lung tumor microenvironment which was regulated by estrogen receptor (ER) signaling. In humans, the risk and outcome of lung cancer are also vastly distinct between men and women, especially for smokers. However, the reason for this sex disparity is poorly understood and extremely underappreciated. It is known that estrogen could have anti-inflammatory effects. However, the interplay between estrogen/ER signaling, and STAT3/NF- κB mediated cytokine network in shaping the lung microenvironment and promotion of lung cancer is unknown. Our novel finding that the crosstalk between STAT3 and ER signaling is an essential regulator of NF-κB mediated cytokine response in K-ras mutant lung tumors provides us with a direct molecular insight into these sex differences. It will facilitate identification of the signaling pathways that lung cancer cells use to recruit and reprogram myeloid cells, thus providing new pathways to intercept for preventive and therapeutic purposes. Accordingly, our goals for this project are to determine the sex and cell type specific mechanistic roles of specific inflammatory signaling cues and functional preventive and therapeutic significance of targeting these inflammatory pathways in the pathogenesis of K-ras mutant lung cancer. Three specific aims are proposed to achieve these goals: (Aim 1) To dissect the sex-specific interplay between STAT3/NF-κB mediated cytokine network and estrogen receptor signaling in K-ras mutant lung tumorigenesis. (Aim 2) To investigate the chemopreventive and therapeutic effects of targeting the IL-6/STAT3 pathway in K-ras mutant lung cancer. (Aim 3) To analyze sex- and cell type-specific global expression programs downstream of mutant K-ras in lung cancer. We expect our study will elucidate sex- and cell-type specific mechanisms that will be fundamental in delineating targets for tailoring rationally directed sex-oriented personalized preventive and therapeutic strategies to overcome K-ras mutant lung tumors. It could also help us to improve the efficacy of currently available immunotherapy regimens, to develop a panel of unique and sex specific clinical predictive and prognostic biomarkers to identify responders and non-responders, and to explore mechanisms of susceptibility or resistance to therapy in these patients. This project will focus on dissecting the mechanisms responsible for lung cancer promotion by inflammatory signals in a sex-dependent manner. Unfortunately, despite being the leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide, our knowledge of the molecular mechanisms involved in lung cancer, especially in regards to sex differences and in the context of inflammation, is substantially deficient. By understanding the sex and cell-type specific molecular pathways through which inflammation promotes lung cancer, we aim to identify new and specific targets to tailor personalized preventive and

"Myometrial stem cells Project Summary Uterine fibroids (also known as leiomyomas) are the most common tumors in the female reproductive tract. Some estimates indicate that up to 75% of American women have uterine fibroids, depending on race and ethnicity. There is a significant disparity in the incidence of fibroids since African-American women are 2-3 times more likely to develop fibroids, often with earlier onset and greater severity of symptoms. These tumors can be very painful and are the leading cause of hysterectomies in the US. Despite the healthcare burden caused by uterine fibroids, their etiology and pathophysiology are essentially unknown. The vast majority of fibroids either have mutations in Mediator Complex protein 12 (MED12) gene or over-express high mobility group AT hooks (HMGA)1/2 transcription factors, but the molecular mechanism that are disrupted and lead to tumor development or growth are unknown. Another well known characteristic of fibroids is that they are clonal, indicating a single cell of origin for each tumor. Our overarching hypothesis is that fibroids develop from myometrial stem cells that have become dysregulated by either MED12 mutation or HMGA1/2 over- expression. We have developed complementary models to study myometrial stems cells and determine the mechanisms disrupted that lead to fibroid development or growth. We have identified and characterized label- retaining cells (LRCs) in the mouse myometrium. These cells express putative stem cell markers, and divide in response to postpartum repair, as would be expected for myometrial stem cells. We have also used side population analysis and cell surface markers to identify human myometrial cells with stem cell properties. However, none of these methods leads to a highly enriched, homogeneous population necessary for some of the next generation sequencing approaches to study molecular mechanisms driving disease etiology and progression. We propose to use establish RNA-seq profiles for these putative myometrial stem cells and map them to single-cell sequencing clusters of myometrial cells to identify other cell surface markers to further enrich for highly purified, human myometrial stem cells. Once these putative myometrial stem cells are validated, we can then use them to study and better understand possible disrupted chromatin and epigenetic mechanisms that lead to fibroid development and growth, with the ultimate goal of identifying targets for therapeutic intervention. Project Narrative Uterine fibroids affect approximately 75% of American women during their reproductive years and are a significant source of pelvic pain and abnormal uterine bleeding for many of them. Despite the major health care burden posed by uterine fibroids, very little is known about their cause or the best treatment strategies. We hypothesize that fibroids are a myometrial stem cell disease, and the goal of this proposal are to establish a method to enrich myometrial stem cells for further study.",Myometrial stem cells,9986156,R21HD100959,"['Affect ', ' Automobile Driving ', ' driving ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Chromatin ', ' Cluster Analysis ', ' Cluster Analyses ', ' Daughter ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Dyes ', ' Coloring Agents ', ' Dysmenorrhea ', ' Menstrual Pain ', ' Painful Menstruation ', ' Endometrium ', ' Female ', ' Genes ', ' Goals ', ' Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Growth and Development function ', ' Growth and Development ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Hysterectomy ', ' In Vitro ', ' Incidence ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Fibroid Tumor ', ' Fibroid ', ' Fibroid Neoplasm ', ' Fibromyoma ', ' Leiomyomatous Neoplasm ', ' Leiomyomatous Tumor ', ' Maps ', ' Menstruation ', ' Menses ', ' menstrual period ', ' monthly period ', ' Methods ', ' Biological Models ', ' Biologic Models ', ' Model System ', ' Morbidity -

"Implementation of Medical Homes for Evidence Based Care of Adolescents and Adults with Sickle Cell Disease PROJECT SUMMARY Life expectancy for patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) has increased from teens to late forties over the last 30 years. The increase in the number of adults with the disease has created new unmet needs, due to the heavy disease burden and organ damage which increase with age. This is confounded by the inability of the health care system to adequately meet the needs of this population, and thus has resulted in disparities and increase in health care costs. This project attempts to address these problems by creating medical homes and medical neighborhoods in four different settings throughout rural Georgia, which has the fourth largest population of patients with SCD in the country. This will be achieved by building on the GRU Sickle Cell Center's experience in taking care of SCD patients through its outreach clinics, and more recently through its partnership with primary care practices and Hematology/Oncology practices at different locations in the state. In the first two years of the project (Phase I) a needs assessment of patients, communities, and providers will be carried out and a Community Advisory Council will be established. The results of this needs assessment will be used to develop and implement interventions to establish medical homes and neighborhoods to improve evidence-based care for SCD patients in Phase II. PROJECT NARRATIVE Advances in the diagnosis and care of infants and children with sickle cell disease (SCD) has led to an increase in life expectancy of this population and an increase in the number of adults with the disease. Chronic organ damage associated with the natural history of the disease on one hand, and challenges imposed by the health care system (large number of uninsured/underinsured patients, stigmatization, paucity of adult providers with expertise in the care of SCD) on the other, have created unmet needs. This project, in response to RFA HL- 16010, builds on the 30-year experience of the GRU Sickle Cell Center in providing care to patients with SCD in rural Georgia through its extensive outreach clinics and proposes to address these unmet needs by the creation of patient-centered medical homes and neighborhoods in four diverse health care settings.",Implementation of Medical Homes for Evidence Based Care of Adolescents and Adults with Sickle Cell Disease,9962471,U01HL134004,"['Adoption ', ' Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Sickle Cell Anemia ', ' Hb SS disease ', ' HbSS disease ', ' Hemoglobin S Disease ', ' Hemoglobin sickle cell disease ', ' Hemoglobin sickle cell disorder ', ' sickle cell disease ', ' sickle disease ', ' sicklemia ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' children ', "" childrens' "", ' youngster ', ' Communities ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Faculty ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Hematology ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' hydroxyurea ', ' Hydroxycarbamid ', ' Hydroxycarbamide ', ' hydroxy-urea ', ' Infant Care ', ' baby care ', ' infant health care ', ' infant healthcare ', ' newborn care ', ' Interview ', ' Life Expectancy ', ' Modernization ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Neonatal Screening ', ' Newborn Infant Screening ', ' newborn screening ', ' Pain ', ' Painful ', ' Patients ', ' Penicillins ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Primary Care ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Registries ', ' Research ', ' Stigmatization ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Universities ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' Underinsured ', ' Uninsured ', ' chronic pain ', ' Caring ', ' Guidelines ', ' Practice Guidelines ', ' base ', ' Organ ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Acute ', ' Chronic ', ' Phase ', ' Medical ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' juvenile ', ' juvenile human ', ' Adolescent ', ' sickle RBC ', ' sickle erythrocyte ', ' sickle red blood cell ', ' Sickle Cell ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' Individual ', ' Rural ', ' Funding ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R01 Program ', ' Research Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Oncology Cancer ', ' Oncology ', ' Letters ', ' Home ', ' Home environment ', ' prophylactic ', ' Location ', ' Country ', ' interest ', ' Needs Assessment ', ' Medical center ', ' experience ', ' cohort ', ' disease natural history ', ' Participant ', ' member ', ' Benefits and Risks ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' disease registry ', ' education planning ', ' patient registry ', ' Provider ', ' Address ', ' Adherence ', ' Consent ', ' Data ', ' Clinical Management ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Teen ', ' teen years ', ' teenage ', ' Teenagers ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' NHLBI ', ' National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute ', ' burden of disease ', ' disease burden ', ' years of life lost to disability ', ' years of life lost to disease ', ' burden of illness ', ' implementation research ', ' under served population ', ' underserved people ', ' Underserved Population ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' patient centered ', ' patient oriented ', ' eligible participant ', ' implementation science ', ' clinical care ', ' evidence base ', ' FDA approved ', ' patient population ', ' effective treatment ', ' effective therapy ', ' ED Physician ', ' ER physician ', ' Emergency Physician ', ' Emergency room physician ', ' Emergency Department Physician ', ' recruit ', ' primary care provider ', ' care providers ', ' healthcare settings ', ' health care settings ', ' outreach clinics ', ' practice setting ', ' treatment guidelines ', ' implementation strategy ', ' community involvement ', ' Acute pain management ', ' ']",NHLBI,AUGUSTA UNIVERSITY,U01,2020,967888,0.05937433704956774
"Cancer Center Support Grant ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overarching goals of the Cancer Cell Biology Program are: (i) to understand, at the molecular and cellular levels, mechanisms underlying tumor initiation, progression, metastasis and resistance to therapeutic treatment, and (ii) to identify and validate new targets for cancer therapy. Insight derived from these studies, when integrated with research and development from other programs, will provide targets and guidance for the development of strategies for therapeutic intervention of cancer. Toward these two goals, the Program faculty investigates various aspects of cancer cell biology, including growth factors and receptors; angiogenesis and vascular biology; apoptosis; cell cycle regulation; chromatin biochemistry and transcriptional regulation; cell microstructure and function; DNA replication and repair; metabolism; regulatory RNA; and signal transduction. Led by two co-leaders with complementary expertise, Yue Xiong and James Bear, the program organizes these different areas into four major research themes: (1) Cell Cycle, (2) Cell Signaling, (3) Cell Movement and Organization, and (4) Epigenetics and Chromatin Biology. The major emphasis of the Program is to foster integrated research that spans these inter-related themes, enhancing the research and translational capabilities of program investigators through the establishment, expansion and utilization of appropriate core facilities, and promoting interactions with investigators from other LCCC basic, clinical and population sciences programs.
